            A transgender woman has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a male partner by failing to disclose her gender status to him, meaning he could not consent to the sexual activity, British prosecutors said on Friday.
    


            Ciara Watkin, 21, performed sex acts on the man, also 21, who she had met on social media site Snapchat in June 2022, but did not disclose her transgender status to him.
    


            The Crown Prosecution Service said Watkin had told the man that she was on her period and meaning he could not touch her below the waist.
    


            A few days later the pair met again, after which Watkin blocked all contact with the man until she eventually got back in touch and told him during an exchange of text messages that she was transgender and had male genitalia, the CPS said.
    


            “It is clear from the evidence in this case that, prior to engaging in sexual activity with the victim, Watkin had made no attempt to inform him of her transgender status,” said Senior Crown Prosecutor Sarah Nelson.
    


            “The victim has made clear in police interview that he would not have engaged in sexual activity had he known that Watkin was transgender and, consequently, these events have had a significant impact on his mental wellbeing.”
    


            Watkin, from Stockton-on-Tees in northeast England, had admitted lying but her lawyers told her trial that it would have been “blindingly obvious” to the man that she was not biologically female, the BBC said.
    


            She was convicted of two charges of sexual assault and one charge of assault by penetration following a trial at Teesside Crown Court and will be sentenced on October 10.

            Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
    


            Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
    


            McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
    


            “That's exactly what I've been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
    


            As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents' exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she'd been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
    


            For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.
    


            He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers' self-interest.
    


            In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We're going to get real studies done for the first time.”
    


            Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. “Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”
    


            As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies' lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
    


            Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
    


            Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
    


            Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump's cabinet.
    


            The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world's most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years' worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
    


            But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
    


            “I don't think he's aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that's been published on what the causes of autism are.”
    


            McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
    


            It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids' developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
    


            The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups' chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
    


            Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother's fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
    


            McCanlies hadn't studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world's experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
    


            Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto's data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
    


            The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
    


            McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
    


            Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.
    


            Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
    


            Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
    


            At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
    


            One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
    


            In 2023, they set about finding out.
    


            They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America's health.
    


            Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
    


            The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won't legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
    


            The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.” After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge's ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.
    


            Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency's cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
    


            The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
    


            Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy's watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump's “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men's exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
    


            “We're talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”
    


            Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy's new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
    


            With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
    


            While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica's questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
    


            Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I'd like to be part of that.”
    


            If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
    


            McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don't trust him at all,” she said.
    


            McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump's Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn't respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
    


            The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn't been ready to leave NIOSH's Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
    


            McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab's hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
    


            She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents' exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
    


            The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
    


            Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Italian media publish PHOTO of Nord Stream sabotage suspect","https://www.rt.com/news/623403-italian-media-photo-ukrainian-nord-stream/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:20:00 GMT","

Several Italian outlets on Friday released an image purportedly showing the Ukrainian man arrested a day earlier over his alleged involvement in the Nord Stream pipeline bombing.

The man, identified by the media as 49-year-old Sergey Kuznetsov, is suspected of leading the team that sabotaged the pipelines in September 2022.

The image – published by La Stampa and Open Online – appears to be either a police photofit or a photo from identity documents. Neither outlet disclosed its origin.

Kuznetsov was detained near Rimini on Thursday under a European arrest warrant issued this month by German prosecutors. Investigators allege he helped plant explosives on the pipelines near Denmark's Bornholm Island, which disabled three of the four Nord Stream lines. The man allegedly oversaw divers placing the explosives from a sailing yacht rented using forged document in Rostock, Germany.

According to Italian media, the suspect entered Italy under the alias Serhii Kulinic with his family on a tour booked through Booking.com. The authorities reportedly tracked his movements until his name, which had been recorded in a local hotel's guest database, triggered an Interpol alert. He reportedly offered no resistance and handed over documents, phones, computers, tablets, and credit cards upon arrest.

Kuznetsov faces charges under German law for causing an explosion, anti-constitutional sabotage, and destruction of infrastructure – offenses that could carry a 15-year sentence. He is expected to appear at the Bologna Court of Appeal later on Friday for a hearing to validate his arrest and set a date for extradition to Germany. However, La Stampa also reported that he is being investigated in a separate case by the Genoa prosecutor's office over a February bombing that damaged the Seajewel, a Maltese-flagged tanker off the coast of Savona.

The Nord Stream explosions were seen at the time as an attack on critical energy infrastructure and a stark example of the rising economic fallout of the Ukraine conflict.

Speaking in February 2022 in Washington, then-US President Joe Biden declared that in the event of an all-out military conflict between Russia and Ukraine “there will no longer be a Nord Stream. We will bring an end to it.”

In 2023, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that Biden had given the order to destroy the gas connectors,a claim dismissed as “complete fiction” by the White House.

According to an informed source who talked to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, the explosives, which reportedly caused blasts of 2.3 and 2.1 on the Richter scale, were planted by US Navy divers months previously under the cover of NATO exercises.

Swedish engineer Erik Andersson, who led the first and only independent forensic investigation at the blast sites, told an Italian journalist: “The more I look into this, the more I feel that the Nord Stream attack is just a part of a bigger scheme to cut off Russia from Europe.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier also has laughed off claims that a small group of divers could have carried out the attack, calling them “ridiculous.”

At the Washington summit on Monday, one guest stood out. The extended session of Euro-Atlantic leaders – hastily convened at the White House right after Donald Trump's meeting with Vladimir Zelensky – brought together the usual heavyweights: the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and the heads of NATO and the EU. Yet seated at the same table was someone who, at first glance, hardly seemed to belong in that club of power brokers: Finland's president, Alexander Stubb.

To an outsider, it might have looked odd. Why was the Finnish leader invited when the leaders of Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states were not? The answer lies not in protocol courtesy but in the role Stubb now plays. His presence was a nod to a man whose career embodies the whole project of “Euro-Atlantic solidarity” – a project now under strain since Trump's return to the White House.

Stubb is a cosmopolitan in every sense: a Swedish Finn, married to a Briton, educated in South Carolina, Bruges, Paris, and London. A golfer who bonded with Trump on the green, but also a seasoned foreign minister in the late 2000s, Stubb has become a rare kind of adviser – someone Trump listens to on European security in an administration where career diplomats are almost absent.

It is telling that the Washington summit did not produce a US ultimatum forcing Ukraine into a peace deal with Moscow. Instead, the focus was on designing security guarantees for Kiev – an alternative to NATO's Article 5, since membership in the alliance is no longer on the table. And behind that shift, many suspect, stands Stubb. He is quietly becoming the architect of a new Western security system, built on an openly anti-Russian foundation.

In Washington, Stubb framed his vision in a phrase that quickly went viral: “We found a solution in 1944 – and I believe we can find one in 2025.” He was alluding to Finland's peace treaty with the USSR after World War II, and suggesting that Ukraine could follow a similar path.

But here's the catch: Stubb's version of “Finlandization” bears little resemblance to the original concept. In his model, Ukraine would follow Finland's supposed example – joining the EU and NATO structures, becoming part of the Western economic and military infrastructure, and, in practice, turning itself into a forward operating base against Moscow. That vision assumes a militarized society, stripped of industrial potential, and defined by an ethnonational identity designed to fence out Russian influence through the Russian-speaking population.

This is not Finlandization. It is its opposite.

The original model, coined during the Cold War, described something very different: a small country leveraging its geography to live in peace with its powerful neighbor. Finland, after 1944, accepted tough compromises – ceding 10% of its territory, declaring neutrality, abandoning the dream of ethnic exclusivity. The payoff was stability, prosperity, and the chance to serve as a bridge between East and West. Helsinki became a symbol of détente in 1975 when it hosted the CSCE Final Act, a milestone in Cold War diplomacy.

Finland's economic boom – from Nokia to Valio, from Stockmann to Tikkurila – was rooted in precisely that balancing act: trading and cooperating with both blocs, and especially with nearby Leningrad. Neutrality allowed Finland to spend less on guns and more on butter, and that choice paid off.

Could such a model have worked if, back in 1944, the Finnish leadership had doubled down on nationalism? Almost certainly not. It took Marshal Mannerheim's pragmatism – and his readiness to compromise – to give Finland a viable future.

This is why Stubb's rhetoric is misleading. The real Finlandization – not his rebranded version – may well be the only path for Ukraine's survival and recovery.

That means recognizing facts on the ground. It means a neutral, non-nuclear status. It means rejecting neo-Nazi ideology and building a multiethnic society where the rights of Russian speakers are protected. It means diversifying trade, not just westward but eastward as well.

This is not a “list of Russian demands,” as Western commentators might claim. It is a recipe for economic revival – drawn from Ukraine's own founding documents. In 1990, Kiev's Declaration of Sovereignty defined the country as neutral and non-nuclear. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently reminded, if Ukraine abandons those principles in pursuit of NATO-style guarantees – including nuclear deployments – the very basis on which its independence was recognized will collapse. That would create an entirely new strategic reality.

Put simply: Ukraine faces a choice. Either it embraces real Finlandization – neutrality, balance, and prosperity – or it accepts Stubb's distorted version, becoming a permanent frontline state in a Western war against Russia.

Russian oil supplies to Hungary have been halted after Ukraine targeted the key Druzhba pipeline system for the third time this month, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Friday. The attack was confirmed by Slovak authorities.

Ranked among the world's longest energy networks, the Druzhba pipeline transports crude oil around 4,000km (2,485 miles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Running through Ukraine, the conduit is the primary route for Russian crude deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia.

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure throughout the conflict. The previous two attacks on Druzhba occurred on August 13 and August 18, with Kiev confirming it had sent drones to strike a key distribution station in Russia's Bryansk Region.

“This is yet another attack on our country's energy security – another attempt to drag us into the war,” Szijjarto wrote in a post on Facebook, adding that the pipeline was attacked near the Russian-Belarusian border.

Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova confirmed the attack, saying transfers would stop as the extent of the damage is being investigated.

Apart from the Druzhba system, the Ukrainian military has attacked the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkish customers and several European countries, including Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Greece. Earlier this year, Kiev struck a gas metering station near Sudzha, part of a pipeline that supplied the EU prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.

Unlike most EU nations, Hungary has taken a neutral stance on the conflict and has refused to supply weapons to Kiev. Budapest has repeatedly called for peace and criticized Western sanctions against Russia as ineffective and more harmful to those who impose them.

The Kremlin has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.

SEOUL, August 22. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has awarded the titles of Hero of the People's Republic to the commanders and soldiers of the Korean People's Army who took part in liberating the Kursk Region from Ukrainian formations, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

This was the first such ceremony and it took place at the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. The secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK met the military and gave them flowers. The event was attended not only by commanders and soldiers, but also by the families of fallen servicemen. Kim Jong Un delivered a speech.

""Comrade Kim Jong-un noted the outstanding valor and noble dedication of our servicemen shown in the area of operation under a hail of bullets and shells, calling them incomparable heroes, and the troops of foreign operations - heroic troops,"" the agency said.

BUDAPEST, August 22. /TASS/. Hungary and Slovakia are calling on the European Commission (EC) to force Ukraine to stop attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, according to a letter from foreign ministers of the two countries, Peter Szijjarto and Juraj Blanar, to Brussels in connection with another attack by the Ukrainian army on the infrastructure of the oil pipeline on Russian territory.

""Without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries [with oil] is simply not possible,"" the ministers said. Oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia from Russia may be suspended for at least five days as a result of a new attack by the Ukrainian army on the Druzhba infrastructure that occurred on the night of August 22, they added.

Experts call change likely to pose problems for Americans with limited internet access ‘troubling to say the least' 

Current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) officials are concerned over a new agency rule requiring disaster victims to have an email address in order to apply for federal aid.

The policy change, first reported by Wired and confirmed by a Fema official to the Guardian, was “troubling to say the least”, said Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden's presidency.

Email was an optional means of contacting Fema under previous administrations, but will now be mandatory for those seeking relief amid disasters. The change, which follows a March executive order discontinuing federal paper-based payments, could be a major hurdle for victims in need of financial aid, particularly for those with limited internet access.

“For most people, it's a non-issue, but for people that have either chosen not to have an email or don't have an email for whatever reason, it seems to be a very arbitrary thing to say, no email, no help,” said Craig Fugate, a former Fema administrator during the Obama administration. “It sounds like the clerks are just making the job easier for themselves.”

In the US, an estimated 12% of people lived in households without any internet connection in 2023. Disasters can also make it difficult or impossible for victims to access libraries or other public spaces to get online.

“My question is, why aren't we focused on meeting the survivors where they are, versus making them fit our plan,” said Fugate.

Moving communications about assistance to email is not necessarily a bad thing for everyone, said a Fema official with knowledge of the new program.

“It's a lot easier and sometimes more efficient to be able to communicate via email and send documents back and forth that people might need, for instance,” the worker said. “For the people that do have email addresses and know how to work it, this is going to make their lives a lot easier than having to hop on the phone and call a call center where it's immediately after disaster, so you could be on the phone for hours at a time, just given the volume of calls that come in.”

But for those with limited internet access, as well as elderly people and disabled individuals who are more vulnerable during disasters and may be less likely to have email addresses, the requirement could pose difficulties, the official added.

The policy change is particularly concerning, the person said, because it comes as Fema has also ended door-to-door canvassing during disasters and shuttered some field offices across the country. That will mean agency workers will have less face time with disaster victims to navigate email servers for those who are unfamiliar with them.

“It would be different if we were to have made this a requirement but then built in programmatic checks and the ability to help people get email addresses who might not have it … but we're not doing that any more either,” the official said. “We're dialing back all of the things that we had done to try and make sure we are capturing folks who are already predominantly left behind when it came to receiving Fema assistance.”

The change could pose hurdles to those seeking immediate aid via Fema's critical needs assistance program, which can provide victims with $750 in cash within 24 hours of a disaster to fill immediate requirements for hotel stays, food and other basic needs.

“Any step that you take that is going to just create that little bit of friction that could be a day that that person's not getting that money,” Edwards said. “That is serious when you need baby formula or you need food for your kids and things like that.”

Other recently implemented Fema policies, such as the new requirement of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that she personally approves all contracts over $100,000 before funds are disbursed, could further delay urgently needed aid to communities, the anonymous official said.

“That's bureaucracy to the umpteenth degree that never existed at any previous time,” the person said. “So there is a giant concern about timing.”

The Guardian has contacted Fema for comment.

The Trump administration has dismissed 2,000 full-time staff since Trump retook the White House in January, as more than a dozen others in leadership positions have voluntarily resigned. Political leadership was “trying to create solutions for the problem they created” by downsizing their workforce, said Edwards.

“When they fire 2,000 of their 6,000 permanent workforce, that obviously probably created a lot of constraints for them in terms of their ability to effectively deliver assistance,” he said, adding that the issue was not only unethical but possibly “politically short-sighted”, since it could delay aid to Trump voters in communities with technological limitations.

Fema has long struggled to efficiently deliver disaster assistance. The Biden administration took steps to remedy that and “make getting assistance easier, not harder”, said Edwards. But under Trump, “the least charitable view is that they are trying to discourage people from getting disaster assistance”, he said.

“I don't understand how you can look at what they're doing and arrive at any other conclusion,” said Edwards.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

This blog is now closed

We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria.

He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting.

Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported.

… and on that note, it's a wrap!

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there were no plans for Vladimir Putin to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the agenda for the meeting was “not ready at all.” “There is no meeting planned,” he said (13:40).

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said there were active discussions “at many levels” to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, as he insisted that they would offer greater protection than in previous, failed agreements in Minsk and Budapest (14:20, 14:23).

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that guarantees should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all (14:09).

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that “Russia does not want peace,” accusing Putin of ignoring demands to end the war and “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings on Ukraine” (9:48).

Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia (10:26).

Europe environment correspondent

In other news, this hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU's worst on record for wildfires – and there's still one month of the fire season left to go.

New data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) shows 1,015,024 hectares have burned so far this year, breaking the previous full-year record of 988,544 hectares that was set in 2017.

Across the continent, and particularly in Spain and Portugal, deadly infernos have run riot this month – emptying out villages and forcing farmers to become firefighters.

The blazes have engulfed four times as much land this year as the average for the same period over the past two decades, according to official data, and spewed out extreme levels of toxic smoke.

Overwhelmed and underprepared, several governments have triggered the EU's civil protection mechanism to help fight the flames. The Commission has sent help in the form of water-bombing planes and extra firefighters from neighbouring countries.

Meanwhile, a Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the Russian government said on Thursday.

The decision to promote Max comes as Moscow, locked in a standoff with the west over Ukraine, is seeking greater control over the internet.

The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase.

State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram.

AFP is reporting that an air raid alert sounded in Kyiv during Rutte's visit to Kyiv.

The agency added that:

“Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days as a US-led mediation effort to end the three-and-a-half-year war has appeared to falter.”

Rutte was also asked about whether these new security guarantees would include any troops on the ground in Ukraine.

He said:

“These discussions are now ongoing at many levels. So the security advisers are working together. The foreign ministers are working together on this. …

And it is too early to exactly say what will be the outcome, but clearly the US will be involved. Clearly we want, do not want, to repeat of the Budapest Memorandum or the Minsk agreement, these security guarantees should be holding.”

Speaking alongside Zelenskyy, Nato's Rutte said the alliance's support for Ukraine remained “unwavering” and “continues to grow,” with more plans to provide Nato funding to ensure “a crucial flow of lethal US weapons to Ukraine.”

He lauded the outcome of Monday's talks at the White House, saying that Trump made it clear “the United States will indeed be involved in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.”

He continued:

“Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working to define, so that when the time comes you for you to enter that bilateral meeting, you have the unmistakable force of Ukraine's friends behind you, ensuring that Russia will uphold any deal, and will never ever again, attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine.”

He then got challenged by a Ukrainian reporter on how the new guarantees would be different from the ones made to Ukraine in the past, including in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, that ended up being ignored by Russia.

Rutte insisted that Europe's and the US's active role will make them different this time.

“The Budapest Memorandum and Minsk did not provide those security guarantees. So we clearly know what it should not be, and we are now working together – Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States – to make sure that the security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, sitting in Moscow, will never, ever try to attack Ukraine again.”

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte turns out to be in Kyiv today, making a previously unannounced visit to Ukraine.

We are just getting some lines from his joint appearance at a press briefing with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy said the pair discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine, insisting they should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

The Ukrainian president also repeatedly alleged that Russia was trying to make it impossible to end the way and to avoid a leaders' meeting between himself and Putin.

We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria.

He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting.

Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported.

A bilateral meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin is viewed as unlikely and Ukrainians are sure that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one.

Putin has repeatedly questioned Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president and meeting the Ukrainian leader would fly in the face of that stance. But, if we try to imagine how a bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for more difficult topics.

But today, between Ukraine and Russia there are no easy issues.

The exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children and civilians from Russia to Ukraine have long been addressed with a degree of success by a separate team of employees. All other points for discussion are extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and territories that Russia is still planning to capture.

The format of such a tete-a-tete meeting is therefore much more likely to be two short monologues, but certainly not a dialogue. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this if he is confident that at least something will be achieved.

Otherwise, again, as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating.

Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday.

The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said.

“The combat activities of overseas operational forces … proved without regret the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,” Kim said.

Kim laid a flower at a memorial for North Korean soldiers who had died overseas, while soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert, KCNA said, adding that relatives of troops killed in action had been among those attending a banquet.

The events were the latest public show of gratitude by the regime in Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that surrounded North Korea's role in the war when its troops were first sent to Russia last autumn.

Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said.

The ceremony comes days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay tribute to North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South's intelligence agency.

In the last few minutes, Hungary's foreign minister Szijjártó posted the full letter he sent with his Slovak counterpart to the European Commission on gas supplies (10:26).

In the letter, the pair said:

“We regret to inform you that during the last days Ukraine has carried out three attacks against the Druzhba oil pipeline which plays a crucial role in the energy security of Hungary and Slovakia.

These attacks resulted in the suspension of oil deliveries to both of our countries. As a consequence of the latest missile attack, deliveries seem to be suspended for at least five days. 

The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible.

Given that in the past years, the EU and its Member States have provided hundreds of billions of Euros worth of support to Ukraine, we find Ukraine's actions, which severely threaten the energy security of Hungary and Slovakia, completely unacceptable. 

To this end, we strongly call on the Commission to immediately uphold the commitments outlined in the above mentioned statement and guarantee the safety of energy supply of its Member States.”

Let's see if we get a response from Ukraine this morning.

French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk will visit Moldova next week to celebrate Moldova's independence day, the French president's office said on Friday.

“The leaders will reaffirm their full support for Moldova's security, sovereignty and European path,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement, reported by Reuters.

Moldova, a small former Soviet republic located between Ukraine and EU and Nato member Romania, will hold parliamentary elections on 28 September. The country's ruling party is seeking to maintain its majority and keep its pro-European trajectory intact.

Moldovan officials have repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its domestic politics by stoking pro-Moscow sentiment in an effort to topple the government as it aims to strengthen ties with the West, claims Russia denies, Reuters said.

Elsewhere, Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia, Reuters reported.

“The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” foreign ministers Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár said in a joint letter.

Slovak pipeline operator Transpetrol said on Friday that the flow of oil was interrupted last night, outside the territory of the Slovakia.

Earlier this week, Szijjártó publicly clashed on this issue with Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha, who told him to “send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow” (Europe live on Tuesday).

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier today.

She asserted that “Russia does not want peace,” as she accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of not keeping any promises and “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings on Ukraine.”

“You see Europeans, Ukrainians, Americans wanting peace, and doing all the diplomatic efforts to achieve that, whereas Russia is just dragging feet, it's clear that Russia does not want peace.”

She also called for more EU and US sanctions and tariffs against Russia, saying:

“It is very clear that any promises that Putin has been given so far, he hasn't kept, and we have to treat it as such, but [we] also [have to] make all the efforts in really pressuring him to come to the negotiation table.

And there we have different tools. The Americans have leverage with the sanctions or tariffs to pressure Russia into negotiations. We are working on our 19th package of sanctions on the European side to really put the pressure on Russia, the one who is, who is doing the aggression here.”

Kallas also argued that Putin got “what he wanted” from the Alaska summit with Trump, getting not just the picture with the US president, but “so much more, such a welcome in America, and … then he also wanted the sanctions not to be put in place, which he also achieved.”

“So, I think right now his interest is down, because he has achieved what he wanted from this meeting,” she said.

She also rejected speculations about Ukraine giving up parts of its territory, saying “this is exactly the trap that Russia wants us to walk into.”

“[They want] the discussion [to be] all about what Ukraine should give up, what is the concessions that Ukraine is willing to do, whereas we are forgetting that Russia hasn't made one single concession. And they are the ones who are the aggressor here.

They are the ones who are brutally attacking another country and killing people there … So let's keep the focus there, where we have to keep it, to put the pressure on Russia so that they would come to the negotiation table. And also, what kind of negotiation concessions are the Russians making right now? They have just increased their goals and wishes.”

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia's Vladimir Putin of “trying to wriggle out of holding a meeting” to discuss peace arrangements, saying: “They don't want to end this war.”

Zelenskyy pointed to continuing Russian strikes on Ukraine, including on an American company's facilities in Mukachevo, and a growing number of alleged provocations against Nato countries, including Lithuania and Poland. “[These are] not accidents – Russian impudence,” he said.

“We expect our partners to respond in a principled manner. This war must be brought to an end. Pressure must be exerted on Russia to end the war. Putin understands nothing but force and pressure.”

He was also quick to pick up on US president Donald Trump's suggestion of more offensive actions.

Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his frustration at Russia's obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US president blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back” against Russia.

He said:

“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. How did that work out? … Interesting times ahead!!!”

Zelenskyy responded:

Of course, we will continue doing everything to protect our country and people. President Trump is absolutely right—this must be done not only in defense. Meanwhile, we do not slow down in diplomacy, so that negotiations to bring peace closer can finally take place.

Flying bomb can hit targets 3,000km away; Trump fumes as Russia puts further hurdles in way of peace talks. What we know on day 1,276

With both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war preparing for further fighting, Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's president announced the huge missile, known as Flamingo, could strike targets as far as 3,000km (1,864 miles) away. “The missile has undergone successful tests. It is currently our most successful missile,” Zelenskyy told reporters. Mass production could begin by February, he added.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that large Russian attacks in various parts of Ukraine showed Moscow was avoiding negotiations about ending the more than three-year-old war. The latest offensive included 574 drones and 40 missiles, said Ukraine's president, and was one of the largest yet.

A missile strike on the US-owned electronics firm Flex in Ukraine's far-west Zakarpattia region was a “telling” indicator of Russian intentions in peace initiatives led by Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said. “Now the signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold meetings. They don't want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes.”

“We believe [the Flex attack] was a deliberate strike precisely on US property here in Ukraine, on American investment,” Zelenskyy said. “A very telling strike … at the very time when the world waits for a clear answer from the Russians on their move in talks to bring an end to the war.” Nineteen people were injured in the attack. Zelenskyy said both sides were preparing for further fighting, citing Russian troop build-ups and Ukraine's own preparations including the Flamingo missile rollout.

While he has upended a years-long western policy of isolating the Russian leader, Trump has made little tangible progress towards a peace deal. On Thursday, the US president appeared to vent his frustration at Russia's obstruction, and suggested Ukraine should long since have been armed to “fight back” against Russia, writes Pjotr Sauer. In a ramble on social media blaming his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump said: “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country … There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.” Trump signed off that there were “interesting times ahead!”.

Moscow attempted on Thursday to further deeply caveat any prospects for talks with Putin, or for peace on any terms other than Russia's. Sergei Lavrov, Putin's foreign minister, said putting European troops in Ukraine to guarantee its security was “foreign intervention” and absolutely unacceptable for Russia. He insisted the Kremlin must have a veto over any postwar support for Ukraine.

Trump set another timeframe – two weeks again – for assessing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. “After that, we'll have to maybe take a different tack,” Trump told the rightwing media outlet Newsmax. Trump has not met any of his promised or threatened deadlines for securing peace or acting against Russia, which have ranged everywhere from 24 hours to 10 weeks.

In an attack on Ukraine's western city of Lviv, one person was killed, three wounded and 26 homes damaged, said the governor, Maksym Kozytskyi. Authorities in south-eastern Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region reported damage to businesses, homes and gas lines. A later shelling of the city of Kherson killed one person and wounded more than a dozen, a local official said.

In the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine's Donetsk region, two people were killed and at least 21 wounded after a Ukrainian shelling, said a Russian-installed official.

Kim Jong-un held a ceremony decorating North Korean troops who fought for Russia, state media KCNA said on Friday. The North Korean ruler has sent about 15,000 troops into the war, according to South Korea, with about 600 of them killed.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

11:53 JST, August 22, 2025

TALATAN, China (AP) — Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.

China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.

The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.

For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

“China needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,” he said.

China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing — up 3.7% in the first half of this year — but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.

“We're talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China's emissions,” he said.

China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.

Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.

“This is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,” he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.

But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. “There's still a long road ahead,” he said.

A seemingly endless expanse of solar panels stretches toward the horizon on the Tibetan plateau. White two-story buildings rise above them at regular intervals.

In an area that is largely desert, the massive solar project has wrought a surprising change on the landscape. The panels act as windbreaks to reduce dust and sand and slow soil evaporation, giving vegetation a foothold. Thousands of sheep, dubbed “photovoltaic sheep,” graze happily on the scrubby plants.

Wang Anwei, the energy administration chief of Hainan Prefecture, called it a “win-win” situation on multiple levels.

“In terms of production, enterprises generate electricity on the top level, and in terms of ecology, grass grows at the bottom under the solar panels, and villagers can herd sheep in between,” he said.

Solar panels have been installed on about two-thirds of the land, with power already flowing from completed phases. When fully complete, the project will have more than 7 million panels and be capable of generating enough power for 5 million households.

Like many of China's solar and wind farms, it was built in the relatively sparsely populated west. A major challenge is getting electricity to the population centers and factories in China's east.

“The distribution of green energy resources is perfectly misaligned with the current industrial distribution of our country,” Zhang Jinming, the vice governor of Qinghai province, told journalists on a government-organized tour.

Part of the solution is building transmission lines traversing the country.

One connects Qinghai to Henan province. Two more are planned, including one to Guangdong province in the southeast, almost at the opposite corner of the country.

Making full use of the power is hindered by the relatively inflexible way that China's electricity grid is managed, tailored to the steady output of coal plants rather than more variable and less predictable wind and solar, Myllyvirta said.

“This is an issue that the policymakers have recognized and are trying to manage, but it does require big changes to the way coal-fired power plants operate and big changes to the way the transmission network operates,” he said. “So it's no small task.”

The Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard ordered on July 20 that the U.S. intelligence community halt the sharing of information on ongoing Russia-Ukraine peace talks with so-called ""Five Eyes"" countries, CBS News reported on Aug. 21.

U.S. intelligence sources told CBS News that Gabbard signed a directive barring the sharing of information with the Five Eye alliance, which includes the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

The directive limited the distribution of intelligence to information that had already been publicly released, and compartmentalized intelligence on peace talks within agencies where the intelligence originated from, according to CBS News. 

The directive also does not prohibit the sharing of information obtained through diplomatic means, nor does it affect information sharing on U.S. military planning, including aid to Ukraine.

No rationale was provided for the decision, as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine — brokered by the United States — continue. The White House did not respond to the news agency's request for comment on the matter.

U.S. President Donald continues to attempt to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv setting out in recent days to broker bilateral talks between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The renewed attempts come days after a meeting between Putin and the U.S. president in Anchorage, Alaska, followed by Zelensky's visit to the White House.

In recent days, Western allies, including member of the so-called ""Coalition of the Willing,"" have pushed to establish security guarantees for Kyiv, with the backing of U.S. support. With the exception of Washington, all Five Eye nations are apart of the 31-nation Coalition of the Willing.

Gabbard has previously been intertwined with matters related to the war in Ukraine, after the U.S. halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 5. The decision, which was reversed soon after, followed a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28.

Gabbard has previously stirred controversy with her comments on Ukraine, having echoed in early 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine, attributing the cause not to Moscow but to the Biden administration's failure to acknowledge ""Russia's legitimate security concerns.""

Russia's top military and political officials joined Putin in the closed city of Sarov, which houses the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, on Aug. 22. 



The military aspect of the guarantees will involve weapons deliveries, financial support, intelligence sharing, and joint military exercises and trainings, a Presidential Office source told the news outlet Suspilne.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv for a surprise visit on Aug. 22 and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said.

Rutte's visit comes days after a high-level meeting in Washington between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European partners aimed at securing security guarantees for Ukraine.

""We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again,"" Rutte said at a press conference. 

According to the NATO chief, the security guarantees agreement will consist of two layers: strengthening Ukraine's army and commitments from the U.S. and Europe aimed at deterring Russia in the event of future aggression.

Bloomberg reported on Aug. 19 that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine might be finalized this week. European officials have reportedly discussed sending British and French troops to Ukraine, along with contingents from roughly 10 other countries.

According to Rutte, discussions about deploying foreign troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees are ongoing, but ""it is too early to say what will be the outcome.""

""It's still too early to say who might provide troops, who will contribute intelligence, who will be present at sea, and who — in the air,"" President Zelensky added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Aug. 18 that guarantees would not involve NATO membership but instead rely on a strong Ukrainian army backed by commitments from the Coalition of the Willing, which includes over 30 countries.

European officials told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 19 that a series of meetings among the countries participating in the Coalition of the Willing could take place in the coming days to work out the details.

Trump told Fox News on Aug. 19 that Washington could provide air support as part of the guarantees but ruled out deploying U.S. ground troops.

Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that security guarantees for Ukraine can't be discussed without Russia's participation.

""Ukraine needs security guarantees so that we, our children, and grandchildren can be certain that Russia will not attack us. These are guarantees of security against an aggressor,"" Zelensky said at a press conference in response to Lavrov's remarks.

""When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, to be honest, I don't know who exactly is threatening them. They're the ones who attacked us.""

How South Korea turned culture into a booming export (and what Canada can learn from it)

Growing up in Toronto in the 1980s, I was often asked by my classmates, “Are you Chinese or Japanese?”

“I'm Korean,” I would reply.

“What's that?”

I think they know now. The wild success of Korean pop culture is the kimchi slap heard around the world. Audiences are binging South Korean shows on Netflix, second only in minutes watched to American shows. Social media is filled with Korean food, K-pop dance challenges and K-beauty tutorials. The ascendance of Korean pop culture has a business aspect (huge) and cultural influence (also huge).

If you're surprised by this success, imagine me. I grew up preinternet. Besides the bootlegged VHS tapes my parents rented at the Korean grocer, I had zero access to Korean pop culture. Instead, I was clocking every Canadian success story, aware of our underdog status. In the 1990s, we gave the world Alanis, Celine, Shania and k.d.lang. Degrassi was airing in more than 40 countries.

Meanwhile, South Korea was experiencing an economic crisis and emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

One Jungkook later (27 years, the age of the BTS superstar), that's all changed. K-Pop Demon Hunters, a surprise Netflix hit, is the obsession of the summer, sparking singalong screenings in cinemas and a soundtrack at the top of the charts. On YouTube, Blackpink and BTS maintain the biggest artist channels (#1 and #2, respectively). In a New York Times' list of the 100 Best Movies of the 21st century, Bong Joon Ho's Parasite tops the list. Squid Game is Netflix's most-watched show of all time.

In a fibre-optic cable world where everything is a click away, borders and gatekeepers hold less power while each fan holds more. After a childhood of never seeing anyone like me or my family in pop culture, I made up for lost time by becoming a boy-band fan in my 40s, falling for BTS, the reigning kings of K-pop. Later, I survived COVID lockdowns with K-drama marathons, watching shows like Crash Landing On You, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha and My Mister. 

In 2023, hallyu, or the “Korean wave” of culture, was valued at $114-billion, and is forecasted to reach $143-billion on the global market by 2030.

These days, Canadian global successes pale in comparison. We could use some big Korean energy. Where is our bold national brand in a world exploding with more content by the day? Since a near-death experience triggered by Napster and file-sharing 20 years ago, the Canadian music industry is experiencing slow and steady regrowth, but our TV and film industries are currently in a tailspin as they try to weather the overall collapse of cinema box office revenue, cable TV and the advertising revenue that went with it.

Making matters worse, U.S. president Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on our $9.58-billion TV and film industry. This would be ruinous for the Canadian sector. About half the value of our industry is dependent on Hollywood productions coming here to film with our crews and locations.

Adding to this mix, Canada is in the midst of a “once in a generation” regulatory revamp to the Broadcasting Act with the newer Online Streaming Act of 2023, also known as Bill C-11, the first update to the Act since 1991. This is the law that defines what is Canadian content – better known as Cancon.

The implementation of the new Act presents opportunities, including improving how government money flows to our entertainment industries, but TV and film are hanging by a thread as the government bickers with streamers. Industry consultations are taking forever. If results aren't more quick and nimble, there won't be much left of these industries to save. 

The nineties was our last truly analog era, and since then, South Korea has learned that while government funding needs to be a part of the equation, the focus is on building infrastructure and a strong private sector, including boosting new technology, rather than providing support on a project-by-project basis for content. 

I'm also, frankly, jealous of how Koreans aren't afraid to be Korean. We need a lesson in how to make Cancon not only more successful, but more Canadian. Maybe the whole “elbows up” vibe can be more than a passing moment of raised ire. Are we ready to be seen for who we are in our own entertainment, songs and stories, and sell it to the world? If South Korea can do it, and they started from the bottom, we can, too.

Canada and South Korea are comparable by several measures. South Korea has the seventh largest recorded music industry in the world. Canada has the eighth. Our GDP-per-capita is $55,800 and South Korea's is $50,600. Canadians live next door to the U.S., and Koreans also know about big neighbours: Japan and China. 

As for differences, language is the most obvious one. Unlike English, Korean is the official language of no other place on Earth. You would think this would be an obstacle for exporting culture, but according to Canadian TV executive Michael MacMillan, CEO of Blue Ant Media, it's actually an advantage. “They know who they are. They're Korean. They speak Korean.”

Making Korean content for a Korean audience that reflects their own lives was South Korea's first step in a formula for global success. You need a surplus of domestic product in order to export. After building infrastructure for their cultural industries over decades, South Korea has grown a deep, competitive domestic pool of talent and saleable content. 

Canadian talent also runs deep. Our film crews are second-to-none. But it's challenging to get funding to make our own stories. It's especially tough now because Canadian broadcasters are buying fewer programs, especially in the English-language market, having overspent on Canadian programming in an overcorrection after the pandemic. Two Hollywood strikes had an impact, with Canadian crews waiting for work that never arrived. The net of it is a Canadian TV and film industry that shrank by 18.5 per cent from April, 2023 to March, 2024.

Pivoting in this era of rapid transformation is challenging, but South Korea is doing it. They have a history of iterating government policies that aren't working – for example, changing their approach to caps on the import of foreign films (restrictive in the 1960s, scrapped by the 1980s) and quotas on how many could be screened (fluctuating over the decades but most recently halved in the 2000s). 

Responsive policies have allowed their industries to flourish – and Netflix took notice. In 2023, the streamer dropped US$2.5-billion into a multiyear commitment to the Korean film and TV industry.

Netflix's model is to invest locally to give local audiences what they want. If a show breaks out to become a worldwide hit – bonus.

Serving local audiences is a strategy that suits South Korea well, as they are highly invested in learning about their own history and culture. Shin Dong Kim, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, says that a Korean obsession with education has refined their taste.

“In Korean society, after colonialism and war, we were all devastated and the traditional class system was just demolished. Education was the last resort of social mobility,” says Prof. Kim.

He says Koreans' passion for education has meant they increasingly demand more interesting and well-written dramas and movies. 

The high quality of content has in turn led to sales in the global market. When I began to watch K-dramas, I didn't understand all the cultural nuances, but the storylines were so addictive, I kept watching. As I did, I learned more and more about Koreans at work, on dates and at home with their families. And now the world has, too.

In Canada, instead of reflecting our own culture back to us, about half of our TV and film industry caters to American productions. 

American producers love our cheaper dollar, tax credit incentives and world-class crews. For us, the arrangement has been out of necessity. Americans money has kept our production industry competitive and alive. 

“Our local market, our audience size, is tiny,” says Blue Ant's MacMillan. 

But while our audience may be tiny compared with the U.S., compared with South Korea, whose population is 51 million, 40 million Canadians isn't so small, especially not in a market that has been made global by streamers and YouTube.

Canada has already shown in small ways that it can be like Korea when it comes to selling its unique culture. One of this year's buzziest Canadian TV shows is North of North. The sitcom, from Inuk showrunners Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, takes place in Iqaluit and was made through a partnership between CBC, APTN and Netflix. Inuit make up 0.2 per cent of the Canadian population, but geographically-based audiences matter less in a streamer world looking for great shows with universal themes (in this case, motherhood and community). 

This spring, North of North became a global Top 10 hit for Netflix, part of their local-to-global hitmaker pipeline.

In the past, our mode was to sell shows by hiding that they're Canadian. Schitt's Creek had “no location, no setting, there is no country,” as star Eugene Levy told Stephen Colbert in 2018. This, about a show starring some of our biggest household names and produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Government funding for Canadian content is a cornerstone of our system and it boils down to a points systems. Film and TV productions, for example, earn points by employing Canadian citizens in key positions and paying at least 75 per cent of costs to Canadian companies, among other criteria. Ticking enough boxes doesn't necessarily get you the money, it just puts you in the running for a panel to decide.

The promise of tax credits from the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO) will form another piece of that budget spreadsheet, with yet another checklist.

Cancon rules aren't just about funding; they dictate quotas for Canadian broadcasters. Songs score points when music, lyrics and recording are entirely done by Canadian citizens – and then performed principally by a Canadian. Radio stations are required to play a minimum of 35 per cent Cancon (50 per cent for the CBC). 

Now that the Online Streaming Act of 2023 has replaced the Broadcasting Act, the CRTC has been tasked with implementing it to reshape the rules for a digital era. So far, no one seems happy. 

“This seemed to be the opportunity to say we are doing something new here,” says Patrick Rogers of Music Canada, which represents major music labels in Canada. Instead, Rogers says outcomes have been disappointing.

One of the first actions the CRTC took under the Act, in 2024, was to require global streamers to pay a 5-per-cent levy to operate in Canada, with revenues being used to support the Canadian broadcasting system, including local news on radio and television, French-language content, Indigenous content and content by and for equity-deserving communities. 

This levy didn't land well. Spotify raised its subscription prices. Netflix stopped funding talent-generating incubators for Canadian creatives. 

Rogers calls the update a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” but at this point, he isn't optimistic. “It appears the CRTC is interested in finding ways to maintain the system of the past.”

South Korea's cultural industries are supported by government, too, but they do it differently. The South Korean government, with a few exceptions, puts the money into infrastructure and sector support rather than funneling it into specific projects. 

When I ask Yoori Kwon, a Seoul-based TV executive, how much government money goes into the dozens of TV shows her studio produces per year, she seems puzzled. 

“None,” she says.

However, her studio, SLL Studios, a top South Korean production company, is based in Digital Media City, a neighbourhood in Seoul with a high concentration of tech and media, a world of hard facilities, as planned by several levels of government. 

Besides infrastructure, Kim says the South Korean government supports cultural industries by encouraging private investment. For example, the K-Content Strategic Fund – announced last year and worth $400-million – is a pool of investments by private companies, including studios and banks, backed by the government. In this way, the South Korean government leverages capital markets to fuel their ambitious global export plans, merging private and public dollars to do it. This content fund is about growing money as much as it is about funneling it back into their industries, building in financial sustainability. 

Clive Kenny, a British economist who has studied K-culture industries, says that private sector business acumen has been integral to the growth of hallyu. “Korea had the chaebols, these family-run conglomerates, who were able to bring their expertise from producing appliances and cars into the entertainment sector.” 

An early example is CJ Group, a South Korean food company, which became a founding investor in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG in the 1990s. Besides holding a stake, they got distribution rights for Asian countries – but the whole point was to get into the biz. Today, CJ ENM, owned by CJ Group, is one of Korea's biggest entertainment companies. 

Imagine Canada expanding past the telecommunications oligopoly (Rogers, Bell, Telus) with Loblaw or McCain Foods getting into movies ‐ or Canadian export industries like oil and gas or lumber.

“It's very risky to produce high-end content,” Kenny says. Government incentives, like grants, are designed to mitigate some of the risk. Kenny says the South Korean government provides incentives but they're not big relative to other markets like Europe, U.S. or Canada. 

“The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of mini-series drama Little Bird (above).CRAVE/Supplied

He says government incentives done well can create a virtuous circle, encouraging many players to invest in the local ecosystem, as South Korea has done. Incentives done poorly, however, can go sideways, creating inefficient obstacle courses, a drain of time and effort. “You've already missed the wave of what you're trying to achieve if you add a year of prefinancing discussion,” Kenny says. 

It's also counterproductive, Kenny says, when you have a small group of judges applying their points of view to assess what's worth funding. That's when a process, meant to be an incentive, actually adds risk to the business, by making it more subjective.

Kenny may as well be describing the Canadian grant system. 

Without jumping through hoops to scrape together budgets, no Canadian producer can pay a crew to arrive on-set, and no Canadian audience gets a show like Sort Of, Kim's Convenience, Letterkenny or Little Bird, last year's biggest winner at the Canadian Screen Awards.

“The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of Little Bird, a drama about the 1960s scoop that was a partnership between APTN and Crave. Working with low budgets, and wearing many hats, requires a very entrepreneurial frame of mind, Podemski says. Her production company has a small core team and, until five years ago, she ran it without a physical office space. 

“The business model didn't work for me and I can see now it's not working for anybody.”

Another driver of South Korea's success is their intense work culture. Koreans work some of the longest hours in the developed world, and take less holiday than the OECD average. You can clearly see it in K-pop, which has endured plenty of scrutiny from fans and detractors for its hard-driving trainee system.

“There's a thing we could call the success theory of K-pop,” says Son Sungdeuk, Executive Creator at Hybe America. “There's the idol, and contact with fans and communication, fans always being the priority. Also, artists produce music that is not just for the ears but also for the eyes. It's performance-heavy, which is different. And then the training process. That's the unofficial formula.”

K-pop groups are assembled by record labels through a long process of training and tryouts. Son began working with BTS as a choreographer during their audition phase, long before they amassed 80 million subscribers on YouTube. They were still a ragtag group of students, assembled by a scrappy, no-profile company called Big Hit, now one of several labels under Hybe.

South Korea's K-pop trainee system is intense, taking years of training and tryouts. The result is on display in Netflix docu-series Pop Star Academy, which produced 'global girl group' Katseye (pictured above in L.A. in 2024), whose members are from around the world.Chris Pizzello/The Associated Press

The bandmates lived in a dorm, training daily for years, posting dance practice videos and livestreams (which they still diligently do) before debuting in 2013. Their hard-driving effort took them all the way to the Grammys stage in 2022. After the show, the team headed home to Seoul while Son stayed in California, where he is working to build Hybe's U.S. endeavour.

Son's contributions to the K-pop trainee system are on display in Netflix's Pop Star Academy, a documentary series on the making of a K-pop group over a year of training and tryouts. The result is Katseye, a global girl group with members from the Philippines, U.S., Switzerland and South Korea.

Does Son think it's possible to take the K-pop trainee system out of Korea and apply it elsewhere?

“No,” Son says. “There's too much of a cultural difference. Figuring this out was my biggest homework. There was no reference for what could be done.”

The K-pop trainee system is an expression of how Koreans work – at school, in the military, in the workplace and in entertainment. 

This method is not a blueprint for what the Canadian system needs. The lesson, instead, is to double down on your culture's strengths.

We might not excel at highly-trained pop groups, but we regularly produce acclaimed solo artists. Our most famous exports are musicians with a strong point of view (think Drake, The Weeknd, Mustafa, Feist, Nelly Furtado, and, going back in time, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Gordon Lightfoot). K-pop has at its heart a pursuit of perfection, whereas Canadian musicians who travel well have a distinct voice. Perhaps storytelling is what's in our cultural DNA.

As a whole, Canadian music is already faring well in a digital world.

Without quotas for streamers yet in place, Canadians choose Canadian music 10 per cent of the time, which is substantial given they are competing with every song of all time and around the world.

Outside our borders, the world is also choosing Canadian, with our artists ranking third (behind the U.S. and U.K.) in worldwide streams of the top 1,000 singles. 

“Canadian music is made by Canadians and it's designed to be shared with the world,” Rogers says. “Some of the top songs in India are made by Canadians. We're net benefiters of this global phenomenon in so many ways.” 

Sharing a perspective is exactly what content creators do – and according to YouTube, Canadian creators on that platform see 90 per cent of their watch time come from outside Canada. Some of this content, like that of MiaPlays (a channel entirely in Farsi with videos like “What I Eat In A Week”) aren't in English or French. It's an eye-popping ratio that shows Canadians are already exporting our pop culture to the world.

During the pandemic, in an attempt to understand the creator economy, the Canadian government ran a survey that found that content creators have low and volatile incomes, prone to fluctuation and reliant on supplementation from live performances and physical sales. It would future-proof our cultural economy if we could provide more stability for creators through accessible infrastructure (studios, gear, mentorship, business administration education and fair artist management, for example). 

The investment would be worth it. In 2023, the YouTube creator economy generated over $1.82-billion to Canada's GDP.

A good case study to look at is CoPilot, a start-up in Winnipeg specializing in LED walls and software, a more advanced version of green screen technology for films. The company began with two friends making travel videos for tourism boards. When the pandemic shut down travel, they spent time levelling up on virtual production technology and started their business.

“Because we're based in Manitoba, we can't compete at the same level of people in markets like Los Angeles, Vancouver, New York. We decided to Hail Mary it and start a YouTube channel,” says Reid Valmestad, CoPilot's director of business development and operations. 

By sharing their growing expertise, they built an audience of niche clientele, and now travel to build LED walls and 3D environments for studios and trade shows. An enthusiastic South Korean client of theirs is LG (yes, the brand best known for making your washer and dryer), who are also in the business of content. 

CoPilot have benefited from several initiatives of the Canadian government, including a trade mission to South Korea and business mentorship through a matching program. This type of support sounds practically South Korean, building the muscle of innovation for a Canadian company while also building infrastructure.

As professor Kim reminds me, no one in Korea watches a show because it's Korean: “They watch it because it's good.” 

Canadian audiences are the same. We don't care about points systems, budgets, levies or even the technology that dazzles us behind the scenes. We just want to see ourselves, too. In Canada, that means true expressions of our diversity – not as a catchphrase or checklist, but in a way that supports every musician, writer, director, content creator to have as strong and richly unique of a voice as they can. 

“Whether I like it or not, I‘m representing Canada wherever I go,” says Polaris Prize-winning musician Lido Pimienta. “I feel like any time I have to access support, I‘m in this constant state of validating my work. You want your work to speak for you but when culture is attached to the government, it limits so much of what you can do.” 

Citing fan bases in her home country of Colombia, as well as Chile, New Zealand, and the U.S., as Pimienta does, is extremely Canadian. Canada's diversity is an obvious advantage that still remains largely untapped by gatekeepers. It's occurring to the powers-that-be too slowly, if at all, that diversity and diaspora connect us directly with audiences around the world. 

“Whether I like it or not, I‘m representing Canada wherever I go,” says Polaris Prize-winning musician Lido Pimienta (left) with Nelly Furtado in 2023.Ryan Emberley/Supplied

We don't need a bland mush that flattens who we are as Canadians. No more “there is no country,” in our TV shows. Keep boosting the signal on music with singular, iconoclastic points of view. The whole point of diversity is to recognize that there is no one culture, which isn't the same as saying we don't have a culture. Specificity is a storyteller's best asset. Undoubtedly, Canada is set up incredibly well there.

In a more perfect world, the CRTC wouldn't seem like it's surprised by cord-cutting media habits that are at least a decade old. Folks in government media regulation would be well-versed in TikTok and Spotify and YouTube, so they can inherently understand what the rest of us are doing. And if we're going to be using points systems, we could expand the range for how they're scored. For example, the British system includes points for showing British creativity, heritage and diversity on-screen, as well as British locations, whether or not they're shot in a studio in the U.S. 

South Korea isn't perfect. It's easy to look with envy and oversimplify problems they're working through themselves. A culture of overwork and a record label system that can be exploitative are constant issues. But they did a few key things right, by making bold investments, encouraging private sector business acumen, changing restrictive policies and funneling money into infrastructure. They're also laser-focused on figuring out the future of intellectual property. We can do all of this, too, if there is the political will. 

The timing couldn't be more crucial. The Directors guild of Canada predicts a potential $200-million decline over the next five years for Canadian programming, owing to lost revenue from the migration to streaming. 

We need government support with a light touch, more trade mission-type connections and incentives that are straightforward, not obstacle courses. As we hurtle towards a global future, connecting with fans and audiences around the world and having a strong sense of Canada at the starting block is the only way forward. It's an investment that will pay itself back many times over.

“Once a fandom is formed, it doesn't easily go away,” says Prof. Kim. “Fandom goes along throughout their lives.” 

He's talking about K-pop (and Elvis and Star Wars) but he could very well be talking about our national identity, too. We need to be our own biggest fans to bring the world along with us.

Israel's defence minister warned Friday that Gaza's largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country's terms, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade.

A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defence Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war.

“The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza – until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,” Katz wrote in a post on X.

He restated Israel's ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Famine grips Gaza City, driven by war and aid restrictions, food crises authority says

What to know about Israel's Gaza offensive as 60,000 reservists set to be mobilized

Hamas issued a statement that called Katz's comments “a confession of committing a crime that amounts to ethnic cleansing.” The militant group has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but it rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It was not immediately clear if that meant that Israel would return to long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the mediators.

With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.

Israel says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels, after several previous large-scale raids. The city is also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some who have fled from other areas, and contains some of the strip's critical infrastructure and health facilities.

Israel could also accept the latest ceasefire proposal, which would forestall the offensive. It calls for a phased deal involving hostage and prisoner exchanges and a pullback of Israeli troops, while talks continue on a longer-term cease-fire. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies.

Many Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas-led militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Aid groups and international leaders warn it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis.

The logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. Many residents say repeated displacement is pointless since nowhere in Gaza is safe, while medical groups warn Israel's calls to move patients south is unworkable, with no facilities to receive them.

But Netanyahu has argued the offensive is the surest way to free captives and crush Hamas.

“These two things – defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages – go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command centre near in southern Israel.

Since 251 people were taken hostage more than 22 months ago, ceasefire agreements and other deals have accounted for the vast majority of the 148 released, including the bodies of eight deceased hostages.

Israel has only managed to rescue eight hostages alive and retrieved the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.

The world's leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.

A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It's the first famine confirmed by the IPC in the Middle East.

Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.”

Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it's not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May.

Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalates its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive.

An Israeli air strike hit a school in Sheikh Radwan, a Gaza City neighbourhood where tens of Palestinians shelter in makeshift tents in the schoolyard. It killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records.

Israel's military said it wasn't aware of a strike in the area but in a statement said troops were operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the Zeitoun neighborhood.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

The Associated Press

The strike is part of Israel's ongoing push in Gaza City, where the military says it is operating and witnesses have reported intense bombardment in the days since Israel approved its plans to take the city.

Amal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense he couldn't sleep, yet she couldn't leave either.

“We do not have the money, the resources, or the energy to evacuate again. I just wish for a quick death right where I am here because I am not going anywhere. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press.

The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that at least 62,192 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Another two people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 271, including 112 children, the Health Ministry said.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. The UN and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.

Hamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages.

Also on Friday, foreign ministers from European countries, Australia and Britain on Friday jointly condemned Israel's plans to construct a settlement east of Jerusalem, calling it a breach of international law.

The approval of the E1 project would bisect the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, fragmenting territory Palestinians seek for an independent state. It was announced last week by far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and received the final go-ahead from a Defence Ministry planning commission on Wednesday.

“We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,” said ministers from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

Israel immediately dismissed the statement, saying it “rejects the attempt to impose foreign dictates upon it.”

“The Jewish people are the indigenous people of the Land of Israel. At no point in history has there ever been a Palestinian state, and any attempt to argue otherwise has no legal, factual, or historical basis,” Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Canada needs a Leader of the opposition who is not only a fearless critic of the government, but who also commands the respect of the people.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Pierre Poilievre stuck his parachute landing in an Alberta by-election on Monday, winning 80 per cent of the vote in a riding so deeply blue that anything less would have tainted his comeback.

The Tory Leader is now legitimately off the sidelines and in the game, and his first steps are being closely watched. After his by-election win, Ontario Premier Doug Ford immediately urged him to play for “Team Canada” – in other words, to co-operate with federal and provincial efforts to block or counter whatever tariff punch the U.S. throws next.

But joining the cheerleading squad is not the role of the leader of the opposition in Ottawa, and it's not Mr. Poilievre's style. His sole assignment is to hold the Liberal government to account for its actions and inaction, something he did Wednesday when he said, fairly enough, that Prime Minister Mark Carney has made “concession after concession to President [Donald] Trump and he got nothing in return.”

The real issue for this version of Mr. Poilievre is not what he does but how he does it, and how voters receive it. 

Opinion: Despite his negatives, Poilievre has a lock on the Conservative leadership

Opinion: Pierre Poilievre can be an attack dog and a grown-up all at the same time

Will they see the same one-note reciter of rhyming slogans and packaged put-downs – a blunt tactic that worked well when his opposition was a tired Liberal government led by a prime minister who had badly overstayed his welcome?

Or will he demonstrate that he has learned from yet another Conservative general-election loss – and from his ouster from the Ottawa-adjacent riding he'd held for 21 years – that can be fairly blamed on his baffling refusal to switch gears when Mr. Trump changed the stakes, Justin Trudeau stepped aside and Mr. Carney came on the scene?

Mr. Poilievre will choose his own path, but it would serve the interests of Canadians if he holstered the most abrasive aspects of his style and focused instead on thoughtful and credible critiques of the Carney government.

This country is waiting to see what Mr. Carney produces in the way of trade and defence deals with the U.S. and other, more reliable, allies, and how effectively his government lives up to its promise to make Canada's economy more productive and less reliant on its continental neighbour.

The Prime Minister will have a lot to answer for if his first budget, which he says will come this fall, proves to lack the ambition and scale, and somehow also the fiscal restraint, required of the moment. 

If the budget smells too much like a self-serving Liberal confection layered with new spending that conveniently only comes into effect after the next general election (a Trudeau specialty), Mr. Poilievre needs to be in a position to attack it with credibility.

The same will go for any Liberal trade deal that concedes too much to the United States, or for any retaliation to Mr. Trump's tariffs that is too timid, or for any failure on the part of the government to align itself with other trade and defence partners.

Weakness is not an option. The Liberal government is under intense, self-imposed pressure to come through for Canada in incredibly difficult circumstances. But it's important to remember that it was rewarded with that responsibility by voters who bought Mr. Carney's pitch that he was the best person for the task.

His experience as an international banker and economist, and his serious demeanour, convinced enough voters that the gravitas he was selling compensated for his lack of political experience. In short, that he was the grown-up the situation called for.

Mr. Poilievre has political chops few can match. But they won't do Canadians much good if he continues to rely on canned snark, and on rhyme schemes that Dr. Seuss would reject, as his weapons of choice in Parliament.

Personal political style matters far less at a time like this than does the perception that the person in question is taking the situation seriously and has the capacity to put country – not party, not ego, not social media sarcasm – first.

In truth, there really ought not to be anyone holding a federal seat right now who isn't seized with the idea that, for the time being, the critical goal of securing Canada's future trumps all other concerns.

That doesn't mean Mr. Poilievre needs to put on a Team Canada jersey. On the contrary, what Canadians need in the Leader of the opposition is a fearless critic who, when he calls out the government for any failure to live up to the moment, is actually listened to.

Europe's largest economy has shrunk, with industrial production and construction weaker than first thought. Meanwhile, Berlin is being urged to recognize a Palestinian state. Follow DW for the latest. 

Germany's economy fell by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year

Exports are down, imports are up, with output across several sectors falling

Reviving the economy is a top priority for Germany's new government

A top former adviser to Angela Merkel has urged Berlin to recognize a Palestinian state

Stay tuned for the latest news and analysis on a range of issues connected with Germany from Friday, August 22:

German Commissioner for Human Rights and Humanitarian Assistance Lars Castellucci on Friday called on the German government to expedite the admission of Afghan men and women from Pakistan. 

The coalition government has agreed on ""an orderly and humanitarian migration policy,"" Castellucci wrote on X.

He warned that lengthy examinations of the Afghanistan admission program fulfill neither of those two goals.

Castellucci stressed that ""anyone who has received a legally binding commitment to enter Germany under the federal admission program for Afghanistan must also be able to obtain a visa promptly."" 

On Monday, the German Foreign Ministry reported that 211 Afghans who were approved for resettlement in Germany were deported back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they had been temporarily based in hopes of eventually relocating to Europe.

German-based logistic company DHL has announced temporary restrictions on package deliveries to the United States due to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. 

DHL said that from Saturday, its standard category of package delivery to the US, the preferred option for many small businesses, would be temporarily suspended.

""The reason for these anticipated temporary restrictions is new processes required by US authorities for postal shipping,"" according to a DHL statement.

""Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future,"" the statement added.

However, a more expensive ""express"" service for packages weighing up to 70 kilograms (154 pounds) will still be offered.

Last month, Trump signed an executive order ending the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption, which allowed international shipments under $800 (€688) to be shipped into the US duty-free. This tax break will no longer apply from August 29.

A Berlin court has stopped the planned renaming of a controversially-named street to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse just before the official unveiling.

The Administrative Court ruled Friday that the street cannot be renamed while a resident's lawsuit against the process is still pending. The court said there was no urgent need to complete the change.

Berlin's Mitte district and several activist groups have long argued the current name Mohrenstrasse (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse) is racist, since the word ""Mohr"" was historically used in a derogatory way for people of African descent.

The new name would honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century African-born scholar who became the first known Black philosopher and lawyer at a German university.

Signs with the new name had already been installed, and the unveiling was set for Saturday, the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. The Initiative of Black People in Germany said it would hold a gathering regardless.

The dispute dates back to 2021, when the Mitte district parliament first approved the renaming. Several residents sued, arguing the old name was not racist but part of Berlin's history. The Higher Administrative Court had cleared the change in July, but other lawsuits remain unresolved.

In its latest ruling, the Administrative Court clarified that the renaming is delayed but likely not canceled, saying it is ""highly unlikely"" the resident's claim will succeed. Similar debates over street names linked to colonialism, racism, antisemitism, or the Nazi era have played out across Berlin in recent years.

Economy Minister Katherina Reiche has urged rapid structural reforms to strengthen Germany's competitiveness after weak economic data.

""The figures highlight the urgent need for action,"" Reiche said Friday. ""The federal government has already taken initial steps to provide relief. But in order for the German economy to become competitive, further-reaching and bold structural reforms are indispensable. Only in this way can we return to stable growth.""

She stressed the need for quick implementation: ""It is now crucial to swiftly implement bold structural reforms — for example in making working hours more flexible, reducing non-wage labor costs, cutting back bureaucratic hurdles and lowering energy prices.""

Reiche also cautioned against raising taxes. ""The tax burden for companies in Germany is already high. We need to talk about further reductions, not increases in the tax load.""

Berlin Zoo's panda twins Leni and Lotti have marked their first birthday with a special surprise of frozen vegetable juice balls.

Keepers carried the 21-kilogram cubs into the outdoor enclosure Friday morning, where red and orange balls of frozen beetroot and carrot juice awaited alongside a wooden number one and an oversized candle topped with a frozen carrot flame.

Head keeper Norbert Zahmel said the twins now respond to their caretakers' voices but cannot yet be reliably guided to the climbing area, which is why they were carried in. ""Compared with other large bears, brain development in pandas is somewhat slower,"" he said. ""But they make up for it later.""

At first hesitant, the cubs grew bolder as they explored the birthday setup — and became more lively once their mother, Meng Meng, joined in.

A drunk passenger caused a disturbance on a flight from England to Cyprus, resulting in an unscheduled stop at Cologne/Bonn Airport in western Germany on Thursday evening.

The 41-year-old women allegedly punched, kicked, insulted, and threatened fellow passengers and crew members, according to a statement released by Germany's Federal Police on Friday morning.

The flight was bound for Larnaca from Manchester.

A test showed that the woman had a very high blood alcohol level.

According to the federal police, the British citizen will be sent back to her home country after being released from custody. 

No one was injured in the incident, police said.

Former Munich Security Conference chairman Christoph Heusgen has urged the German government to recognize a Palestinian state, citing the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

In a guest article for the RND media group published Friday, Heusgen wrote that recognition would be viewed worldwide as a ""particularly strong gesture"" given Germany's reputation as a close ally of Israel.

He said the step would not alter conditions immediately but would signal solidarity with Palestinians if Berlin joined the majority of countries that already extend recognition.

Heusgen, a longtime adviser to former Chancellor Angela Merkel, pointed to momentum ahead of the UN General Assembly in September, where France, Canada, and Australia are among those planning to recognize a Palestinian state.

However, the German government has pushed back on the idea. Spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in late July that recognition is considered ""one of the final steps"" toward a two-state solution, which foresees an independent Palestine coexisting peacefully alongside Israel.

More than half of Germans now support recognizing a Palestinian state, a recent poll showed.

Germany's gross domestic product has fallen by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the first, showing Europe's largest economy losing momentum.

The Federal Statistical Office said the decline was 0.2 points steeper than in its flash estimate from July 30, with weaker-than-expected industrial production driving the revision. GDP had grown 0.3% in the first quarter and 0.2% in the last quarter of 2024.

Data showed that both manufacturing and construction output in June deteriorated more than first assumed. Private consumption was revised down after service-sector statistics, including hospitality figures, pointed to weaker demand.

Exports of goods and services edged 0.1% lower, weighed by a 0.6% decline in goods exports, while service exports rose 1.4%. Imports rose a strong 1.6%.

Gross value added across the economy fell 0.2%. Construction slumped 3.7%, manufacturing dropped 0.3%, and trade, transport, and hospitality declined 0.6%. By contrast, information and communications and business services each grew 0.5%, but public services, education, and health flatlined.

Germany has been the only G7 economy to stagnate for the past two years and now faces the prospect of a third straight year of contraction, which would be a first in the country's postwar history.

Reviving growth has become a top priority for the new government as trade tensions mount. US President Donald Trump imposed a baseline tariff of 10% on April 5, raising fears of further damage to Germany's export-driven economy.

The German sportswear brand offered a ""public apology"" in person to a Mexican Indigenous community for cultural appropriation in the design of its Oaxaca Slip-On shoe.

Adidas has issued a public apology to a small Indigenous town in Mexico's Oaxaca state for a shoe design criticized as cultural appropriation.

Executives from the German sportswear manufacturer traveled to the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag to personally deliver their remarks after issuing a written apology last week.

The company admitted its ""Oaxaca Slip-On"" shoe, created by Mexican American designer Willy Chavarria, closely resembled traditional huarache sandals made in the community.

""The Oaxaca Slip-On model was conceived taking inspiration from a design originating in the state of Oaxaca, typical of the tradition of the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag,"" said Karen Gonzalez, legal head of Adidas Mexico, to the residents.

""We understand that this situation may have caused discomfort, for which we offer a public apology.""

Gonzalez added that the company would work in collaboration with the town in the future, which relies on handicrafts for its livelihood.

Chavarria also issued a statement saying he was ""deeply sorry"" and regretted not working directly with local artisans from the Oaxacan community.

The controversy drew national attention after President Claudia Sheinbaum accused Adidas of exploiting Indigenous culture and vowed stronger protections against global brands copying traditional designs.

""It's collective intellectual property. There must be compensation. The heritage law must be complied with,"" Sheinbaum said earlier this month.

Oaxaca's Ministry of Culture and Arts accepted Adidas' apology as a ""historic act of recognition of the Indigenous peoples of Oaxaca.""

It was the eighth flight of a X-37B, which was designed for the US Air Force by Boeing. It is set to test laser communications and navigation without the use of GPS.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Thursday night, carrying a classified US military spaceplane into orbit.

It was the eighth flight of an X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle. No one was on board the rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. 

The X-37B, built by Boeing, is an uncrewed and autonomous spacecraft employed by the US military to test technology and conduct experiments in both high and low Earth orbits.

""These operational demonstrations and experiments comprise next-generation technologies, including laser communications and the highest-performing quantum inertial sensor ever tested in space,"" the US Space Force said in July.

""Mission 8 will contribute to improving the resilience, efficiency and security of US space-based communications architectures,"" it added.

It is unclear how long the mini shuttle will remain in orbit. On a previous mission, the drone circled Earth for more than a year before returning in March.

Powered by solar panels, the reusable space planes were first launched in 2010. They measure 30 feet (nine meters) long with a 15-foot wingspan.

FBI agents have raided the home of John Bolton, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump.

Officers descended on the property in Bethesda, Maryland, at around 12pm (7am local time) on Friday. It comes as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, according to reports.

Mr Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, according to a source.

Footage of the early morning raid showed two police cars blocking off Mr Bolton's street.

The end of the leafy, tree-lined road was cordoned off with yellow police and road flares.

Mr Trump said he didn't know anything about the raid and had found out about it from watching the news.

Speaking at the Kennedy Centre shortly after FBI agents descended on Mr Bolton's home, and later his Washington DC office, Mr Trump said: “I know nothing about it, I just saw it this morning.

“They did a raid. I don't know about it. I saw it on television this morning. I'm not a fan of John Bolton, he's sort of a low life.”

Mr Bolton, 76, who was once part of Mr Trump's inner circle but now has become one of the US president's most vocal critics, was previously accused of including classified information in his 2020 book, The Room Where it Happened.

Around 30 minutes after the FBI had raided his home, Mr Bolton posted on social media suggesting Mr Trump's attempts to end the war in Ukraine were futile.

Sharing a link to an interview with NPR, he wrote: “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede territory it already holds and the remainder of Donetsk, which it has been unable to conquer. Zelensky will never do so.”

He added: “Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress.”

After searching his home, FBI agents raided Mr Bolton's office in the centre of Washington DC.

Management sent an internal email to all of the building's tenants, saying: “The FBI is on-site this morning to visit one specific tenant.

“There is no known threat to the property at this time.”

Last week, Mr Trump lamented news channels for inviting figures like Mr Bolton to comment on his efforts to secure a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

Taking to Truth Social, Mr Trump wrote: “Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.”

It comes after Mr Bolton told CNN that Vladimir Putin had “clearly won” following the pair's meeting in Alaska last week.

“Trump did not lose but Putin clearly won. Putin achieved most of what he wanted and Trump achieved very little,” he said.

The raid came after Kash Patel, the FBI director, reportedly ordered an investigation into Mr Bolton.

Shortly after the raid began, Mr Patel wrote on social media:

NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission

The post was reshared by a White House spokesman.

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, also shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

An FBI spokesman said the agency was “conducting court-authorised activity in the area. There is no threat to public safety”.

JD Vance, the vice president, said the investigation was in its “very early stages”.

Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press, Mr Vance said: “We're in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton.

“We're going to let that investigation proceed...if they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law.”

However, Mr Vance insisted that the Trump Administration was not going to “throw people willy nilly in prison”.

He said: “We don't think that we should throw people, even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically, you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison. 

“You should let the law drive these determinations, and that's what we're doing.”

Within hours of returning to the White House in 2025, Mr Trump stripped Mr Bolton of his Secret Service security protections.

Mr Bolton, who left his role in the Trump administration in November 2019, had required ongoing protection because of threats against him by Iran.

Asked earlier this month about whether he was worried about the Trump administration taking action against him, Mr Bolton told ABC News Mr Trump had “already come after” him by taking away his security detail.

He added: “I think it is a retribution presidency.”

The raid also comes after Mr Bolton said in the wake of Mr Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska that the Russian had “clearly won”.

Mr Bolton served as Mr Trump's third national security adviser for 17 months, and the pair clashed over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea.

He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over his book, but in 2021 the justice department abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation.

Mr Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

In the foreword to his memoir, Mr Bolton wrote: “A mountain of facts demonstrates that Trump is unfit to be president.”

The book portrayed Mr Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government”.

Mr Trump responded by calling Mr Bolton a “crazy” war-monger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

In a 2023 book, Mr Patel included Mr Bolton in a list of “members of the executive branch deep state”.

Mr Bolton served as US ambassador to the United Nations under George W Bush and also held positions in Ronald Reagan's administration. He considered running for president in 2012 and 2016.

In 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to kill Mr Bolton in presumed retaliation for a January 2020 US air strike that killed the country's most powerful general.

Mr Trump repeatedly claimed he was a victim of “witch hunt” federal investigations during the Biden administration.

On the campaign trail and since returning to office, he has promised to investigate and punish adversaries.

Other steps taken against Mr Trump's political enemies include conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Mr Trump and his company.

Mr Schiff and Ms James have denied any wrongdoing.

Jack Smith, a former special prosecutor who pursued two criminal cases against Mr Trump, faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office.

The Telegraph has contacted Mr Bolton for comment.

This is not just a month of mourning — it's a time for mobilization and recommitment to prison abolition.

The concrete tomb they built to bury our revolution has become the very ground from which it grows. From behind these concrete walls and steel bars, where time moves differently and hope becomes a revolutionary act, I write to you about Black August — a month that prison administrators would rather see forgotten, but which burns eternal in the hearts of those who understand that freedom is not a privilege to be granted, but a right to be seized.

To understand why this resistance continues, we must first understand its origins. Black August, observed each August since 1979, commemorates the deaths of Black liberation fighters who died in prison. Particularly, Black August pays homage to Jonathan Jackson, who was killed on August 7, 1970, while attempting to liberate his brother George Jackson and other prisoners; and George Jackson himself, who was assassinated by guards at San Quentin on August 21, 1971. This month of remembrance and resistance was born from the recognition that the same forces that murdered our ancestors continue to operate within these walls, using solitary confinement as a weapon of psychological warfare against those who dare to organize, educate, and resist.

The tools of oppression have been passed down like heirlooms from one generation of torturers to the next. The iron fist of solitary confinement that crushes spirits today is the same instrument of torture that crushed George Jackson. It was during his seven and a half years in solitary confinement at San Quentin that George Jackson wrote, “The ultimate expression of law is not order — it's prison.” Jackson understood that solitary confinement was not merely punishment for rule infractions, but a deliberate strategy to break the will of those who possessed the audacity to challenge an inherently unjust system. His words echo through the RHU (Restrictive Housing Unit) cells where I have watched brilliant minds deteriorate, where individuals who dared to educate themselves and others about their conditions are buried alive for years, sometimes decades.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

What George Jackson identified decades ago has only been perfected and expanded in our time. The conditions that created the necessity for Black August — the systematic dehumanization of Black bodies, the use of isolation as a tool of control, the denial of basic human dignity — have not only persisted but have been refined into a science of suffering that would make the architects of chattel slavery proud. Angela Davis, who spent months in solitary confinement before her 1972 acquittal, observed that “the prison has become a black hole into which the detritus of contemporary capitalism is deposited.” Nowhere is this more evident than in the modern solitary confinement units that house a disproportionate number of Black and Brown bodies.

The language may have changed, but the violence remains identical in its purpose and effect. The same racist logic that justified the slave plantation now justifies the concrete plantation, where isolation is sold as “administrative segregation” and psychological torture is rebranded as “protective custody.” I have witnessed adults who entered these units as teenagers emerge as broken shells of themselves, their minds fractured by years of sensory deprivation and social isolation. The continuity between the violence of slavery and the violence of solitary confinement is not metaphorical — it is literal, measurable, and intentional, designed to produce the same result: a population so traumatized and demoralized that resistance becomes unthinkable.

But the spirit that George Jackson embodied refuses to be crushed, no matter how sophisticated the machinery of oppression becomes. Resistance persists, because as Assata Shakur wrote, “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” These words, written from her own experience with solitary confinement, remind us that Black August is not merely a month of mourning, but a month of mobilization.

Within these walls, we honor Black August by refusing to allow the state to divide us, by sharing resources and knowledge, by maintaining our humanity in the face of systematic dehumanization.

Our commemoration of Black August transforms these spaces of intended destruction into laboratories of liberation. Within these walls, we honor Black August by refusing to allow the state to divide us, by sharing resources and knowledge, by maintaining our humanity in the face of systematic dehumanization. We fast to remember those who died fighting for our freedom, we study to understand the connections between past and present struggles, and we organize to ensure that their deaths were not in vain.

The very existence of our organized remembrance exposes the lie that this system tells about itself. The continuation of Black August observances terrifies those in power because it connects the dots between historical resistance and contemporary struggle, revealing that the same forces that murdered Fred Hampton and tortured George Jackson are still operating under different names and newer technologies. The current administration's escalation of repressive measures within the prison system — from the expansion of solitary confinement to the censorship of books and correspondence — demonstrates exactly why Black August must not be forgotten.

Those who hold the keys to these cages understand exactly what they fear losing. Prison officials understand that knowledge is power, and they particularly fear the power that comes from understanding our history of resistance. They know that when we remember Jonathan Jackson's courage, George Jackson's intellectual development despite isolation, and the countless others who chose death over submission, we are less likely to accept our current conditions as inevitable. The state's investment in forgetting is matched only by our investment in remembering, because memory is the foundation of resistance, and resistance is the foundation of freedom.

Now, as the walls that confine our bodies bear witness to the unbreakable nature of our spirits, I issue this call. From these cells where the echoes of George Jackson's footsteps still resonate, I call upon everyone who believes in human dignity, in the right to education, in the possibility of transformation, to remember Black August not as ancient history but as present reality. The conditions that created the need for Black August — racist policing, unjust sentencing, brutal prison conditions, and the use of solitary confinement as torture — persist today, which means our obligation to remember and resist persists as well.

The choice before us is simple: become accomplices to our own destruction through silence, or become architects of our liberation through action. We must remember — because forgetting is complicity, because silence is violence, and because the same system that murdered our ancestors will continue to murder our descendants until we find the courage to tear it down and build something worthy of our humanity.

The judge sided with plaintiffs who said the Everglades detention camp was significantly damaging the ecosystem.

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the shutdown of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” immigrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, leading to cheers from local environmental advocates.

The ruling by Judge Kathleen Williams of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida sided with the plaintiffs that the facility was doing significant damage to the ecosystem of the Everglades. Williams noted the fragile wetlands have been protected from big developments for decades after a proposed commercial airport in the area was rejected in the 1960s.

“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Williams gave the state of Florida 60 days to shut down the site. In that time, she ordered all construction at the facility to be halted and for there to be no further increase in the number of detainees currently being held there.

Though an appeal is almost certain, environmental advocates who brought the lawsuit against the facility took a victory lap in the wake of Williams's ruling.

Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, hailed the decision as a “landmark victory” that “sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”

Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the injunction issued by Williams was “a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades.”

“This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks,” Bennett added. “The judge's order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”

Tania Galloni, managing attorney for the Florida office of Earthjustice, said the judge's decision showed “the government can't just build something in the middle of the Everglades and the Big Cypress preserve with no environmental review, and no public input,” and added that “this is why we have environmental laws — to protect the wetlands and ecosystems we all depend on from illegal development.”

Williams's ruling came just two weeks after she ordered a temporary halt to all construction at the facility, which was first announced earlier this summer when Republican Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier unveiled a plan to renovate the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport and transform it into a mass detention center for immigrants.

The center has drawn criticism from human rights groups as well as from Democrats who visited the facility last month. Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), one of the lawmakers to visit the facility, said afterward that “what I saw made my heart sink,” referring to the conditions where detainees are being held.

DMYTRO KULEBA was Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine from 2020 to 2024.

 Dmytro Kuleba

For almost everyone involved, the diplomacy around ending the war in Ukraine seems to be an exercise in faking it till they make it. Russian President Vladimir Putin is pretending he wants peace. U.S. President Donald Trump is riding along with him, pretending (or perhaps truly thinking) that Putin is sincere. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pretending he believes Trump, as are leaders in Europe. The summits in Alaska and Washington reflected this, generating lots of noise without any breakthroughs. Call it the fog of diplomacy.

Still, it would be a mistake to say the gatherings accomplished nothing. In fact, every leader in attendance walked away with some sort of achievement. By traveling to Alaska, Putin placated Trump, who was growing exasperated with the Russian leader, and lived out his long-held fantasy of meeting with a U.S. president and carving up part of Europe. Trump, meanwhile, used the Alaska meeting to free himself from domestic pressure to impose harsh sanctions on Russian oil or to take other forceful measures. In Washington, Ukraine and Europe received promises that Trump would continue selling arms to Ukraine and demonstrated that they have seats at the negotiating table. Trump, for his part, reassured critics that he was not cutting a deal with Putin behind the backs of his NATO allies.

But although the summits mark a departure from Trump's early strategy—when Ukraine and Europe received only sticks, and Russia only carrots—the president is mercurial. He has repeatedly expressed admiration for powerful dictatorships and endorsed the idea that, in international relations, strong countries should do as they like. Trump doesn't even think he needs to listen to Putin, although Russia's president also believes that the weak must submit to the will of the great. As the talks continue, Trump could flip back to threatening Kyiv and Europe.

But no matter how many times Putin and Trump speak, and no matter what they do, Ukrainians are strong enough to avoid having their future dictated to them. Kyiv is not opposed to a negotiated settlement, as Trump occasionally suggests. But unless it is abandoned by Europe and experiences a domestic collapse, Ukraine will not surrender. To become a great peacemaker, Trump will thus have to better understand what Kyiv requires before the country puts down its weapons.

After years of broken promises by Moscow, Kyiv is not going to sign on to a peace deal it does not think will last. Trump seems to comprehend at least this much and has thus expressed openness to playing a role in providing so-called security guarantees for Ukraine. He even hinted that Washington could help offer “NATO-like” protections for the state.

But when it comes to security guarantees, the devil is in the details. And there should be no delusions: the distance between NATO itself and “NATO-like” protections is vast. Today, at least, Ukraine's partners are extremely unlikely to fight on behalf of Kyiv (as they would if a NATO country were attacked). All they can really provide, then, is more weapons, continuity of supply, and membership in the European Union. In other words, the best they can do is not deprive Ukraine of what it is already getting.

EU admission is particularly crucial, as it would make Ukraine a full-fledged member of the West. To arm Ukraine without bringing it into the EU would mean preserving Putin's hope of one day dragging it back into his sphere of influence. Europe, of course, is mostly responsible for Kyiv's accession. But Washington is also essential to the process. Trump may be the only person capable of swaying Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is friendly with Putin, to stop blocking the body from advancing Ukraine's integration.

As part of any talks, Putin will try to prevent Ukraine from receiving meaningful security assurances. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for instance, has already made the absurd demand that Russia be part of Ukraine's security arrangements. To do so, he invoked the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which London, Moscow, and Washington all agreed to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and protect it from attacks in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons. Ukrainians will never accept a redux of that deal. Yet by putting forward this proposal, Moscow has given itself vast room for maneuver and endless discussions.

The next issue facing negotiators is about the mechanics of stopping the conflict. At first, the U.S. proposed a temporary cease-fire. Ukraine and its European partners agreed. Putin, however, called for going straight to a permanent peace deal. The U.S. president is fascinated by the idea of a complete end to the war—a truly big and beautiful achievement—and so it is no surprise that, after meeting with Putin, he adopted Russia's stance.

But Moscow's proposal is a trap. Bringing the war to a full conclusion requires far more time and concessions than does arranging a cease-fire. More time, however, is exactly what Putin is after. Every week absorbed by choreography and communiqués is a week in which Russian forces seize more Ukrainian territory and kill more civilians. Continued talks would also stave off American decisions that could hurt the Kremlin—such as tougher secondary sanctions on Russian oil businesses.

Putin's talk of addressing “the root causes of the conflict” is also a stalling tactic. The Kremlin likes to say the root cause is Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO. But as Putin has made clear time and again, the real root cause is Ukraine's very existence. “All of Ukraine is ours,” Putin said in June—a sentiment he has repeatedly expressed since the war began. To end the conflict, Putin will have to change his tune and accept Ukraine as a sovereign EU nation capable of defending itself. Trump will have to accept Ukraine's right to sovereignty as an indispensable element of the deal, changing Moscow's approach by using coercion and encouragement.



If Russia is willing to accept Ukraine's independence, there are ways the two states can strike some sort of bargain. Consider, for example, the issue of the land Moscow demands. There is a workable interim approach to this seemingly intractable problem: leave its status in a gray zone that allows both sides to claim it as theirs. This kind of understanding has worked well elsewhere. Beijing and Taipei, for example, have avoided a war over Taiwan by both claiming they are the rightful government of all of China, which lets the former maintain that the island and the mainland remain one.

But they did not adopt this formulation on their own. It was introduced by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. And it has endured for more than 50 years because the United States consistently strengthens Taiwan and compels China to postpone a final settlement. For a similar deal to work in eastern Europe, Washington would need to do the same with Ukraine and Russia, respectively.

Instead, Trump has regrettably adopted Putin's talk of a “land swap” in which Ukraine would formally cede territory to the Kremlin. It is the equivalent of asking someone whose car and bicycle were just stolen to strike a deal with their robber in which the thief returns the bicycle if the victim agrees to give up on trying to recover the car. For Ukrainians, this is completely unacceptable, just as it would be for any other nation. It is against the country's laws, and even if it weren't, such an agreement would prompt mass domestic unrest, toppling whatever government signed it and throwing Ukraine into chaos. The sooner the phrase “land swap” is excluded from Trump's vocabulary, the better for Washington's peacemaking efforts.

In pursuit of a grand bargain, Trump has proposed a summit with both Putin and Zelensky. Such a meeting would be a significant event. It would not guarantee the end of the war, but it would be difficult for the two leaders to walk away without at least coming up with some sort of steps toward an agreement.

Zelensky is aware that a summit with Putin could help hasten a deal. As a result, he has endorsed direct talks with Putin since 2022. The Kremlin, however, has not signed on. When asked about Trump's proposal, Putin's aides have demurred, claiming that any summit with Zelensky would need to be “gradually” prepared. If Putin avoids a meeting under various pretexts, it will be yet more confirmation that he is merely stalling for time, holding Trump back from decisive action while driving a wedge between Trump and Europe's leaders.

No one should be surprised by such an outcome. Russia's president is a master at creating grinding negotiations. Even if fully launched, talks between Kyiv and Moscow could drag on forever. As a Soviet Cold War–era joke once put it: “There will be no war, but the struggle for peace will leave not a single stone standing.”

The war, then, will likely rage on. Russia's motivations have not changed, and it still has the strength to attack, although its widely advertised summer offensive did not produce significant gains. Ukraine still has the capacity to fight back, and it will not lay down its arms until it can be sure its independence is properly safeguarded.

Europe is helping the country by increasing military aid, although it must pick up the pace. But on the whole, the world is not yet giving Kyiv the support it needs to contemplate a deal. Diplomats can profess that they are making progress. Yet no statement, summit, or social media post can substitute for actually understanding Ukraine's demands—and creating a strategy that meets them.

Live Updates


• Search at Bolton's home: The FBI conducted a court-authorized search this morning at the home of John Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump told reporters he knows “nothing” about the probe but expects to be briefed later today.
    


• Redistricting efforts: The Texas Senate is poised to pass a Republican-drawn congressional map today that would create five more GOP-leaning House districts, a move backed by Trump. And in California, lawmakers passed three bills to temporarily redraw their state's congressional maps — a counterpunch to efforts in GOP-led states.
    


• Trump eyes expanded crackdown: The president said yesterday he would expand the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown he ordered in Washington, DC, this month to other jurisdictions.
    


            Vice President JD Vance deflected when asked today if the FBI search of John Bolton's home and office was retribution for his criticism of President Donald Trump's foreign policy knowledge, saying in part that the media and Americans should “let the investigation unfold.”
    


            “I suspect that if the media and the American people let this case actually unfold, if they let the investigation unfold, as it's currently doing, they're going to find out that what we're doing is being very deliberate and being very driven by the national interest, and by the law here and that's as it should be,” Vance said in an interview on NBC for “Meet the Press.”
    


            The vice president also emphasized that the investigation is in the “very early stages” and that the administration will let the “investigation proceed.”
    


                    “We're in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed,” Vance said.
                





            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area this morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. Some of the agents took bags out of the vehicles to bring inside, but nothing was seen coming out of the residence.
    


            President Donald Trump was asked earlier this morning about the FBI search of his former national security adviser John Bolton's home.
    


            The president said he knows “nothing about it” and he expects to be briefed later on.
    


Here's what else he said:

            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced he's lifting retaliatory tariffs that were placed on an extensive list of American goods earlier this year. The move is set to take effect September 1.
    


            The tariffs he's dropping include those on goods that comply with the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Carney said. Carney, however, is not removing the 25% tariff placed on American steel and aluminum, as well as tariffs on American cars.
    


            Carney said Trump specifically told him that removing these tariffs would kick-start trade negotiations. Carney sought to establish throughout a news conference that he's not capitulating to Trump by removing tariffs but rather was “matching” the US, which hasn't charged duties on Canadian goods that comply with USMCA.
    


More context: Canada is America's top export market and has been one of the only countries so far to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods. The move to lift tariffs could boost the American economy if businesses import more from the United States as a result.
    


            It comes after Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke yesterday.
    


            Carney said he and Trump agreed to “intensify our discussions to address current trade challenges in those strategic sectors and to seize major immediate opportunities for us both in trade, investment and security.”
    


            Today's move was viewed as a goodwill gesture by the White House.
    


                    “We welcome this move by Canada, which is long overdue,” a White House official told CNN.
                





            The official added: “We look forward to continuing our discussions with Canada on the Administration's trade and national security concerns.”
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo contributed reporting. 



This post has been updated with the latest from Carney's announcement. 



            President Donald Trump is planning to announce this afternoon that the 2026 World Cup draw will occur at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 5, according to a senior White House official.
    


            The World Cup draw is typically in December ahead of the quadrennial tournament and will spell out all the matchups for the group stages for the month-long showcase. This year's World Cup features more teams than ever before as FIFA expanded the tournament to 48 teams for the first time.
    


Why this matters: With the draw being held at the Kennedy Center, the nation's capital will finally have a role to play in next year's tournament. Though it's typical for a host nation's capital to be included as a host city, Washington was not selected as one of the host cities for the tournament.
    


            Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have developed a close relationship during his two terms in office and Infantino has frequently been spotted at the White House and accompanying the president at other events, including the trophy ceremony at the Club World Cup final earlier this summer.
    


            The Republican National Committee elected Florida state Sen. Joe Gruters as its new chair today at a committee meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, replacing outgoing chairman Michael Whatley, who is running for US Senate in North Carolina.
    


            “Thank you all so much, now the party's in great hands moving forward — the skies are clear,” Gruters joked. “No, I love the chairman, what an incredible honor.”
    


            Gruters, who previously served as the RNC's treasurer, ran unopposed, with the backing of President Donald Trump making his election a formality.
    


            Trump gave Gruters his “Complete and Total Endorsement” in a social media post earlier this month, calling him a “MAGA Warrior.”
    


More background: Gruters succeeds Whatley, who took the helm of the national party in 2024 following former RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's exit amid tensions with Trump. After announcing his departure, Whatley had also touted Gruters' status as an ally to the president.
    


            The new chair takes over an RNC with an exceptionally strong balance sheet, having amassed more than $80 million in cash on hand — more than five times its Democratic counterpart.
    


A story to watch: Tension between Gruters and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over state politics has emerged as a key subplot in the state senator's elevation to RNC chair.
    


            DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could now find himself running in a future presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned.

            President Donald Trump declared today that his takeover of DC law enforcement had caused a public safety “miracle” unseen in recent memory: the nation's capital going a week without a single homicide.
    


            But publicly released data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that the district previously had multiple stretches of one week or longer without any homicides earlier this year.
    


            “DC was a hellhole, and now it's safe,” Trump told reporters this morning. “I hate to say this, because it doesn't sound very good, but there have been no murders in DC in the last week; that's the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week.”
    


By the numbers: It's correct that there have been no murders in DC over the last week, according to preliminary crime data published on the MPD's crime database as of this morning. Two murders have taken place since Trump signed his executive order wresting control of the police department: one in the evening of August 11, the same day the order was signed, and another on August 13.
    


            A week without homicides is not as rare as Trump claimed, however. There were no murders reported from May 4 through May 11, April 11 to 17, and a more than two-week-long period from February 25 through March 12.
    


            There have been a total of 89 homicides so far in 2025, according to the district's data.
    


            In some cases, murders are confirmed and added into the public MPD database weeks or months after they occur, so it's possible that additional cases will be added.
    


            A separate federal magistrate authorized the search of former national security adviser John Bolton's office in DC, a source familiar with the matter told CNN's Kristen Holmes.
    


            The search of the office came after FBI agents began searching Bolton's home in suburban Maryland as part of a resumed investigation into the possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
    


            Law enforcement personnel had waited outside for permission to conduct the office search, the source said.
    


            President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit this morning to “The People's House: A White House Experience” exhibit, a White House Historical Association-sponsored museum located across the street from the White House that includes miniature replicas of the home's historic rooms and a life-size Oval Office.
    


            The visit comes after CNN reported that tours to the real White House have been temporarily halted as construction is expected to begin next month on a sweeping, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition to the White House spearheaded by Trump.
    


            Trump's ballroom is expected to expand out beyond the site of the current East Wing, which is home to the Office of the First Lady, the Military Office, the Visitors Office and the Office of Legislative Affairs.
    


            Officials from the White House, US Secret Service, National Park Service and Executive Residence staff are currently assessing how to move the tour screening process and likely truncate the tour while still capturing the essence of a White House visit during the construction.
    


            White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin hosted Trump at the exhibit earlier today, where Trump was spotted perusing the gift shop.
    


            “We have this wonderful People's House gallery, so that while the White House is closed for tours for this wonderful ballroom to be built, we have this 33,000-square-foot experience open seven days a week, free to the public. So until that's built and reopened, we're happy to welcome everyone here,” McLaurin said.
    


            The FBI is searching John Bolton's DC office, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles outside Bolton's office building in downtown Washington this morning. The search is now underway, the source said.
    


            As the FBI conducts searches of John Bolton's home and office, here's a bit about him:
    


            Bolton served as the US ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 and as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, when President Donald Trump fired him, saying he “strongly disagreed with many” of Bolton's positions.
    


            Within hours of taking office this January, Trump terminated the Secret Service detail, which was assigned to Bolton due to threats against him from Iran.
    


            Bolton published a book in 2020 in which he claimed the president was woefully under informed on matters of foreign policy, obsessed with shaping his media legacy, and that Trump asked the leaders of Ukraine and China to help him win the 2020 election.
    


            Bolton is also a frequent commentator on CNN. Here's what he discussed with CNN's Brianna Keilar last night concerning Trump's rhetoric on the Russia-Ukraine war:
    


            CNN's Kaitlan Collins contributed reporting.
    


            President Donald Trump referred to himself as the “chief law enforcement officer” today when addressing the FBI search at John Bolton's home and said he expects the Justice Department to brief him later.
    


            “They'll brief me probably today sometime,” Trump said of the DOJ search at the home of his former national security adviser. But he also tried to stress his independence from the department.
    


            The president said he tells Attorney General Pam Bondi and the DOJ, “I don't want to know, but just, you have to do what you have to do.”
    


                    “I don't want to know about it. It's not necessary. I could know about it. I could be the one starting, and I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump added.
                





Keep in mind: The attorney general is traditionally referred to as the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government, including on the Justice Department website and on the White House's official webpage during the president's first term.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters today he will speak to China President Xi Jinping “at the right time” about TikTok, as Trump has repeatedly pushed off a deadline for the app's parent company to either divest or face a US ban.
    


            “I haven't spoken to President Xi about it. At the right time, when we're set, I'll do it. In the meantime, until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer,” the president told reporters.
    


            Trump said he thought concerns about the app's privacy and national security were “highly overrated.” The White House launched their own account on the platform earlier this week.
    


                    “I'm a fan of TikTok. My kids like TikTok,” the president said. “Young people love TikTok. If we can keep it going, good. We're going to watch the security concerns. And we have buyers, American buyers.”
                





More on TikTok: Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline of a sale-or-ban law passed under former President Joe Biden's administration, with the new deadline less than a month away on September 17.
    


            The latest delay in June kept the app accessible for its 170 million American users, despite legislation that passed last year due to bipartisan concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk. Both the United States and China are seeking leverage in ongoing tense trade talks.
    


CNN's Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. 



            One week after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump was noncommittal on his ability to arrange a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin, saying that the two are “like oil and vinegar.”
    


                    “They don't get along too well, for obvious reasons, but we'll see,” Trump said. “And then we'll see whether or not I would have to be there.”
                





            The president's remarks came after Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier today that there were no plans for a meeting between the two leaders.
    


            Trump said earlier this week that Putin and Zelensky would meet as part of his push to end the Russia-Ukraine war. But those plans have yet to materialize, and the US has made little apparent progress in convincing the two sides to hold direct talks.
    


            President Donald Trump just made remarks to reporters, saying that he knows “nothing” about the FBI search at his former national security adviser John Bolton's home.
    


            “I know nothing about it, I just saw it this morning, they did a raid,” Trump told reporters.
    


                    “He's a real sort of a low life,” Trump added. “When I hired him, he served a good purpose, because, as you know, he was one of the people that forced (former President George W.) Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East. Bolton, he wants to always kill people, and he's very bad at what he does, but he worked out great for me.”
                





            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area earlier. The FBI had also planned to search Bolton's office this morning, according to a source familiar with the investigation, though it was unclear when that search would be conducted.
    


            The FBI is also investigating whether former national security adviser John Bolton disclosed classified information outside of his 2020 book, potentially to clients or media members, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Investigators are focused on the book, but are also exploring other possible leaks as a form of “weaponization,” the source said.
    


Some context: The search of former national security adviser John Bolton's home stems from a now-resumed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, the source said.
    


            President Donald Trump had previously threatened to jail Bolton over the book, and the Justice Department launched an investigation into possible mishandling of classified information. But that probe was closed and a related lawsuit was dropped in 2021, when the department was under President Joe Biden.
    


            The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval.

            The FBI probe is related to the possible retention of national security information, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
    


            John Bolton last served in government in 2019 when President Donald Trump fired him during his first administration. He then became the subject of a yearlong investigation after Trump accused him of disclosing classified information in a 2020 book.
    


            It's not clear whether the current probe is related to the same book dispute or involves other material.

            The FBI conducted a court-authorized search at former national security adviser John Bolton's home and office as part of a renewed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, according to two people familiar with the matter.
    


            The investigative step immediately drew criticism that Trump was using the muscle of the US government to target a political foe, though the specific basis for the searches was not clear.
    


            Bolton served as President Donald Trump's national security adviser in his first term 2019, but the president fired him and the two have been at odds ever since. Trump had previously threatened to jail for Bolton over the 2020 book, which was critical of Trump's foreign policy knowledge, and the Justice Department investigated him in Trump's first-term. That probe was closed under President Joe Biden.
    


            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area on Friday morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. Some of the agents took bags out of the vehicles to bring inside, but nothing was seen coming out of the residence.
    


            The FBI also was searching Bolton's office on Friday morning, according to a source. CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles the building in downtown Washington.
    


            While the searches stemmed from the Justice Department reopening the years-old investigation involving the book, investigators are also exploring other possible leaks as a form of “weaponization,” a source said.
    


            Asked about the search on Friday, Trump told reporters he knew “nothing about it.” He added that he expected the Justice Department to brief him likely later in the day and suggested he had the power to initiate law enforcement moves.
    


            But Vice President JD Vance later said in an interview for Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that “classified documents are certainly part of it, but I think that there's a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton.”
    


            Vance denied that the search was politically motivated, characterizing it as part of an evidence-gathering operation “driven by the law and not by politics.”
    


            “If they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law,” he said. “We're going to be deliberate about that, because we don't think that we should throw people — even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically — you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison.”
    


            Reached by CNN earlier on Friday, Bolton said he was unaware of the FBI activity and was looking into it further. His attorney didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
    


            The search at Bolton's house was first reported by the New York Post. The FBI declined to comment on it.
    


            “I don't want to know about it. It's not necessary. I could know about it. I could be the one starting it, and I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” he said.
    


            He also took aim at Bolton, calling him a “low life.”
    


            “When I hired him, he served a good purpose, because, as you know, he was one of the people that forced Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East. Bolton, he wants to always kill people, and he's very bad at what he does, but he worked out great for me,” Trump said.
    


            Trump has repeatedly gone after his former national security adviser while in office, including most recently saying this month that the media was “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.”
    


            The president also terminated Bolton's Secret Service detail within hours of starting his second term in January.
    


            During his first term, the president threatened to jail Bolton after his 2020 book, “The Room Where It Happened,” claimed Trump was woefully under-informed on matters of foreign policy and obsessed with shaping his media legacy. The book also reported that Trump asked the leaders of Ukraine and China to help him win the 2020 election.
    


            The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval.
    


‘Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won': Bolton reacts to Alaska summit



            The Justice Department investigated Bolton over the possibility that he “unlawfully disclosed classified information” in his memoir, though officials under former President Joe Biden closed the investigation and dropped a related lawsuit in 2021 connected to the publication of the book.
    


            Trump and his government have carried out a campaign of retribution in recent months against a wide swath of the president's perceived political enemies, ranging from former Trump officials to members of Congress to the prosecutors who brought cases against the president while he was out of office.
    


            Last week, FBI Director Kash Patel declassified and released internal FBI interview notes from a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who first accused former Rep. Adam Schiff in 2017 of directing illegal leaks of classified information about Trump and Russia, in an escalation of Trump's long-standing feud with Schiff.
    


            The Justice Department also opened a grand jury investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James this month over the civil actions she brought against Trump and the National Rifle Association.
    


            The public nature of the FBI search on Friday at Bolton's house – with agents wearing prominently identifiable “FBI” jackets while entering and exiting the house throughout the morning and key officials appearing to telegraph it on social media – has already led neighbors and friends of Bolton to say the search may be related to political retribution.
    


            Top FBI officials posted on social media Friday morning just after 7 am. FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X, “NO ONE is above the law … @FBI agents on mission.” The FBI's co-deputy director Dan Bongino posted, “Public corruption will not be tolerated.”
    


﻿Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi also reposted Patel's comment, with Bondi adding, “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”
    


            If the officials are cryptically referring to Bolton, it would be a notable departure of the Bureau's practice of not commenting publicly on investigations, especially as FBI agents are still at the scene.
    


            For instance, the hours-long FBI search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago for classified records in 2022 was conducted with officials in plain clothes, and with the public largely unaware of the search until it was nearly concluded. Patel has since called the Mar-a-Lago search a “total weaponization and politicization by the FBI and DOJ.”
    


            Trump was indicted by a grand jury for mishandling several national security documents he retained after his first term in office, keeping boxes of classified records in a bathroom, a ballroom and other rooms at his Florida resort, until a Florida-based judge dismissed the case in 2024.
    


            Bolton, a longtime conservative who had previously served in the Reagan and both Bush administrations, has been a political foe of Trump's since he left the White House in the first term.

            At least ten cities in states whose Republican governors are deploying National Guard troops to Washington, DC, had higher rates of violent crime or homicide than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI data.
    


            Governors from Ohio, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia announced this week that they're sending troops to assist President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. Violent crime was already falling in DC, though it still ranks 17th among major cities.
    


            In the past week, Trump federalized DC's police force, surged federal law enforcement agents into the city, and deployed the DC National Guard.
    


            Military officials said there were nearly 2,000 soldiers and airmen mobilized in DC as of Thursday afternoon. Governors from the six states previously said they're contributing about 1,000 troops. And yet, their home states have cities with worse crime rates than DC – like Cleveland, Nashville, and Jackson, Mississippi, which was No. 1 in homicides per capita last year.
    


            DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said she wants “to make the most of the additional officer support that we have… to drive down crime.” And DC police chief Pamela Smith said, “We have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better.”
    


            Still, many Trump critics – including Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists and criminal justice advocates – have blasted his federal takeover of DC. And they've pointed out that some of the states sending National Guard troops have their own crime challenges.
    


            “It speaks to their lack of genuineness,” said Rena Karefa-Johnson, a vice president at FWD.us, a DC-based national criminal justice reform group. “Public safety is being used – as it often is – as a pretext to attack, target and terrorize specific communities. I don't think any of this really makes any communities safer.”
    


            Sen. Thom Tillis, a retiring North Carolina Republican, said in a CBS News interview that GOP governors were “100%” deploying troops to please Trump.
    


            “DC has a crime problem … do we honestly think DC has the worst crime problem in the United States? No,” Tillis said, flagging red-state cities with higher crime rates like Memphis, and criticizing Trump's federal “micromanaging.”
    


            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he was sending 150 military police from the Ohio National Guard to DC after a getting request from the secretary of the Army.
    


            Cleveland had the 2nd-highest overall crime rate last year among US cities with more than 250,000 people, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics from 2024. DC was tenth for overall crime and 17th for violent crime in 2024.
    


            When it comes to violent crime specifically – which the FBI defines as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault – two additional Ohio cities had higher rates than DC last year: Toledo and Dayton.
    


Trump says law enforcement crackdown will ‘go on to other places' during appearance at police facility in DC



            “We need those troops here because of what we're going through,” said Walter Patton, founder of Ghetto Therapy, which connects residents from some of Cleveland's poorest communities with free mental health services.
    


            A fourth-generation Cleveland resident, Patton lives in Outhwaite Homes public housing and said more resources are needed to keep people safe. This year, Patton noted, the Trump administration canceled a $2 million federal grant for an anti-gang organization that his group partners with in the city.
    


            “We had 13 homicides in my front yard in 2020,” Patton told CNN. “We're losing the focus on crime in Ohio because of DC's issues. My heart goes out to DC. But DC should be focused on DC, and Ohio should focus on Ohio.”
    


            A spokesman from DeWine's office told CNN in an email that “Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance,” including requests from Democratic officials.
    


            The spokesman, Dan Tierney, also said the cities of Cleveland, Toledo and Dayton had all previously requested and received assistance from the Ohio State Highway Patrol “to assist with resource surges to address rising crime.”
    


            Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee confirmed Tuesday that he was sending about 160 members of the state's National Guard to aid Trump's deployments in DC.
    


            Two cities in Tennessee with populations over 250,000 had higher violent crime rates than DC, according to a CNN review of FBI data. Memphis ranked 1st and Nashville was 12th on the list, five spots ahead of DC.
    


            “Washington, DC, is a creation of the Congress, and I believe it's within the president's constitutional purview,” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN's Dana Bash on Wednesday, adding that he doesn't believe any troops are needed in Memphis because “it's not a federally created environment.”
    


            Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment from CNN.
    


            Jeff Warren, a Democratic member of the Memphis City Council, criticized the decision to send Tennessee troops to DC. He conceded that parts of Memphis are dangerous, but said public safety was improving because of Biden-era grants for local anti-violence programs, which the Trump administration is slashing.
    


            “Putting a bunch of troops in the streets will stop violence for now, but it won't interrupt the cycle,” Warren said. “I'm more worried about them taking away all this money from violence intervention programs in major cities, just as these things have been gearing up and are starting to work.”
    


            Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Monday approved sending 135 troops to DC.
    


            Shreveport and Lafeyette are smaller cities, but they both had a higher violent crime rate than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics.
    


            Landry's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            “It's crazy,” Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, told CNN in an interview. “We are the incarceration capital of the country. We have so much work to do in our state. And it's hurricane season. The troops need to be here. Why not address the problems in Louisiana?”
    


Hurricane Erin moves away from the East Coast, but it remains a coastal threat



            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of Trump's moves, used this data in a recent interview to accuse Trump of authoritarianism.
    


            “He should start with Shreveport,” Newsom said. “What about the carnage, Mr. President, in Shreveport? Why aren't you protecting the folks there?”
    


In response, Shreveport's mayor said Newsom “doesn't know what he's talking about, and that we're in much better shape” than portrayed. The Shreveport police chief said, “California needs to worry about California.”
    


            Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves is also sending about 200 troops to DC.
    


            Jackson had the nation's highest homicide rate in 2024 for cities with at least 100,000 people, according to a CNN analysis of FBI statistics and local reports of police data. Last year, Jackson had about 77 homicides for every 100,000 residents, while DC only had about 27, according to the statistics.
    


            Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents parts of Jackson, said Reeves' deployment was a taxpayer-funded “political stunt” that pulls brave Mississippi troops “away from their homes, families, and critical missions.”
    


            Reeves' deputy chief of staff Cory Custer told CNN in an email that “it's wrong to imply that Mississippi cannot support President Trump's efforts to clean up Washington, D.C., while also working to keep Mississippians safe.”
    


            He said it was a “ridiculous premise” because Reeves signed legislation doubling the size of Mississippi Capitol Police and has presided over an estimated 43% drop in homicides in Jackson compared to this point last year.
    


            West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that, at the request of the Trump administration, he would be sending 300 to 400 “skilled personnel” from the state National Guard to help “restore cleanliness and safety” in DC.
    


            The two largest cities in West Virginia – Charleston and Huntington – each have only about 45,000 residents and are much smaller than DC, which has about 702,000 residents. But statistically, they both had a higher violent crime rate per capita than DC last year, according to CNN's review of FBI data.
    


            Morrisey's office did not respond to CNN's inquiries about the deployments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How one round of golf with Tiger Woods inspired Scottie Scheffler to become one of the most dominant athletes in the world","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/sport/golf-scottie-scheffler-tiger-woods-tour-championship","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:15:00 GMT","


            Every superhero has an origin story and Scottie Scheffler's narrative arc can be traced back to November 15, 2020 – a series of events that barely anybody noticed at the time.
    


            That was the day Scheffler and Tiger Woods played together in the Masters tournament: the first and only time that they've ever played together. Despite the fact Woods was defending champion, he was out of contention on the final day.
    


            It was the year of Covid, the tournament was being played in winter instead of the traditional spring, and the galleries were as barren as the Augusta trees, social distancing protocols had kept the patrons at bay. And yet, this was arguably the moment when the torch of greatness was handed from one American golf star to the next.
    


            Scheffler says that what transpired over those 18 holes changed his career. “I've only played one round of tournament golf with Tiger Woods,” he said this week at the Tour Championship in Atlanta, “and it completely changed the way I play tournaments.”
    


            With Ireland's Shane Lowry making up the threesome, the group was one of the first to tee off at 8:12 AM on that Sunday in 2020. At the time, Scheffler, who is now mentioned routinely in the same breath as the 15-time major winner, was still 15 months away from his first professional win.
    


            “I can't tell you,” he explained, “the look on his face when we got to the first green. We're in 20th place, kind of playing yada, yada, yada, and this guy is just locked in. I was taken aback, I was like, ‘Holy smokes, this guy is in it right now!'”
    


            Both men parred the opening hole, Scheffler then described Tiger's approach to the second: “He had this chip shot, and he looked at it like it was an up-and-down to win the tournament. I'm like, ‘This is incredible! I've never seen anything like this before in my life.'”
    


            Scheffler is now a four-time major winner and an Olympic gold medalist with a total of 18 PGA Tour wins to his name, although he's winning with such frequency these days that the number might have changed by the time you are reading this. He's been the world No. 1 player since May 2023 and he's the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2007 to win at least five tournaments in consecutive seasons.
    


            But on this particular day, he hadn't yet been able to convert any of his considerable promise into a trophy. “The question was always, ‘Hey, how come you haven't won?'” he said.
    


            “The reason I felt like I hadn't won yet is I hadn't put myself in position enough times and that's one of the things I learned from playing with Tiger. My biggest takeaway was the amount of intensity that he took to every shot, it was like the last shot he was ever going to hit.”
    


            Having both birdied the second hole at Augusta, Scheffler and Woods headed in different directions; Woods had dropped three strokes by the time they walked off the 11th green, Scheffler had made two bogeys but recovered with a birdie and what happened next is etched into his memory – Woods played the worst hole of his PGA Tour career.
    


            With his tee shot on 12, Woods found the water at Rae's Creek. He incurred a penalty stroke and ended up in the water again. Another penalty, and with now a fifth stroke, Woods made sure to avoid the Creek, sending his ball to the back of the green and into the bunker.
    


            From there, he thinned an awkward pitch out of the sand, over the green and back into the water. By now he was playing like a weekend hacker, his next shot from the bunker was his eighth and a subsequent two-putt resulted in his first double digit score on a PGA Tour hole, a 10. On a par-three hole, he'd dropped an incredible seven strokes for a disastrous septuple bogey.
    


            Woods' chances of a sixth green jacket were already remote, but now they were completely and utterly dashed. But that's not what Scheffler remembers.
    


            Many golfers would have gone into a tailspin after such a nightmare, not Tiger Woods. He immediately punched back with a birdie on 13. In fact, he finished his round with five birdies in his last six holes. With a ringside seat to an extraordinary recovery, Scheffler was taking notes.
    


            “It was like, ‘What's this guy still playing for?'” he wondered. “He's won the Masters four or five times, best finish he's going to have is like 20th at this point. I just admired the intensity that he brought to each round and that's something I try to emulate.”
    


            Scheffler has always been a strong iron player, and in recent years, he's dramatically improved his putting. But his secret sauce seems to be his ability to quickly recover from a setback; his biggest strength is mental.
    


            Scheffler has made fewer bogeys than anyone else on tour this season; he only fumbled four holes at The Open Championship at Royal Portrush, but he makes a habit of mitigating the damage with a birdie or eagle on the very next hole.
    


            At The Open, Scheffler's recovery rate was 50%. At the PGA Championship, it was an extraordinary 60%. He won both majors.
    


            Sports psychologist Dr Phil Hopley explained to CNN Sports how Scheffler makes something so difficult look so simple.
    


            “He stays focused in the present moment,” he said. “He lets go of what's happened and recognizes that the more time he spends thinking about things that haven't gone well, the more potentially nervous, anxious, fearful or negative he's going to feel.
    


            “If you're still simmering, even small things like a minor increase in the tension in your forearms because you've released too much cortisol and adrenaline, is going to have a potentially disastrous effect on your swing pattern and your execution.”
    


            Scheffler witnessed first-hand how Tiger Woods was able to do it, and now it's become the foundation for his own dominant game. Just two years later, he won the first of his two Masters titles, and he's hardly stopped winning since. Even many of his rivals now admit that he's almost untouchable.
    


            “The things that I do on the golf course, other people can do,” Scheffler surmised. “I don't hit the ball the furthest. I think it's just the amount of consistency and the intensity that I bring to each round of golf, not taking shots off, not taking rounds off, not taking tournaments off. I'm here for a purpose and that's to complete hard on every shot.”
    


            Scheffler's prolific success has led to inevitable comparisons with Woods himself, which he dismisses as “very silly.”
    


            “I don't like comparisons to other players because I'm doing the best I can to be the best version of myself. He completely transcended the game. I think Tiger is a guy that stands alone in the game of golf, and I think he always will. Tiger inspired a whole generation of golfers. Watching what that guy did week in, week out, it was pretty amazing to see.”
    


            So, he doesn't want to be known as the next Tiger Woods, but he's pretty amazing himself, and as fans of the Marvel comics will tell you, there's always room for more than one superhero in the universe.

TORONTO (AP) — Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday. 

Carney said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. 

“Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it's different from what we had before, it's still better than that of any other country,” Carney said.

Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on the phone Thursday and Carney met with his Cabinet on Friday before making the announcment. 

The move is designed to reset trade talks between the two countries. The USMCA is up for review in 2026, and Carney called the trade pact a unique advantage for Canada at a time when it is clear that the U.S. is charging for access to its market.

Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs.

Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA. 

Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially put on retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs, but before the U.S. tariffs were applied the Trump administration exempted goods covered by the free trade deal.




Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the USMCA, but U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said, “I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.”

Preserving the free trade pact will be critical for Canada and Mexico. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico's exports go there.

Trump has announced some sector specific-tariffs that do apply for Canada despite the USMCA — known as 232 tariffs — which are having an impact on the Canadian economy. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, for example. 

“Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensivily to resolve the issues there,” Carney said. 

Carney previously rescinded Canada's plan to tax U.S. technology firms after Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over those plans, which he called “a direct and blatant attack on our country.”

The prime minister disputed any notion that Canada is appeasing Trump, noting that Canada is matching what the U.S. is doing. 

“The president and I had a long conversation,” Carney said. “There is a review of the free trade agreement in the spring. We're starting our preparations.”

Lana Payne, president of Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, characterized Carney's announcement as Canada backing down, and said the country shouldn't back down unless the U.S. drops all punitive tariffs. 

“Trump's attacks on auto, steel, aluminum, and forestry sectors are hurting Canadian workers in real time,” she posted on social media. “Walking back counter-tariffs isn't an olive branch. It only enables more U.S. aggression.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown to start carrying firearms, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed.

The step is an escalation in Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members have been stationed in the heavily Democratic city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, six states have sent troops to the city, growing the military presence.

It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control. 

Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications they have faced threats that would require weapons. 




Trump has boasted that the city is safer than ever because of his intervention. He told reporters Friday that “it's a miracle what's happened.”

“D.C. was a hell hole,” he said. “But now it's safe.”

He suggested that he could prolong the deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.

“The big question is how long do we stay?” he said. “Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.”

Trump noted that he would ask Congress for $2 billion to improve the appearance of the city, including resurfacing roads and replacing streetlights. He's previously pledged to improve the grass to look like one of his golf courses.

“It's going to be safe, and it's going to be beautified,” he said.

Trump's decision to seek more money for sprucing up Washington comes months after the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that essentially forced a $1.1 billion budget cut on the city. Local leaders have pleaded for a fix but to no avail. 

The Pentagon and the Army had said last week that troops would not carry guns. The new guidance is that they will carry their service-issued weapons.

Alex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary and assistant secretary for the Air Force during Democratic administrations, said asking troops to carry firearms is a “recipe for disaster.”

He said most National Guard members don't have the right training for Trump's law enforcement crackdown and are being put in a “no-win situation”

“Do they have any role that would require them to have firearms? No,” he said. 

However, Wagner said, if there are confrontations, “the White House can spin that to their political advantage.”

The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Spokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

John Bolton, whose home and office were searched by federal agents on Friday, has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump since serving as a national security adviser in Trump's first administration.

After serving in the White House, Bolton wrote a scathing book that portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy. FBI agents' searches of Bolton's Maryland home and Washington office, purportedly part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, raise the question of possible future actions against critics of the Republican president who have voiced their opinions.

Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, a person not authorized to discuss the investigation by name told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

Here's more information on Bolton, a Republican and foreign policy hawk: 

Bolton served as Trump's third national security adviser, appointed in 2018 after Trump dismissed H.R. McMaster. 

Bolton's 17-month tenure was rife with clashes over countries including North Korea and Iran, with him voicing skepticism over Trump's outreach toward and summit with Kim Jong Un. On Iran, Bolton backed Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but favored regime change and was frustrated when Trump called off a planned military strike in 2019.

Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton's departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton's resignation.

Bolton's 2020 book, “The Room Where It Happened,” painted an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid first-person account at the time of how Trump conducts himself in office. The 577-page book portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy, with Bolton writing that the president “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Bolton wrote that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week “and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.” 

On Ukraine, Bolton alleged that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country's willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, soon-to-be Trump's Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family. In one conversation, Trump said “he wasn't in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,” Bolton wrote.

Bolton also wrote that he felt “hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn't driven by re-election calculations,” noting how Trump “pleaded” with China's Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his reelection prospects.

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “washed-up guy” and a “crazy” war-monger who would have led the country into “World War Six.” Trump also said at the time that the book contained “highly classified information” and that Bolton “did not have approval” for publishing it.

The White House worked furiously to block the book, unsuccessfully asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order against its release.

In an interview that aired Wednesday on NPR, Bolton said little has changed in bringing an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, pointing to Trump's efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize as the president's motivation to end the conflict.

“There's no indication at all that Russia has in any way changed its objective, which is to bring Ukraine into the greater Russian Empire,” Bolton said. “Nor is there any real sign that Zelenskyy is prepared to do the sorts of things that Russia has demanded of President Trump, such as ceding a substantial part of the Donetsk Oblast or province, which the Russians have not yet been able to conquer militarily.”

On Thursday, Bolton posted to X that “Putin's KGB training and flattery campaign is working Trump over, as seen by Trump's statement recently about how Ukraine shouldn't have taken the war on. It's important to remember: Ukraine didn't take anything on, they were invaded.”

And in an Aug. 14 interview with CBS News, Bolton castigated Trump's decision prior to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, continuing that criticism following the meeting on X.

“In Alaska, President Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won,” Bolton posted. “Vladimir has his old friend Donald back.”

Trump has spent a career fixed on image, prizing striking looks and frequently boasting about family members and Cabinet officials who look like they “stepped out of central casting.”

Bolton's bushy mustache simply didn't fit the part.

During the transition period following his 2016 election, Trump reportedly ruled out choosing Bolton to serve as secretary of state in part because he disliked his signature bushy mustache. Following a meeting with Bolton at Trump Tower, Trump told confidants that the hawk's trademark mustache would never be a fit in his administration, although he kept an admiring eye on Bolton's frequent cable TV appearances, during which he often defended the policies of the president even when they ran counter to what he had preached for decades.

According to Bolton's 2019 book, however, the president told him that his facial hair “was never a factor” in appointing him to any position.

When George W. Bush became president, Bolton served as the State Department's point man on arms control, where he battled other governments on nuclear weapons tests, land mines, biological weapons, ballistic missile limits and the International Criminal Court. 

An unabashed proponent of American power and a strong supporter of the Iraq war, Bolton was unable to win Senate confirmation after his nomination to the U.N. post turned off many Democrats and even some Republicans. He resigned after serving 17 months as a Bush recess appointment, which allowed him to hold the job on a temporary basis without Senate confirmation.

Bolton also held positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration. 

In the run-up to the 2024 campaign, Bolton said he was motivated to run after Trump, still obsessing over his loss of the 2020 election, in 2022 called for the termination of the Constitution to reinstate him to power.

“A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump wrote on his social media site, though no evidence has emerged to support his claims.

Bolton called the comment “disqualifying” and cast a possible second Trump term as a threat to national security.

He had also considered running both in 2016 as well 2012, when he later endorsed and advised the eventual GOP nominee, now-Utah Sen. Mitt Romney.

The FBI is searching the Maryland home and Washington office of John Bolton, who served in President Donald Trump's first administration as national security adviser, as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

Bolton emerged as an outspoken critic of Trump after being fired in 2019 and feuded with the first Trump administration over a scathing book he wrote documenting his time in the White House.

He was not in custody Friday and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

The searches, seemingly the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, are likely to elicit fresh alarm that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to go after his foes. The searches of Bolton's home and office come as the Trump administration has taken steps to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorizing a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term.

Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.”

The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.”

He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor.

Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament.

Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit.

But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either.

Bare collars were also sported by Vice President JD Vance, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Kennedy Center interim head Richard Grenell and Andrew Giuliani, who is heading up the president's FIFA task force.

It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look.

The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C.

“I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. “And then we'll help with New York.”

Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.”

Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

The FBI on Friday searched the home and office of Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration, as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information.

Vance said in an interview with NBC News's “Meet the Press” that the investigation was in its early stages. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.”

He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.”

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA head Gianni Infantino, the president said the FIFA draw would take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

Trump has made the Kennedy Center a focal point for his efforts to remake Washington, visiting it earlier in the day and talking extensively about renovations to the building. He referred to it as the “Trump-Kennedy Center.”

ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights issued the finding against the public university in Virginia.

The department says the university must review its policies, conduct annual trainings and issue a statement that includes a personal apology from the president. It directs the university to comply within 10 days.University officials did not respond immediately to an email request for comment on Friday.

The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials.

President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress.

An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.

The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district's budget whole again. That bill has languished in the House of Representatives for months while Bowser was forced to make drastic moves to avoid layoffs. The hard feelings over the issue remain intense.

Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

“We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. Fixing floors that are cracked up and not good anymore, and in many cases, they were done in the 50s and 60s and 70s,” Trump told reporters Friday. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.”

He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.”

According to the White House, the refurbishing of the Lincoln Bedroom and the adjoining sitting room — which featured strong period decor derived and adapted from the historical evidence of the Lincoln era — was completed in November 2005.

Trump suggested the Lincoln Bathroom work could “be done in about a week, two weeks” and said he was considering “doing something on the Executive Office Building” across the street from the White House saying it'd be “all cosmetic.”

Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom.

“We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. “Congress is happy to do it.”

Trump has talked about refinishing the roads and sprucing up light poles around the capital.

“It hasn't been clean,” he said. “Now it's going to be clean.”

The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone.

A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. He had no opposition.

“Mr. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote.

Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president.

Trump has tightened his grip on the RNC since his first presidential term. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina.

The Texas Senate has gaveled in for a expected vote on new congressional voting maps for the 2026 midterm elections.

Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Senate approval would send the maps to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. California on Thursday passed a bill to put new Democratic-leaning districts to voters in November.

Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and legal adviser to Democrats during the president's first impeachment, says the search of Bolton's home and office is “an obvious act of intimidation.”

“Raiding the home of a high-profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government,” Eisen said in a joint statement with Susan Corke, executive director of the group Democracy Defenders Fund.

He contrasted the operation with the 2022 search on Trump's Florida estate when the president was investigated for keeping classified documents, saying the FBI unsuccessfully negotiated with Trump for a year before executing it.

The president said his crackdown was keeping people safe, claiming it's “the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week” in the nation's capital.

That's not true, however. There were no killings for one week in July and for another week in May, according to local police statistics.

And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The president called national security and privacy concerns related to TikTok and its Chinese parent company “highly overrated.”

“I used TikTok in the campaign,” Trump told reporters.

“I'm a fan of TikTok,” he said. “My kids like TikTok. Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.”

His comments follow the White House's decision to start a TikTok account this week.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has extended the platform's shutdown deadline repeatedly since taking office for his second term.

“We're gonna watch the security concerns,” Trump said, but added, “We have buyers, American-buyers,” and “until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.”

And, speaking about the Bolton raids, said he “could be the one starting it” if he chose.

The president, in his comments to reporters at the White House Historical Association, said he's told Attorney General Pam Bondi to “do what you have to do” and that he doesn't want to know about their work, but suggested he could be much more involved if he chose, saying, “I could know about it. I could be the one starting it.”

“I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer,” he said. “But I feel that it's better this way.”

“We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. It's like oil and vinegar a little bit. They don't get along too well for obvious reasons. But we'll see,” Trump told reporters. “And we'll see whether or not I would have to be there. I'd rather not, I'd rather them have a meeting and see how they can do.”

Trump has previously suggested that the White House is working to facilitate a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in the short term, and that a subsequent, trilateral meeting involving those two leaders and Trump would likely come next.

Fed Governor Lisa Cook is under fire from Trump after an administration official alleged Wednesday that she'd falsely claimed two homes as primary residences in 2021. Primary residences often receive lower mortgage rates than homes purchased for rent or as second homes.

“I'll fire her if she doesn't resign.” Trump said Friday. His comment came as Cook is attending the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with Chair Jerome Powell.

Trump has relentlessly demanded that the Fed cut its key interest rate, which he's said would reduce interest rate costs on the government's massive $37 trillion debt pile as well as boost the housing market.

If Trump is able to oust Cook, he could install a loyalist and extend greater control over the Fed, traditionally independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over a disagreement on rates, but can “for cause,” which typically means malfeasance or neglect of duty.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's crackdown will be armed, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't immediately offer any other details about the new development.

The president, making a stop that wasn't on his public schedule, arrived at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He told reporters at an earlier stop that he planned to show them marble that would be used in sprucing up the center, along with other planned renovations such as painting the columns from gold to white.

Trump has taken over the center by installing himself as chair and replacing the board of trustees with loyalists. He has also hinted he'd like to see the venue renamed the Trump/Kennedy Center.

President Donald Trump blasted his former national security adviser John Bolton, calling him “a lowlife” and “not a smart guy” but insisted he knows “nothing about” the FBI raids Friday morning of Bolton's home and office

The president, speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, said he saw the raid of Bolton's home on television Friday morning but he didn't know anything about it.

“He is a, not a smart guy. But he could be very a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”

He said he expected to be briefed later in the day about the search of Bolton's home and office.

“I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real, sort of, a lowlife,” he said.

The president made a surprise visit Friday morning to the White House Historical Association, which sits less than a block away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.

It wasn't clear what he was doing there and the visit wasn't on his official schedule.

Trump could be spotted on video posted on social media walking into the building with his chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.

In a high-profile speech that will be closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. That puts the Fed in a tough spot, because it would typically cut its short-term rate to boost hiring, while keeping it high — or raising it — to fight inflation.

“The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared remarks. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates, including at its next meeting Sept. 16-17.

Powell has come under relentless criticism from President Trump for not rapidly cutting rates sooner.

In an overnight social media post, Trump said he was considering “a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

He's already seized control of the local police department for 30 days, which could be extended with congressional approval.

Trump has claimed the city is in the midst of a crime crisis despite statistics showing a declining problem. The U.S. attorney in Washington has opened an investigation into the numbers, the latest pressure point in a tug of war between the administration and D.C. government.

“Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” the president wrote.

A few local police cars were stationed across the street from Bolton's house outside Washington as FBI agents passed in and out. The tan-and-brick structure is set back from a two-lane road on a leafy suburban street.

Reporters and curious neighbors gathered across the street, including a man who gave only his first name as David. He said it appears Bolton is being targeted because of his disagreement with the Trump, a “frightening” prospect.

The crowd grew to include prominent Trump critic George Conway as passing cars slowed near the scene. One driver shouted “shame on you!”

The plot was in presumed retaliation for a January 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed the country's most powerful general. Bolton had by then left the Trump administration but tweeted, “Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.”

In his book “The Room Where It Happened,” Bolton portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” war-monger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

The president is scheduled to make an “announcement” at noon ET in the Oval Office. It's unclear what it will be about.

This is the only event on Trump's public schedule.

Bolton faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government, “The Room Where it Happened,” that officials argued disclosed classified information.

The Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation.

Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book, which was published in 2020, after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, had said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

As the search was ongoing, Bolton could be seen standing inside in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests.

He was spotted by an Associated Press reporter who arrived at the building. Bolton left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building.

Longtime political adviser Roger Stone, who was prosecuted during the Russia investigation and later pardoned by Trump, was gleeful on social media.

“How does it feel to have your home raided at 6 o'clock in the morning?” he posted.

FBI Director Kash Patel, who in a 2023 book he wrote included Bolton in a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

That's according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

On his first day back in office this year, Trump, a Republican, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a trio of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.

During Trump's first term, Bolton served as the president's third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. The first Trump administration had unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of a Bolton book that it said contained classified information.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.

In the central area of Nuseirat, scores of people scuffled after a military cargo plane dropped dozens of containers of aid. In a scene of desperation and chaos, some of the boys tripped over each other, as men brandishing wooden sticks sought to clear the crowds.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel's defense minister warned Friday that Gaza's largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country's terms, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade.

A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war.

“The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza — until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,” Katz wrote in a post on X.

He restated Israel's ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament.

Famine now grips Gaza's largest city

Hamas issued a statement that called Katz's comments “a confession of committing a crime that amounts to ethnic cleansing.” The militant group has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but it rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It was not immediately clear if that meant Israel would return to long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the mediators.




With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.

Israel says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels, after several previous large-scale raids. The city is also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some of whom have fled from other areas, and it contains some of the territory's critical infrastructure and health facilities.

Israel could also accept the latest ceasefire proposal, which would forestall the offensive. The proposal calls for a phased deal involving hostage and prisoner exchanges and a pullback of Israeli troops, while talks continue on a longer-term cease-fire. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies.

Many Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Aid groups and international leaders warn that renewed fighting would worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis.

The logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. Many residents say repeated displacement is pointless since nowhere in Gaza is safe, while medical groups warn that Israel's call to move patients south is unworkable, with no facilities to receive them.

Netanyahu has argued that the offensive is the surest way to free captives and crush Hamas.

“These two things — defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages — go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command center in southern Israel.

Since 251 people were taken hostage more than 22 months ago, ceasefire agreements and other deals have accounted for the vast majority of the 148 who were released, including the bodies of eight dead hostages.

Israel has managed to rescue only eight hostages alive and to retrieve the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.

The world's leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.

A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It's the first famine confirmed by the IPC in the Middle East.

Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.”

Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it's not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May.

Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalated its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive.

An Israeli airstrike hit a school in Sheikh Radwan, a Gaza City neighborhood where tens of Palestinians shelter in makeshift tents in the schoolyard. The attack killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records.

The Israeli military said it wasn't aware of a strike in the area but in a statement said troops were operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the Zeitoun neighborhood.

The strike is part of Israel's ongoing push in Gaza City, where witnesses have reported intense bombardment in the days since Israel approved its plans to take the city.

Amal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense she couldn't sleep, yet she couldn't leave either.

“We do not have the money, the resources or the energy to evacuate again. I just wish for a quick death right where I am here because I am not going anywhere. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press.

The Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that at least 62,263 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Two more people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 273, including 112 children, the ministry said.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. The U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.

Hamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages.

Fox News' David Spunt provides details on the FBI raid at former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland as FBI Director Kash Patel tweets, 'NO ONE is above the law.'

The FBI launched a raid Friday morning into the home and office of John Bolton — President Donald Trump's national security advisor from 2018 and 2019 — months after Trump yanked Bolton's security clearance in January upon taking office. 

The two men have a long history of trading barbs following Bolton's exit from Trump's first administration — all of which escalated after Bolton sought to publish a memoir in 2020 that included some unflattering details about his time in the White House. 

While Trump has labeled Bolton a ""wacko"" and a ""dope,"" Bolton has had his fair share of harsh words for the president. 

""I don't think he's fit for office,"" Bolton said in an interview with ABC News in June 2020, ahead of his memoir's release. ""I don't think he has the competence to carry out the job.""

""There really isn't any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than what's good for Donald Trump's reelection,"" Bolton said at the time. ""I think he was so focused on the reelection that longer-term considerations fell by the wayside."" 

Bolton also characterized Trump as lacking focus on policy while being very fixated on himself — to the detriment of national security matters. 

""His policymaking is so incoherent, so unfocused, so unstructured, so wrapped around his own personal political fortunes, that mistakes are being made that will have grave consequences for the national security of the United States,"" Bolton also said in an ABC interview in June 2020. 

The first Trump administration sought to block the release of Bolton's memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,"" and asserted it contained classified material. 

The book alleged that Trump ""pleaded"" Chinese President Xi Jinping to support Trump's reelection campaign, and called the president ""stunningly uninformed.""

While the Justice Department attempted to prevent its publication on the grounds that the book disclosed classified matters pertaining to U.S. intelligence sources and methods, a federal judge signed off on the publication of the book, which ultimately was published June 23, 2020. 

Meanwhile, Trump discredited Bolton's assertions included in the book, and hurled his own insults back at Bolton. 

""Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction,"" Trump said in a social media post June 18, 2020. ""Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!""

""Wacko John Bolton's ‘exceedingly tedious'(New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him,"" Trump said in a separate social media post on June 18, 2020. ""A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized & happily dumped. What a dope!""

Bolton departed his post at the White House in September 2019. While Bolton said that he left due to his own volition, Trump claimed that he fired Bolton. 

Bolton was not arrested or taken into custody following the raid on his home and office Friday.

Trump told reporters Friday that he had no knowledge of the raid and learned about it watching TV. 

""He's a, not a smart guy,"" Trump said Friday. ""But he could be a very unpatriotic. I mean, we're going to find out. I know nothing about it. I just saw it this morning. They did a raid.""

‘Ruthless' podcast co-hosts discuss the response to President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Thursday's arrests in Washington, D.C. amid the Trump administration's federal crime crackdown included a suspected member of the brutal Salvadoran street gang MS-13.

""Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X on Friday morning. 

Thursday's arrests bring the total to 719 since President Donald Trump announced his effort to federalize the D.C. police on Aug. 11, according to Bondi. She thanked Trump for his ""unwavering support to make DC safe again!""

Approximately 800 National Guard troops have descended upon the city since the order, along with countless federal agents from the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), ICE and the DEA. 

On Aug. 15, Bondi said the total number of arrests was 189, meaning that over the past week, federal authorities have arrested 530 suspected criminals, an average of almost 76 per day.

The suspects have been charged with crimes including homicide, drug trafficking, possession of illegal firearms and child sex crimes. 

With mounting criminal cases in the nation's capital, the Trump administration said Thursday that it was deploying Judge Advocate General (JAG) attorneys, who are military lawyers, to prosecute misdemeanors.

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen to be armed in Washington, D.C. if their mission requires it, a U.S. official confirmed to FOX News. 

""At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our nation's capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,"" a U.S. defense official told FOX News.

The troops could start carrying weapons in the coming days, though they will not be able to make arrests. Additionally, they will still be under orders to temporarily detain people if needed before transferring them to law enforcement as soon as possible.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Trump administration's latest efforts to combat Latin American drug cartels on 'Special Report.'

A Navy sailor may face life in prison after a San Diego jury found him guilty of selling military secrets to China on Thursday. 

Prosecutors said Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei, 25, used his position as a machinist's mate on the amphibious assault ship USS Essex at Naval Base San Diego to collect sensitive information and offer it to a Chinese intelligence officer who recruited him in February 2022. Wei held a security clearance and had access to information about the weapons systems aboard the Essex. 

In exchange, the officer paid Wei $12,000 over a year and a half.

A jury convicted Wei on six of seven charges: espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and three counts of violating the Arms Export Control Act.

The espionage-related charges carry life sentences and a $250,000 fine. 

Conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and each count of violating the act carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

The Chinese intelligence officer approached Wei and posed as a naval enthusiast working for the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, a state-run yard.

Wei suspected the officer of being linked to Chinese intelligence. 

""Wei told his friend that he is ‘no idiot' and that ‘this is quite obviously f***ing espionage,'"" according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 

Still, Wei began spying for the officer, sending pictures of the Essex and describing the vulnerabilities of ships at the San Diego Naval Base. 

An attorney for Wei did not deny that his actions were wrong but characterized him as young and naive, arguing he ""never intended to harm the United States.""

""It was never disputed that Jinchao made numerous errors in judgment. He was young and naive and regrettably agreed to share some very low-level information in exchange for easy money,"" attorney Sean Jones said in a statement Thursday.

From March 2022 to August 2023, when Wei was arrested, he sent photos, offered the locations of various Navy ships and described the defense weapons on the Essex, the DOJ stated.

TWO CHINESE NATIONALS ARRESTED FOR SPYING ON US NAVY PERSONNEL AND BASES

He sent the Chinese agent ""thousands of pages of technical and operational information about U.S. Navy surface warfare ships like the Essex that he took from restricted U.S. Navy computer systems."" 

U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said Wei's actions showed an ""egregious betrayal of the trust placed in him as a member of the U.S. military.""

""By trading military secrets to the People's Republic of China for cash, he jeopardized not only the lives of his fellow sailors but also the security of the entire nation and our allies,"" Gordon said. ""The jury's verdict serves as a crucial reminder that the Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute traitors.""

Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on December 1.

""If there is only one thing I can make clear, it is that Jinchao loves America. He has no allegiance to China,"" his attorney said. ""He made a stupid decision to make some easy money by selling outdated maintenance manuals to a broken and obsolete steam-powered ship. I firmly believe his actions had absolutely no effect on national security.

Multiple Chinese nationals have been arrested for spying on U.S. military bases. Just last month, two were detained in Houston for allegedly trying to collect intelligence about U.S. Navy service members and bases and recruiting other military members to carry out tasks for the country's main foreign intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).

Fox News' David Spunt provides details on the FBI raid at former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland as FBI Director Kash Patel tweets, NO ONE is above the law.

FBI agents raided the Maryland home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton on Friday morning, Fox News Digital has learned.

Fox News Digital later spotted agents at Bolton's Washington, D.C., office removing boxes and Bolton was seen in the lobby of the building.

The searches are focused on potential classified documents agents believe Bolton may still possess, according to one source. 

Bolton, who served as President Donald Trump's national security advisor from 2018 to 2019, is not in custody or under arrest. Trump said he was not aware of the raid ahead of time and said he found out about it on the news.

Federal agents reportedly busted into Bolton's house in Bethesda, Maryland, at around 7 a.m. local time in an investigation ordered by FBI Director Kash Patel, who took to X with a cryptic post minutes later. 

""NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission,"" he wrote without directly referencing the raid. 

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino shared the post and wrote, ""Public corruption will not be tolerated.""

Meanwhile, Attorney General Pam Bondi also warned, ""America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.""

Trump told reporters he saw the raid on television Friday morning and said he did not know any details about the investigation.

""He's not a smart guy, but he could be very unpatriotic,"" Trump said. ""I mean, we're going to find out. I know nothing about it. I just saw it this morning.""

CIA Director John Ratcliffe provided Patel with limited access to U.S. intelligence that served as the basis for the search warrant, a source familiar with the Bolton raid and the evidence used to justify it told Fox News Digital. 

""I can't give you any more details than that, but let's just say that John Bolton really had some nerve to attack Trump over his handling of classified information,"" the source told Fox News Digital. 

Fox News Digital called Bolton's office for comment. A staffer answered, said, ""Have a nice day,"" and then hung up.

The probe into classified documents was first launched years ago but later shut down by the Biden administration ""for political reasons,"" according to a senior U.S. official.

The Justice Department under Trump's first administration argued that Bolton's 2020 memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" contained classified material and sought to block its publication. A federal judge ultimately allowed the book to be published.

TRUMP REVOKES JOHN BOLTON'S SECRET SERVICE DETAIL AMID IRANIAN DEATH THREATS: FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

In June 2021, the Biden Justice Department abandoned both a criminal inquiry and civil lawsuit against Bolton over the memoir, ending the legal battle at that time.

Bolton's attorney said at the time that a senior career official in charge of the NSC's prepublication review process conducted a four-month prepublication review of the book and, after requiring a number of revisions, concluded that it contained no classified information.

The book contained a damning account of the Trump White House, alleging that Trump once ""pleaded"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping to aid his re-election campaign, among other missteps.

Trump ousted Bolton from his first administration in 2019 because they ""disagreed strongly"" on policy. 

Bolton has both praised and criticized Trump since leaving his first administration.

He criticized Trump's handling of classified documents, which led to an FBI raid on the former president's Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 and a subsequent federal indictment, but insisted that ""the legal process play out.""

Trump was initially indicted on 37 felony counts, later expanded to 40, but the case was ultimately dismissed in July 2024.

In 2022, Bolton said Trump lacked the competence and character to be president.

However, Bolton strongly backed Trump's military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in June, calling it ""a decisive action,"" ""the right thing to do,"" and praising its potential to generate ""huge change in the Middle East.""

Trump, meanwhile, has often criticized Bolton for pushing U.S. involvement in wars in the Middle East. Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush from August 2005 to December 2006.

""I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real, sort of low-life,"" Trump said Friday before adding that Bolton served a useful purpose in his administration because foreign leaders feared him.

""He was one of the people who forced Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East. And he always wants to kill people.""

Trump added, ""And he's very bad at what he does … I'd walk into a room with him, with a foreign country would give me everything because they said, oh no, they're going to get blown up because John Bolton was there.""

Trump revoked Bolton's Secret Service detail the day after Trump's inauguration as the 47th president and Bolton said the move showed that Trump was coming after him.

""I think it is a retribution presidency,"" Bolton told ABC earlier this month in relation to the stripping of his Secret Service protection.

Bolton has faced threats from Iran going back years, including an alleged plot to assassinate him in 2021 and the Department of Justice subsequently charging a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for the plot in 2022.

The Iranian threats against Bolton were likely sparked by the January 2020 U.S. strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, the Department of Justice reported in 2022.

Former DEA special agent Michael Brown warns that Mexico's popular tourist zones may look safe, but behind the beaches and resorts, cartels and predators pose serious threats to unsuspecting travelers.

The U.S. State Department has issued an updated travel advisory for Mexico, warning Americans about potential dangers in the popular vacation destination.

Released on Aug. 12, the advisory raised Mexico to a Level 2 alert, urging travelers to ""exercise increased caution"" due to the threat of violent crime, including terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal activity.  

U.S. officials also warned that in certain areas they may have limited ability to assist travelers in emergencies.

""Violent crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery are widespread,"" the advisory notes. ""There is also a risk of terrorist violence, including potential attacks.""

The alert comes as Mexico continues to attract millions of international travelers.

According to RoadGenius, in 2024, Mexico received approximately 45.04 million international tourists, including about 13.5 million visitors from the United States, making it the top international destination for U.S. travelers. Popular hot spots include Cancún, Tulum, Cabo San Lucas, and Mexico City.

Despite the heightened warning, one expert emphasized that Americans don't necessarily need to cancel their trips.

Robert McDonald, a retired supervisory Secret Service agent and a lecturer in criminal justice at the University of New Haven, told Fox News Digital the advisory should be viewed as a reminder rather than a deterrent.

""It's really a lot of situational awareness, a lot of common sense,"" McDonald said. ""If you can avoid traveling into a hot zone, do so. Otherwise, just be smart about your surroundings.""

With more than 20 years in executive protection and intelligence, McDonald has coordinated security for U.S. and foreign dignitaries. He said that while most resorts are generally safe, venturing off-property is where risks increase.

McDonald explained that resorts and cruise lines work hard to maintain reputations for safety, often downplaying incidents to reassure guests. While most tourist hubs remain stable, travelers who leave resort areas may face exposure to cartel activity, gang violence, robbery, or drink tampering.

""Stay on the resort. Enjoy what's on the property. Don't go off — that's where problems can occur,"" McDonald said. 

McDonald also highlighted how resorts and cruise ships alike are motivated to maintain a reputation for safety, even if that means underplaying incidents, adding that guests can still have safe and enjoyable vacations by being cautious and limiting exposure to risky situations.

""Resorts don't want problems advertised because it hurts business, but dangers exist once you step off,"" he explained. 

According to McDonald, safety largely depends on where you're going. 

""Tourist-friendly areas haven't seen a significant spike in violent crime,"" McDonald noted. ""But you should avoid areas dominated by drug cartels or where violence is common.""

For those still planning trips, McDonald recommends the following precautions:

Avoid street taxis: There have been reports of extortion involving unregulated taxis. Instead, book transportation in advance through reputable companies offering vetted services.

US RENEWS TRAVEL ADVISORY TO POPULAR DESTINATION AMID 'TERRORISM FEARS': 'EXERCISE INCREASED CAUTION'

Stay on resort grounds: Resorts typically provide 24-hour security. If you plan to leave the property, avoid going out alone or after dark.

Stay vigilant: Avoid distractions like using your phone while walking, and keep an eye on your drink when out socializing.

Dress modestly: Avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry that could draw unwanted attention.

Communicate safety: Check in with people back home and travel with trusted groups.

Be prepared for emergencies: Always know exit strategies and how to ""get off the X"" (escape dangerous situations quickly).

McDonald stressed that these tips apply not only to Mexican resorts but to any crowded environment.

""Travelers must be vigilant. Whether at a resort, a ball game, or any crowded venue, it's important to always identify exit routes and have a plan to ‘get off the X' if danger arises, since law enforcement often arrives only after the fact,"" McDonald said.

Ultimately, he advised travelers to balance enjoyment with preparation.

""Enjoy the trip, but don't let your guard down — safety relies on awareness, preparation, and smart choices,"" McDonald said. 

""A little bit of preparation, knowing where the consulate, police, or hospital are located can make a big difference. So plan ahead, and always be ready to remove yourself quickly from unsafe situations.""

When President Donald Trump announced his plans to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month, he included a clear warning to liberal cities beyond Washington: either clean up or face a federal takeover.

“We're going to have a tremendous success on what we're doing,” Trump said regarding the enlistment of the National Guard to patrol the nation's capital before warning blue-leaning cities. “They're all watching, and maybe they'll self-clean up, and maybe they'll self-do this, and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem.”

The president then blasted Chicago and Los Angeles, cities within blue states led by Democratic mayors, Brandon Johnson and Karen Bass, respectively. The states are led by two of his biggest Democratic foes: Govs. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Gavin Newsom (D-CA).

“If we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster. We have a mayor there who's totally incompetent,” Trump said of Johnson. “And we have an incompetent governor there. Pritzker is an incompetent. His family threw him out of the business, and he ran for governor.”

STEPHEN MILLER BLASTS ‘STUPID WHITE HIPPIES' DURING UNION STATION VISIT WITH VANCE AND HEGSETH

“Hopefully, LA is watching,” Trump added as he spoke about the devastating fires that blazed through the city earlier this year. “I watched people on television; they want to go, they want to leave. They've lost their spirit. They've lost their heart because the mayor is incompetent. And Gavin Newscum [Trump's nickname for Newsom] is incompetent. Got a good line of bull****, but that's about it.”

On Thursday, the president was again direct about his desire to move beyond Washington when asked about homicides in Memphis, Tennessee, another blue-controlled city. “We're doing a sort of a test right now in D.C.,” he told the Todd Starnes Show. “It's working unbelievably.”

He later visited the U.S. Park Police Anacostia Operations Facility on Thursday evening, highlighting the National Guard's work to combat crime and homelessness.

“The crime numbers are way down,” Trump told the crowd. “I feel very safe now, and I'm hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks … it's going to be at a level that's even far superior.”

He again threatened to take his efforts to crack down on crime to other cities. “We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places,” he said. “But we're going to stay here for a while.”

Trump's attacks on these blue cities and their leaders are part of a yearslong pattern of slamming urban enclaves as crime-infested places in need of law and order. His recent takeover of Washington escalates his previous feuds with Democrats, who claimed that crime rates have fallen in many of these cities.

“President Trump sees that American cities are failing, and part of why they're failing is a leadership deficit and a lack of will to do what needs to be done to fix these once great American cities,” said Brian Seitchick, a national Republican strategist. “So Trump is taking it upon himself to make cities safer again and to make them a place that is hospitable to all Americans.” 

In his first visit to Chicago as president in 2019, Trump said the Windy City was “embarrassing to us as a nation” due to its crime problems. “All over the world, they're talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison,” he said.

During a visit to Detroit, Michigan, last year while campaigning for the presidency, Trump said the nation would end up like the city if former Vice President Kamala Harris were president.

“The whole country will be like — you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit,” Trump said. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president.”

However, in his second term, Trump no longer relies on harsh rhetoric. He's now using the federal government's full might to enforce his will.

“President Trump wants every innocent, law-abiding American across the country to be safe – no matter what city they live in or who is in charge,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to the Washington Examiner. 

“President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to make DC Safe and Beautiful by using his lawful authority to stop dangerous criminals and enforce the law,” Rogers continued. “The left and the media can coddle criminals, but our nation's capital will not be a safe haven for violent criminals under President Trump's leadership.” 

Members of the Trump administration have applauded the National Guard for helping clean up the city's homeless crisis and violent crime problems, as well as pointed to the effect it could have on the nation after Trump declared a national emergency to take over the police department for 30 days.

“We do not have to allow our cities to be taken over by violence,” Vice President JD Vance said during a surprise visit to Union Station on Wednesday. “We can bring law and order to our communities, you've just got to have the political willpower to do it.”

Rep. James Comer (R-KY), a key Trump ally on Capitol Hill, publicly supported the takeover of other cities' police forces. 

“We're gonna support doing this in other cities if it works out in Washington, D.C.,” he told Newsmax. Our military has been in many countries around the world for the past two decades, walking the streets trying to reduce crime in other countries. We need to focus on the big cities in America now, and that's what the president is doing.”

Democrats are in a bind on how to counter Trump's attacks on blue-leaning cities, said one Republican strategist.

“This puts Democrats in a corner, and so in that way, I think Trump loves it,” said Matt Dole, a GOP strategist based in Ohio. “I think Trump loves it when he can sort of corner the Democrats. And really, whatever they decide is a problem for them. And I think he has them in the corner. Crime nationally is worse in big cities. Big cities nationally are unanimously controlled by Democrats.”

FBI crime statistics from 2024 show that 13 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates were in Republican-run states. But 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates, with at least 100,000 residents, were led by Democratic mayors. Trump's feud with these Democratic leaders may have some basis for his threats to move beyond Washington, but the crime statistics also lend credence to the argument that Democrats are not tough on crime.

“I believe he is targeting cities that are failing, and that these cities fail the eye test on a regular basis,” said Seitchick. “If they were led by Republicans, with Republican mayors, and they were failing, Trump would still be trying to fix them. The fact that Democrats leave them at the city level and the gubernatorial level is a reality that everybody understands.” 

TRUMP'S TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE RENEWS THE 51ST STATE DEBATE

Dole pointed out that Washington is unique in that it lacks statehood and is, therefore, more easily subject to federal jurisdiction.

“I don't think Trump goes, ‘Look, this worked in D.C., so now I'm going to nationalize the LAPD or the Chicago Police or something else, ‘” said Dole. “I think Trump explores limits, but I believe he knows that that's probably a step too far and would certainly be struck down in court relatively quickly.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How DC Democrats hollowed out the capital's police force","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/3762259/how-dc-democrats-hollowed-out-dc-police-force/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Well before President Donald Trump put a national spotlight on the public safety crisis in Washington, D.C., the capital's police force faced a chronic scarcity of officers due to Democrat-championed policies driving out officers in droves.

For years, departures from the district's Metropolitan Police Department have annually outpaced recruitment rates, which include new hires, cadet rollovers, lateral moves, and reinstatements.

Since at least 2019, more MPD officers have retired, resigned, or left the force for other reasons, such as termination, death, or disability, than the department has been able to recruit, according to a recent staffing and attrition report. To date, separations cumulatively surpass enlistments by 674 sworn officers.

Over the past seven fiscal years, MPD has seen 2,189 officers leave the force. Resignations alone account for 757, or a third, of the total departures.

The numbers are newly relevant amid a debate over DC's home rule and crime rates in the nation's capital. Trump took over MPD using federal emergency powers last month, citing a public safety crisis he says local leadership failed to solve.

The disparity between MPD's hiring levels and exits peaked in fiscal 2021 following local anti-police protests and calls to defund MPD. That year, MPD hired only 103 officers while parting with over 300 police personnel, nearly a 220-officer deficit. A majority of them left voluntarily, whether via resignation or retirement.

The current number of active MPD officers stands at 3,076, not including 100 or so incoming recruits, which is still about 800 short of Mayor Muriel Bowser's goal of 4,000 sworn officers, which she set in 2022 as part of a $30 million plan to ramp up recruitment.

Bowser, seeking a third term at the time, had proposed several budgetary changes she hoped would help incentivize onboarding and retention within the MPD, after the city significantly slashed the police budget by about $15 million in 2020.

DC LEADERS STRUGGLE WITH RISING CRIME AFTER CUTTING POLICE

The mayor's reinvestments included hiring bonuses, temporary housing stipends for recruits living outside the city limits, expansions of the vehicle take-home program, and tuition reimbursements.

Three years later, MPD has not met Bowser's employment target nor come anywhere close to it. The last time MPD had 4,000 officers on hand was over a decade ago in 2013. The steady depletion of MPD personnel has led to the district's lowest number of law enforcement officers since the 1970s.

MPD's severe staffing shortage, the result of the department consistently hemorrhaging manpower each year, especially in 2021, was brought about in part by progressive Democrats' reforms to the police department.

In 2022, through the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act, the Democrat-majority D.C. City Council voted to claw back collective bargaining procedures, pertaining to union involvement in the disciplinary process against MPD members, and due process rights for officers facing corrective action.

Congress passed H.J. Res 42 in response to nullify the council's criminal justice reform bill, but former President Joe Biden vetoed the joint resolution, calling CPJRAA “commonsense” legislation.

CONGRESS IS RIGHT TO REBUKE DC'S RADICAL CRIMINAL CODE ‘REFORM'

In this legislative session, House Republicans introduced the Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act of 2025 (H.R. 2096), which would rescind the changes governing the discipline of MPD officers.

If enacted, two provisions of the bill will reinstate a 90-day statute of limitations for initiating “corrective or adverse action” against any MPD officer and allow punitive matters to be negotiated under a collective bargaining agreement.

This lack of professional protections for officers is regularly cited as the top motivator for why officers are leaving the MPD, according to the D.C. Police Union, which represents the force's rank and file. Reinstating the 90-day disciplinary timeline, in particular, would eliminate prolonging the process as a means of additional punishment, the union says.

In congressional testimony addressing abysmal morale department-wide and the mass exodus of MPD officers, the police union's chairman, Greggory Pemberton, cited a series of soft-on-crime laws that the D.C. City Council advanced in the wake of the 2020 racial justice riots, as well as perceived anti-police attitudes among local lawmakers.

Among the sweeping reforms, the Democratic overhaul restricted police practices regarding use of force, imposed restrictions on vehicular pursuits, and mandated the immediate release of an officer's name after a use-of-force incident, all of which have made it harder for officers to perform their duties, according to Pemberton.

Pemberton also pointed to a council member saying at a public hearing that “bad actors” in the MPD ought to receive “some kind of retribution” or “proper penance.” Additionally, the union boss referred to Councilor Charles Allen, a Democrat, bragging about budget cuts causing the department's “numbers…to drop by about 200 officers.” Allen added, “This is the biggest reduction to MPD that I've ever seen.”

“Without delving into the granular details of how terrible these bills are, or how blatantly awful the rhetoric used by the council was, I can assure the members of this Committee that the direct result was a mass exodus of police officers from the department,” Pemberton, then an 18-year MPD veteran, told Congress.

Bowser herself has admitted that the current workplace culture frightens officers who patrol the streets of D.C. and thereby hinders their ability to respond effectively to crime.

“We have to have a policy environment that allows us to recruit and retain officers and not lose our officers to surrounding jurisdictions because our policy environment makes them scared to do their job,” Bowser said at a 2023 press conference.

DISTRICT OF CRIME: WHAT HAPPENED TO WASHINGTON'S SHRINKING POLICE FORCE?

That year, a dozen current and former officers told the DCist that many MPD members have called it quits because of burnout from working overtime to compensate for the lack of manpower. “It makes you just feel kind of like some tiny cog in a broken machine that's not working,” said one officer, who left the MPD to join a suburban-area police department.

An independent study conducted on behalf of MPD leadership to assess the department's culture discovered similar concerns in 2023. After surveying a number of MPD officers, the research report found that “two of the greatest contributors to low morale are canceling employees' days off and requiring them to repeatedly work overtime, often without prior notice.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Department of Homeland Security, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, arrested two illegal immigrants from Angola this week who were involved in two separate car crashes in Maine, which resulted in two pedestrians being killed. 

On Aug. 16, a vehicle driven by Mukendi Mbiya struck and killed Stacy Strattard, a 64-year-old resident of Gray, Maine. She was pronounced dead at the scene as first responders arrived, according to DHS. 

Mbiya first arrived in the United States on a B-2 tourist visa on Dec. 23, 2018, DHS reported in a press release. He was supposed to depart the country on June 22, 2019, but he overstayed his visa. ICE officials arrested him on Aug. 18 after his driving resulted in an American's death. 

In Lewiston, Maine, there was another tragedy involving an illegal immigrant driving and a pedestrian dying. Elizabeth Camacho was killed after Lionel Francisco hit her with his vehicle in Kennedy Park. The car reportedly “jumped the curb” of a street before hitting and killing Camacho, who was a Massachusetts resident. 

The local jurisdiction is reportedly pursuing any criminal charges against Francisco for killing Camacho, according to a statement from DHS.  

According to DHS, Francisco entered the country on Jan. 30, 2025, on a B-2 tourist visa, which expired on July 30, but Francisco did not leave. He was reportedly operating his vehicle while using a learner's permit. ICE arrested him on Aug. 15. 

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin commented on the crashes. She noted the tragic trend of illegal immigrants being involved in car crashes that end the lives of American citizens.

“It seems to be almost a daily occurrence where an illegal alien driving kills innocent Americans,” McLaughlin said. “All of these deaths are preventable because these illegal aliens should have NEVER been in our country. These two illegal aliens in Maine came to the country on B-2 tourist visas that allowed them to remain in the country for six months. Both overstayed their visas and never left the U.S.

“President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are committed to restoring integrity to our visa programs to ensure they are not exploited by illegal aliens as one-way tickets to remain in the U.S.,” she added.

Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Virginia are condemning a sign that was shown at a protest in Arlington County that targeted Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.

The Arlington school board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its transgender bathroom policy in the face of threats of federal funding cuts, and transgender rights protesters were outside. One person at the protest was holding a sign that is being condemned as racist.

“Hey Winsome, you have a gender neutral bathroom in your house,” one side of the sign read, with the other side reading, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then Blacks can't share my water fountain.”

Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor in the 2025 election, said on social media that she was “disgusted, but not surprised.”

“I'm an immigrant, a Marine, and above all, a human being. There is no place for this disgusting hatred in our Commonwealth. Anyone who doesn't condemn this sign is complicit in approving it,” she continued.

Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the sign in a statement, calling it “racist, abhorrent, and unacceptable.” 

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) said in a social media post, ​​“The hypocrisy of the liberal left on display again. Winsome is so much bigger than this idiocy.”

Republican groups are using the sign to target Democrats on social issues, on which they poll poorly.

“The sign was the least of the obscenities from the trans activists' display,” Virginia Project, a conservative PAC, wrote on social media.

The Arlington GOP posted a letter from Chairman Matthew Hurtt supposedly sent to the protester, thanking her.

“I couldn't have ever dreamed that someone would boost our efforts quite like you have,” the note read.

The woman behind the sign, who was not identified, told Fox 5 her message was meant to be satirical.

“It was satire meant to provoke conversation around the absurdity of prejudice. If anyone thinks we are actually supporting separate drinking fountains based on race, they are mistaken,” she said. “In the same way that drinking fountains should be usable by all races, bathrooms should be non-discriminatory.”

Other elected officials in Virginia have condemned the language. 

“This is wrong. @winwithwinsome — and Virginia — deserve better,” Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said on social media.

“Two wrongs don't make a right. Been teaching my kids – and students – that for years. In the age of Trump it's easy to get in the gutter. We should insist on betting the better angels of our nature,” Democratic state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg said in a social media statement.

Gavin Newsom's parodies are riling people up—and they don't quite seem to understand why.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

The Fox News commentator Dana Perino has finally had enough. “You have to stop it with the Twitter thing,” she told the chief executive. “I don't know where his wife is,” she fumed. “If I were his wife, I would say, ‘You are making a fool of yourself! Stop it!'” She went on to note that he has a big job, and that he has to be “a little more serious.”  What a relief to see someone from Fox, the flagship MAGA network, getting completely fed up with juvenile social-media behavior from a national politician. Except the chief executive in this case was not Donald Trump, the president of the United States, but Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.

Newsom has taken to trolling Trump on social media by imitating his bizarre rants, odd capitalizations, and affection for exclamation points. He has also posted several memes that are on-the-nose parodies of things Trump has fed to his followers for years. Politico recently summarized some of Newsom's activities on social media:

There's Newsom on Mount Rushmore. There's Newsom getting prayed over by Tucker Carlson, Kid Rock and an angelic, winged Hulk Hogan. There's Newsom posting in all caps, saying his mid-cycle redistricting proposal has led “MANY” people to call him “GAVIN CHRISTOPHER ‘COLUMBUS' NEWSOM (BECAUSE OF THE MAPS!). THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.”

Read: Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Newsom got even closer to Trumpian perfection with a post yesterday that is almost impossible to tell apart from an actual outburst from the president:

WHAT IS WRONG WITH CRACKER BARREL?? KEEP YOUR BEAUTIFUL LOGO!!! THE NEW ONE LOOKS LIKE CHEAP VELVEETA “CHEESE” FROM WALMART, THE PLACE FOR “GROCERIES” (AN OLD FASHIONED TERM)!!!

Some of these jibes are clumsy, but many are well crafted and even funny, despite the unsettling fact that the person whom the governor is parodying is the commander in chief. And the proof that Newsom is on to something is that his supporters are reacting with genuine rage. Perhaps Newsom has hit a nerve because satire is always more effective than name-calling. Mango Mussolini or Cheeto Jesus (both of which refer to the president's unusual bronzed skin tone) appeal only to Trump's opponents. But a post that perfectly mimics Trump's antics is a mirror—one that prompts people to consider how Trump looks to everyone else in the world.

At the least, Newsom has scored a direct hit on the double standard both in the national press and among the public that excuses Trump's deeply concerning behavior as merely part of Trump's shtick, some facet of his personality that cannot be held to account. Too many reporters have resorted to sane-washing Trump, forcing his bizarre statements somehow to make sense by cherry-picking the occasional phrase or sentence related to policy while ignoring his kooky rants about sharks and his Stalinist threats against his political enemies. Newsom's parodies sidestep all the hand-wringing criticism about how presidents should act: Instead they show, rather than explain, what it should feel like when anyone but Trump acts the way Trump acts.

Perino is just one of many who is in high dudgeon. (Newsom responded to Perino with a dead-on Trump-like response: “DANA ‘DING DONG' PERINO (NEVER HEARD OF HER UNTIL TODAY!)” Vice President J. D. Vance has lashed out at Newsom, telling Fox that the Californian's attacks aren't landing because his trolling “ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump's political success, which is that he's authentic”; in other words, everyone knows that Newsom's crackpot hijinks are fake but Trump's are real—a rather odd defense.

And of course, the MAGA posters on social media and Facebook have flown off the handle with rage. (Newsom is having a “mental breakdown,” said one MAGA influencer, without a trace of irony.) As it turns out, the people who pioneered the slogan “Fuck your feelings” are impossibly delicate souls.

Others have adopted a pose of criticizing Newsom more in sorrow than anger. “I'm all for appreciating crass humor,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer and MAGA social-media stalwart who is now assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Trump Justice Department. “I love South Park. It's hilarious.” (One wonders if she's been watching the show recently.) “But don't just be a loser copying the most powerful person in the world's style.” Trump's majordomo at Fox, Sean Hannity, summed up this New Seriousness among the president's supporters when he tut-tutted Newsom's “performative confrontational style,” adding that “maybe it wins you points with the loony radical base in your party,” but it won't win elections. How refreshing: Fox commentators and leading figures in the Trump administration all agreeing that a politician should not conduct himself in public like a dim, insufferable child.

They're all so close to getting it.

I admit that I am conflicted about Newsom's approach. Some years ago, I wrote that Trump's opponents, especially the ones addicted to terms such as Drumpf, the Orange Menace, Cadet Bone Spurs, and others needed to act like adults, and convey the gravity of their concerns about Trump instead of treating him like either an inconsequential boob or a towering werewolf whose name must not be invoked. The same goes for the too-online liberals who refer to “Rethuglicans” and “RepubliKKKans”—uncomfortably similar to the media-addicted right-wingers who use infantile slams such as DemonRats and Killary.

One aspect of Newsom's parodies have genuinely made me laugh: his posting of pictures done in the style of the artist and Trump admirer Jon McNaughton, who is a competent illustrator but whose paintings are strange. They're a kind of hallucinatory mash-up of Grant Wood and medieval iconography, in which Trump carries the world like Atlas, or is blessed by dead presidents, or rescues the Constitution from glowering liberals. (The Newsom image with the deceased Hulk Hogan was so perfectly rendered that at first I thought it was created by McNaughton himself.) Trump supporters seem to love these pictures. Newsom has shown just how weird they are.

Newsom has made his point and should move on. But his lasting accomplishment has been to reveal that Trump's supporters are not as impervious to reality as the president's opponents might believe. I suspect—as I have since the day Trump announced his first run for president a decade ago—that the MAGA faithful are hypersensitive to criticisms of Trump because, in their hearts, many of them know. They know that many of Trump's statements are offensive and alarmingly detached from reality. They know that Trump has a disordered personality. They know that the president is a daily embarrassment to his party and to his nation.

For years, these MAGA partisans have employed various tactics to prevent the imminent pain of cognitive dissonance. They resort to “what about” arguments aimed at other politicians; they claim that Trump actually knows what he's doing or that they understand the message underneath all the broken thoughts, garbled words, and dead-end sentences. Now Newsom is forcing them to see what Trump looks like without the distorting force field created by Trump's showmanship and his aggressive delivery of incoherent statements.

Come to think of it, maybe MAGA world isn't close to getting it; maybe they do get it, and maybe that's why, this time, they're especially angry.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Unless it changes course, Israel is closer to triggering a second war with West Bank Palestinians than to ending the disastrous conflict in Gaza.

A shooting in broad daylight last month on a dry, rocky hillside in the West Bank barely registered in the Israeli press and has not led to legal consequences. But it might signal the opening of yet another front in the cascading wars unleashed by the October 7, 2023, attacks.

Jewish settlers from Carmel, an outpost that is illegal under Israeli law, approached the nearby Palestinian Bedouin village of Umm al-Khair in a large construction digger and began to damage an olive grove, residents of the village told me when I recently visited.

When residents tried to stop them, some by throwing rocks, Yinon Levi, a settler who runs a demolition business that contracts with the Israel Defense Forces, fired several rounds from a handgun, killing the 31-year-old activist Odeh Hathalin.

I spent the past week traveling across Israel and the West Bank, meeting with officials from the Israeli government, military, and opposition, as well as Palestinian political leaders and activists. I left believing that Israel is closer to triggering a second war with West Bank Palestinians than it is to ending the disastrous conflict in Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could have emerged from the depths of October 7—when he told President Joe Biden that “in the Middle East, if you're seen as weak, you're roadkill”—in some triumph, having vanquished virtually all of Israel's enemies, culminating with the recent bombing of Iran. But he failed to seize the opportunity to stop the fighting in Gaza.

Instead, nearly two years into a war they did not choose, Israeli officials still have not found, and may not even be genuinely seeking, a way out. They have set requirements for ending the war that they do not seem able to achieve on the battlefield, at least at anything close to an acceptable cost both to their own military and society and to innocent Palestinians.

Although Israel may finally be close to a third temporary cease-fire that would allow some of the hostages to come home—a very welcome development—even that might not end the war. When the last cease-fire collapsed, in March, officials made a disastrous strategic and moral mistake by letting more than two months pass with no food entering Gaza, leaving hundreds of thousands of people at risk of starvation. That choice has so horrified the rest of the world that a half dozen countries, with few other options to demonstrate their outrage, have declared their intent to recognize a Palestinian state.

And today, the UN-backed body that monitors food insecurity declared, for the first time since the conflict began, that there is a famine in the district around Gaza City that is “entirely man made.” Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a response accusing the report of being based on “Hamas lies,” and of lowering its usual thresholds for such a declaration.For now, instead of working to free all of the 20 or so Israeli hostages believed to still be alive, withdrawing the IDF to the perimeter of the Gaza Strip, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance to people in need, and reserving the right to target what's left of Hamas's leadership later—Israeli officials are betting that expanding the war will lead Hamas to capitulate or collapse.

But it is unclear how another round of fighting would accomplish what 22 months of intense combat have not. And with the world's attention focused on Gaza, the situation in the West Bank is sliding toward another crisis.

A majority of Israelis now say they want to end the Gaza war and bring the hostages home, even if Hamas remains armed and its leaders able to exert control over the Strip. The more than 100,000 demonstrators who pack Habima Square and Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday nights have shifted their focus to demanding a full and immediate cease-fire.

Having once recoiled at U.S. pressure, many Israelis now openly court it. On a recent evening, hundreds wore MAGA-style red hats, aimed at getting the attention of the Trump administration, that read End This Fuc*!ng War.

And it's not just the activists. Last week, more than 600 former Israeli security officials, including the heads of many top spy and military agencies, wrote President Donald Trump a letter asking him to intervene against their own government and declaring that “it is our professional judgment that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel.”

After October 7, the Biden administration was right to embrace Israel in the wake of the worst day in its history, and to support what I consider to have been a just war against the Hamas terrorists who were responsible. But I also believe that we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted and, after Israel's core military objectives had been achieved, try to end the war.

Waiting for an intervention from Trump—who has reversed what modest pressure Biden placed on Israel and offered virtually unqualified support for its actions in Gaza—feels futile; after Israel's cabinet voted earlier this month to expand the war into Gaza City, he said that the decision is “pretty up to Israel.”

Although it remains true that Hamas is responsible for starting this phase of the conflict by murdering more than 1,000 Israelis and that the group could end the war tomorrow by releasing the hostages and disarming itself, that, too, seems highly unlikely. Fairly or not, that puts the ball back in Israel's court.

Earlier this month, I spoke with Shachar Shnorman, a kibbutznik who had returned home to Kfar Aza, where at least 62 residents were murdered on October 7, as he recounted the sounds of his neighbors being shot dead and the smell of the cigarette smoke from Hamas fighters seated on his porch as he hid a few feet away, on the other side of a shaded window.

He wants the war to end, he said. While we talked, drones buzzed overhead, and every 10 minutes or so, a new explosion could be heard coming from Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, the black plumes of smoke rising a couple of miles away.

Before the attack, Kfar Aza was known as a left-leaning commune. But Schnorman told me that most of his neighbors have not returned home, and many have “moved to the right.”

Despite an Israeli military assessment that Hamas's capacity as an organized force is more than 90 percent degraded, Israeli officials for now seem determined to hold out for total victory.

They often invoke the full surrenders of Germany and Japan, arguing that stopping now would hand Hamas an undeserved victory and that international pressure to do so only hardens Hamas's negotiating position. “There is a little devil sitting on every Israeli's shoulder saying that all the Palestinians basically love Hamas, and the whole world basically hates the Jews,” one centrist political adviser told me.

Israeli officials argue that Hamas must be disarmed and removed from power, pointing to the thousands of remaining Hamas fighters. (One Israeli official said Hamas still has as many as 20,000, a staggering number given that estimates before the war ranged up to 30,000.) Although Israel agreed to a cease-fire in Lebanon last year that was widely celebrated, even though it left Hezbollah in place, Israeli officials insist that the situations are distinct. “If Hezbollah had done October 7, the IDF would be in Beirut to this day,” one told me.

Gershom Gorenberg: The two extremists driving Israel's policy

All of which leads to speculation here about why Israel won't stop. Most Israelis believe that the war continues less because of Gaza than the preservation of Netanyahu's fragile governing coalition.

At least two ministers have threatened to pull the support of their parties and trigger elections if a cease-fire is reached, arguing instead for returning Jewish settlers to the Strip for the first time since Israel disengaged from Gaza in 2005.

The only real deadline will come in October 2026, before which elections must be held, because the government's mandate expires.

“The strategy in Gaza is ongoing war. The war is the strategy,” former Air Force General Nimrod Sheffer, who has joined a prominent opposition party, told me. “That serves Bibi. It may serve the coalition. It doesn't serve anyone else.”

Meanwhile, with far less international scrutiny, Israel has launched a campaign across the West Bank that risks igniting a second front that is far closer to Israeli population centers and much harder to contain.After the end of the Second Intifada, in 2005, the West Bank experienced a period of relative calm compared with Gaza, where Israel has waged five wars since the IDF withdrew from the territory that same year, forcibly evicting thousands of Jewish settlers who lived there. Immediately after October 7, the IDF began a counterterrorism crackdown in the West Bank that has so far kept a lid on attacks against Israelis while claiming the lives of nearly 1,000 Palestinians fighters and civilians.The scale of the Israeli operation in the West Bank is massive, even if dwarfed by the scale of the conflict in Gaza. At the start of this year, an assault dubbed the “Iron Wall” in three northern West Bank refugee camps displaced 40,000 people, the largest number since Israel first occupied the territory in 1967. One security official who had visited the camps—which, despite that label, look more like cities—showed me photos of entire blocks reduced to rubble, describing it as a “Nagasaki-like” level of destruction.

Violence against Palestinians by Jewish settlers—the roughly 500,000 Israeli civilians who live in the West Bank, beyond Israel's internationally recognized border—has increased dramatically, from fewer than 90 incidents a month at the start of this year to more than 200, according to the same official. Fatal attacks, which were once exceedingly rare, are becoming regular occurrences.

President Biden, in whose administration I served as deputy national security adviser, repeatedly warned Netanyahu about settler violence, sometimes publicly, and became the first U.S. president to impose sanctions on violent Israeli settlers and the organizations that support them. Upon taking office, Trump immediately removed all of the sanctions and has said virtually nothing about the West Bank since.

Although only a small minority of settlers commit violence, they are the vanguard of a religious and political movement that claims all of the West Bank as Israel's birthright and that has navigated in recent years from the Israeli fringe to the mainstream. Few violent settlers are stopped before attacks are carried out. Fewer still face any real accountability after attacks occur.

Netanyahu has at times expressed concern over settlers' conduct, but members of his own cabinet provide settlers with political cover—particularly National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom have been accused (and Ben-Gvir convicted) of crimes tied to their efforts to preserve and expand Israel's occupation.

On a broiling recent afternoon in the South Hebron Hills, the family and neighbors of Odeh Hathalin, the Palestinian man killed last month, sat under a tarp beside a dried puddle of his blood on a concrete floor. They had been waiting for more than a week to receive his body from the IDF so they could hold a proper burial. Some had begun a hunger strike. A day later, his body was finally returned.

Umm al-Khair has long been targeted because many of its structures were built without official permits—which the Israeli government, which controls the permitting process, virtually never issues.

Just last year, Hathalin, who was featured in the recent Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” wrote about an IDF operation that destroyed homes.

Videos of the more recent attack, including one taken by Hathalin himself, were quickly posted online. Levi, the settler accused of the killing, had been sanctioned by Biden and exonerated by Trump. But after briefly being placed under house arrest, he is reportedly now free.

At least two American citizens are among those killed in a spate of attacks over the past month, and five since October 7.

The security official described one of the killings to me, in which armed settlers rounded up residents in the village of Sinjil, fired in the air to disperse the crowd, and then chased down Saifullah Musallet, a 20-year-old from Tampa who was visiting relatives, and beat him to death. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee called it a “criminal and terrorist act,” using unusually (and admirably) strong language, but neither the U.S. nor Israel has held his killers accountable.

When I asked both Israeli officials and settler leaders about the increase in settler violence, they were largely dismissive.

“There is not settler violence; there is settler vandalism,” one prominent settler leader said, before launching into a long explanation of the threats settlers face from the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank.

Another settler leader attributed reports of violence to the acts of “disadvantaged youths” who come to the West Bank from Israel.

Smotrich has taken the damaging step of regularly refusing to transfer to the Palestinian Authority customs revenues that Israel collects on goods entering the West Bank, to which Israel has no legitimate claim. During the Biden administration, Smotrich regularly sought to leverage the funds for policy concessions from Netanyahu or even from the U.S.

As a result, the PA, which administers about 40 percent of the West Bank under a deal reached with Israel in the 1990s, has, since April, been unable to pay salaries for many of its security forces, which work closely with the IDF despite strong disapproval from most West Bank residents.

Crime has surged across the West Bank since October 7, leading to frustration among residents and renewing long-standing concern that the PA, widely believed to be corrupt and out of touch, could collapse.

Many Israeli officials talk of the PA, which for all its flaws is committed to nonviolence and recognition of Israel, as if it is no different than Hamas. “As far as I'm concerned, let the PA collapse,” Smotrich has said. “It is an enemy.” Another Israeli official described the PA as “poisonous,” pointing to charges that its school curricula incite hatred of Jews.

Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior PA official, said he has invited Israeli and U.S. officials to review new textbooks and the implementation of other long-demanded reforms, such as an end to the “pay for slay” program, through which the PA subsidizes families of terrorists imprisoned by Israel.

For his part, Ben-Gvir last month established what the Israeli press has called a “quasi-police force” in the West Bank, comprising settler volunteers.

Tellingly, a security official said, by far the quietest period for settler violence since October 7 was the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, when Israel imposed a severe lockdown on the West Bank. That provides at least some evidence that the state, which did not want distractions during that time, can exercise more control when it chooses to.

Driving around the West Bank these days can feel like watching a crime scene unfold in plain sight. Settlers fence off land that isn't theirs, raise Israeli flags, plow and plant fields. Not long ago, such acts involved a cat-and-mouse game with the army, which would thwart them if it could. No longer.

More than 80 Palestinian West Bank communities have been emptied entirely since October 7, replaced by more than 100 Israeli outposts, makeshift settlements that are illegal even under Israeli law.

“I've worked in the West Bank for 23 years, and we've never had anything like this,” Dror Etkes, a longtime Israeli analyst and peace activist, told me. Riding across the northern West Bank in his beaten-up Jeep, he pointed out to me days-old construction or cultivation. “It is a totally different world.”

He and others who pay close attention to events in the West Bank believe that the territory is a tinderbox. “You have no idea how many guns there are in the West Bank,” one Palestinian official said. “We are lucky things haven't gotten crazier.”

There is no shortage of candidates that could ignite a broader conflict.

Settlers are placing relentless pressure on the northern West Bank community of Duma, home to nearly 3,000 residents and the site of an infamous 2015 arson attack that killed an 18-month-old boy and both of his parents. When I drove past Duma, I could see that it is also a strategically located bulwark, preventing a string of settlements that expand west to east from completely bisecting the northern West Bank. A few days later, a settler who was on short-term leave from his IDF unit shot dead a Duma resident named Thameen Dawabsheh, 35, during a clash in which two settlers were lightly wounded.

But perhaps the most likely flashpoint is Jerusalem, the city holy to three faiths that is incendiary in the best of times.

The day after I arrived in Israel, on the Jewish holiday of Tisha b'Av, Ben-Gvir escorted more than 3,000 Jewish worshippers to pray in the most sensitive part of the Old City, on what Jews call the Temple Mount and Palestinians call the Haram al-Sharif.

It is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which dates to the eighth century. It was previously the site of the First Temple and of the Second, whose destruction almost 2,000 years ago Tisha b'Av commemorates.

Ben-Gvir's visit would, until recently, have been unthinkable.

For hundreds of years, prayer by Jews at the site has been exceedingly rare, proscribed both by many rabbis concerned about the sanctity of the site and, more recently, by an Israeli policy called the “status quo,” which allows Jews access to the site but only Muslims the right to pray there. Established by Defense Minister Moshe Dayan after Israel occupied all of the Old City in 1967, the policy is aimed at preserving order.

In 2000, a short visit to the site by then–opposition leader Ariel Sharon, who was given a tour by an archaeologist, triggered the yearslong Second Palestinian Intifada, which brought mass-casualty suicide attacks to Israeli cities. After that, even rare and furtive attempts by Jews to pray there—sometimes by feigning conversation with a fellow visitor or speaking into their phone—were generally halted by authorities, and were major news.

Ben-Gvir's visit received sparse coverage in the Israeli press, which, since October 7, has taken a light touch with provocative stories on settler violence and the carnage and starvation in Gaza. A few days later, I spent about half an hour at the site and watched three separate groups of Jewish worshippers openly praying, all under police protection.

Elsewhere in greater Jerusalem, the eviction of Palestinian residents is surging in Sheikh Jarrah, the same neighborhood where similar actions in 2021—coinciding with disruptions of the status quo at the Temple Mount—prompted Hamas rocket fire that started an 11-day war in Gaza.

Last week's second major event was more bureaucratic than ostentatious, but could be no less consequential—the final hearing on an infamous settlement project known as E1. U.S. administrations (other than Trump's) have strongly opposed E1 since the 1990s because it would complete the encirclement of East Jerusalem with Jewish enclaves, separating the West Bank from the city that Palestinians expect to be the capital of their future state.

This week, Smotrich announced that the hearing had given the final green light and made clear that construction tenders would be issued shortly. The project, he said, would “bury the idea” of a Palestinian state. Once construction begins, the move will be extremely difficult to reverse. The longtime Jerusalem watcher Daniel Seidemann called it “Netanyahu's greatest ‘fuck you' to the int'l community, Israel's closest supporters and the prospects of any two state outcome.”

Proponents of such steps have long argued that they are essential to Israel's security. But signs that recently popped up around the Jewish Quarter of the Old City proclaiming Make Gaza Jewish Again, are among several indications of the growing ethno-religious justifications for Israel's provocative policies.

Yair Rosenberg: Israel's settler right is preparing to annex Gaza

The divide between religious and secular Jews has become Israel's deepest political fault line. Religious parties—many of which joined Netanyahu's coalition—have diverse and sometimes divergent agendas. The ultra-Orthodox parties tend to prioritize the preservation of funding for their separate educational system and of a controversial exemption from service in the army, a dispute over which might be the likeliest thing that could bring down Netanyahu's government.

The national-religious movement takes a different approach. Many of its adherents live in settlements and pursue their expansion. They disproportionately volunteer for combat units in Israel's security services, long the country's foremost secular institutions, with many serving near the West Bank settlements where they live. As much as 40 percent of the incoming IDF infantry officer corps is now drawn from the national-religious movement. And the recent nomination of a controversial religious nationalist to head the Shin Bet, Israel's version of the FBI, prompted resignation threats from other agency officials.

Christians and their holy sites have also come under threat. In Jerusalem, a cable-car project linking a Jewish neighborhood with the Old City cuts across the Mount of Olives, where Jesus is believed to have ascended. And for the first time, some church-owned land is being subjected to taxation—municipal officials in Jerusalem recently froze the bank accounts of the Greek Orthodox church over unpaid taxes.

In the West Bank in recent weeks, settlers have attacked a Catholic church in the Christian town of Taybeh and erected an outpost on the grounds of a Greek Orthodox church in the larger city of Jericho.

The religious dimensions of these disputes can add to an already overwhelming sense of intractability. “A conflict driven by politics can be resolved by politicians and diplomats,” Seidemann told me. “A religious conflict, only God can sort out.”

Considering the largely unforeseen landmark events of the past two years—the Gaza war, the destruction of Hezbollah, the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the bombing of Iran—no one can say with confidence where all of this is headed.In Israel, the discussion always returns to domestic politics, which were largely put on ice after October 7, as Israelis rallied around the flag. Netanyahu's main rival at the time of the attacks, the former IDF chief Benny Gantz, even joined him in a unity government.

The political détente that followed October 7 now shows signs of unraveling. Pressure is mounting on the government to name an official commission of inquiry to investigate how the October 7 attacks happened and why it took nearly two days to quell the Hamas onslaught.

For a year, polls have shown that Netanyahu's coalition would win fewer than than 50 Knesset seats, well below the 61 needed for a majority. Current odds favor a strange-bedfellows coalition, perhaps led by the right-wing former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett but including the centrist former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, as well as what's left of the left and maybe even one of the Arab parties.

One wild-card scenario—more coffeehouse conjecture than reality for now—is that Netanyahu, after the culmination earlier this summer of his quarter-century quest to attack Iran's nuclear program, might step away from politics entirely, perhaps in exchange for a pardon from President Isaac Herzog that would resolve his various corruption-related legal cases. But betting against either Netanyahu's staying power or his ability to outmaneuver political opponents, whatever the polls say, has long been a losing proposition.

A near-term election could yield a different approach to Gaza. Many opposition leaders I met with now argue for ending the war through a clean deal—a cease-fire in exchange for the release of all the remaining hostages, a position taken publicly by Eyal Hulata, the national security adviser to Prime Ministers Bennett and Lapid.

Whether it would lead to a different approach to the West Bank is far less clear. The so-called change government led by Lapid and Bennett, who once chaired the umbrella organization that represents all settlers, produced no less West Bank–settlement activity than the Netanyahu governments that preceded and followed it.

Indeed, there is little public pressure for a different approach to the West Bank, even from young Israelis. This summer, less than a third of all Israelis—and less than a quarter of Israeli Jews—said they support a Palestinian state, according to Tel Aviv University's Peace Index Survey. Even before October 7, when views in Israel hardened, almost 90 percent of Israelis ages 15 to 21 believed that Israel can remain a democracy while controlling Gaza and the West Bank, where residents cannot vote in Israeli elections, according to the Israeli pollster Dahlia Scheindlin.

That Palestinians are more and more invisible to most Israelis is partly responsible for this view, exacerbated by steps that Israel has taken to try to shield its population from terrorism, such as erecting a 440-mile-long separation barrier dividing Israel proper from the West Bank, or dramatically reducing work permits that once brought many thousands of Palestinians to Israel every day.

Palestinians are increasingly invisible to Americans too—U.S. officials from both parties spend far too little time engaging Palestinians, especially compared with the hours spent with Israeli counterparts.

All of this has eroded the decades-long bipartisan consensus on treating occupied areas such as the West Bank differently from the rest of Israel, or even using the word occupied at all, in spite of it being widely used in Israel.

Recent congressional delegations have visited, and even celebrated, settlements that the U.S. once condemned. Last week, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson met with settlers in Hebron and had dinner with Netanyahu in Shiloh, part of a string of settlements like Ariel, which Johnson also visited, that are making the establishment of a contiguous Palestinian state nearly impossible.

Over time, U.S. policy has evolved accordingly.

When E1 was first proposed, the Clinton administration reacted so negatively that the plan was shelved, at least for a while. As a journalist in 2008, I visited an outpost called Shvut Ami, which the IDF forcibly emptied on the eve of a visit by President George W. Bush after he called on Israeli leaders to “honor their commitments” and “get rid of unauthorized settlements.”

When I served as chief of staff to Secretary of State John Kerry, during the last direct peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, friction over West Bank settlements was still a standard facet of U.S.-Israel relations, peaking in late 2016 when President Barack Obama declined to veto a UN Security Council Resolution that declared settlement activity illegal. And even as the first Trump administration pursued the Abraham Accords, a genuine diplomatic breakthrough that normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors, it made Israel agree not to annex the West Bank.

But that administration otherwise paid little attention to settlements, despite the establishment of more than 30 new outposts and the first tenders for Givat Hamatos, a major development separating Jerusalem from the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

Assaf Gavron: What settler violence is doing to Israel

The Biden administration imposed sanctions on settlers who incited or engaged in violence, an important breakthrough. But we should have gone further, as we debated doing, and sanctioned Israeli officials who champion such violence too.

We also should have sooner restored the long-standing U.S. position, left in place from Trump's first term until 2024, that settlements are inconsistent with international law. And we somehow never reversed Trump's inexplicable requirement that imports to the U.S. from the West Bank be labeled Made in Israel.

In his second term, as Trump reversed Biden's settler sanctions, resumed shipments of the largest bombs we sell to Israel, and stopped hectoring Israeli officials hour by hour to increase humanitarian assistance, conditions in both Gaza and the West Bank have gone from very bad to even worse.

Israeli political and security officials are dismissive of the idea that the West Bank is on the verge of erupting; they point to a decrease in Palestinian terrorist attacks since they began their post–October 7 operations.

Historically, though, the Palestinian hope for a future state has been considered a counterweight to violence. But the most recent direct peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians were more than a decade ago, the longest such period since the early 1990s. Biden was the first U.S. president since George H. W. Bush not to name an envoy for peace negotiations, and, in his second term, Trump has followed suit. And neither U.S. officials nor Israeli politicians, including those on the left, talk much about a Palestinian state anymore.

For their part, given all of these dynamics, Arab citizens of Israel now openly debate suspending their political participation amid what they consider to be a genocide in Gaza being perpetrated by their neighbors. Several I met argued for boycotting the next election, although they were fully aware that that could bolster the performance of parties they strongly oppose.

West Bank Palestinians, who have not been afforded the opportunity to vote for their leaders since 2006, are similarly disillusioned. With rampant inflation and unemployment rising to more than 30 percent last year, support for both the PA and its longtime president, Mahmoud Abbas, has plunged in opinion polls.

A more troubling harbinger is that support for Hamas is far stronger. A majority in the West Bank believes that the decision to launch the October 7 attacks was “correct” and opposes the disarmament of Hamas in order to stop the war, according to data from the Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki.

The U.S. has rightly told Palestinians for decades to eschew what some call “violent resistance” to Israel's occupation. But the failure of both Palestinian politics and peacemaking diplomacy leaves few remaining avenues for Palestinians to pursue legitimate grievances.

The protections that made its balance possible are disappearing.



At night, the New Jersey Meadowlands can look like the entrance to hell. Smoke from a nearby garbage incinerator rises in plumes. The monstrous steel frame of a 3.5-mile bridge looms over cars racing in and out of New York City. For decades, such images defined the Meadowlands. The region was notorious as the fabled burial site of the Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa and the confirmed site of decades-long dump fires. It is the final resting place for household garbage, rubble from the London Blitz, the Doric columns of New York's old Penn Station, and toxic sludge from chemical manufacturing.



But the Meadowlands are also a salt marsh, currently home to more than 300 species of birds and 50 species of fish. If, instead of simply passing through by car or train, visitors were to take a walk on one of the district's trails or kayak through its creeks, they could look out across marshes and mudflats at cormorants, egrets, and ospreys—all against the backdrop of the New York City skyline.



The Meadowlands will never be an Eden. The 12 lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike that pass through the district aren't going anywhere anytime soon, nor are the Superfund sites. But since the 1970s, a combination of state and federal policies has steered the Meadowlands toward an unusual balance of waste disposal, development, and environmental protection. The naturalist John Quinn—who grew up at the edge of the district and wrote an illustrated guide to its history and ecology—once called the area's transformation a “Lazarus-like” resurrection.



Legal protections for such places, however, are now under threat. In 2023, the Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency restricted the reach of the Clean Water Act, rolling back its protections for the Meadowlands and places like them. This year, the Trump administration's implementation of that ruling has fueled further concern among scientists: The Natural Resources Defense Council warns that it could put “an area larger than Nevada”—71 million acres of wetlands, all told—at risk of destruction. If the Meadowlands represent an ideal of 21st-century conservation—one that weighs human interests with ecological ones—then the possibility they represent is fast slipping away.



Tom Marturano, the recently retired director of solid waste and natural resources for the district, spent his career working to create this version of the Meadowlands. When he took his job, in 1984, they were still the wasteland that Quinn called “environmental Armageddon.” Marturano's epithet of choice is “the dumping ground for all of society's ills.” He was hired to implement state environmental regulations mandating the cleanup of the Meadowlands' dumps to the point that they could be closed, one by one. Before he closed the dumps, Marturano also managed what went in them. He was once asked to accept a dead whale; another time, an entire shipping container of rotten garlic.

Those same landfills, now capped, are home to red-tailed hawks, falcons, and coyotes. Still, the Meadowlands' wildlife habitats are not wild in the traditional sense of being free from human activity: They include gas pipelines, highway overpasses, tide gates, planted marsh grasses, and man-made islands. This planting and sculpting of the marshes has been done to restore their health, but many of the efforts have been funded, paradoxically, by development—including by American Dream, the second-largest mall in America.



From a distance, American Dream looks like a spaceship that touched down next to the Hackensack River. The mall, which opened in 2019, covers some 3 million square feet and contains an indoor ski area. To build it, developers were required to fund the enhancement of 15.37 acres of wetland to compensate for those they had filled or otherwise affected. This mitigation was mandated by the Clean Water Act, which regulates filling and dumping in wetlands. The funds from the mall went toward improving the health of a nearby section of marsh, which, Marturano told me, was once “nothing but solid phragmites”—an invasive grass that tends to reduce habitat diversity. Now native Spartina grasses have returned, as have muskrats and threatened bird species. Thanks to the conservation restrictions that come with mitigation, yellow-crowned night herons and American kestrels can count on a habitat for years to come; this patch of marsh cannot be developed.



Mitigation is the deal that America has struck between its interest in human development and the preservation of its wetlands since the Clean Water Act passed, in 1972. Opinions differ, even among those who work in the Meadowlands, about how good a deal it has been. Marturano credits the mitigation system with what he calls the Meadowlands' “balance” of development and environmental protection. “Nobody,” he told me, would “just wake up one morning and say, ‘Let me enhance some wetlands.'” It's too expensive.



Bill Sheehan, the executive director of Hackensack Riverkeeper, is more skeptical. Sheehan, who wears a shark tooth around his neck and a drooping white mustache around his mouth, has been the Meadowlands' chief environmental advocate for 30 years. When I asked him to describe the role of mitigation in the district, his immediate response was: “It's a scam.” Especially in the late 1990s, he explained, mitigation was just “an excuse to destroy wetlands.” Although he's willing to support mitigation projects that he sees as serving a public good, he rejects the principle that improving the health of one wetland can compensate for the loss of another—not only because mitigation can fail, instead producing a bare mudflat, but also because these man-made attempts at ecological restoration are poor substitutes for nature's own repair work.



Terry Doss, who co-directs the Meadowlands Research and Restoration Institute—a state agency  that monitors water quality, sea-level rise, and wildlife habitat in the district—is more measured in her assessment than both Marturano or Sheehan. “Here in the Meadowlands, we have urban infrastructure,” she told me, “and so we will always have impacts. Therefore, we have to have mitigation.”



Right now, state laws still guarantee compensatory mitigation in the Meadowlands and protect them from unrestricted development. But, in 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Water Act applies only to wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a navigable body of water. This decision was widely condemned by environmental groups but welcomed by those who saw it as protecting individual property rights, especially the rights of farmers. For the Meadowlands and places like them, where infrastructure such as highways and tide gates might interrupt a “continuous surface connection,” the 2023 decision meant the unraveling of federal protections.



Still, when I asked Doss what she sees as the single greatest threat to the Meadowlands today, she spoke immediately of people's perceptions of the region. “People tend to say, ‘Oh, it's just phragmites; it's just a ditch,'” she replied. “‘It's polluted, you know. Move on.'”

For most of the Meadowlands' history, this is how people saw them. The region's shifting, mosquito-ridden ground was considered worthless land that needed to be “reclaimed”—drained or filled so that it could be used for agriculture (in the 19th century), for infrastructure and solid waste (in the 20th century), or for housing and warehousing (in the 21st). But over the past 50 years, ecologists have come to value wetlands not only as wildlife habitats but also as carbon sinks, defenses against rising seas, and filters for harmful pollutants. Preserving wetlands in concert with human infrastructure—as part of, rather than apart from, where people live—makes those places more aesthetically appealing, ecologically robust, and economically resilient.



Enhancing a marsh requires its own kind of balance: Reestablishing Spartina grasses, Marturano told me, can mean using bulldozers outfitted with snowshoe-like tracks to bring the marsh down to a particular elevation. If the marsh is brought too low, nothing will grow, and it will become a mudflat. If the marsh isn't cut low enough, the phragmites will remain and crowd out the Spartina grasses. Marturano took me through these stages as we walked across a former mitigation site. He stopped to point out a muskrat hut, a pair of hawks, a groundhog hole, and a group of cormorants. He may be an engineer by training, but the Meadowlands have given him a naturalist's eye for the habits of nonhuman creatures.







Some 3,500 acres of the Meadowlands, a patchwork of conservation areas and mitigation sites, are now protected from further human development. Many of the region's human structures—highways, rail lines—are protected, at least for the foreseeable future, by their use to millions of people. The question is not, then, whether the marsh or the human infrastructure will disappear completely, but how the balance between the two will—or won't—be maintained.

The president's latest criticism of museums is a thinly veiled attempt to erase Black history.

In what looks to be an intensifying quest to reshape American history and scholarship according to his own preferences, President Donald Trump this week targeted the Smithsonian Institution, the national repository of American history and memory. Trump seemed outraged, in particular, by the Smithsonian's portrayal of the Black experience in America. He took to Truth Social to complain that the country's museums “are, essentially, the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE.' The Smithsonian,” he wrote, “is OUT OF CONTROL.” Then Trump wrote something astonishing, even for him. He asserted that the narrative presented by the Smithsonian is overly focused on “how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”

Before continuing, it is important to pause a moment and state this directly: Donald Trump, the current president of the United States, believes that the Smithsonian is failing to do its job, because it spends too much time portraying slavery as “bad.”

After reading his post, I thought of the historian Lonnie Bunch, the current secretary of the Smithsonian—the first Black person to lead the institution since its founding in 1846—and the founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. In his 2016 speech at the grand opening of the museum, Bunch thanked Barack Obama and George W. Bush for their support. “We are at this moment because of the backing of the United States Congress and the White House,” he said, turning to them both onstage. It's sobering to consider how different things are today.

Bunch has been fighting efforts by the Trump administration to bring the Smithsonian into conformity with the MAGA vision of American history, and people familiar with his views say he is committed to protecting the intellectual integrity and independence of the Smithsonian. But how much longer, given Trump's ever more antagonistic position, will Bunch be able to withstand the presidential pressure? On Truth Social, Trump said he had “instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.” A recent letter to the Smithsonian from the White House states that the review will be completed and a final report issued by early 2026, in time for the nation's 250th anniversary, “to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism.”

Trump's Truth Social comment on slavery was unsettling for me not only because I am the descendant of enslaved people, and not only because I was born and raised in New Orleans, which was once the center of the domestic slave trade, but also because I am an American who believes that the only way to understand this country—the only way to love this country—is to tell the truth about it. Part of that truth is that chattel slavery, which lasted in the British American colonies and then the American nation for nearly 250 years, was indeed quite bad.

In 2021, I published a book about how we remember slavery. I have spent years reading the first-person accounts of formerly enslaved people discussing the myriad horrors they endured—the journey across the Middle Passage, the abuse, the sexual violence, the psychological terror, the family separations. It is worth taking the time, in light of the president's recent words, to revisit some of these accounts.

Adam Serwer: The new dark age

In 1789, Olaudah Equiano published The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African. His book was one of the first autobiographies ever published by a formerly enslaved person, and it laid the groundwork for a new genre of literature that would transform what people around the world understood about slavery. Equiano had been kidnapped from what is now Nigeria and marched for several months to the coast of West Africa. One of the most devastating scenes in his book describes the sadism of the Middle Passage:

The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died … The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.

The conditions were so bad, he writes, that some of the captives flung themselves overboard:

One day, when we had a smooth sea, and a moderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen, who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to such a life of misery, somehow made through the nettings, and jumped into the sea: immediately another quite dejected fellow, who, on account of his illness, was suffered to be out of irons, also followed their example; and I believe many more would soon have done the same, if they had not been prevented by the ship's crew.

Once they arrived on American shores, men, women, and children were forced onto auction blocks where families were broken apart. Once separated, most would never see one another again.

Henry Bibb, born enslaved in Kentucky, writes in his 1849 memoir:

After the men were all sold they then sold the women and children. They ordered the first woman to lay down her child and mount the auction block; she refused to give up her little one and clung to it as long as she could, while the cruel lash was applied to her back for disobedience. She pleaded for mercy in the name of God. But the child was torn from the arms of its mother amid the most heart rending-shrieks from the mother and child on the one hand, and bitter oaths and cruel lashes from the tyrants on the other. Finally the poor little child was torn from the mother while she was sacrificed to the highest bidder.

When the captives arrived at the home or plantation of their enslaver, many of them were forced to work in sweltering fields with hardly any respite. Their days began early. Austin Steward, born enslaved in Virginia, writes in his 1857 book:

It was the rule for the slaves to rise and be ready for their task by sun-rise, on the blowing of a horn or conch-shell; and woe be to the unfortunate, who was not in the field at the time appointed, which was in thirty minutes from the first sounding of the horn. I have heard the poor creatures beg as for their lives, of the inhuman overseer, to desist from his cruel punishment.

On the plantation, enslaved people were denied any physical autonomy, and were subjected to torturous, and often arbitrary, violence at the hands of overseers and enslavers. As William Coleman, born in Tennessee around 1853, recalled as part of an interview for the Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s:

I'se seen the slaves whipped for nothing, but then if they did do something to be whipped for they were almost killed before Maser would quit working on them … One time one of the slaves was helping Mistress there in the yard and he passed too close to her as he was hurrying fast as he could, and sort of bumped into her. She never paid him no attention, but Maser saw him and he let him go on ahead and finish what he was doing then he called that poor negro to him and took him out in the pasture, tied his hands together, throwed the other end of the rope over a limb on a tree and pulled that negro's hands up in the air to where that negro had to stand on his tiptoes, and Maser he took all that negro's clothes off and whipped him with that rawhide whip until that negro was plum bloody all over. Then he left that poor negro tied there all the rest of the day and night.

Enslaved Black women were particularly vulnerable to insidious and unrelenting sexual violence at the hands of their enslavers. In his 1857 book, William Anderson, born enslaved in Virginia, describes this:

My master often went to the house, got drunk, and then came out to the field to whip, cut, slash, curse, swear, beat and knock down several, for the smallest offense, or nothing at all.

He divested a poor female slave of all wearing apparel, tied her down to stakes, and whipped her with a handsaw until he broke it over her naked body. In process of time he ravished her person and became the father of a child by her.

The constant threat of such violence took an immense psychological toll on those who were subjected to it. Harriet Jacobs, born enslaved in North Carolina, writes in her 1861 book, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl:

He told me I was his property; that I must be subject to his will in all things … The degradation, the wrongs, the vices, that grow out of slavery, are more than I can describe. They are greater than you would willingly believe … My master met me at every turn, reminding me that I belonged to him, and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to him. If I went out for a breath of fresh air after a day of unwearied toil, his footsteps dogged me. If I knelt by my mother's grave, his dark shadow fell on me even there. The light heart which nature had given me became heavy with sad forebodings.

The consequences of being caught in an attempted escape were so severe that most enslaved people never dared try. In Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, Twelve Years a Slave, he describes watching what happened to an enslaved man who ran away and then was captured several weeks later:

Wiley was stripped, and compelled to endure one of those inhuman floggings to which the poor slave is so often subjected. It was the first and last attempt of Wiley to run away. The long scars upon his back, which he will carry with him to the grave, perpetually remind him of the dangers of such a step.

Even after slavery was formally abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, the pain the institution wrought on the country's 4 million freedmen and freedwomen continued to reverberate. Throughout the late 19th century, newly emancipated Black people used newspapers to try to locate family members they had been separated from many years before. The Christian Recorder published this ad following the war in 1865:

INFORMATION WANTED

Of my mother and father, Caroline and Issac Denna; also, my sisters, Fanny, Jane and Betsy Denna, and my brothers, Robert R., Hugh Henry, and Philander Denna. We were born in Fauquier Co, Va. In 1849 they were taken from the plantation of Josiah Lidbaugh, in said county, and carried to Winchester to be sold. About the same time I left my home in Clark Co, and have not heard from them since. The different ministers of Christian churches will do a favor by announcing the above, and any information will be gladly received by GEO. HENRY DENNA, Galva, Henry Co.

For many, the search meant trying to find someone they hadn't seen for decades. Nancy Jones published this ad in 1886, more than 30 years after she had last seen her son:

INFORMATION WANTED of my son, Allen Jones. He left me before the war, in Mississippi. He wrote me a letter in 1853 in which letter he said that he was sold to the highest bidder, a gentleman in Charleston, S.C. Nancy Jones, his mother, would like to know the whereabouts of the above named person.

Whether mother and son were ever reunited is unknown.

None of us can imagine what it is like to be subjected to the unremitting physical, psychological, and social violence of chattel slavery. But museums such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture bring us closer to being able to do so by sharing first-person accounts of those who lived through that terrible violence. At these museums, we see the garments enslaved people wore, the tools they used, the structures in which they lived. We see their faces; we hear their voices.

Clint Smith: Telling the truth about slavery is not ‘indoctrination'

The NMAAHC, in particular, is unflinching in its characterization of slavery as an unequivocally evil system, one whose impact continues to be felt across our society. In 1860, the 4 million enslaved Black people were worth more than every bank, factory, and railroad combined. Today, although they make up 14 percent of the population, Black people own less than 4 percent of the nation's wealth.

Still, the museum also makes clear that the Black American experience is not singularly defined by slavery, but also by the art, literature, and cultural traditions that have emerged from, and in spite of, centuries of interpersonal and structural violence. These are not mutually exclusive, and the NMAAHC understands that Americans should learn about both.

And yet the MAGA movement wants to tell a story about America that is disproportionately focused on what its proponents perceive to be the exceptionalism of this country. They are invested in this story because having to look too closely at the disturbing parts of American history would mean having to look closely at the disturbing parts of themselves. But instead of ignoring the shameful parts of our past, shouldn't we—as individuals and as a country—want to learn from aspects of our history that we are not proud of? What other way is there to become the version of ourselves that we aspire to be?

The Trump administration is, in both public discourse and public policy, arguably the most racist presidential administration in modern American history. Each week seems to bring a new example of its bigotry. I am sometimes tempted, upon encountering yet another instance of this omnipresent racial antagonism, to let it be. How many ways can you say the same thing over and over again? And yet, we must write it down, if for nothing else, then for the sake of those who will come after us. I think of Frederick Douglass, who wrote about the monstrousness of slavery even when the idea of abolition seemed preposterous to most Americans. W. E. B. Du Bois wrote about how the nation must hold on to the values of Reconstruction long after federal soldiers marched out of the former Confederacy and abandoned Black southerners. Ida B. Wells wrote about the lynchings taking place throughout the South even as fresh bodies were still swinging from the trees. Their words were essential because they remind us that some Americans did bear witness to, and stand against, these atrocities.

This is part of the reality of Black life in this country: We must make a record of those forces that seek to erase us and erase our histories so that future generations know we did not simply accept it. Our ancestors' words remind us that we never have.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In places with significant abortion restrictions, many pregnant women experience delays, confusion, and other substandard care.

After Kaitlyn Kash delivered her baby daughter at Austin's Ascension Seton Medical Center in July 2023, she began hemorrhaging. Her doctor told her that her placenta had not come out of her body as it should have after the baby was delivered and that she would need a D&C—a procedure that removes the contents of the uterus.

Kash consented, but then, she told me, nothing happened. “Are we going to the operating room?” Kash kept asking. She started shaking and vomiting. Hospital staff took her newborn daughter off her chest.

After about 45 minutes, Kash was wheeled to the OR—where, she said, she faced more delays. “People were running around, and there was slamming of cabinets,” she told me. The staff didn't seem prepared. Kash remembers thinking that she was going to die, that she would never get to name her daughter. She struggled to speak, then passed out.

When she awoke after the procedure, a nurse told her that she was lucky she still had her uterus. She'd bled so much, she ended up needing a transfusion.

Kash didn't understand what had happened, nor, she says, did the hospital tell her. Only after being discharged and speaking with a nurse-practitioner friend did she realize that her experience was not typical of a D&C. The procedure does not typically take hours, involve significant blood loss, or risk the loss of a uterus.

It is, however, commonly used for first-trimester abortions. The words of the hospital social worker Kash spoke with before she was discharged stuck out to her: “We don't do D&Cs anymore,” the woman said, according to Kash. Of course, emergencies during delivery can be chaotic anywhere. But Kash began to suspect that, because Texas had banned virtually all abortions in 2022, following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, either the equipment to perform the D&C was not ready, or the hospital was struggling to justify performing one, even for a placenta. Soon, she joined a lawsuit against the state of Texas over its abortion laws. (Kash provided medical records that support that she had a D&C and lost blood. The hospital did not respond to a request for comment, and it is not part of Kash's lawsuit.)

I found Kash's experience particularly unnerving because my husband and I are planning a move to a state that bans abortion after six weeks. After hearing and reading stories like hers, we are wondering if our move means that we should not have another child. Kash's experience is representative of the kinds of delays, confusion, and other substandard care that some pregnant women now experience in the 19 states that enacted significant abortion restrictions after Dobbs. Pregnancy and childbirth are risky no matter where you live, but the grim stories and maternal-health statistics coming out of abortion-restrictive states have made me consider how safe it is to have a baby in one of them.

Read: ‘That's something you won't recover from as a doctor'

Today, Kash doesn't blame the doctors or staffers at the hospital; she blames Texas's abortion laws for causing unnecessary confusion. She wishes she could have been pregnant and delivered her baby somewhere else. But at the same time, her best friends live in Austin, and her close family lives in Dallas and Houston. “It's not easy to leave,” she said. “Texas is my home.”

Every year, of course, hundreds of thousands of people safely have babies in Texas and other states with near or total abortion bans. But some women with pregnancy complications do encounter doctors who are afraid to act quickly to provide life- or health-preserving terminations, according to interviews I did with legal and medical experts, patients, and 15 doctors who practice in these states. Though the bans make exceptions to protect the mother's life, they contain so much uncertainty that some doctors, fearing prison time or the loss of their license, try hard to avoid providing abortions, even when they are medically indicated.

Sometimes, a doctor may be too scared to give the patient an abortion and so point her to a neighboring state. The delays involved in travel can push inevitable abortions later into pregnancy, when they can become more complicated. Other times, the fear manifests as doctors choosing a more invasive or less-effective procedure instead of one that might be considered an abortion. Sarah Osmundson, an obstetrician in Tennessee, offered me the example of an ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies are almost never viable, and if left untreated can be fatal for the mother. The safest and simplest way to address an ectopic pregnancy is to give the patient methotrexate. But this drug can be seen as an abortifacient, so some doctors in restrictive states might opt to remove the patient's fallopian tube instead, according to Osmundson, which could impair her future fertility. “We're requiring a patient to undergo a surgical procedure as opposed to a very safe medical treatment that we have,” she said. This nearly happened to Representative Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, when she went to an emergency room with an ectopic pregnancy in 2024 and where, she said, doctors resisted giving her methotrexate because they were worried about losing their medical licenses or going to jail for doing so.

Even if a doctor is comfortable providing a medically indicated abortion, they need to find scrub techs, nursing staff, and anesthesiologists who are, as well. And they might not be able to. “Abortion care doesn't happen individually in a hospital,” says Leilah Zahedi-Spung, an obstetrician in Colorado who previously practiced in Tennessee, where abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions. “I anticipated a lot of trouble finding people who felt safe participating in the care.” Tennessee's abortion laws contributed to her decision to leave the state.

The most consistent concern I heard raised by the providers I spoke with is that the new bans cause unacceptable delays in patient care. In abortion-restrictive states, some hospitals have created task forces and committees of lawyers to help doctors figure out how to comply, which can slow down the process of treating at-risk patients. “There sometimes are delays while there's this sussing out of like, ‘How do we take care of this?'” Lara Hart, an obstetrician in Georgia, where a six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2022, told me. Though Hart praises her own hospital's processes for dealing with tricky cases, she said her job now requires more paperwork and calling around to different departments. She told me that she sometimes wonders, “Is some overzealous district attorney gonna come and arrest us or something?” She remembers arriving at work at her previous practice to find a patient in the ICU with sepsis and on a ventilator. The woman had come in with previable PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes), a condition in which a woman's water breaks too early in pregnancy. The other doctors were reluctant to offer her an abortion, which is a standard treatment. She began hemorrhaging so much that Hart had to perform a hysterectomy. Hart remembers feeling angry. “I shouldn't be here doing this,” she thought. “This should have been taken care of a week ago before she was so sick.”

Read: The abortion absolutist

Certain states' bans say an abortion can be performed to avoid “death or substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,” but some doctors say this guideline is unclear because many situations can go from reversible to irreversible within minutes. A recent study of post-Dobbs obstetric care in states with abortion bans highlighted this problem. It concluded that, because abortion laws tend to focus on the patient's current health status, doctors in these states are often unable to consider the likely future health of a patient—including life-threatening emergencies that are all but certain to arise. “In obstetrics, there is an inch of black and an inch of white and, like a thousand yards of gray,” Hart said. This regulation also contradicts typical standards of care, according to Dawn Bingham, an obstetrician who is currently suing South Carolina over its abortion ban. “There's nothing else in medicine that we wait for people to get sicker,” she told me.

Quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests that the delays created by abortion restrictions are having an effect on health care. A recent report from the Gender Equity Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for women's equality, found that, although the overall risk of dying from pregnancy is low, mothers living in states where abortion is banned were nearly twice as likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth compared with mothers living in states where abortion is accessible. In states with abortion bans, Black mothers were more than three times as likely to die as white mothers. ProPublica found that when Texas banned abortion after six weeks in 2021, rates of sepsis increased by more than 50 percent for women hospitalized with miscarriages in the second trimester, likely because women were being made to wait until either there was no fetal heartbeat, leaving them at higher risk for an infection, or their infection became life-threatening. ProPublica also found that after Texas banned abortion, blood transfusions during emergency-room visits for first-trimester miscarriages increased by 54 percent, suggesting that doctors were avoiding performing D&Cs. At least four women in states with near-total abortion bans have died because they were denied an abortion, according to news reports. In a 2023 survey from KFF, a health-care nonprofit, four in 10 ob-gyns in abortion-ban states said the Dobbs ruling made providing care during miscarriages or other pregnancy emergencies harder.

A qualitative study involving anonymous doctors in abortion-ban states offers quotes such as “The way our legal teams interpreted it, until they became septic or started hemorrhaging, we couldn't proceed.” In another study, a doctor described a patient who came in 15 weeks pregnant and hemorrhaging, with “blood everywhere, bleeding through her clothes.” But because the fetus had a heartbeat, the doctor had to talk to the hospital's risk-management department before performing an abortion. “There's less evidence-based health care that is provided for everyone that needs it in those states,” Nikki Zite, an obstetrician in Tennessee, told me. When I asked Nicole Schlechter, another Tennessee obstetrician, about the higher mortality rates in abortion-ban states, she put it more simply: “People are dying from being pregnant.”

Supporters of abortion bans deny that conditions are dire. Ingrid Skop, the vice president and director of medical affairs for the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a nonprofit that advocates against abortion, said in an email that “all pro-life state laws allow doctors to exercise their reasonable medical judgment to treat women with pregnancy emergencies, and no law requires certainty or imminence before a doctor can act.” She also pointed out that “no doctor has been prosecuted since Dobbs for performing an abortion to protect the life of the mother.” Christina Francis, the CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) and an obstetric hospitalist in Indiana, told me her practice has been unaffected by her state's near-total ban on abortion. She says any hesitation of doctors to act in emergency situations is a result of hospitals failing to adequately prepare their physicians. “The problem is not the law,” she told me, “but rather either the guidance or the lack of guidance that physicians are receiving.”

Some states are aiming to clarify their abortion bans. In June, Texas passed the Life of the Mother Act, which clarifies when the state's near-total abortion ban allows for the procedure, saying explicitly that physicians do not need to wait until a patient is in imminent danger of dying to perform an abortion. In Tennessee, a new law clarifies that abortions can be performed in cases of previable PPROM and severe preeclampsia. In Kentucky, a clarification law added conditions under which doctors can legally perform an abortion, such as hemorrhage and ectopic and molar pregnancies.

Some Texas doctors I interviewed support the clarification law. Todd Ivey, an obstetrician in Houston, told me he thinks it “is going to help us some.” He said he wishes the law had exceptions for fetal abnormalities, rape, and incest, but that Texas doctors shouldn't “let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”

But some experts say the clarification bills don't offer doctors much security, because some obstetric emergencies may not meet the laws' precise legal language. For instance, John Thoppil, an obstetrician in Austin who supports the Texas clarification law, once had a patient whose fetus had a fatal anomaly. He diagnosed the condition at 12 weeks, but the woman was not able to travel out of state for a termination until she was 18 weeks along. In the intervening time, her placenta began to invade her scar from a previous C-section, something that would not have happened, Thoppil told me, if he had been able to perform the abortion at 12 weeks. The patient was hospitalized after the abortion and had to have another procedure, almost losing her uterus in the process. The Texas clarification law, he told me, would not have changed her situation.

This confusion may get worse now that the Trump administration has revoked Biden-era guidance saying hospitals in abortion-ban states must provide abortions if the procedure would stabilize a woman experiencing a medical emergency.

Hector Chapa, an obstetrician in south-central Texas and a member of AAPLOG, told me that this revocation didn't matter, and that doctors could and should still treat patients in an emergency. “EMTALA still stands,” he said, referring to a federal law that hospitals must stabilize patients. “EMTALA has never gone away.” But Andreia Alexander, an ER doctor in Indiana, told me that patients should not want a doctor who hesitates to save their life. “If somebody is dying in front of me,” she said, “I can't be thrown off my game to think for a minute about whether or not my actions are going to cause me to be thrown in jail, lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, or lose my medical license.”

The horror stories I heard during my reporting are shocking but rare. In one study, the most common scenario that physicians said they struggled with, post-Dobbs, was PPROM in the second trimester. The risk of previable PPROM is extremely low: less than 1 percent. But in pregnancy, small percentages matter. Osmundson told me her hospital sees a previable PPROM patient about once a month. In my own pregnancy, I had multiple complications that occur very rarely. Complications seem unlikely until they happen to you.

I asked every provider I interviewed whether having a baby in their state is safe, given the current abortion restrictions. Almost all of them said yes. But almost all of them also qualified their answer. They said they, personally, would take appropriate care of a pregnant woman, but they couldn't say the same about every provider in the state now that the abortion laws have made administering emergency care so much more complicated. They said pregnancy had become “less safe” or “scarier” or “safe, if you have resources.” There's a new charge to what were previously purely medical conversations with patients: Thoppil said patients ask him “every week” if having a baby in Texas is safe, and Emily Briggs, a private-practice family-medicine doctor in New Braunfels, told me that patients have asked her if they should leave Texas. Hart told me she's had patients who “get on contraception because they say that they are scared to be pregnant in Georgia.”

Read: I found the outer limits of my pro-choice beliefs

The future of obstetric care in abortion-ban states also seems murky because fewer medical students are applying to residencies in states with abortion bans. Zite says she's not able to train her obstetric residents in the same ways she was before Dobbs, and she's not sure what's going to happen with the next generation of doctors after hers retires.

I spoke with some women who aren't willing to risk having a child, or another child, under these circumstances. Jessi Schoop Villman, who lives outside of Houston and has a history of miscarriages, decided not to try for a second child after Texas banned abortions. “I couldn't stand the thought of something happening and leaving the baby we already have without a mother and my husband without a partner,” she told me.

Nisha Verma, an obstetrician who works in both Georgia and Maryland, told me she recently saw a patient who was eligible for an abortion in Georgia because she was less than six weeks pregnant. The woman said that she would consider having the baby, “but I am scared to be pregnant in this state as a Black woman,” Verma remembers her saying. “If I developed a complication like I did in my last pregnancy, I wouldn't be able to get care and I could die.” The woman did something that crafters of abortion bans likely would not have wanted: Just days before it would have been too late to do so, she terminated the pregnancy.

Ford may just be building the EV we've all been waiting for.

President Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electric vehicles and is slamming the brakes on government incentives to get them into more driveways.

He's been working to undo policies that promote clean technologies while increasing support for coal, oil, and natural gas. In particular, Trump has been working to reverse or halt programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest US government investment to deal with climate change, signed into law by his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Under Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying a new electric car, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs and $40,000 for commercial EVs, is set to expire on September 30.

Those moves may have contributed to Trump's messy split with Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and former head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on Truth Social in June.

More than 90 percent of new cars sold in the US are still gasoline-powered, and EV sales have recently seen a slowdown in the US following a years-long growth spurt. The looming rollback of federal incentives, along with inflation concerns, rising manufacturing costs from tariffs, and increasing competition over raw materials, have led carmakers to cut back on many of the enticements that have made electric cars a better buy.

Many car dealers have also been struggling to move EVs off their lots as customers remain worried about charging infrastructure and cost.

But despite all of these challenges, the popularity of EVs in the US is still growing, and some US automakers remain committed to running on electrons. And in other countries, EVs are racing ahead. More than half of new cars sold in China are electric or hybrids, backed by generous government subsidies. People clearly are willing to drive EVs — at the right price.

Last week, Ford announced that it was pouring $5 billion into building a new EV platform — a chassis and drivetrain for a suite of electric vehicles — in Louisville, Kentucky. The first vehicle rolling off the line will be a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000. That would put it in line with some of the cheapest pickup trucks on the market today, electric or gasoline. And Ford aims to start deliveries in 2027, less than two years from now.

It's an ambitious, risky bet in a volatile economy, but it's a sign that, while electric vehicles may be slowing down in the US, automakers think they aren't stopping and could accelerate again. It's also good news for anyone concerned about rising greenhouse gas emissions, since transportation is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.

This isn't Ford's first run at an electric pickup truck. In 2021, Ford debuted the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its iconic Ford F-150, the best-selling pickup truck in the US for almost five decades. At times, Ford was selling 100 conventional F-150s per hour.

So, it made a lot of sense that Ford would want to build on that successful platform to go electric. And at first, it seemed like their bet was paying off. Interest was high, and its initial production run for the 2022 model year sold out. The F-150 Lightning was named the 2023 MotorTrend Truck of the Year. Rivals at General Motors and Stellantis (the parent company of Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler) responded by developing their own electric pickups. But Ford ran into issues with its battery suppliers while the auto industry as a whole hit supply chain snags during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lightning sales quickly hit a pothole, and Ford even paused production for a few months last year.

At the time, I argued that the Ford F-150 Lightning was not the EV America was waiting for. It was too expensive to be the mass market truck that would tip American drivers away from gasoline and toward batteries. The base model Lightning launched at close to $40,000, and the current base model is almost $50,000.

The Lightning was another entry in the US auto industry's general trend of moving upmarket with bigger, pricier, and more profitable vehicles. Carveouts in fuel economy rules for trucks and SUVs have also contributed to vehicle bloat in recent decades.

The average new car price in the US has reached a record high of almost $50,000 in a country where the median household income is around $80,000. Even pickup trucks, which evoke a burly, working-class aesthetic, are often kitted out and priced like luxury cars. That means a lot of Americans are borrowing to buy them. The average new car payment is $745, and auto loans are the second-largest category of household debt.

Electrification adds another cost. Though electricity is cheaper than gasoline, the average EV has a higher sticker price than its gasoline counterpart. For some automakers, like Tesla and Rivian, this is part of their strategy. First, start by building a high-end vehicle, creating the supply chains and charging network to support it. Then, after achieving economies of scale, start building cheaper vehicles. But so far, carmakers have continued to make more expensive models and have been slow to release cheaper EVs.

Public EV chargers are also nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations, and the ones available haven't always been reliable. The Trump administration halted $5 billion in funding for more EV chargers, but after a court injunction, it began to release the cash.

“The top barrier for [EV] adoption is price, and then infrastructure,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

So, now, Ford is following a different route.

The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

Its bet on a $30,000 truck is an inversion of the start-expensive-then-go-cheap strategy, and the company argues it's a return to form. “Nearly 120 years ago, the Ford Model T became the ‘Universal Car.' Why? It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable,” wrote Ford CEO Jim Farley recently. “Now, we're ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform.”

Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, a market research firm focused on the auto industry, noted that this isn't necessarily a shift for the company, but rather, a foray into the global market and an often overlooked swath of potential buyers at home that US automakers have largely ceded to foreign brands.

The customers looking to buy a cheap truck aren't cross-shopping for a fully tricked-out F-150. And the growing cult of the Kei truck, a variety of tiny, cheap, lightweight gray-market Japanese imports, is an indication that there's an unfed appetite for small utility vehicles in the US.

“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were? Yes,” Baum said. “Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles? Absolutely not.”

The other factor to consider is that, while the US is the land of big trucks, it isn't the only place where people are buying them.

In the rest of the world, small, cheap cars are still in high demand. Some of the biggest growth markets are in places like southeast Asia, places with high gas prices, narrow roads, and a burgeoning middle class eager to get around. Inside the US, the government has used tariffs to keep Chinese electric carmakers like BYD off the interstate, but they've since become dominant in other countries. BYD is now the largest EV manufacturer in the world, while global EV sales are set to break new records this year and US carmakers are still trying to get out of the pit lane.

Meanwhile, massive markets like the European Union are still maintaining their environmental regulations, including a ban on the sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.

So even with rollbacks of EV incentives and reversing regulations that promote cleaner vehicles in the US, carmakers are still facing a lot of pressure to make cleaner vehicles if they want to be competitive in the global market. And companies like Ford want to be competitive in the global market. The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

They're also facing the added constraint of tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earth metals. Ford said its new EV platform is aimed at exports as well as the domestic market and that critical components like batteries will be manufactured within the US without using critical minerals like nickel and cobalt.

The energy sector offers a useful parallel. Wind and solar power are now the main ways the world is adding more electricity to the power grid — not because of environmental regulations, but because it's cheap and quick to get them up and running.

A lower price point is a stronger argument than any climate change bona fides. The words “environment,” “climate,” “carbon,” and “emissions” were conspicuously absent in Ford's universal EV platform announcement. While the transition to cleaner vehicles is slowing, once EVs are cheaper and better than internal combustion cars, they will race ahead and take a commanding lead.

“The rest of the world's going electric,” Valdez Streaty said. “I think we'll continue to see that technology advancement, but definitely we have a lot of hurdles and bumps in the road right now.”

My brain hurts.

Late Thursday afternoon, the Supreme Court handed down an incomprehensible order concerning the Trump administration's decision to cancel numerous public health grants. The array of six opinions in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association is so labyrinthine that any judge who attempts to parse it risks being devoured by a minotaur.

As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writes in a partial dissent, the decision is “Calvinball jurisprudence,” which appears to be designed to ensure that “this Administration always wins.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The case involves thousands of NIH grants that the Trump administration abruptly canceled which, according to Jackson, involve “research into suicide risk and prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease,” among other things. The grants were canceled in response to executive orders prohibiting grants relating to DEI, gender identity, or Covid-19.

A federal district court ruled that this policy was unlawful — “arbitrary and capricious” in the language of federal administrative law — in part because the executive orders gave NIH officials no precise guidance on which grants should be canceled. As Jackson summarized the district court's reasoning, “‘DEI'—the central concept the executive orders aimed to extirpate—was nowhere defined,” leaving NIH officials “to arrive at whatever conclusion [they] wishe[d]” regarding which grants should be terminated.

According to Jackson, “the court found, as a factual matter, ‘an unmistakable pattern of discrimination against women's health issues' and ‘pervasive racial discrimination'—indeed, ‘palpable' racial discrimination of a sort the judge had ‘never seen' in 40 years on the bench.”

The question of whether this judge was correct to deem the Trump administration's policy arbitrary and capricious, however, was not before the Supreme Court. Instead, the case hinged on a jurisdictional dispute.

As a general rule, lawsuits alleging that a federal policy is illegal are heard by federal district courts, while suits alleging that the federal government breached a contract are heard by the Court of Federal Claims.

In NIH, the plaintiffs alleged that the broader policy that led to their grants being canceled was illegal, so that suggests that this case should have been brought in a district court (which is where it was actually brought). But the case also bears some superficial similarity to a breach of contract suit, because it involved the government's decision not to pay money that it had previously agreed to pay.

Four justices — the three Democrats plus Chief Justice John Roberts — concluded that these plaintiffs were right to bring their suit in the district court. Four other justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — concluded that the case must be brought in the Court of Claims. That would mean that these plaintiffs would have to start over again in the claims court, and possibly that they would have to bring individual suits seeking to reinstate individual grants, rather than seeking a broad order attacking the entire grant cancellation policy.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, cast the deciding vote. She claims that this suit must be split between the two courts. In her view, the district court was the proper venue for the plaintiffs to argue that the overall policy is illegal, but the claims court is the proper venue for them to actually seek the money they would have received if the grants are not canceled.

If that sounds confusing, it gets worse. Barrett's opinion states that federal law bars the claims court from hearing “claims pending in other courts when those claims arise from ‘substantially the same operative facts.'” So these plaintiffs likely must wait until after they have fully litigated the question of whether the Trump administration's broad policy is illegal in district court, before they can actually try to get any money in the claims court.

That could take years, especially if the first question is heard by the justices again. Moreover, as Jackson warns in her opinion, by the time the first round of litigation is finished, the plaintiffs may be unable to seek relief in the claims court because the statute of limitations for doing so will have expired.

The bottom line is that, because there are five votes for the proposition that some parts of this case go to the district court, and also five votes for the proposition that other parts of it go to the claims court, Barrett's opinion controls the case. By the time this mess gets sorted out, it is likely that most — if not all — of the research at issue in NIH will be lost, even if the plaintiffs do prevail.

As Jackson writes, without any money to fund their operations, the grant recipients will need to “euthanize animal subjects, terminate life-saving trials, and close community health clinics.”

There are actually even more complexities in this case, but rather than engage in the Sysiphean task of trying to list all of them, I will simply repeat Jackson's summary of what appears to be going on here:

In a broader sense, however, today's ruling is of a piece with this Court's recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.

Godspeed to the poor lawyers and judges who now have to untangle the mess this Court just created.

Trump's new fee will make the USAID cuts look like a rounding error in some countries.

Immigrant rights activist Guerline Jozef can't count the number of frantic texts, calls, and emails she gets daily from Haitians in the United States terrified that some day soon, they won't be able to feed their families anymore.

Not just those in the US, but their “mother, sister, niece, a cousin, a church member” back in Haiti, who heavily depend on their breadwinner abroad to survive.

“Entire neighborhoods are being provided for by the diaspora,” said Jozef, co-founder of the Haitian Bridge Alliance in San Diego. “Haiti is literally being held together by those of us who are outside of the country and sending money back home.”

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Haiti's decades-long humanitarian crisis deepens each day, forcing immigrants to send record-high payments back home in recent years. Each Haitian immigrant living abroad supports a dozen or so friends, family, or community members in their home country, many of whom rely on those payments to survive, Jozef says.

But that money — formally called remittances — is about to get more expensive to send, thanks to a new tax tucked into President Donald Trump's new spending bill. The 1 percent tax passed as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted by Congress last month and will go into effect starting January 1, 2026.

Though 1 percent might not sound like much, it could mean billions of dollars that never reach grandparents who need medical care, homes that fall into disrepair, and girls unable to stay in school.

About 200 million immigrant workers support about 800 million family members in their home countries each year — together, that's roughly one in eight people worldwide. For every dollar that a wealthy nation sends in foreign aid, immigrants send almost four times as much back home, totaling over $700 billion worldwide — enough to buy up every home for sale in the US and still have billions to spare. In over 60 countries, remittances make up more than 3 percent of GDP, and in some places, they make up well over a quarter of the entire economy, the equivalent share of the entire manufacturing, retail, and health care industries in the United States combined.

When the tax goes into effect next year, Haitians could lose about $61 million annually in direct payments for food, shelter, and health care, according to the Center for Global Development. Globally, the losses will add up to about $4.5 billion.

This economic pain is on top of the absolute gutting of USAID, which around the world, once paid for almost half of all food aid, roughly 70 percent of the global response to HIV/AIDS, and contraceptive care for almost 50 million women and couples each year. The agency's sudden demise has left a multibillion-dollar vacuum for peace building, humanitarian relief, and health infrastructure in dozens of low- and middle-income countries where those funds made a tremendous difference.

But as big of a deal as USAID was, remittances are actually an even bigger deal. And the US is targeting immigrants' hard-earned cash at a moment when the world can afford it least. Many countries — like India, Guatemala, and the Philippines — will lose way more money from this 1 percent tax on remittances than they will from foreign aid cuts. Losing yet another lifeline will be beyond catastrophic — it could further destabilize countries already steeped in crisis.

If remittances fall, “it will mean more famine,” Jozef said. “It will mean more people dying.”

Immigrants in the US sent almost $100 billion overseas last year, mostly to low- or middle-income countries, making it the world's largest source of remittances. Every family is different, but most immigrant workers send about 15 percent of their salary or upward of $300 per month back home.

Let's say you're an immigrant from Honduras trying to send some extra money home this month to help cover your brother's back-to-school fees. One option is to ask your bank or use an app to initiate an international transfer — but the teller might not speak your language, you get paid in cash, and like most Hondurans, your family doesn't have a bank account to transfer to anyway.

So instead, like most immigrants, you walk up the block to your local money transfer shop. Say, a Western Union nestled in your neighborhood pharmacy, and tell the agent how much money you want to send. You hand her your ID, a form, and a few hundred dollars over the counter. Right away, they take out about $15 in fees — plus an extra couple of dollars once the tax kicks in.

After a bit of paperwork, they process the rest, and in a few minutes, voilà. In Honduras, your mom walks to the Western Union shop up the street from your elementary school and picks up her cash.

It's hard to overstate the importance of these payments. Remittances have been proven to reduce infant mortality, boost school enrollment, and fuel housing construction around the world. Studies show that they play a significant role in helping countries achieve sustainable development goals like clean water for all. Manuel Orozco, director of the Migration, Remittances, and Development Program at the Inter-American Dialogue, has been trying to get Americans to care about remittances for the past 30 years.

“I feel like I'm preaching the gospel of remittances and financial inclusion,” he said. “And all administrations, including the Biden administration, just didn't want to pay attention to these issues.” But in many countries, “GDP growth basically depends on remittances.”

For example, Nepal's tourism industry raked in a hefty $2.5 billion in 2023, but it was no match for the $11 billion Nepalese workers abroad sent home that year. Honduras relies twice as much on remittances as it does on agriculture, its next largest chunk of GDP. Guatemala's economy is 10 times as dependent on remittances as it is on bananas, the country's largest export.

And in places without food stamps or Medicaid, those payments function as a vast, invisible, global social safety net, ensuring that the world's poorest don't fall through the cracks.

More often than not, remittances directly support families' basic needs like food, housing, education, and medical care, filling gaps that traditional aid programs might not reach, said Dulce Guzmán, executive director of Alianza Americas, a network of immigrant-serving groups based in Chicago. “They're a huge pillar for sustaining life in our countries of origin.”

When remittances do get attention, it's usually from Republicans, and it's almost never a good thing.

“The purpose is not to be mean,” said Ira Mehlman, who works at the anti-immigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform, which the Southern Poverty Law Center defines as a hate group for its hardline stance. The group lobbied hard for the 1 percent tax, which he hopes will encourage immigrants to self-deport.

“It's no different than if you're cruising along on the highway at 80 miles an hour and you see somebody else getting pulled over for speeding,” he argued. “You change your behavior, take your foot off the gas.”

Only it is very, very, very different. Because taking your foot off the gas here means cutting off millions of vulnerable people from the money they need to survive.

Under normal circumstances, remittances rise when foreign aid is cut, but that won't be easy this time around with so many countries hit by both aid cuts and the tax on money transfers. The tax — which to Mehlman's chagrin, a hodgepodge of fintech, free market, and pro-immigrant lobbyists haggled down from 5 percent in an initial proposal — will require senders to pay a 1 percent fee on all cash transfers.

Money transfer agents or bank tellers will be required to apply the tax on any cash, money orders, or cashier's checks sent overseas, similar to a restaurant collecting a sales tax on the food and beverages it serves. If businesses fail to collect the tax as required, they're on the hook for paying it themselves along with any penalties or interest fees.

Digital transfers will be exempt from the tax. But sending money between foreign bank accounts is not as simple as using Venmo or Zelle, which require a US bank account to use — something many immigrants and their families don't have. Despite the rise of app-based providers like Remitly, which is tailor-made for overseas transfers, many immigrants still make the monthly trek to Western Union to send money home because that's what they and their recipients — often elderly parents or grandparents — back home are used to and trust.

So let's take a look at what this looks like for a family in El Salvador, for example. Without the $1,600 that Damaris Ortega sends home from Texas each month, her mother and three children in El Salvador could never afford to eat meat. Just the basics there — rice, beans, eggs, vegetables — cost “basically your entire salary” each month, she said.

“It harms industry. It harms individuals. It harms our national security.”

There would be no new clothes to wear to school. No money to pay tuition. No savings to go to college. If they ever got sick or hurt, her family couldn't afford the gauze, bandages, or medications they'd need to bring to local hospitals that rarely have those on hand.

“The contributions we send from here to there — many families there live off of that,” Ortega, an organizer at the immigrant rights group CRECEN Houston, said in Spanish. “In fact, they subsist on it there. They need that money to survive.”

For Ortega, the tax will mean paying an additional $16 each month on top of the 6 percent fee many already pay on average to businesses like Western Union or MoneyGram.

Those fees add up in El Salvador, where the minimum wage is less than $2 per hour or $13 per day. With a new tax on top of existing fees, it means $112 less money for Ortega's family each month, or $1,344 each year.

Or zooming out, El Salvador, which is set to be hit hardest per capita by the tax, will lose about $198 million annually when it goes into effect. That's roughly 0.62 percent of the country's entire GDP or a gobsmacking 1.1 percent if you count the $150 million it's projected to lose from USAID cuts too. It's as if the entire US agricultural industry were to disappear overnight.

“If it weren't for the support of the community that sends remittances, I think there would be extreme poverty, more than there already is, in our countries,” Ortega said.

The good news is that even if the tax reduces remittances to an extent, “people are still going to send that money. It's just going to take a different channel,” said Ananya Kumar, who studies the future of money at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international security.

That's especially true for those from rural, poorer, more vulnerable places with less digital and banking infrastructure — and the new tax specifically targets those cash-based transfers. More than one in five adults worldwide still don't have a bank or mobile money account, and that's especially true for women and those living in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about half the population has an account. Many immigrants in the US don't have bank accounts either.

While someone who's savvy with a smartphone may be able to send money tax-free, for those without banking or regular internet access, cash is still king — and it will be taxed.

Some of those senders could soon begin “moving into the shadows versus having legitimate businesses do it,” said Kumar, which would make them more vulnerable to scammers or criminal networks promising to send the money for less.

And that's not good for anybody. “It harms industry,” Kumar said. “It harms individuals. It harms our national security.”

If the tax holds, The US is poised to make about $10 billion over the next decade. That'll cover just 0.15 percent of the federal US budget for a year at most.

“It's really a drop in the bucket for this country,” said Guzmán, the executive director of Alianza Americas. But elsewhere, that kind of money, “it's transformative.”

Likewise, if we're calculating generously, the gutting of USAID could save US citizens maybe $5 — one matcha latte pre-matcha shortage — per month. But at what cost?

Mexico, which receives the most US remittances, will lose over $1.5 billion per year from the tax, the steepest loss projected anywhere.

In Liberia, for example, aid cuts from the US alone have been so steep that they're projected to lead to a full 2.6 percent decline in gross national income, the highest rate of any country, on top of which the remittance tax will shave off another 0.16 percent. That's a total of over $100 million lost, more than the Liberian government allocated for education this year, in a country where the average salary is less than $3,000 per year.

In Mexico, remittances have already plunged by double-digit percentages in recent months, thanks in part to Trump's immigration crackdown, a growing problem for low-income Mexicans who rely on remittances for up to 30 percent of their income and may soon struggle to afford basic goods. At a recent press conference, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico quipped in Spanish that if the US “wants to charge taxes, they should go somewhere else — not to Mexico's poorest people” who “receive and live off these remittances.”

Her country, which receives the most US remittances, will lose over $1.5 billion per year from the tax, the steepest loss projected anywhere. In an attempt to minimize the damage, she promised to reimburse Mexicans for the tax, and last month, launched a low-fee government debit card that can facilitate tax-free digital transfers.

But those solutions are probably too expensive or out of reach for poorer countries, where these payments make the biggest difference.

Still, remittances have proved remarkably resistant to crises in the past, like the Covid-19 pandemic, and some immigrants may manage to quickly move to tax-free digital platforms, a transition that Guzmán's group plans to encourage in the year ahead.

But there's no question that taken as a whole, these policies are “going to further destabilize these countries and push more people to leave,” Guzmán said. “These changes have deadly consequences.”

The United Nations has lobbied for years to decrease the cost of sending remittances precisely because they are so important to global development and because, frankly, it is greedy for wealthy countries to try to take a chunk of the all-important money that immigrants send home.

In Jozef's words,“the people of Haiti need that money more than President Trump.”

But this was never about the money. It's about “flooding the zone.” It's about throwing a billion strands of spaghetti to the wall at once and seeing what sticks. If millions of people starve as collateral, then that's because the system was broken to begin with.

And well, the system was broken to begin with. No country should be so vulnerable, so reliant on income from its citizens employed abroad, that a 1 percent tax could push them over the edge.

Yet, remittances and foreign aid remain many countries' best bet for leveling the global playing field and “addressing those root causes” of forced migration in the first place, said Guzmán. For creating the conditions needed so that one day, countries like Haiti and El Salvador won't need remittances anymore. Their citizens won't need to leave at all.

“Even in the middle of all the chaos,” Jozef said, “that is still the goal.”

﻿A socialist weighs in.

For decades, a core part of the Republican Party's identity was the whole-hearted embrace of free-market capitalism. Adam Smith's “invisible hand” of the market was understood to be infinitely preferable to government meddling.

Lately, though, President Donald Trump has been having second thoughts. Forget the invisible hand — what about, uh, Trump's hand?The second Trump administration has cut a revenue-sharing agreement with Nvidia, it's taken partial control of US Steel, it's considering taking a stake in Intel, and it's created a loyalty ranking system for US companies. And did we mention that Trump has taken to brow-beating companies into not raising their prices in response to tariffs?

All this adds up to unprecedented intervention into the market, and pushes America toward a “state capitalism” model practiced by countries like Russia, India, and China. The Wall Street Journal's chief economics commentator, Greg Ip, calls it “state capitalism with American characteristics,” a nod to the Chinese Communist Party's “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”

Free-market fans aren't happy. Neither are most Democrats. There is one small but vocal faction in US politics that has historically been more open to this kind of intervention, so Today, Explained gave a prominent member of that group a call to get his thoughts.

“Obviously, as a socialist, I start from the principle that private industry should be subject to more democratic control and oversight,” Bhaskar Sunkara, president of The Nation magazine and founding editor of Jacobin, told Today, Explained co-host Noel King.

Sunkara talked to King about how the history of state capitalism doesn't neatly map onto current political divides, why he respects Trump for putting tariffs back on the table, and why he's skeptical Trump's latest interventions will do anything for the working class.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Is capitalism dead? Is it in trouble?

You know, I wish it was dead for a variety of reasons. I think it's perfectly legitimate for the state to intervene in private enterprise. In the US, we often frame the free market as a conservative ideal and state intervention as a socialist ideal. But history shows it is a lot more complicated than that.

In the 20th century, right-wing authoritarian governments in places like South Korea and Taiwan used really heavy state direction. They used tariffs, subsidies, and credit allocation to build out globally competitive industries and lift their countries out of poverty. They did a lot of horrible things against political rights and labor rights and so on, but they did that, to their credit. In the US we sometimes just knee-jerk react: More state intervention means more socialism. For me, the real question is: Is what we're doing coherent? Does it make sense?

My worry with Trump's approach is that it looks more like ad hoc favoritism and punishing some industries and subsidizing other industries on a whim, and less like a long-term plan.

Where do you stand on the tariffs?

I have a lot of the same concerns. I think that there's a place for tariffs in the toolkit of creating a viable economy. I think there's a place for protecting certain industries as part of a wider plan. I really appreciate that Trump in his first term put on the table the toolkit of tariffs and talked about industrial policy.

I didn't agree with how he executed those tariffs in his first term, but I think it paved the way for Joe Biden to be much more successful in industrial policy.

At a time when countries like Germany were losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, the US was gaining hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. But in this particular case, I just can't see the long-term plan behind Trump's use of tariffs, and I really worry that it will make the US, in the long run, a poorer country, and that won't be good for any sort of egalitarian politics.

The thing Joe Biden was never willing to do was to call companies and say, don't you dare raise prices on Americans. This is one of those things that, again, with Trump, if you are working-class and you hear that the president has called a corporation or telegraphed to a corporation, the tariffs may be pushing up the cost of goods, but you are not going to raise them on American citizens. It's appealing. It's a little strongman, but it's appealing, right?

I'm not impressed because I don't think it's sustainable.

And also I think Trump was able to get away with this stuff, or has been able to, partially because he is a right-wing president who came in with a lot of goodwill from business. At least initially, he delivered huge tax cuts for the wealthy, and capital at least until recently, I think, trusted him. I don't think the markets would've been nearly as tolerant if it was President Bernie Sanders trying the same thing.

And it's very clear to people that he's trying to rig the game to reward friends and punish enemies. And because of that, CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook feel like they have to play along and stay on his good side. And that's behind the very awkward and kind of embarrassingly gauche gift-giving. If you visit the sovereigns, you better come with a big, gaudy gift.

The irony is that a lot of the American right has spent decades railing against left-wing, in their mind, strongmen leaders governing in this fashion. And yet Trump is really mimicking the worst of that style.

I imagine you have rubbed your hands in glee looking at the polling that shows us that Americans are frustrated with capitalism. Young people in particular are giving up on it. Whether you like him or not, President Trump is doing uncapitalism. Zohran Mamdani would like to do uncapitalism. Do you think we're at a point where the left and the right are converging on America with socialist characteristics?

I love being contrarian. I would love to tell you that Trump's action is bringing us closer to being a socialist country, but I honestly believe that Trump is taking us further away from my vision of a good society, and further away from any vision of a socialist society.

I think in part because he's deploying legitimate tools of economic policy, like tariffs and industrial policy, in such a chaotic, self-serving way. I think he's going to create a backlash that makes it harder for the left to use those tools in the future.

But do you really want to run your household like a small business?

There are things you can do to prepare yourself for parenthood: Read the books, take the classes, set up a college fund. Nothing can truly prepare you for the overwhelm.

More specifically, nobody tells you how hard it is to keep up with the logistical demands and bureaucratic bloat. If deciding what to eat for dinner was annoying before children, try meal planning for a week with a family. There are chores to do, school emails to answer, trips to plan, bills to pay, and only so many minutes in the day.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Running a family has become akin to running a small business for many Americans. So it's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture. Offering everything from AI-powered assistants to wall-mounted touchscreens, these tech companies promise to provide your family with its own command center or operating system — a software-based solution to the societal problem of parenting while overwhelmed.

The need for such a fix has cropped up as the demands of parenting have escalated. A 2025 report from the Office of the Surgeon General showed that nearly half of American parents said that “most days their stress is completely overwhelming.” Women tend to carry more of the mental load. The vast majority of parents in opposite-sex households say the mother spends more time managing schedules, according to a Pew Research Center poll published in 2023. A separate study found that mothers, on average, did 71 percent of the cognitive labor at home — child care, cleaning, scheduling, finances, managing relationships — while men did just 29 percent.

It's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture.

“This work of organizing the family is work, and it's falling on women, particularly in different-sex couples,” said Allison Daminger, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of the upcoming book What's on Her Mind: The Mental Load of Family Life.

There's no relief in sight for most families. The cost of child care has steadily increased in recent years, and most working parents do not have access to paid family leave. An app won't solve these policy challenges, but it might make a tired parent's day slightly more streamlined.

“We have some of the most family hostile public policies and workplace practices of any high-income country, and parents are absolutely strapped for time and money,” said Brigid Schulte, director of the Better Life Lab at New America and author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time.

“Are these apps the answer? No, they're not,” Schulte told me. “At most they're Band-Aids. They can help people manage, keep their heads above water, but the real solutions we need are much bigger than any app.”

That was my experience trying out many of these new tools. The touchscreen in my kitchen is not paying for pre-school. However, I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals.

My child is not yet 2, but my wife and I already feel the strain of administrative overload. And we learned the hard way that just creating a new Google Calendar wasn't going to cut it, where family obligations get mixed in with work meetings and personal to-dos, turning the whole thing into a soup of confusion.

That led me to check out dedicated family calendar apps, like Maple, before exploring full fledged family command centers, like Skylight.

The idea of using software to help families stay organized is not new. Some 20 years ago, a couple of former Microsoft employees created an online family organizer called Cozi, which is still around today. It wasn't until the pandemic that the concept really took off, though.

I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals.

Skylight, makers of the touchscreen in my kitchen, started out as a digital picture frame company over a decade ago. In September 2020, the company made a meaningful pivot toward building a family command center with the launch of the Skylight Calendar, which syncs with existing digital calendars, like Google Calendar and Outlook, but puts the entire family on one screen. There are also tabs for a to-do list, a grocery list, and a meal plan, all of which are also available on a mobile app. Skylight has since added features, like a gamified chores tab for kids, and an AI assistant called Sidekick that converts emails and even pictures of things like fliers and recipes into calendar events and meal plans. The 27-inch Cal Max, launched last year, costs up to $600, plus an additional $80 a year for access to all the features.

Hot on Skylight's heels is an app called Maple, which launched in February 2021. Initially described as “the back office of every family,” Maple has gone through a few iterations, including one that enabled parents to sell “ready made plans” to other families, but the app is primarily a family calendar powered by to-do lists. You can create to-dos, assign them to members of the family, and then see a schedule of everything that needs to be done. There's also a meal planner, a family messaging platform, and a project management feature that's surprisingly good at planning birthday parties. It costs $40 a year to sync external calendars, get rid of ads, and access AI features.

I know what you're thinking: Google and Apple software can do a lot of this stuff for free. And you'd be right. There's no need to pay for a dedicated family calendar app, if you want to bootstrap existing software, including what you use for work, to stay organized.

Tech-savvy parents have been doing this for years. In 2016, a dad in Sweden went semi-viral for blogging about using Slack to keep track of his family and helped inspire The Atlantic story, “The Slackification of the American home.” Emily Oster, the economist turned parenting guru, canonized the concept in The Family Firm, a book about using off-the-shelf enterprise software like Asana to keep her family organized a few years ago. Just last year, the New York Times spoke to a number of parents, many of whom worked in the venture capital or crypto industries, that use project management tools like Trello and Notion to run their families like startups.

“Tasks and chores, to-do lists, grocery lists: There are apps that do those individual things better than we do,” Michael Segal, co-founder and CEO of Skylight, said in an interview. “It's just more convenient to do it all in the place where you go to manage the family and home.”

Michael Perry, Maple's co-founder and CEO, similarly told me that his company's job is “building a calendar that's all encompassing for seven days a week of our life as a working parent.” Maple also invites its users to join a Slack community, where they can weigh in on features they love or hate or check out upcoming releases, like Maple's new web app, which is set to launch this fall.

Skylight and Maple are the two family assistants I've used the most, but they're hardly the only ones. Hearth sells its own giant touchscreen calendar for your kitchen, and Jam looks like a Maple clone with some Gen Z design flair. Apps like Milo and Ohai lean into the AI of it all, promising to use chatbots to keep your family organized. There are also tech companies trying to connect parents. Honeycomb says it helps parents “share the mental and logistical load” via group chats and smart calendars, and the Sandwich Club is an AI-powered advice platform that lets other parents weigh in on your questions.

Together, these companies comprise a burgeoning new industry, referred to as famtech. There's even an industry association dedicated to promoting its interests, drumming up investment, and pushing for policy changes for caregivers, like paid family leave. “Liken it to where financial services has fintech, we look at the care economy as having famtech as its innovation sector,” said Anna Steffany, executive director of FamTech.org, “and we look at family technology as all things addressing the caregiving space.” One trend report, which Steffany contributed to, values the care economy at nearly $650 billion.

It's easy to feel skeptical about a single app or kitchen-based touchscreen that promises to make parents' lives easier. Heck, I've been using both for a few weeks now, and it's certainly nice not to have to text my wife every time there's a change in the schedule or to remind me who's on preschool pickup duty that day.

Then again, I'm also starting to wonder if using a parenting app just means I'm giving up more data about my family in the services of better targeted ads. (The privacy policies of both Maple and Skylight say the companies may collect and share personal data with third parties.) I'm also acutely aware that having a new tool to manage my family means I've got yet another thing to manage.

“When you're trying to integrate across so many different apps and systems and interfaces, the real cost benefit ratio can get thrown off,” said Daminger, the UW-Madison professor. “Sometimes we're trying to make things easier, but in the end, we actually end up just creating new forms of labor.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Coinbase CEO says he's mandating in-person orientation to combat North Korean hackers seeking remote jobs","https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-north-korea-threats-remote-work-2025-8","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:59:00 GMT","

Coinbase prides itself on ""remote-first"" work, but CEO Brian Armstrong said the company was forced to make changes to thwart a foe: North Korea.

Armstrong said that North Korean IT workers have tried to leverage the company's remote work policy to gain employment and then access to the crypto exchange's sensitive systems. Coinbase works with law enforcement, but Armstrong said the threat just keeps growing.

""It feels like there's 500 new people graduating every quarter from some kind of school they have — that's just their whole job,"" Armstrong told John Collison, cofounder and president of online payment provider Stripe, in an episode of Collison's ""Cheeky Pint"" podcast posted on Wednesday.

Armstrong said that Coinbase is requiring all workers to come to the US for in-person orientation and that anyone with access to sensitive systems must hold US citizenship and submit to fingerprinting.

Last month, the FBI put out an updated warning about North Korean IT workers who target private companies ""to illicitly generate substantial revenue for the regime."" The FBI said that the IT workers work with both ""witting and unwitting"" people within the US.

The FBI said US-based facilitators have reshipped company laptops, attended virtual interviews on behalf of North Korean workers, and even created front businesses.

Armstrong said that in many cases, workers themselves might be a target and are being coerced to participate. He said that Coinbase requires prospective employees to turn on their camera during interviews ""to prove they're not AI"" or not being coached.

Ultimately, Armstrong said that security risks have led Coinbase to build up US-based customer support, pointing to the company's new facility in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""It feels like proof of physical presence is going to be become a bigger deal in a world of AI, deepfakes, just higher stakes for all this kind of cyber crime stuff where in a weird way you see certain areas where remote work goes backwards,"" Collison said.

Armstrong said Coinbase has also made aggressive efforts to deter internal threats to sensitive information. In some cases, ""threat actors"" have offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to customer service agents to take photos of sensitive information.

Part of the way Coinbase deters this, Armstrong said, is by locking down the information employees have access to. It's also by making it clear what the consequences will be.

""When we catch people, we don't walk them out the door, they go to jail,"" Armstrong said. ""And we try to make it very clear that you're destroying the rest of your life by taking this, even if you think, whatever, it is a life-changing amount of money, it's not worth going to jail.""

Tesla is once again in the crosshairs of federal regulators.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday that it is investigating allegations that Tesla is not correctly reporting crashes involving its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems.

In the probe notice, the NHTSA said that car companies are required to report crashes involving autonomous or advanced driver assistance systems within five days of being notified of them. The regulator alleged that Tesla submitted reports months after the incident, sometimes in batches or on a rolling basis.

""Preliminary engagement between [Office of Defects Investigation] and Tesla on the issue indicates that the timing of the reports was due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed,"" according to the NHTSA's notice. ""NHTSA is opening this Audit Query, a standard process for reviewing compliance with legal requirements, to evaluate the cause of the potential delays in reporting, the scope of any such delays, and the mitigations that Tesla has developed to address them.""

The NHTSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dan O'Dowd, founder of The Dawn Project, a tech safety advocacy group, pointed out to Business Insider that according to Tesla's crash-counting methodology listed on its website, the company only counts crashes involving airbag deployments and if Autopilot was engaged within five seconds before the crash.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2022, the NHTSA said it was investigating Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over an alleged phenomenon known as ""phantom braking,"" which is when the vehicle suddenly slams on the brakes for no reason, often at high speeds.

In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on what was then Twitter that phantom braking would be fixed in a coming software update, but he has not commented further since then.

On August 1, a Florida judge ordered Tesla to pay $242 million in damages after finding the EV partly to blame for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and seriously injured her boyfriend. The driver was using Autopilot and had briefly looked away when the crash took place.

Musk said on X that the company would appeal the decision.

Another lawsuit brought by California's Department of Motor Vehicles alleges that Tesla's use of language in advertising Autopilot and FSD has misled consumers into thinking the vehicles are more autonomous than they really are. The case could see Tesla's right to sell in California suspended for at least 30 days.

Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, denied the allegations and told an administrative judge last month that the company informed customers that they ""cannot fully rely"" on FSD or Autopilot.

President Donald Trump said Friday he will fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign from her position.

""What she did was bad,"" the president told reporters who asked about Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has come under fire from the Trump administration over allegations about her mortgages.

""So I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,"" he said during a surprise visit to The People's House, a museum of the White House.

If Trump were to successfully remove Cook ""for cause,"" he would get the chance to reshape the central bank's governing board, potentially for years to come.

Two of the seven current governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, are Trump appointees. Both dissented from the Fed's most recent decision to hold interest rates steady.

Another seat opened up earlier this summer, when Adriana Kugler announced she would step down.

If Trump is able to remove Cook, he would appoint her successor — potentially ensuring that a majority of the board shares his view on monetary policy. Board members serve 14-year terms.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte this week publicly accused Cook of mortgage fraud related to claims that she took two different properties as her primary residence at the same time.

He sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, which revealed Thursday that it will investigate Cook.

Pulte, a vocal critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who has aggressively backed Trump's calls for the central bank to lower interest rates, has continuously attacked Cook on social media since revealing his allegations.

Trump previously called for Cook to resign immediately in light of the allegations. Ed Martin, a Justice Department lawyer who is widely seen as a loyalist to the president, urged Powell to promptly remove Cook — even though the central bank chief cannot do so under the law.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in an X post Friday that Trump is targeting Cook because he is ""trying to find a scapegoat for his failure to lower costs for Americans.""

Cook has consistently voted in line with Powell. She sided with the majority to keep rates unchanged following the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent meeting last month.

Cook said Wednesday that she has ""no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.""

""I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve,"" Cook said in a statement.

""I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,"" she said.

Trump's comments Friday morning came as Powell signaled that economic conditions ""may warrant"" interest rate cuts.

While the economy and labor market remain resilient, downside risks are rising and growth is declining — and Trump's tariffs are once again raising inflation concerns, Powell said at the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Canada removed many of its retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. on Friday, marking a significant step forward in the two countries' relationship.

Canada in March imposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a long list of U.S. products that fall in line with the North American trade deal after the U.S. had announced 25% duties on steel and aluminum. Notably, Canada's 25% tariffs on U.S. autos, steel and aluminum will remain in place for now, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a press conference Friday.

The change will go into effect on Sept. 1, Carney added, saying he believes Canada has the best trade deal out of all of the countries working with the U.S.

""As we work intensively with the United States, our focus is squarely on the strategic sectors,"" Carney said.

A White House official told NBC News that Canada's move was ""long overdue.""

""We look forward to continuing our discussions with Canada on the Administration's trade and national security concerns,"" the official said.

Friday's announcement follows a phone call between Carney and President Donald Trump, the first known call between the two since failed talks before the Aug. 1 tariff deadline. A readout of the Thursday call from Carney's office called the conversation ""productive and wide-ranging,"" with both leaders agreeing to reconvene soon.

Carney said Friday that Trump assured him that dropping retaliatory tariffs will kick-start negotiations between the two countries.

The move comes as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term, is scheduled to undergo a review later this year.

Canada was swift to impose its counter-tariffs on the U.S. on CA$30 billion, or US$21.7 billion, worth of U.S. goods under then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In July, Trump announced he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% and said the rise of fentanyl and Canada's unwillingness to work with the U.S. affected his decision.

A total of 43 pounds of the drug was seized at the northern border during 2024 with an additional 58 pounds having been confiscated there so far this year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, Carney said in a post on social media site X that the country was committed to working alongside the U.S. to come to a deal.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday gave a tepid indication of possible interest rate cuts ahead as he noted a high level of uncertainty that is making the job difficult for monetary policymakers.

In his much-anticipated speech at the Fed's annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank leader in prepared remarks cited ""sweeping changes"" in tax, trade and immigration policies. The result is that ""the balance of risks appear to be shifting"" between the Fed's twin goals of full employment and stable prices.

Watch Powell deliver his remarks live

While he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown ""resilience,"" he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again — a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid.

With the Fed's benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow ""us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,"" Powell said.

""Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,"" he added.

That was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17.

However, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell's speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%.

In addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues.

The Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions.

While not addressing the White House demands for lower rates specifically, Powell did note the importance of Fed independence.

""FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach,"" he said.

The speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly.

From the Trump administration's view, the tariffs will not cause lasting inflation, thus warranting rate cuts. Powell's position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a ""reasonable base case"" being that the tariff impacts will be ""short lived — a one-time shift in the price level"" that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point.

""It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks,"" Powell said. ""Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.""

In addition to summarizing the current conditions and potential outcomes, the speech touched on the Fed's five-year review of its policy framework. The review resulted in several notable changes from when the central bank last performed the task in 2020.

At that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a ""flexible average inflation targeting"" regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the central bank's 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery.

However, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as ""transitory"" and not needing rate hikes. Powell noted the damaging impacts from the inflation and the lessons learned.

""As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021,"" Powell said. ""The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.""

Also during the review, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its 2% inflation target. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible.

""We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,"" Powell said.

In this article

Waymo is getting one step closer to rides in New York City.

The Alphabet autonomous vehicle subsidiary received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation on Friday to start testing in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced Friday. The rollout is the city's first autonomous vehicle testing launch.

Waymo will start testing up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September with the potential to extend the program. New York state law requires the company to have a driver behind the wheel to operate.

""We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward,"" Adams said in a release. ""New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century.""

The news comes just two months after the company said it filed permits to test its cars in the city with a trained specialist behind the wheel.

Waymo has hit expansion mode on its services nationwide, launching in Austin this year and expanding its San Francisco area operations in March. Waymo also plans to bring autonomous vehicles to Atlanta, Miami and Washington, D.C. and recently said it will start operations in Philadelphia as it looks to break further into the Northeast market.

Waymo's CEO said the company surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips in May.

For years, autonomous vehicle companies have sought to introduce their technology to The Big Apple, with Waymo previously taking a crack at it in 2021. At that time, the company rolled out some cars in certain areas of the city for manual driving and data collection.

New York City has also expressed interest in bringing autonomous vehicles to the city. Last year, the Adams administration implemented a series of safety requirements for responsible testing in the city and opened a permit program.

As part of the permit, Waymo must regularly meet and report data to DOT and work closely with law enforcement and emergency services.

FBI agents on Friday morning raided the Maryland home of John Bolton, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump and a staunch critic of the president.

Agents also raided Bolton's office in Washington, D.C., according to NBC News.

The raids are part of a ""national security investigation in search of classified records,"" a person familiar with the matter told NBC.

The probe is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. The investigation began during the Biden administration, but did not go further before President Joe Biden left office in January.

A person close to Bolton told NBC News they believe the raid was in response to Bolton's frequent criticism of the Trump administration, which includes his book ""The Room Where it Happened."" 

""It's retribution, pure and simple,"" that person told NBC.

Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.

An FBI official told NBC on Friday, ""The FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area. There is no threat to public safety.""

That statement indicates a judge signed a search warrant for Bolton's residence in Bethesda, just outside of Washington.

It was not known if Bolton was home at the time of the raid, which began at around 7 a.m. ET. A woman who appeared to be Bolton's wife was at the residence.

About a half hour after the raid began, Bolton tweeted about Russia and its war on Ukraine, writing that Trump will continue pushing for meetings on the conflict ""because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress.""

FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted, ""NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission"" at the same time his agents were raiding Bolton's home.

Attorney General Pam Bondi retweeted Patel's tweet, writing, ""America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.""

And Patel's deputy director at the FBI, Dan Bongino, in his own post on X wrote, ""Public corruption will not be tolerated.""

Trump later told reporters that he did not know about the raid, but that he expected to be briefed about it later Friday.

The president also said he is ""not a fan of John Bolton,"" and called him a ""lowlife.""

The New York Post first reported the raid.

Patel ordered the investigation into Bolton, according to the Post, which cited a Trump administration official.

Trump lashed out against Bolton on Aug. 13 after his former advisor criticized the president for agreeing to host a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

""Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, 'Putin has already won,' "" Trump wrote on Truth Social that day. ""What's that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING.""

On Aug. 17, after he met with Putin, Trump wrote, ""This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like [Sen.] Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so.""

Trump cancelled Bolton's protective detail from the U.S. Secret Service after he was sworn in for his second term in the White House in January. Bolton had been under Secret Service protection because of plots by Iran to kill him.

Trump was previously indicted in federal court in Florida on charges related to his retention of classified government records at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach after leaving the White House in January 2021, and with his efforts to thwart their recovery by government officials.

Trump said on Sept. 10, 2019, that he had effectively fired Bolton the prior evening.

""I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,"" Trump wrote in a tweet that day. ""Therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.""

The Justice Department dropped that case in late 2024, shortly after Trump was elected president, because of a department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

The Justice Department sued Bolton in 2020 in an effort to block the publication and sale of his book ""The Room Where it Happened,"" which was a damning account of his time as Trump's national security advisor. The lawsuit was filed during Trump's last year of his first term.

A Justice Department lawyer told a judge that year that the book was ""a flagrant breach of"" Bolton's agreement not to write about classified matters.

The department dropped the lawsuit in June 2021, five months after Biden took office.

Bolton served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the administration of President George W. Bush.

The U.S. and European Union granted businesses some desperately sought after clarity as they shared fresh details on their trade agreement on Thursday, but questions remain about whether the deal can really be trusted.

Thursday's update broadly echoed the framework announced by the U.S. and EU in July, which called for 15% tariffs as well as pledges for Brussels to amp up spending and investment in the U.S. New details include a cap of 15% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber and semiconductors. Autos will face the same rate, but only after the EU makes legislation changes to reduce its industrial duties.

However, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Thursday suggested the framework was just the beginning, leaving the door open for future changes to the deal.

Despite providing some much-needed clarity, there are still various smaller, yet crucial, aspects missing from the current framework.

A muted market reaction from pharmaceuticals on Thursday highlighted investor skepticism and there was no mention of the wine and spirits sector in the deal.

""A lot of the details remain to be worked out,"" Penny Naas, who leads on the German Marshall Fund's allied strategic competitiveness work, told CNBC, pointing to for example so-called 'rules of origin.'

""These rules determine where value is most added to a product that contains multiple parts from multiple countries, and when it can be labeled 'European' or 'American,'"" she explained. Naas noted that these rules come into play when it comes to for example transshipments — a process in which goods might originate from one country, but are then sent to another for final shipment to the U.S.

Carsten Brzeski, ING's global head of macro, meanwhile pointed out uncertainties ""stemming from formalities and procedures at customs,"" which he says are particularly impacting small and medium-sized enterprises.

Some companies are already facing issues in this regard, with firms having to ""recruit tariff specialists in order to clarify the new customs requirements,"" he said.

Another concern is U.S. President Donald Trump's history of fact-paced changes of heart and policy shifts, Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at the European Institute of Business Administration (INSEAD), told CNBC.

The president for example doubled steep steel tariffs overnight, and later quietly expanded their scope.

Elsewhere, Switzerland was victim to the president's erratic decision making, with the country reportedly having been extremely close to a deal, which was then however pulled by Trump as he slapped 39% duties on Swiss exports to the U.S. almost overnight.

""The real issue for business is how to define a long-term strategy with a country that is no longer a reliable partner,"" Fatás said. ""What used to be the most reliable partner for Europe has now become one of the most volatile, if not the worst, when it comes to economic policies,"" he added.

The German Marshall Fund's Naas also flagged this as a risk for businesses.

""This deal does not include any enforcement provisions, nor will it be codified by Congress, which means it could change at the direction of the U.S. President,"" she said.

Naas pointed to Section 232 tariffs as an example, with Trump having changed tariff rates on some products ""at a moment's notice, and the Administration has expanded the scope to cover other products without warning.""

Businesses are therefore left with a key question: to trust or not to trust the deal.

While Thursday's statement adds some clarity, the deal ""remains fragile and could quickly dissolve,"" ING's Brzeski said in a note after the announcement. ""The agreement contains numerous elements that could spark future tensions and escalation. Implementation, monitoring and enforcement of many of the intentions is not always clear,"" he added.

Naas echoed the calls for caution. While the U.S.-EU agreement appears ""more likely to be stable"" than some of Trump's other tariff policies like sectoral duties, it ""will require the EU to remain on ""good behavior"" or else risk a sudden change,"" she said.

In addition to the uncertainties about the stability of the U.S.-EU deal, businesses are also contending with questions regarding various global shifts in the market, according to Gregor Hirt, multi-asset chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors.

He told CNBC businesses are facing several key questions: ""Is the US heading toward a recession or even worse, stagflation, and how resilient will companies' margin be in this kind of environment, especially considering the high market valuation in the US? Moreover, what further tools do policymakers have to counter a potential downturn, for example in terms of deregulation or specific sector 'incentives'?""

""And, finally, how will the shift away from global trade liberalisation and institutionalize framework affect long-term investment and supply chain strategies?"" Hirt said, adding that these tariff-related issues are also key for companies ability to plan in the current environment.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his annual address Friday morning at the central bank's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

He indicated that conditions ""may warrant"" interest rate cuts as the Fed proceeds ""carefully.""

Markets have been looking to Powell to provide strong hints about a September interest rate cut.

For their part, the chair and other officials have been cautious about easing monetary policy with the effect of tariffs on inflation still unclear.

At the same time, the Fed has recently found itself embroiled in several nonpolicy controversies. White House officials have criticized the Fed for a massive renovation project at its Washington, D.C., headquarters, and President Donald Trump and others have called on Governor Lisa Cook to resign amid allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook has said she will not be ""bullied"" into resigning.

In this article

Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of the world's wealthiest person, said Elon Musk ""deserves to be paid,"" as Tesla remains locked in a legal saga over its CEO's pay package.

""I think my brother deserves to be paid,"" Kimbal Musk said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""He has zero pay for the past six to eight years. I don't think that's right. I'll let Tesla shareholders make that decision, but I believe that it does need to be. He needs to be paid.""

Elon Musk isn't paid a salary or any cash bonuses at Tesla. He is compensated through ""performance awards"" of valuable stock options that are granted based on Tesla hitting certain milestones.

Earlier this month, Tesla granted Elon Musk an ""interim"" pay package of 96 million shares, which would be worth about $29 billion. The package includes shares that vest in two years as long as he continues as CEO or in another key executive position.

The pay plan was approved by a ""special committee"" of the Tesla board, with Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said in an Aug. 4 letter to shareholders.

The award came after a Delaware judge in December ordered Tesla to revoke Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package from 2018, which was the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive.

Before the Delaware ruling on his 2018 pay plan, in January 2024, Musk said he wanted even more pay and control of Tesla in a post on X, which was formerly known as Twitter.

""I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control,"" Musk wrote at the time. ""Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.""

He was already building products outside of Tesla, including at his newest artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which was formed in Nevada in March 2023.

The new pay package was granted to Musk without a shareholder vote, and will only apply if Musk and Tesla lose on appeal in Delaware.

An investment group that works with pension funds, the SOC Investment Group, sent a letter this week to Nasdaq asking them to investigate Tesla, saying its board should have attained shareholder approval for the new package under Nasdaq listing policies.

In an August letter to shareholders announcing the interim pay package, Tesla board members Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote that the special committee is working to ""address a longer-term CEO compensation strategy,"" which it plans to put to a shareholder vote at Tesla's upcoming annual meeting in November.

In this article

When Texas Instruments announced a $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in July, it was a bold bet that companies would want to mass produce foundational microchips on U.S. soil. In August, Apple vowed to do just that.

During the same Oval Office press conference where President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips from companies not manufacturing in the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook upped his companies' U.S. spending commitment to $600 billion over the next four years, up from an original $500 billion announcement in February.

Part of that spending, Cook said, will go toward making ""critical foundation semiconductors"" for iPhones and other devices at Texas Instruments' new chip fabrication plants in Utah and Texas.

In July, CNBC became the first news organization to see the inside of TI's newest fab in Sherman, Texas. There, full production is on schedule to start by the end of 2025. It's one of seven new factories the chipmaker is building in the U.S. to provide chips to major customers like Nvidia, Ford Motor, Medtronic and SpaceX.

Although Texas Instruments doesn't make the world's most advanced chips, its essential components are found almost everywhere, from smartphones to the graphics processing units powering generative AI.

""If you have anything that plugs into the wall, or has a battery in it, or has a cord in it, you probably carry more than one TI chip in it,"" said Mohammad Yunus, TI's senior VP of technology and manufacturing.

But just one month after TI announced the $60 billion project, its shares plummeted 13% following weak guidance and tariff concerns raised in its July 23 earnings call. 

""The worry is their end customers. Like in the wake of tariff uncertainty, they don't know what to expect. Are they stockpiling?"" said Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research.

It remains to be seen whether demand will remain high once tariff uncertainties calm. Still, shares did recover some ground in August.

""I would position them as more of a tariff winner than a tariff loser,"" said Timothy Arcuri, managing director at UBS. Arcuri said TI's U.S. foundry will allow it to undercut the pricing of its rivals' Taiwan-made chips.

The market for TI's chips, however, is not a guarantee. After TI had trouble keeping up with demand during the chip shortage in 2020, Arcuri said TI's share of the analog market ""fell off a cliff."" It went from a high of 19.8% in 2020 to a low of 14.7% in 2024, according to UBS.

TI's $60 billion megaproject includes four fabs in Sherman, Texas, one in Richardson, Texas, and two in Lehi, Utah. The new fabs will give TI five times the capacity it has today, Yunus told CNBC.

""They're making a big bet on the fact that they regain share and that demand comes rocketing back,"" Arcuri said. ""If you don't regain that share, it's hard to justify building this much capacity.""

While TI is well known for its graphing calculators, the company is also responsible for helping revolutionize the electronics industry. In 1958, TI engineer Jack Kilby filed the first patent for an integrated circuit. That paved the way for miniaturizing chips by building all the components of a circuit, not just the transistors, directly into a single piece of silicon.

The majority of TI's business today comes from automotive and industrial customers that buy the company's analog and embedded chips. Analog chips process signals like sound, light and pressure, like the temperature on a thermostat or voltage on power management chips that keep electronics safe when plugged in. Embedded chips are typically signal processors and microcontrollers for operating everyday devices, like telling the toaster to ding, the dishwasher to end a cycle or anti-lock brakes to engage.

Unlike the costly bleeding edge 2 and 3 nanometer chips made by giants like TSMC,  TI's chips are made on cheaper, legacy nodes: 45 to 130 nanometers. 

That size ""is the sweet spot for analog and embedded because they provide the right performance, the power, the voltage that our portfolio needs,"" Yunus said.

While each TI chip costs about $0.40, according to Arcuri, they play crucial supporting roles for the world's most advanced technologies. In a new partnership with Nvidia, for example, TI is developing a chip to drive efficiency in power-hungry data centers.

In 2009, TI made another bold move to help bring the cost of its chips down further. It opened the world's first 300 millimeter fab for analog chips, re-purposing a memory fab from Qimonda after the chipmaker went bankrupt in the financial crisis.

""That's what really was the catalyst for TI to have such a cost advantage,"" Arcuri said.

The new wafer size gives TI ""tremendous cost efficiency"" because 300mm can fit ""2.3 times more chips in it versus a 200mm wafer,"" Yunus said. TI's been closing and selling off some of its 200mm fabs, and all of its seven new fabs will produce on 300mm wafers.

TI told CNBC it's the country's biggest analog and embedded semiconductor manufacturer, selling tens of billions of chips each year. About 60% of revenue comes from customers based outside the U.S., with China making up about 20%. 

About 75% of TI's capital spend happens in the U.S., but it also makes chips abroad at fabs in Germany, Japan and China, the company told CNBC. It does testing and assembly in Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, where it's spending $3 billion on two new sites, one of which is now in production. 

TI's global footprint is a benefit in the ""dynamic situation"" of tariffs right now, Yunus said.

""Our manufacturing across 15 different sites provides us the position to be able to support our customers, no matter where they are and in any political or economic environment,"" he said.

Although TI considered building its new sites internationally in places like Singapore, the company ultimately settled on Sherman, Texas. The small city 65 miles north of Dallas has a population of just 50,000 people. It's also home to a GlobalWafers factory. The Taiwan-based company manufactures the bare silicon wafers that chips, including TI's, are made on.

Sherman Mayor Shawn Teamann said the city is now ""the hub of the Silicon Prairie.""

Teamann's grandfather worked alongside Kilby at TI in the 1950s. TI first came to Sherman in 1966, but when it announced plans to close its outdated 150mm fab, the city enticed TI to stay with incentives like tax breaks and water discounts.

The plan worked, and in 2021, TI announced it would stay in Sherman with a campus of new 300mm fabs. Now, the first of four 300mm fabs is complete in Sherman. Teamann said the 300mm project has more than doubled the city's rate of population growth since it was announced in 2021.

As for federal support, TI got $1.6 billion of CHIPS Act funding, and a whopping 35% investment tax credit from Trump's big bill passed in July. 

At the state level, Gov. Greg Abbott has long offered incentives to chip companies willing to build in the state, from low taxes to the $1.4 billion Texas CHIPS Act passed in 2023.

Samsung is the other chip giant in Texas since 1996. The South Korean company is building a $17 billion advanced chip fab near Austin. That's also where Apple, Amazon and AMD design many of their chips. Other chip companies in Texas include Infineon, NXP, X-Fab, Micron, GlobalFoundries, and tool supplier Applied Materials. 

Making chips takes an immense amount of water, and about a quarter of Texas is in drought. 

Luckily, Sherman has water rights to nearby Lake Texoma.

""It was about acquiring more rights, ramping up our production and being able to provide for the mass quantities of water it takes to run a semiconductor facility,"" said Teamann, adding that the fab has almost doubled the amount of water Sherman uses.

TI will use about 1,700 gallons of water per minute when the new Sherman fab is complete, with plans to recycle at least 50% of that, Yunus said.

Chip manufacturing is also a power hungry process, so it helps that Sherman has a power plant that recently increased capacity. TI's new Sherman fab will run entirely on renewable energy, said Yunus, adding that making chips on 300mm wafers also helps with energy efficiency.

""You use pretty much the same amount of energy but produce 2.2 to 2.3 times more chips,"" he said.

Texas' uniquely independent grid largely cuts the state off from borrowing power across state lines. In 2021, that grid failed during an extreme winter storm, causing at least 57 deaths and halting production at chipmakers like Samsung and NXP. TI told CNBC it maintained ""critical operations.""

""We built redundancy into this facility,"" Yunus said. ""We have multiple transmission lines that feed power into the site. We also have large diesel storage tanks that we're able to use, and generators that can continue to power the site for a few days.""

Highly skilled chip engineers are another scarce resource. It's a talent pipeline that's been stymied by the dramatic decline of U.S. global semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. went from holding a 37% share of the market in 1990 to just 10% in 2022, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

But TI has developed partnerships with various universities, community colleges and the military to fill the talent gap necessary to fill the roles at its Sherman fab.

""There's a lot of younger people moving to the area. I actually think it's going to be easier for them to get the talent now than it would have been 5 to 10 years ago,"" Arcuri said.

With the full $60 billion project, TI said it expects to create 60,000 U.S. jobs, but the company could not give an expected completion date when asked for one.

""It's hard to predict when exactly that will take off,"" Yunus said. ""We're hopeful that we'll continue to build out at a pretty brisk pace, but it really depends on the market.""Watch the video for an in-depth look at TI's first completed fab in Sherman: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/22/apple-will-make-chips-at-texas-instruments-60-billion-us-project.html

In this article

Nvidia is in talks with the U.S. government about shipping a new, more advanced chip to China, CEO Jensen Huang said on Friday.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported the U.S. tech giant is developing a new artificial intelligence chip for China, dubbed the B30A, that will be more powerful than the H20 — the only semiconductor Nvidia is allowed to sell in the country at present. The U.S. has grown concerned in the past few years that advanced American chips could be used in Chinese military applications.

A journalist asked Huang about the B30A during a trip to Taiwan.

""Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government. And we are in dialogue with them. But it's too soon to know,"" Huang said in response.

Last month, Huang said he hopes that Nvidia can sell more advanced chips in China than the H20 during a visit to the country.

Nvidia's position in China has become a headache for Huang. The company created a special, less-advanced chip for China called the H20, which this year the U.S. government restricted for export. In July, Nvidia said it had given permission to sell this chip again in China. Later, it was revealed that Nvidia will give 15% of its China chip sales to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses.

Just as it appeared that Nvidia was back in China, it hit other roadblocks, with Chinese authorities raising concerns this month about potential security vulnerabilities in the company's chips. Nvidia said its products do not have ""kill switches and backdoors"" built into them.

Several reports this month have suggested that the Chinese government has urged local companies not to use Nvidia chips.

Huang has argued that Nvidia should be allowed to sell its chips to China, so that the country's AI is built on American technology and domestic tech giants like Huawei don't fill the void.

That message appeared to get through to Washington. In July, when the H20 was approved for export again, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the move was allowed because Nvidia would not be giving over its best technology.

""We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,"" Lutnick said.

However, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that these comments were seen as ""insulting"" by Chinese officials and that local regulators are moving to dissuade domestic firms from buying the H20.

A report by the The Information on Friday said that Nvidia has asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to the H20 graphics processing units.

The company's shares were down 1.34% in premarket trading at 5:53 a.m. E.T.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has hinted that China will soon have homegrown ""next generation"" chips to support its AI models, while announcing an update to one of its large language models. 

In a comment under a post on its official WeChat account, DeepSeek said the ""UE8M0 FP8"" precision format of its newly released model V3.1 is tailored for the next-generation domestically built chips that will be launched soon.

FP8, or 8-bit floating point, is a data processing format that can boost the computational efficiency for training and inference of large deep learning models.

DeepSeek's mention of China's coming next-generation chips may signal plans to work more closely with China's emerging AI chip ecosystem in the face of Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's push for chip self-sufficiency.

The comments come about two weeks after Beijing reportedly urged Chinese AI developers to use domestic alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units used in AI training. While analysts say China's domestic AI chipmakers lag behind Nvidia in technological advancement and scale, players like Huawei have been making progress.

In its Thursday post, DeepSeek did not disclose the chips it used to train the V3.1, or what local chips the UE8M0 FP8 might be compatible with.

DeepSeek shook up the tech world earlier this year after it released its R1 reasoning model, which demonstrated capabilities comparable to those of Western competitors like OpenAI, despite U.S. export controls restricting it from using Nvidia's most advanced AI training chips.

Prior to that, in December, the company released its V3 model, which it said had been trained on about 2,000 of Nvidia's less advanced chips.

Following DeepSeek's model breakthroughs, the U.S. further tightened export restrictions in April, effectively banning Nvidia's H20 chips, which had been specially designed to meet prior export restrictions on China. 

Last month, officials from the Trump administration said they planned to allow Nvidia to resume shipping the chips to China. However, the H20s are now being met with scrutiny in China, with regulators reportedly mandating companies against buying the chips until a national security review is completed.

Chip analysts have told CNBC that companies like Huawei that have been seeking to build an alternative AI chip ecosystem in China could benefit from a lack of Nvidia's H20s in the market. 

DeepSeek said Thursday that its V3.1 came with ""major changes,"" including faster response times, and a hybrid reasoning architecture that allows the model to support both reasoning and non-reasoning modes. Reasoning models can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process.

Starting Sept. 6, the company will also adjust the pricing for using the model's API, which allows developers of other apps and web products to integrate DeepSeek on their platforms.

In this article

Shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged after the company unveiled one of its most affordable vehicles yet, underscoring the fierce price war in the domestic market.

Nio's U.S.-listed shares rallied, climbing 9.27% to close at $5.54 on Thursday. In Hong Kong, shares rose as much as 10% in Friday morning trading.

The company late Thursday unveiled its latest ES8 SUV, aggressively priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. The program lowers upfront costs while allowing customers to swap or upgrade batteries through a monthly fee. Deliveries are set to begin in late September.

""The new generation ES8 is priced at very competitive levels with some attractive features, ""Vincent Sun, a Senior Equity Analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC.

""We believe that the stock surge is due to the market factoring in strong new orders for the model (together with Onvo L90 launched earlier).""

Nio has historically targeted the high-end market, but has struggled as other companies rolled out vehicles that offer similar features at lower prices. To broaden its reach, the Tencent-backed carmaker has launched two cheaper brands: Onvo, aimed at the mass market, and Firefly, targeting young urban buyers.

The ES8's pricing makes it one of the most aggressively priced premium SUVs, which typically cost between 338,000 yuan and 768,000 yuan.

However, Nio's ET5T sedan holds the title for being the most budget-friendly Nio model, starting at 298,000 yuan.

This rollout of the ES8 comes as China's electric vehicle sector faces mounting pressure. Nio and its EV peers Li Auto and BYD saw a dip in their car deliveries with 21,017 units in July, from 24,925 units in June, while competitors such as Xpeng, Xiaomi, Leapmotor, and Aito reported growth.

Intense competition at home, higher tariffs on exports and regulatory pressure in markets such as the EU have pushed Chinese EV makers, including Nio, to accelerate their global expansion plans.

Nio announced Monday that it would expand into three new markets between 2025 and 2026, including Singapore — its first entry into Southeast Asia — where it will debut its first right-hand drive model under the Firefly brand.

Major Japanese automakers have denied to CNBC that they have raised prices in the U.S. because of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

That comes after a Nikkei Asia report on Thursday that stated that Japanese automakers are ""passing some of the expense of U.S. tariffs through to American car buyers, a change from their strategy of absorbing the impact.""

Japan was hit with 25% tariffs on automobiles in April, but that was lowered to 15% under a deal reached with the Trump administration on July 22.

Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, told CNBC on Thursday that when its U.S. affiliate raised prices in July, it was ""not in response to the tariffs or prospects of increases, but rather a regular, annual price increase to reflect increases in various operational costs.""

""We have said that we would observe the situation concerning the tariffs as governments were still negotiating then, but our general stance was not to increase prices to avoid making our cars unaffordable for the customers waiting for their vehicles,"" the company added.

Reuters reported in June Toyota's plan to increase prices by an average of $270 in July, but a Toyota spokesperson also denied then that the hikes were a direct result of U.S. tariffs.

In its financial results for the first quarter ended June 2025 — Toyota had estimated the impact of U.S. tariffs to be 450 billion yen ($3.03 billion) in its first quarter, and projected it would be 1.4 trillion yen for the full year, taking the U.S.-Japan trade deal into account.

Similarly, Honda told CNBC it has been able to avoid passing tariff costs directly on its products, saying the brand has been able to do so because it has more vehicles in the top 20 of Cars.com's American-Made Index than any other brand.

The index says it ranks models by ""how American your prospective car or truck might be,"" taking into account factors such as location of final assembly and percentage of U.S. and Canadian parts.

Honda said, ""Any price changes for the 2026 Honda models now on sale are tied to added feature content that enhances value for the customer and boosts the competitiveness of our products.""

As for Nissan, the company said prices have not been increased because of U.S. tariffs, adding that it was leveraging vehicles produced at its U.S. plants as much as possible to help offset tariffs.""At the same time, we are managing inventory to meet consumer demand while maintaining competitive pricing. We continue to monitor the market and will make adjustments as needed,"" its response to CNBC added.

Chocolate lovers face another run of price rises as a lag impact from the cocoa market hits retailers — but better news may be in store by next Easter.

Cocoa prices have soared in recent years, hitting record highs amid adverse weather conditions, pest outbreaks and supply tightness in West Africa, which produces around three-quarters of global supply.

That trend has combined with broader retail price inflation around the world which is pushing up costs for consumers and denting demand for sweet treats in the process. A 2024 survey by U.K. consumer group Which? found chocolate products were the category with the highest average annual inflation rate in grocery stores last year, at 11%. In the U.S., the price of popular products such as Hershey's Kisses similarly jumped around 12% year-on-year.

Adalbert Lechner, head of Swiss giant Lindt & Sprüngli, told CNBC in April he doesn't think cocoa prices ""will ever come down to the levels where they have been before.""

Cocoa futures have remained choppy but overall eased this year, falling from $8,177 per metric ton at the start of January to around $7,855 in August. That compares with $2,374 three years ago.

And the recent decline won't show up in chocolate prices in the near-term, according to Tracey Allen, agricultural commodities strategist at J.P. Morgan.

""We've got a bit of a hangover happening here,"" Allen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

Chocolatiers are still dealing with the heightened cocoa prices from the fourth quarter of 2024 when they saw record highs, she said.

""These heightened prices have really had this flow-on, lagged impact for the industry as a whole,"" she said, with a higher cost of doing business being passed through to the consumer. ""There is this ongoing deficit in the market, big depletion of availability of cocoa beans and availability of products. So higher prices for longer here, I'm afraid,"" she continued.

Lydia Toth, spokesperson for the association of Swiss chocolate manufacturers Chocosuisse, said the quadrupling of cocoa prices over the past two years had significantly increased production costs, squeezing manufacturers' margins, particularly given that retail prices tend to lag.

""The impact is being felt across the industry, from smaller businesses to large international exporters. While some of these cost increases have been passed on to consumers, further price adjustments remain likely. A return to earlier price levels is unlikely,"" Toth told CNBC.

However, the outlook may be slightly brighter in time for the busy Easter season, J.P. Morgan's Tracey Allen noted.

Industrial demand from manufacturers is softening just as supply is improving, with production ramping up, better weather conditions and new plantings in Ecuador and Brazil reaching maturity, according to J.P. Morgan analysis, though cocoa prices are seen remaining structurally higher for longer at $6,000 per metric ton.

Hamad Hussain, climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC that longstanding productivity challenges such as diseases and years of underinvestment in Ivory Coast and Ghana – the world's two largest cocoa producers – mean that global supply will remain tight, even if weather conditions in West Africa improve over the coming months.

""That will keep prices elevated at historically high levels. Historically high cocoa prices could support chocolate prices,"" he said.

He also noted other factors that could push up costs on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the U.K., businesses face higher costs from hikes to the minimum wage and employee contributions, which Hussain said appeared to be feeding into the price of foodstuffs including chocolate.

Meanwhile, in the U.S. he said the impact of tariffs could add upward pressure to the price of chocolate over the coming months.

""The upshot is that consumers are likely to face high chocolate prices for some time,"" he said.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Friday showered praise on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on a visit to Taiwan, saying that anybody looking to take a stake in the company would be ""very smart.""

This comes at a time when the U.S. administration has signaled interest in acquiring stakes in tech companies, especially those in receipt of funding under the U.S. CHIPS Act.

Huang, who said the main purpose of his trip was to thank TSMC for work related to Nvidia's Rubin, its next-generation AI chip architecture, made the remarks in response to a query on Washington looking to take a stake in the Taiwanese chip foundry.

""Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person,"" he said. 

Huang also said TSMC was making six new products for Nvidia, including a new central processing unit, a hardware component used for computation, and a new graphics processing unit, used for advanced computation, especially AI.

Earlier this week, Reuters had reported that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was looking at equity stakes in exchange for CHIPS Act funding for companies such as Micron, TSMC and Samsung. 

The 2022 CHIPS Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Joe Biden administration, has seen grants and loans awarded to chipmakers expanding production in the U.S. as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC had been promised $6.6 billion under the act to help build its three cutting-edge chip fabrication plants in Arizona.

Lutnick confirmed in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the government was in talks to take a 10% equity stake in troubled semiconductor company Intel, and said the administration might consider stakes in other firms as well.

A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, however, said the government had no plans to seek shares in semiconductor firms that were increasing their U.S. investments, citing a government official. TSMC, in March, announced an expansion of its Investment in the United States to $165 billion.

Separately, Huang said that Nvidia was eager to begin work on ""NVIDIA Constellation"" — a recently announced new Taiwan office for the company to house its growing Taiwan workforce.

Huang said the company was still working with the local government to resolve some issues to start its construction. 

""We have many, many employees here in Taiwan, and we're growing here in Taiwan because our supply chain is so busy here."" 

""We're working with chip companies, system vendors and system makers all over Taiwan, and everybody is working so hard for us and so we need a lot of engineers to work alongside them,"" he added.

Shares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, have gained 6.5% so far this year.

Separately, news reports on Friday said Nvidia had asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to its made-for-China H20 graphics processing units, after China raised security concerns over the chips. 

Last month, Nvidia said it expected to receive an export license for its H20 chips, which had been effectively banned in April. However, Beijing has reportedly placed a freeze on local companies' ability to buy them.

According to Reuters, one of the companies told to pause their work in relation to the H20 chips was Taiwan's Foxconn — also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Foxconn did not respond to an inquiry from CNBC on the matter.

Huang on Friday said that the company had responded to Beijing's concerns regarding its H20s and was hoping that the issue would be resolved.

The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the possibility of an interest rate cut in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Within 15 minutes of Powell's speech starting, Bitcoin jumped above $114,700 from $112,000, a nearly 2.5% gain, while Ethereum surged to $4,600 from $4,300, an almost 7% increase, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Both cryptocurrencies remained down 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, over the past week.

By the time Powell was done with his remarks, altcoins were soaring. XRP and Solana had both surged more than 6% in less than an hour, with XRP regaining the $3 threshold for the first time since Tuesday. Dogecoin leapt more than 7% for the same time frame. However, most altcoins tracked by CoinGecko were still slightly in the red on the week, a sign of investors' earlier angst about the Fed's path forward.

An interest rate cut would likely buoy cryptocurrency and other risk-on assets by boosting liquidity for investment. U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressuring Powell relentlessly to slash rates amid concerns that the economy is slowing.

In a Myriad Linea market, 87% of respondents expect the Fed to change the interest rate, up from closer to 70% earlier this week.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Powell was steadfast in his assessment that the central bank faces elevated inflation risks compared to the labor market, but he said that the central bank is prepared to adjust its policy stance if its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices is in conflict.

Caveating that the central bank is not on any preset course, Powell said “the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” indicating that the central bank may lower interest rates at its September meeting.

Still, Powell warned that inflation from Trump's tariffs has not been fully reflected in economic data, and it could be that way for months.

“It will continue to take more time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks,” he said. “Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.”

Analysts say that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were falling earlier this week in anticipation of Powell's eighth and final speech in Jackson Hole as Fed chair. With markets positioned for easing in September, they said “cautiously hawkish” remarks could disappoint investors.

Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt on Thursday that he expected Powell to focus on sticky inflation and tariff uncertainty, while avoiding any pre-commitment to a rate cut in September and potentially pressuring risk-on assets with a firmer tone.

Powell looked back on the COVID-19 pandemic in defending his tenure as Fed chair. The central bank took drastic measures to stabilize markets and stimulate growth as the U.S. economy ground to a halt nearly overnight. And as a red-hot economy roared back from pandemic-related pressures, inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. 

UPDATE (August 22, 2025, 11:01 a.m. ET): Adds token price information and context on the impact of a rate cut. 

UPDATE (August 22, 2025, 11:08 a.m. ET): Adds Myriad Linea paragraph.

Top 3 cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are trading cautiously at the time of writing on Friday as traders brace for potential volatility ahead of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium. BTC holds above its key support, ETH shows some signs of resilience, while XRP struggles near its 50-day Exponential Moving Average. The crypto market's next move may hinge on Powell's guidance on the Fed's policy outlook.

BTC price has fallen over 8% from its record of $124,747 on August 14, closing below an ascending trendline drawn by connecting multiple lows since early April this week, and retested its support level at $111,980 on Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $113,432.

If the support at $111,980 holds and BTC recovers and closes above its 50-day EMA at $114,786, it could extend the recovery toward its next daily resistance at $116,000.

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 43 below its neutral value of 50, suggesting bearish momentum. For the recovery rally to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral value.

BTC/USDT daily chart 

However, if BTC continues its correction and closes below $111,980 support, it could extend the decline toward its 100-day EMA at $110,605.

Ethereum price reached a new yearly high of $4,788 last week on August 14, but failed to continue its upward trend and declined by over 14% in the next five days until Tuesday. However, ETH recovered 6.39% the next day and found support around the daily level of $4,232 on Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades slightly above at $4,282.

If the daily level at $4,232 continues to hold as support, ETH could extend the recovery toward its next daily resistance at $4,488. A successful close above this level could extend the rally toward its yearly high at $4,788.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 56, rebounding from its neutral level of 50 on Tuesday and points upward, suggesting bullish momentum is gaining traction.

ETH/USDT daily chart 

However, if ETH faces a correction and closes below its daily support at $4,232, it could extend the decline toward its next support level at $3,946.

XRP price faced rejection around the daily level of $3.40 on August 14 and declined over 12% in the next five days, closing below the 50-day EMA at $2.93 on Tuesday. XRP recovered slightly on Wednesday, but faced a rejection from its 50-day EMA the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to trade down at $2.83.

If the 50-day EMA at $2.93 continues to hold as resistance, XRP price could extend the decline to retest its key support at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 41 below the neutral level of 50, pointing downward, indicating strong bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bearish crossover and rising red histogram bars, supporting the bearish thesis.

XRP/USDT daily chart 

Conversely, if XRP recovers and closes above its 50-day EMA at $2.93, it could extend the recovery toward its daily resistance at $2.99.

The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset's current market value. 

Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","EU exploring Ethereum, Solana for digital euro launch: FT","https://cointelegraph.com/news/europe-mulls-ethereum-solana-digital-euro-launch","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 08:20:20 GMT","

 The EU is exploring Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro, marking a shift toward public blockchains over private models like China's CBDC, according to the FT. 

The European Union is reportedly exploring major public blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana in connection with its digital euro design.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering running a digital euro on a public blockchain like Ethereum rather than a private one, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Unlike a private blockchain, where data is limited to authorized entities, public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana are open to everyone.

If confirmed, the EU's exploration of public blockchains would represent a significant milestone in the digital euro's development, given that the ECB has not yet finalized the technology framework for the project.

The use of a public blockchain is “definitely something that [EU officials are] taking more seriously now,” one of the people involved in the digital euro discussions told the FT.

Another person said a digital euro in a private form would look “much more like what the Chinese central bank is doing than what private companies in the US are doing.”

The person specifically referred to China's central bank digital currency (CBDC), deployed privately, as opposed to public-run stablecoins developed by companies like Circle.

Europe has been increasingly concerned about the US stablecoin push promoted by the Trump administration and its implications for the autonomy of the European financial system.

In April, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone called for cutting stablecoin usage in Europe by introducing a digital euro, citing adoption risks of the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, which dominate the stablecoin market at 98%.

A spokesperson for the ECB did not explicitly confirm or deny that the bank has started exploring specific public networks such as Ethereum or Solana for a digital euro.

The representative referred to an official ECB page with frequent questions related to a digital euro, which states that the authority has yet to decide on what CBDC model would be deployed.

Should the EU eventually opt for a public digital euro design, there would be both positive and negative implications, according to Juan Ignacio Ibañez, general secretary of MiCA Crypto Alliance.

“On the positive side, there is potential for a public-blockchain-based digital euro to interoperate better with all the infrastructure being developed on blockchain these years,” Ibañez told Cointelegraph. On the negative side, this would introduce a “stronger state interest in influencing blockchain governance,” he said.

The ECB has yet to decide whether to proceed with the digital euro project.

According to official ECB information, the ECB Governing Council is expected to deliver a decision on whether to issue a digital euro by the end of 2025.

TRON is outperforming other altcoins, mainly driven by user growth.



TRON outpaced altcoins in BTC performance, with Kraken expanding xStocks to Tron. MetaMask adding TRX support and growing USDT adoption, boosting its user base and exchange partnerships.

Justin Sun's blockchain, TRON [TRX] is still making waves not only in terms of price performance but also in major partnerships around the crypto space.

The altcoin has outperformed its peers when evaluating their ratio changes against Bitcoin [BTC].

The altcoin has been among the best performers for the year, with returns of more than 115%, per CoinMarketCap. Its user growth has been one of the main drivers of price performance.



That said, Justin Sun is looking to adjust the transaction cost on the blockchain. As the unit price of TRX rises, the fees follow.

This would let TRON remain competitive in as a layer for stablecoin issuance, DeFi activities and tokenization.

Evaluating the weekly gains for the major altcoins against Bitcoin, the charts showed that TRON led with 2.66%.

It was closely followed by Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH], which barely had 1%. For Ripple [XRP], the change was negative 2.28% over the same period.

Following this performance, some users were regretting not to have bought TRX in the previous bear market. This bull market has made TRX have the best returns since 2021.

On the TRX valuation against the US dollar, the altcoin traded at $0.35 per Trading View. Since the 23rd of July, when it traded at $0.24, TRX has stayed above the trendline support with timely bounce of it.

The MACD has flipped bullish after the bounce, but the Stochastic RSI is still at overbought levels. Still, the altcoin shows urge to reclaim $0.37 which was its previous peak as users continue to rise.

User growth is the standout driver of TRON's price growth, driven by the surge in chain activity. Kraken users will now trade their xStocks on the TRON blockchain.

The tokenization of stocks on TRON brings another bunch of traditional participants of the markets. Kraken's tokenized equities include Apple, Tesla, among others.

Additionally, TXR is being integrated on MetaMask per CoinMarketCap. This will bring more than 100 million users on board. Recently, MetaMask also integrated Sei Network [SEI] and Solana.

Also, institutions have been heavily relying on the blockchain in moving their USDT. Most of the USDT is transacted on TRON blockchain, with more than $860 million flowing into exchanges.

This has been the case since 2022, with USDT accounting for 61% of total transactions on TRON.

Among the exchanges, OKX led this inflow of stablecoins through the network. Bitfinex came second, but its volume, in reality, was about a fifth of what was moved on OKX.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Coinbase Sparks New Buzz with Altcoin Additions","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/coinbase-new-altcoins-flock-awe-dojo-layer-spx6900","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:03:55 GMT","

The cryptocurrency landscape is igniting with speculation as Coinbase, a heavyweight in the exchange arena, unveils a lineup of five fresh altcoins: FLOCK, AWE, DOLO, LAYER, and SPX6900. A notable highlight is FLOCK's astonishing 30% leap in a mere 24 hours. As the excitement simmers, this article delves deep into the implications of Coinbase's strategic maneuvers and their potential to influence investor behavior and market dynamics.

When it comes to cryptocurrency, few entities wield the influence that Coinbase does. The phrase ""Coinbase effect"" perfectly captures the phenomenon where altcoins experience dramatic price movements following news of their prospective listings on the platform. FLOCK serves as a prime example, capturing the attention of eager speculators ready to chase new gains. Investors would be wise to keep close tabs on Coinbase's roadmap updates, which hold the power to shape market expectations and dictate trading behaviors.

FLOCK Cryptocurrency: At the forefront, FLOCK is making waves with an eye-catching 30% price escalation in just one day. This spike reflects a roiling market craving speculative opportunities, leaving eager investors on the lookout for future trading enhancements to sustain its upward trajectory.

AWE Token: Not quite a household name, yet AWE is asserting its place within an expanding ecosystem. Following its listing, this token could gain momentum as traders seek novel investment avenues.

DOLO Coin: An innovator in its approach, DOLO is making strides to capture investor interest, positioning itself as the next altcoin to watch.

LAYER Token: With its focus on user-friendly scalability and minimal transaction fees, LAYER is emerging as a desirable option for those navigating the choppy waters of decentralized finance (DeFi), firming up its relevance in speculative trading circles.

SPX6900 Cryptocurrency: Though it may not have garnered major headlines yet, SPX6900 is poised to draw the attention of traders eager to explore new opportunities presented by Coinbase.

Today's cryptocurrency market is brimming with volatility, challenged by mounting regulatory scrutiny and macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from Federal Reserve policies. Still, Coinbase remains a beacon of innovation by continually attracting interest through its new altcoin offerings. This proactive strategy is essential amid evolving regulatory landscapes, appealing to both seasoned investors and those dipping their toes into the crypto waters for the first time.

As excitement swirls around newly introduced listings, it is crucial to scrutinize the mechanisms that underlie cryptocurrency exchanges. While traders flock to Coinbase for speculation, the necessity of stringent compliance frameworks cannot be overstated. New entrants in the space must prioritize seamless integration of cryptocurrency and fiat payment solutions all while grappling with the complex regulatory landscape.

Research underscores that emerging startups within the Web3 ecosystem can significantly enhance their potential for success by leveraging integrated crypto-fiat payment systems that prioritize compliance. A study by John Doe indicates that ensuring regulatory alignment while streamlining transaction processes can mitigate the inherent risks tied to speculative ventures. As Coinbase broadens its spectrum of listings, the demand for platforms valuing both compliance and innovation is set to increase.

For those invested in the potential outcomes of Coinbase's latest altcoin movements, here are some vital takeaways:

Coinbase's strategic inclusion of FLOCK and other altcoins into its trading offerings embodies the ever-shifting interaction between speculation and tangible market realities in the crypto sphere. Investors must align their pursuit of potential profits with the foundational compliance measures ensuring market stability. By remaining well-informed and judicious in their choices, they can deftly navigate this landscape, seizing the enticing opportunities springing from each new Coinbase listing.

In an environment where each announcement can herald significant shifts, the moment to act is here—let the Coinbase effect guide your investment journey!

HBAR traded in a narrow but active 4% range from Aug. 20–21, climbing to $0.24 in the evening before correcting to $0.23 early the next day. By session's end, the token had regained $0.24, reinforcing the $0.23–$0.24 band as a zone of support and accumulation.

The rebound comes as broader macro conditions favor digital assets. The Federal Reserve has kept rates below 2%, with markets increasingly pricing in cuts that could provide short-term momentum for crypto.

Institutional developments are also strengthening sentiment. Global payments network SWIFT launched live blockchain trials featuring Hedera, while asset manager Grayscale filed a Delaware trust for HBAR — a move viewed by some as laying groundwork for a future ETF.

Together, these factors highlight rising institutional interest in enterprise blockchain infrastructure. As central banks and financial institutions accelerate testing of tokenized settlement systems, Hedera's positioning within global payments is gaining attention. HBAR's latest recovery may signal more than intraday volatility — it reflects growing confidence in Hedera's role in digital finance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Japan's SBI forms new blockchain ties with Circle, Ripple and Startale","https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbi-japan-blockchain-partnership-circle-ripple-startale","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:40:59 GMT","

 SBI partners with Circle, Ripple and Startale to launch stablecoin ventures and a tokenized asset trading platform in Japan. 

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI inked new blockchain partnerships with USDC issuer Circle, XRP developer Ripple and the Web3 company Startale.

SBI Group announced the three separate partnerships on Friday, including stablecoin-related collaborations with US companies Circle and Ripple, and a new tokenization project with Singapore-based Startale.

In cooperation with Startale, SBI plans to build an onchain trading platform for tokenized stocks and real-world assets (RWAs) to enable 24/7 trading.

As part of stablecoin collaborations with Ripple and Circle, SBI will explore new ways to promote adoption of Circle's USDC (USDC) and Ripple's Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin.

While the Circle announcement mentions the establishment of a joint venture with SBI, the partnership with Ripple aims to establish RLUSD distribution in Japan through SBI's crypto subsidiary SBI VC Trade.

“The establishment of this joint venture aims to promote the use of USDC in Japan and create new use cases in the Web3 and digital finance domains,” SBI said.

The Ripple announcement refers to a new memorandum of understanding with Ripple Labs on distributing RLUSD in Japan, with SBI VC Trade aiming to make the stablecoin available during the fiscal year ending March 2026.

“The introduction of RLUSD will not just expand the option of stablecoins in the Japanese market, but is a major step forward in the reliability and convenience of stablecoins in the Japanese market,” SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo said.

SBI previously announced similar partnerships with both Circle and Ripple, with SBI VC Trade completing registration to support USDC operations in March. The Japanese conglomerate has maintained a long-standing partnership with Ripple, facilitating various XRP (XRP) services across its platforms over the past several years.

As part of a joint venture with Startale, SBI secured “milestone-based committed funding” to build an onchain tokenized platform in Japan.

The development echoes many tokenization initiatives globally, with companies like Gemini, Kraken and Robinhood introducing similar 24/7 trading platforms offering tokenized stocks of companies like Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) earlier this year.

“As tokenized RWAs enable 24/7 real-time settlement and achieve unprecedented liquidity and capital efficiency, the convergence of traditional finance and DeFi will likely accelerate,” SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said.

“We predict that this movement will eventually lead to the digitalization of capital markets themselves, including exchanges,” the executive said, adding:

The announcement did not specify either the expected launch date for the platform with Startale or what blockchain network would be used in the venture. Startale is known for co-developing Sony's layer-2 blockchain Soneium and Astar Network.

“We're not ready to reveal the technical architecture just yet,” Startale Group CEO Sota Watanabe told Cointelegraph.

“What matters is the joint venture's mission: to deliver an always-on, compliant trading platform for tokenized assets,” Watanabe said, adding that the timeline will be announced at a later date.

Cointelegraph approached SBI for comment regarding the joint tokenization project but had not received a response by publication.

SBI's move comes as major financial players globally are experimenting with the tokenization of traditional assets. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Eric Trump plans to visit Tokyo in September as part of his family's expanding push into the cryptocurrency industry.

State Street, a Boston-based custody bank with $49 trillion in assets under its watch, is pushing deeper into digital assets by joining JPMorgan's blockchain-based tokenized asset platform Digital Debt Service as the first third-party custodian.

The first transaction State Street anchored was a $100 million tokenized commercial paper issuance by the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), a Singapore-based banking group, according to a Thursday press release.

State Street Investment Management, the bank's asset management arm, purchased the debt. J.P. Morgan Securities acted as placement agent.

The move comes as traditional finance heavyweights and global banks are getting increasingly involved in tokenization of financial instruments, or real-world assets (RWA), placing bonds, funds and credit on blockchain rails. The process promises operational benefits such as increased efficiency, faster and around-the-clock settlements and lower administrative costs.

The tokenized asset market could grow could balloon in the next few years, though projections vary from McKinsey's $2 trillion by 2030 to Ripple and BCG's almost $19 trillion by 2033.

By joining JPMorgan's blockchain platform, State Street can now offer clients custody of tokenized debt securities without changing its traditional servicing model.

In this particular case, State Street manages client holdings in a digital wallet directly connected to JPMorgan's system, eliminating manual steps in settlement and recordkeeping. The infrastructure supports delivery-versus-payment settlement, with the option for same-day (T+0) settlement, and automates corporate actions such as interest payments and redemptions through smart contracts.

""This launch reflects a meaningful step forward in our digital strategy — where we manage a digital wallet on-chain and lay the groundwork for interoperability across blockchain networks,"" Donna Milrod, State Street's chief product officer, said in a statement.

The bank pursued initiatives to tokenize a bond and a money market fund, Milrod said in October. The firm also selected Switzerland-based Taurus as a tokenization partner.

Over $800,000 worth of “blue chip” NFTs are still being held in contracts of Parallel Finance, despite it pulling support for its NFT lending product after a six-month notice period.

With no front end support for NFT lending, non-technical users are unable to withdraw their tokens manually, and the Parallel team is reportedly charging a $500 fee to return the assets.

Yuga Labs' 0xQuit highlighted the predicament on X, as well as posting a step-by-step guide on how to manually withdraw assets using the Etherscan block explorer.

The vaults of the now defunct Parallel Finance own 11 BAYC, 39 MAYC, and 2 Doodles. The frontend is deprecated, leaving nontechnical users stuck, and the founder is charging a $500 fee to help.If your assets are stuck, here's a step by step to extract them:1/🧵 pic.twitter.com/JFJSDqEfPK

Users were warned that support would be withdrawn in plenty of time; the Parallel Finance website contains a banner linking to an “Important Product Closure Notice.”

Published on January 31, the notice informs users that various services, including NFT lending, will be closed on August 1. “You will have six months from today to withdraw your funds. After this period, you won't be able to withdraw,” it read.

It appears that some users didn't heed the warnings, however. This is unsurprising, given the drop-off in the NFT sector since its peak in Spring of 2022.

Even a recent Pudgy Penguins promo push was seemingly forgotten within 24 hours.

0xQuit identified a number of NFTs from high-value collections still locked up on the platform. These included 11 Bored Ape Yacht Club, 39 Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and two Doodles.

According to current floor price data of the collections listed, the NFTs are worth in excess of $800,000, though tokens with specific traits may be worth more.

Screenshots appear to show a Telegram conversation with Parallel CEO Yubo Ruan in which a user is informed “there will be a $500 late fee for the asset withdrawal.”

Even without a user interface, it's possible for users to withdraw their tokens by interacting with the contract directly. Manual withdrawal requires tracking down a user-specific proxy contract address as well as other info, and encoding a withdrawal transaction for each NFT collection.

0xQuit recognises that the “steps to recover aren't intuitive, but they're doable with some effort.” They add, “If you run into issues, drop a reply below and I'll be happy to help (for free).”

Ruan told Protos, “Please withdraw using [0xQuit's] tutorial, as the platform has officially closed on August 1, 2025.

“Otherwise, all remaining NFTs will be liquidated to provide lender liquidity.”

- MetaWin launches MetaWin Create, offering free AI tools to MetaWinners NFT holders, enhancing NFT utility through blockchain and AI integration.

- The platform hosts a $1.3M exclusive NFT holder event, with a $1M top prize, reinforcing community-driven value and real-world NFT applications.

- MetaWin's 10,000 NFTs, designed by Terraform Labs, have seen tenfold price growth and millions in prize distributions since 2024.

- AI integration boosts productivity threefold internally, with plans for full AI-powered game development, redefining NFTs as functional assets.

MetaWin has launched a new initiative called MetaWin Create, which offers free access to a suite of premium AI tools exclusively for holders of MetaWinners NFTs. This announcement marks a significant step in integrating AI technology with NFT utility, positioning MetaWin as a pioneer in leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to enhance community value. The tools are categorized into productivity, creative, and developer platforms, aiming to empower NFT holders with resources to boost efficiency, creativity, and technical development. MetaWin Create will be available in phases and requires no additional cost for verified NFT holders[2]. The platform's founder, Skel, emphasized the importance of AI in shaping the future, stating that access to these tools could transform the way users interact with Web3 technology[2].

The MetaWinners NFT collection consists of 10,000 unique digital art pieces, designed by Terraform Labs, a studio known for major Hollywood and gaming projects. These NFTs serve as more than just collectibles; they are integral to the holder's identity within the MetaWin ecosystem and act as a badge of honor across the broader Web3 community. Since its launch in December 2024, the project has delivered millions of dollars in prizes to NFT holders, while the floor price of the collection has increased tenfold. This growth highlights the strong utility and value proposition associated with the NFTs[1][3][4].

MetaWin is also set to host the MetaWinners Millionaire event on September 30, 2025, offering a total prize pool of $1.3 million. A single NFT holder will win $1 million, with the remaining $300,000 distributed among other winners. The event is entirely exclusive to NFT holders, with no entries for sale, meaning only the 10,000 NFT owners can participate. This structure ensures that the competition remains community-driven, with odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 10,000. The event is considered a groundbreaking move in NFT utility, offering the largest guaranteed cash prize to an NFT holder in the industry[1][3][4].

The integration of AI tools and exclusive events like the MetaWinners Millionaire reflects MetaWin's broader strategy to enhance the value of NFT ownership beyond speculative investment. By embedding real-world applications such as productivity, creative development, and competitive prize pools, the platform is creating a more functional and engaging NFT ecosystem. The move also aligns with the growing trend of blockchain platforms leveraging AI to streamline operations and improve user experiences. For instance, MetaWin's internal teams are already reporting three times higher productivity due to AI integration, and its game studio is transitioning to full AI-powered development[2].

MetaWin's approach to NFT utility is setting a benchmark in the digital asset space. By combining exclusive rewards, real-world tools, and competitive elements, the platform is redefining how NFTs can serve as more than just digital collectibles. The MetaWinners project has already demonstrated significant traction, with substantial increases in both prize distributions and NFT value. As the event and AI initiatives unfold, MetaWin aims to further solidify its position as a category-defining project in the blockchain and NFT landscape[1][2][4].

The UK Information Commissioner's Office has launched two consultations as part of the transition to the Data User and Access Act framework. These consultations will be of particular interest to organisations operating UK-facing websites, analytics tools, and online advertising services.

Cookies and Similar Technologies (closes 26 September 2025)
The ICO is seeking views on when consent is required for the use of cookies and similar technologies. In particular, it is exploring whether exemptions could be extended to cover low-risk technologies that enhance user experience such as preference settings, basic analytics, or certain security updates.

Online Advertising and Consent (closes 7 September 2025)
The ICO is also considering whether limited low-risk forms of tracking for advertising could be permitted without explicit consent under the DUAA. This consultation raises important questions for publishers, platforms, and adtech providers balancing privacy compliance with advertising models.

For businesses, these consultations signal potential changes to the familiar “cookie banner” landscape and may result in divergence from the EU ePrivacy regime. Organisations with cross-border operations should track these developments carefully and consider whether to submit responses.

We recently examined the wider DUAA reforms, highlighting the implications for data protection compliance and digital business models. The outcomes of the ICO's consultations will play a key role in shaping how the DUAA operates in practice.

Next Steps

The measures in the Data (Use and Access) Act are being introduced over the coming months

Charities have been encouraged to take part in a consultation on new guidance around the introduction of a “soft opt-in” for electronic marketing.

The Information Commissioner's Office has this week opened a consultation on draft guidance for organisations handling data protection complaints in preparation for the Data (Use and Access) Act, which is expected to be fully introduced in the coming months.

The act will enable charities to send direct marketing messages via email, text or social media to people who either express an interest in or offer to provide support to their charity without needing the person's consent.

It will also require organisations to give customers a way of making data protection complaints, acknowledge receipt of complaints within 30 days of receiving them, take appropriate steps to respond to complaints including making appropriate enquiries and keep people informed and tell people the outcome of their complaints.

“The guidance aims to walk organisations through the new requirements and inform them of what they must, should and could do to comply,” the regulator said.

“It includes helpful tips and practical advice for each stage in the process.”

The consultation invites views on areas including the main challenges organisations would face in implementing a complaints process, the extent to which they feel the guidance helps them understand their legal obligations in this area and the costs they are likely to face as a result. 

The regulator said it might publish in full the responses received from organisations or a summary of the responses.

The consultation is open until 19 October.","{'href': 'https://www.thirdsector.co.uk', 'title': 'Third Sector'}","cryptocurrency"

Today the Financial Times ran an article saying EU officials are accelerating plans for the digital euro central bank digital currency, spurred on by the passage of the US GENIUS Act for stablecoins. It also asserted that officials are mulling launching the digital euro on the public Ethereum or Solana blockchains, “rather than a private one, which had previously been expected, due to privacy concerns.” 

While the first statement is undoubtedly accurate, the second one deserves examination as it potentially conflates several topics. As part of the ECB retail digital euro work, it is currently exploring potential innovations involving at least 70 organizations. A few of these are blockchain firms. This is likely the source of these ‘discussions'. But the retail digital euro never planned to use blockchain, certainly not at the base layer. Blockchain is not sufficiently performant. On the other hand, a wholesale CBDC for use only by banks would almost certainly use blockchain. The one piloted by the Banque de France leverages blockchain.

Even on the retail front, there's also the question of how blockchains might be used. Potentially someone could lock digital euros with a custodian and issue permissionless blockchain tokens linked to the digital euro. Unlike the real thing, that involves counterparty risks. But there are other avenues to use blockchain. China's digital yuan does not use blockchain at the base layer, but supports the use of blockchain applications and smart contracts tied to its CBDC. However, those are permissioned blockchains.

When US President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought with him an ambitious set of campaign-trail promises made to the crypto industry.

One of the few — and one of his earliest pledges — still on the table is his vow to block a US central bank digital currency. 

“Such a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money,” Trump warned last year. “They could take your money, and you wouldn't even know it was gone.”

Those efforts took a step forward this week when the House of Representatives passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a provision to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar.

The language, closely resembling Representative Tom Emmer's CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, would bar the Fed from offering accounts or digital tokens directly to individuals or through intermediaries.

It isn't the first time the House has acted on CBDCs. In May 2024, lawmakers passed a standalone financial services bill with the same aim, but it stalled in the Senate. 

While the measure marks progress toward a campaign pledge that resonated strongly with Trump's crypto supporters, no US CBDC has ever been issued, and the provision must still clear the Senate before it becomes law.

Trump has already checked off several of his campaign vows to the crypto industry. 

Just two days after his inauguration, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road marketplace, following through on a promise that had become a cause célèbre among libertarians and Bitcoiners. 

Trump had also pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, though he never had to. Gensler announced his resignation ahead of Inauguration Day, ending a tenure defined by aggressive enforcement actions against the industry. 

The president has since appointed crypto supporter Paul Atkins as the new head of the SEC.

In March, Trump established a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Though in its current iteration, the reserve consists only of coins seized by federal authorities rather than taxpayer-funded purchases. Treasury officials recently confirmed no additional buying is planned.

In August, Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing “debanking” by directing regulators to remove guidance seen as pressuring banks to avoid crypto companies, though experts question how much practical impact it will have.

Other pledges remain unfinished. 

Trump moved quickly in January with an executive order on digital assets that affirmed Americans should be free to hold their own crypto in self-hosted wallets and transact peer to peer without interference. 

But only Congress can make that protection permanent. The Clarity Act, which would formally enshrine these rights, passed the House in July but has yet to clear the Senate.

Lower interest rates, another key Trump campaign pledge, have so far remained out of reach. Though they haven't gone higher, either.

The Fed has kept its benchmark range pinned at 4.25% to 4.5% all year, leaving markets to look to central bank chair Jerome Powell's upcoming Jackson Hole remarks for clues on whether cuts are finally coming.

Traders had put the odds of a September rate cut as high as 83% on Wednesday, but that has slipped to just above 71% on Friday. 

For crypto, which thrives on looser liquidity, the outcome could set the tone for crypto and traditional markets through the rest of the year.

And then there is Trump's most far-fetched promise: to ensure that all remaining Bitcoin is mined in the United States. 

No serious policy effort has been made toward that goal, and even industry insiders saw this as more campaign rhetoric than an achievable target.

Oops, something went wrong

House Republicans have added a provision banning central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) into a 1,300 page bill which lays out defense spending and priorities for the next financial year.

The amendment, included in bill H.R. 3838, would prohibit the Federal Reserve from testing, developing or implementing a CBDC under any label.

It adds an exception for ""any dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private, and fully preserves the privacy protections of United States coins and physical currency.""

""Attaching our Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act to the NDAA will ensure unelected bureaucrats are NEVER allowed to trade Americans' financial privacy for a CCP-style surveillance tool,"" GOP Majority Whip Tom Emmer said last month, referring to the bill.

The charge to stop CBDCs in the U.S. is a largely Republican-led effort. Emmer himself attempted to introduce a CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act in 2023 but it failed to gain momentum. It was reintroduced upon Trump coming to office and is currently making its way through the Senate.

Globally, however, CBDCs are advancing rapidly. According to the Atlantic Council, 137 countries are exploring digital versions of their currencies, up from just 35 in 2020, and with 72 already in advanced stages of development. The U.S. remains an outlier after President Trump's executive order earlier this year to halt all retail CBDC work.

The opposition to CBDCs in the U.S. reflects competing visions of the future of money. Critics of CBDCs fear government overreach, surveillance and disruption to the banking sector.

The American Bankers Association (ABA), which backed the House measure in July, argued that a CBDC “would fundamentally change the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve, undermine the important role banks play in extending credit, exacerbate economic and liquidity crises, and impede the transmission of sound monetary policy.”

Nanak Nihal Khalsa, Co-Founder of human.tech by Holonym, told Decrypt that he hoped the senate bill against CBDCs passed because he feared “sleepwalking into surveillance money.”

Wyoming's Stablecoin Billed as Yield-Bearing Alternative to CBDC Control

“The fears are definitely justified,"" he said, calling CBDCs ""programmable money controlled by the state."" He added that, ""Once every transaction runs through a state ledger, privacy is gone by default and the question isn't if it gets abused, it's when.""

“If the US takes a stand against CBDCs, it opens up space to build alternatives that are open, permissionless, and actually preserve privacy, the things that made digital money worth caring about in the first place,” Khalsa said.

Khalsa added that stablecoins issued by private companies also carried some of the same risks. ""Private companies have the same incentives to track, exclude, and monetize,"" he said. ""The only difference is who you're forced to trust, the state or a corporation. Without privacy guarantees built into the protocol itself, you're choosing which empire you want to live under.""

Europe-based financial non-profit Finance Watch told Decrypt it believed concerns about surveillance are about ""design, not about the concept of a CBDC itself.""

Europe Needs Digital Euro, Central Bank Says After Trump Order Barring US CBDC

""It is entirely possible to create a CBDC that is open, permissionless, and preserves the same privacy protections as cash,"" a spokesperson said. ""That requires privacy by design and by default, strict limits on data collection, and offline functionality for small payments.""

""The real question is whether money should be run by private companies or issued by the central bank, as with cash,"" they added, arguing that the digital Euro being developed in the EU is being designed as ""a public alternative to established, privately controlled means of payment, reasserting citizens' control of money and payments.""

 The House slipped a provision banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital currency into an almost 1,300-page bill on defense policy. 

The US House added a provision banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) into an almost 1,300-page bill setting the country's defense policy for the 2026 fiscal year.

A revision of HR 3838, the House's version of a bill implementing the National Defense Authorization Act, was shared on Thursday by the House Rules Committee to include sweeping language banning the Federal Reserve from studying or creating digital currency.

The House passed a similar Republican-backed bill, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, in July with a slim vote of 219 - 210, which now has an uncertain future in the Senate.

The National Defense Authorization Act and related appropriations bills are seen as “must-pass” national security legislation as they outline how the military will be funded and how it will spend its budget.

It's typical of lawmakers to add non-defense-related provisions that could otherwise be stalled or heavily revised if passed as standalone bills.

Top House Republicans had promised to include a CBDC ban in the military spending bill in a deal with conservative hardliners in July.

A group of Republican holdouts had refused to move three crypto bills forward unless a CBDC ban was guaranteed to pass, stalling a vote to set up floor debate on the bills for over nine hours, the longest in the House's history.

At the time, the House passing the CBDC-banning bill on its own was seen as unlikely due to a lack of support. Debate on the bills eventually moved forward after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said the CBDC ban would be added to the National Defense Authorization Act.

The provision in the defense policy bill would ban the Fed from issuing any digital currency or asset and stop the central bank from offering financial products or services directly to individuals.

It adds that the central bank may not “test, study, develop, create, or implement” a digital currency or asset, but allows a carve-out for stablecoins, saying the bill does not prohibit “any dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private.”

House Republicans have been looking to ban CBDCs for some time.

The party's House leaders had looked to pass a version of the CBDC-banning bill in the last congressional session.

A similarly named bill, called the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, was introduced by Representative Tom Emmer in early 2023, but it didn't progress and died with the last Congress.

Emmer reintroduced a version of the bill in the current Congress, and Republicans have backed the effort as aligning with President Donald Trump's executive order in January prohibiting CBDCs.

 Beijing's consideration of a yuan-backed stablecoin could mark a new front in the global financial system, but experts say dollar dominance, liquidity and trust are high hurdles. 

China appears to be weighing the launch of a yuan-backed stablecoin, with an initial rollout in Hong Kong and Shanghai, a surprising shift after years of cracking down on crypto while promoting its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan.

In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph spoke with two leaders analyzing China's potential move into stablecoins: Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Patrick Tan, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos. 

The news, first reported on Wednesday, highlighted Beijing's ambitions to strengthen the yuan's role in international finance. Still, experts say the path forward is anything but certain, especially with the track record of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. 

According to Chorzempa, the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay in everyday transactions has left little room for China's CBDC experiment. 

That leaves a yuan stablecoin with a different potential role. “I tend to think that probably the most interesting applications of a renminbi [yuan] stablecoin is going to be cross-border payments,” Chorzempa said.

Still, cross-border utility doesn't erase the credibility gap between the yuan and the US dollar. Chorzempa said:

“And if the answer is yes,” he said, “it's probably not going to be that attractive in comparison to something in USD, which is really freely usable.”

From a market perspective, the hurdles are just as steep. “Ninety-eight percent of all stablecoins and stablecoin transactions are dollar-based,” said Tan. 

For Tan, the real issue is systemic: “If China wants to make the digital yuan attractive, it needs to make the yuan attractive first. And to make the yuan attractive requires significant, large systemic political and economic changes and reforms, which, given the current climate in China, I think would be extremely challenging at best.”

Whether China's stablecoin push succeeds or stalls, it signals one thing clearly: Stablecoins are no longer just crypto plumbing; they've become tools in a larger geopolitical contest over the future of money.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, on July 18. Regulatory inaction is pushing Canadians toward U.S. dollar-based stablecoins.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Ori Freiman is a post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University's Digital Society Lab. Rafael Morales-Guzman is a doctoral candidate at the University of Saskatchewan and a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation's Digital Policy Hub.

As the U.S. Senate passed landmark legislation to regulate the digital American dollar, Canada's slow response is an economic neglect, practically surrendering our economic future. Meet “stablecoins,” the technology underlying future payments.

Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value. They are primarily distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: the link that gives them value and how they maintain their stability.

Their value is usually pegged to a currency – commonly the U.S. dollar, a precious metal such as gold, or a mix of assets. The methods used to prevent value fluctuation range from holding one-to-one cash reserves to deploying smart algorithms that control the supply. This is how stablecoins avoid the price volatility that characterizes cryptocurrencies, making them more suitable for everyday payments and transactions.

For consumers and small businesses using stablecoins is like upgrading from snail mail to e-mail, but for money. Payments can be sent and received instantly, any time, including weekends, and across the globe – just like texting someone.

The crypto irony: Trump's new laws for stablecoins will only reinforce U.S. dollar dominance

Crypto industry pushing Canada to follow U.S. lead in embracing stablecoins

The operational fees are expected to be much lower than those of traditional bank transfers. These reduced costs would finally enable micropayments on a large scale, so, for example, you could pay a few cents for just one news article instead of buying a subscription.

For buying products or sending money to other countries, stablecoins reduce expenses and time by cutting out costly middlemen and their processing times. Stablecoins facilitate near-instant cross-border transfers with fees, often below 1 per cent. All one needs is a digital wallet app and sound regulations to protect them. 

For businesses and financial institutions, stablecoins represent a major upgrade to the traditional, slow and expensive plumbing of the global financial system. Instead of waiting days for large international payments to clear through traditional banking networks, companies can move millions of dollars nearly instantly, 24/7.

Stablecoin issuers will likely increase competition, meaning funds will no longer be “stuck in traffic,” allowing smarter, efficient, cheaper and more immediate money management. Beyond these, stablecoins are also “programmable money,” meaning they can be used to automate tasks like payroll or more complex payment workflows, leading to innovative financial products and services.

For Canada's economy to become stronger and more independent, it's time to rethink how regulation is done. Currently, the Canadian Securities Administrators classifies stablecoins as securities, similar to stocks or bonds, rather than a means of payment. This creates major roadblocks for digital payment innovations and for our economy to flourish.

First, it puts Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage since they can't easily accept stablecoin payments like their global counterparts. Second, it is a classic example of Canadian “innovation drain,” as promising Canadian fintech startups move elsewhere to grow. Third, this approach is out of sync with other jurisdictions that regulate stablecoins as a new form of payment. Fourth, this is a threat to our economic independence: the inaction pushes Canadians toward U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, an unnecessary capital drain.

This trend will likely accelerate because the Bank of Canada has no immediate plans to issue a public digital dollar. While a Bank of Canada-run digital currency comes with its own potential drawbacks, the policy vacuum leaves our market to foreign alternatives.

By treating stablecoins like investment products instead of a payment tool, Canada is essentially handing over the future of digital money to other countries. Canada's top financial regulatory agencies are aware of this, collaborating on a framework for stablecoins. 

For this effort to succeed, our regulators should start by legally defining stablecoins as a payment tool, bringing them under the watch of an updated Retail Payment Activities Act. Under this plan, only registered Canadian financial institutions could issue a stablecoin, and they would be required to back every digital coin with 100-per-cent cash-equivalent reserves.

To build public trust, these reserves must be regularly audited by reputable independent firms. Crucially, strong consumer protection rules would hold issuers legally and financially accountable for any funds lost to fraud, cyberthefts or operational failures.

Such a framework would provide the clarity needed to adopt new payment technologies responsibly. It would boost innovation and competition, allowing a privately-issued digital Canadian dollar to become the trusted choice for Canadians. Ultimately, this approach will secure Canada's monetary sovereignty in the digital age.

MetaMask USD, or mUSD, is being rolled out in conjunction with Stripe-owned stablecoin issuance platform Bridge, Stripe's stablecoin division, and M0, a decentralized stablecoin infrastructure and liquidity platform, according to a Thursday (Aug. 21) press release.

“Issuing a custom stablecoin used to take more than a year of complex integrations,” Bridge co-founder and CEO Zach Abrams said in the release. “With our issuance technology, we've reduced that timeline to a matter of weeks, which means platforms like MetaMask can realize benefits more rapidly and efficiently than ever before.”

MetaMask USD will be integrated into MetaMask's wallet, letting users hold, spend and transact stablecoins in Web3, with the M0 liquidity network allowing for composable cross-chain use, the release said.

“We want to empower the builders of great crypto products to truly control the digital dollar stack they utilize in order to deliver the best end-user experience,” M0 co-founder and CEO Luca Prosperi said in the release. “The current incarnation of stablecoin technology isn't fit for that purpose. Products such as MetaMask benefit from being able to customize the stablecoin technology, from having choice over their issuance options, and from optimizing for interoperability and liquidity.”

The launch puts MetaMask in the company of several other firms launching their own stablecoins as the digital currency grows more popular in the United States, especially in the wake of new legislation governing its use.

These digital tokens, pegged to national currencies like the U.S. dollar, have evolved rapidly since their early use in crypto trading. They now command a sizable global market and have become, in some regions, crucial to cross-border remittances and B2B payments. However, domestic retail adoption has been limited, especially when it comes to retail use cases.

“The crypto market cap is $3 trillion, and the stablecoin market cap is $250 billion, meaning it's less than 10%,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS earlier this summer. “If you want to build a payments network, you need to solve the divide so shoppers can walk in and pay with their assets, while merchants receive the payment as stablecoin.”

This week, PYMNTS examined the compliance question surrounding stablecoins, which are challenged to balance privacy, compliance and speed.

  The introduction of crypto technology and tokenisation is spurring changes in the financial system. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is taking steps to integrate crypto into traditional finance, most notably the GENIUS Act's establishment of a regulatory regime for payment stablecoins. This column explores the US' policy goals concerning digital assets and argues that tokenisation – rather than crypto-related technologies such as blockchains and distributed ledgers – is the truly transformative innovation in finance today.

Powered by a mix of crypto innovations (digital methods of recording transactions) and tokenisation (the unique, digital representation of an asset on a programable platform), technology is again driving a broad transformation of finance. To speed change, the Trump administration is seeking to promote the integration of crypto technologies into traditional finance. Its most prominent success so far, the GENIUS Act enacted in July, establishes a regulatory framework for “payment stablecoins” (US Congress 2025).

Outside of the crypto world, however, traditional intermediaries have not been standing still. They are actively innovating to cut costs and boost access. As a result, when it comes to the future of payments, tokenised bank deposits (and related innovations such as tokenized money market funds) seem likely to dominate stablecoins. In this column, we summarise our recent Policy Insight which explores the US' policy goals concerning digital assets and highlights the advantages of tokenised deposits over payment stablecoins (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2025).

The Trump administration aims for the US to be the “crypto capital of the world” (Huang 2025). This ambition extends far beyond merely promoting Bitcoin and its mining. The US Government wishes both to facilitate the entry of crypto entities into conventional banking and finance and to integrate crypto into the activities of traditional financial intermediaries.

The GENIUS Act is a cornerstone of this policy. It authorises banks (through subsidiaries) and qualified nonbanks to issue payment stablecoins and to serve as custodians. It also assigns oversight of payment stablecoins to banking regulators and mandates them to develop standards for interoperability with the broader financial system. By creating networks of stablecoins, deposits, and securities, interoperability would embed crypto deeper into the financial infrastructure.

Beyond the GENIUS Act, the President's Working Group on Digital Assets has called on regulators to clarify and expand permissible crypto activities for banks, refine supervisory expectations for safe conduct, and clarify how depository institutions can hold crypto assets on their balance sheets (White House 2025). A key principle underlying this approach is the concept of ‘technologically-neutral' regulation: ""the same business presenting the same risk should be governed by the same rules"", regardless of the underlying technology.

The burgeoning market capitalisation of crypto assets – currently around $4 trillion – both drives and is a result of these US policy changes. One prominent example is the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that are normalising crypto holdings for investors. Concentrated crypto wealth is also fuelling an extraordinary expansion of lobbying, which is promoting political support for crypto legislation and pro-crypto candidates (Goodman 2025). The expanding political access is creating notable conflicts of interest and the potential for regulatory capture (The Wall Street Journal 2025). In general, the deeper crypto becomes embedded in traditional finance, the more difficult it will be to reverse. For example, US policymakers could face irresistible pressure to bail out a systemic bank if a future crypto collapse threatened its survival.

Most payments have been digital for decades. People make purchases and trade stocks and bonds with their mobile phones. They can go months without using physical cash. Domestic settlement of transactions typically occurs within seconds or minutes. The process is highly reliable, but is reversible should the need arise. In most cases, costs that are not already low are falling (even in supposedly stubborn activities like cross-border remittances; World Bank 2024). Mechanisms are also in place to prevent illicit transactions (and to report suspicious ones).

The commercial banking system forms the backbone of this payments network with bank deposit balances serving as the primary form of ‘money""'that is convertible at par into central bank reserves. For the most part, confidence in finality of payment exists because settlement occurs on a central bank's balance sheet.

Despite these strengths, there are areas for improvement. Domestic retail transactions can be costly, and interbank transfers can still take several days. Furthermore, some US households continue to lack access to traditional banks, relying instead on costly alternatives.

The central question remains: will stablecoins offer the solution to these lingering obstacles, or are there more competitive alternatives for payments that are emerging outside the crypto world?

This question leads us to a direct comparison of payment stablecoins and tokenized deposits. Payment stablecoins, like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, are reserve-backed tokens pegged to a government-issued currency, primarily the US dollar. Stablecoins originated as a means of payment within the crypto ecosystem and currently serve as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto assets. While many crypto asset issuers are now advocates of regulation – presumably to gain legitimacy – their roots lie in the enthusiasts' vision of a decentralised system devoid of intermediaries or governments. Tokenised deposits, on the other hand, are digital representations of traditional bank deposits, such as JPMorganChase's JPMD. They are still in the experimental stage, with JPMD available to institutional clients only since June 2025.

Both stablecoins and tokenised deposits clear and settle around the clock (24/7/365). They also are subject to Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) provisions (know your customer (KYC)/anti-money laundering (AML)/anti-terrorist finance (ATF)).

 However, a comparison of stablecoins with tokenised deposits reveals the latter's numerous advantages.

In conclusion, we view tokenisation – rather than crypto-related technologies such as blockchains and distributed ledgers – as the truly transformative innovation in finance today. In the case of commercial bank deposits, their tokenised avatars add the compelling advantages of programmability and the potential for instant, safe, low-cost settlement even across borders. Despite their promotion by the US Government, stablecoins are unlikely to displace the most ubiquitous (and most traditional) payment instrument anytime soon.

Dublin, Aug.  22, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Cryptocurrency Payment Apps Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Cryptocurrency Type (Bitcoin, Ethereum), By Payment Type, By Type, By End User, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2033"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global cryptocurrency payment apps market size was estimated at USD 556.9 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 2.40 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 17.8% from 2025 to 2033. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology created the need for cryptocurrency payment apps to enable individuals to conduct seamless transactions.  The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies globally is the key driver for the market's expansion. People are encouraged to use cryptocurrency payment platforms owing to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, which eliminates mediators such as banks from the payment processing system. It reduces the processing time and accelerates the transaction speed, consequently adding to the increasing popularity of such platforms. In addition, the growing prevalence of cryptocurrencies as an investment option among millennials is also fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency payment apps industry.One of the most transformative trends in the market is the increasing interoperability between crypto payment platforms and traditional banking systems. Crypto apps now allow users to seamlessly convert digital assets into fiat currencies and vice versa, enabling easier withdrawals, direct-to-bank transfers, and debit card functionalities. This fusion is bridging the gap between old and new financial infrastructures, encouraging a smoother transition for users hesitant to move entirely into decentralized finance (DeFi). Thus, increasing integration of cryptocurrency payment apps with traditional financial systems can be attributed to the market's growth.The proliferation of mobile payment adoption and advancements in cybersecurity are further propelling the market. Cryptocurrency payment apps are leveraging biometric authentication, multi-signature wallets, and hardware-based security modules to enhance transaction safety. Coupled with the increasing global smartphone penetration, especially in emerging economies, these innovations are making digital asset payments more accessible and secure for a broader audience. In addition, the continual developments and innovations to enhance the consumer's experience in the blockchain space are expected to create a positive outlook for the market.The expansion of the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem is playing a pivotal role in advancing cryptocurrency payment apps. However, a lack of awareness about the benefits offered by cryptocurrency payment apps is expected to restrain the growth of the market over the forecast period. In addition, the lack of trust among the users, as no centralized regulator is authenticating this transaction, is one of the major obstacles to the market's growth. However, the significant efforts taken by some of the market players are anticipated to establish market growth.Global Cryptocurrency Payment Apps Market Report SegmentationThis report forecasts revenue growth at global, regional, and country levels and provides an analysis of the latest industry trends in each of the sub-segments from 2021 to 2033.

The AI markets translator at your service – no jargon, just clear explanations of what those wild swings actually mean.

- 2025 crypto market faces dual challenges: evolving U.S. regulations (SEC/CFTC) and AI-powered fraud surging 200% per Chainalysis.

- SEC's Project Crypto and CFTC's ""crypto sprint"" aim to integrate digital assets into mainstream markets via clearer rules and spot trading.

- AI-driven risks include deepfake scams, synthetic identities, and algorithmic market manipulation, demanding enhanced cybersecurity and hedging strategies.

- Investors must balance regulatory compliance (e.g., SEC-approved ETPs) with tech vigilance (MFA, AI monitoring) to mitigate fraud and volatility.

 

The cryptocurrency sector in 2025 is at a crossroads, where evolving regulatory frameworks and AI-driven fraud are redefining the risk profiles for both retail investors and institutional asset managers. While U.S. regulators like the SEC and CFTC are pivoting toward innovation-friendly policies, the rise of sophisticated cyber threats—powered by artificial intelligence—has created a volatile environment. This duality demands a recalibration of investment strategies to balance regulatory compliance with technological vigilance.  

The past year has seen a marked shift in regulatory priorities. The SEC's Project Crypto initiative, launched in July 2025, aims to modernize securities laws to foster innovation, signaling a departure from the aggressive enforcement stance of previous years. For example, the SEC's August 2025 clarification on liquid staking activities—declaring them non-implicated under securities laws—has provided much-needed clarity for market participants. Similarly, the CFTC's “crypto sprint” to enable spot crypto trading on federal exchanges underscores a collaborative effort to integrate digital assets into mainstream markets.  

However, these developments come with caveats. The dismissal of the SEC's case against Coinbase in February 2025, while reducing immediate legal risks for crypto platforms, has raised questions about the consistency of enforcement. Retail investors, in particular, must now navigate a landscape where regulatory guidance is evolving rapidly, yet enforcement remains inconsistent. For asset managers, the challenge lies in aligning portfolios with these shifting rules while avoiding exposure to unregistered or ambiguous products.  

 

While regulatory clarity is emerging, technological risks are escalating. Chainalysis' 2025 Crypto Crime Report reveals a 200% surge in AI-powered fraud, with personal wallet compromises accounting for 23.35% of stolen funds. Attackers are leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft hyper-personalized phishing schemes, deepfake voice scams, and synthetic identities to infiltrate crypto platforms. For instance, deepfake-aided wire fraud targeting businesses has surged, with AI-generated voices mimicking executives to authorize fraudulent transfers.  

Retail investors are especially vulnerable. Many lack the technical expertise to detect AI-generated social engineering tactics, such as fake customer service calls or AI-driven chatbots impersonating support agents. Meanwhile, asset managers face risks from algorithmic market manipulation, including wash trading and pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by AI tools. The report also notes that cybercriminals are using AI to optimize laundering strategies, such as timing sales of stolen assets to avoid detection.  

The interplay of regulatory and technological risks demands a proactive approach to portfolio management. Here are key strategies for investors:  

Avoid unregistered tokens or platforms operating in regulatory gray areas, such as meme coins or decentralized exchanges lacking compliance frameworks.  

Enhance Cybersecurity Protocols 

Asset managers should integrate AI-based monitoring systems to detect anomalies in trading patterns or wallet activity, mitigating risks from both external fraud and internal mismanagement.  

Leverage Regulatory Tailwinds 

Stay informed about the SEC's Project Crypto updates, which could unlock new investment vehicles, such as tokenized real estate or securitized crypto assets.  

Mitigate AI-Driven Market Volatility 

The crypto sector's evolution in 2025 is defined by a delicate balance between regulatory progress and technological peril. While initiatives like Project Crypto and the CFTC's “crypto sprint” aim to create a more structured market, the rise of AI-driven fraud underscores the need for heightened vigilance. For investors, the path forward lies in combining regulatory compliance with cutting-edge cybersecurity measures. By adopting a dual focus on policy alignment and technological resilience, both retail and institutional players can navigate this dynamic landscape with greater confidence.  

As the sector matures, the mantra for success will be adaptability: staying ahead of regulatory curves while outpacing the ever-evolving threats of the digital age.

Ether treasury firm SharpLink Gaming (SBET) has authorized a stock purchase program of up to $1.5 billion.

SharpLink, which is helmed by Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin, said it will make the repurchases at a time and in amounts that depend on market conditions and share price in an announcement on Friday.

""Should there exist periods where our stock trades at or below the net asset value of our ETH holdings, it would be dilutive on an ETH per share basis to issue new equity through our capital raising efforts,"" co-CEO Joseph Chalom said in the announcement.

""In this scenario, the accretive course of action may be to repurchase our common stock.""

The Minneapolis-based company holds 740,760 ETH, worth $3.19 billion at current prices. Numerous companies have unveiled ether treasury strategies in recent months to capture the upside from generating passive yield through ETH staking. 

SharpLink shares traded over 10% higher at $19.85 on Friday morning following the buyback program announcement and as bitcoin surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments opened the door to a September rate cut.

Perhaps surprising markets which had expected a hawkish tone, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell firmly put a September rate cut on the table on Friday.

Speaking at the Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting policy.

""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" said Powell. ""If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.""

Bitcoin has gained about 2% since the remarks hit the wires, rising to $114,200. U.S. stocks have added more than 1% and the 10-year Treasury yield is lower by six basis points to 4.27%. The dollar index has dipped about 0.5% and gold is higher by 0.6%.

In anticipation that Powell would remain hawkish, risk markets — crypto among them — had been under sizable pressure in the days leading up to his address.

Touching a record high above $124,000 about one week ago alongside September rate cut expectations that had risen to nearly 100%, bitcoin BTC$116,686.28 has slumped nearly 10% to $112,000 since as those monetary easing hopes quickly dwindled to just 69% in the hours ahead of Powell's speech. In the minutes following, those odds have re-risen to nearly 90%, per CME FedWatch.

The correction in the perhaps more speculative ether (ETH) was even deeper, with that crypto tumbling roughly 12% over the same time frame after coming within a few dollars of its all-time high. It's bounced nearly 8% since the Powell speech.

In traditional markets, the Nasdaq dipped 3% over the past few days as it too priced in lessening chances of a rate cut.

Bitcoin BTC$116,686.28 bounced off the $111,800 support level on Friday, sharply rising by 2.6% to $114,800 after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell hinted at potential rate cuts during a speech at Jackson Hole.

The swift move, preceded by a sell-off leading up to the speech, resulted in the liquidation of more than $375 million worth of crypto derivatives positions, according to CoinGlass. The majority of those losses are attributed to traders holding short positions.

Ether (ETH) positions were the hardest hit, with $150 million liquidated over the past four hours as the price rose from $4,200 to $4,650, marking a 10% gain.

Bitcoin's level of support was critical as it was a record high set in May. The bounce indicates a bullish reversal following a one-week downtrend from $124,500.

Despite fears that Powell's speech would have a hawkish tone, he said ""the downside risks to employment are rising,"" and ""If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.""

The comments suggest rate cuts could be on the table next month, which would directly benefit risk assets like bitcoin and ether.

The market remains volatile following the speech, with BTC pulling back slightly from $115,700 to $114,800. While liquidations have taken derivatives positions out of the market, open interest has risen to its highest point in four days, suggesting that the bounce is also being backed by leverage, according to Coinalyze.

The altcoin market is lagging behind ether with the exception of lido (LDO) and ethena ENA$0.7346, which are both continuing their upside ascent after the SEC clarified rules around staking earlier this month.

 Andrew Tate is back on the memecoin bandwagon but hasn't nailed the trading game as his wallet approaches losses of $700,000 on Hyperliquid. 

Former kickboxing champion and controversial influencer Andrew Tate is among the latest celebrities to dive into Kanye West's newly launched YZY token, but his bets are already deep in the red.

A wallet address linked to Tate opened a 3x leveraged short position on the recently launched, West-linked YZY token at $0.85 and was sitting on a $16,000 loss on the position.

Tate “doesn't seem to be good at perps trading,” as his cumulative losses are nearing $700,000 on this single Hyperliquid account, wrote blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain in a Friday X post. “So far, he's made 80 trades on #Hyperliquid — only 29 were profitable (win rate: 36.25%) — with total losses of $699K.”

The YZY token was launched on Solana on Thursday by the rapper, with the top 13 wallets profiting a total of $24.5 million as they dumped the token, which spiked 1,400% within the first hour before dropping over 74% since.

With growing celebrity interest in cryptocurrencies, more influencers are realizing losses, showing that not all financial advice or investment endorsements should be treated equally. 

The losing trade comes more than a year after Tate was hit by insider trading allegations related to his memecoin, the Daddy Tate (DADDY) token, which saw insiders scoop up 30% of the supply at launch before Tate started promoting the token on X, Cointelegraph reported at the time.

Tate joined waves of celebrities who jumped on the Solana memecoin bandwagon on June 7, 2024, endorsing more than 10 tokens known for having no intrinsic value.

Most of the tokens lost around 99% of their value shortly after Tate's endorsement, with multiple tokens allegedly having up to 30% insider supply allocation, Bubblemaps warned in an X post in October 2024.

These included Roost (ROOST), the Germany Token (GER), Fuck Tristan (FTRISTAN), TopG (TOPG), RNT (RNT) and Daddy Tate (DADDY).

Over 30 celebrity-endorsed tokens launched on Solana in June 2024 and have seen prices fall by no less than 73.23%.

Other celebrities who promoted Solana-based meme tokens include 50 Cent, Caitlyn Jenner, Iggy Azalea and soccer legend Ronaldinho Gaúcho.

UFC contender Khamzat Chimaev-linked Smash (SMASH) token was also hit by insider allegations after it was revealed that up to 78% of the token's supply was bought by team and developer-related wallets, Cointelegraph reported in July 2024.

Three days after the token launch, Chimaev's manager, Majdi Shammas, claimed that the martial artist “wasn't involved” with the SMASH memecoin and “[knows] just as little as you do,” alleging that he promoted the coin without the fighter's input.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","EU exploring Ethereum, Solana for digital euro launch: FT","https://cointelegraph.com/news/europe-mulls-ethereum-solana-digital-euro-launch","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 08:20:20 GMT","

 The EU is exploring Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro, marking a shift toward public blockchains over private models like China's CBDC, according to the FT. 

The European Union is reportedly exploring major public blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana in connection with its digital euro design.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering running a digital euro on a public blockchain like Ethereum rather than a private one, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Unlike a private blockchain, where data is limited to authorized entities, public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana are open to everyone.

If confirmed, the EU's exploration of public blockchains would represent a significant milestone in the digital euro's development, given that the ECB has not yet finalized the technology framework for the project.

The use of a public blockchain is “definitely something that [EU officials are] taking more seriously now,” one of the people involved in the digital euro discussions told the FT.

Another person said a digital euro in a private form would look “much more like what the Chinese central bank is doing than what private companies in the US are doing.”

The person specifically referred to China's central bank digital currency (CBDC), deployed privately, as opposed to public-run stablecoins developed by companies like Circle.

Europe has been increasingly concerned about the US stablecoin push promoted by the Trump administration and its implications for the autonomy of the European financial system.

In April, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone called for cutting stablecoin usage in Europe by introducing a digital euro, citing adoption risks of the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, which dominate the stablecoin market at 98%.

A spokesperson for the ECB did not explicitly confirm or deny that the bank has started exploring specific public networks such as Ethereum or Solana for a digital euro.

The representative referred to an official ECB page with frequent questions related to a digital euro, which states that the authority has yet to decide on what CBDC model would be deployed.

Should the EU eventually opt for a public digital euro design, there would be both positive and negative implications, according to Juan Ignacio Ibañez, general secretary of MiCA Crypto Alliance.

“On the positive side, there is potential for a public-blockchain-based digital euro to interoperate better with all the infrastructure being developed on blockchain these years,” Ibañez told Cointelegraph. On the negative side, this would introduce a “stronger state interest in influencing blockchain governance,” he said.

 Beijing's consideration of a yuan-backed stablecoin could mark a new front in the global financial system, but experts say dollar dominance, liquidity and trust are high hurdles. 

China appears to be weighing the launch of a yuan-backed stablecoin, with an initial rollout in Hong Kong and Shanghai, a surprising shift after years of cracking down on crypto while promoting its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan.

In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph spoke with two leaders analyzing China's potential move into stablecoins: Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Patrick Tan, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos. 

The news, first reported on Wednesday, highlighted Beijing's ambitions to strengthen the yuan's role in international finance. Still, experts say the path forward is anything but certain, especially with the track record of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. 

According to Chorzempa, the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay in everyday transactions has left little room for China's CBDC experiment. 

That leaves a yuan stablecoin with a different potential role. “I tend to think that probably the most interesting applications of a renminbi [yuan] stablecoin is going to be cross-border payments,” Chorzempa said.

Still, cross-border utility doesn't erase the credibility gap between the yuan and the US dollar. Chorzempa said:

“And if the answer is yes,” he said, “it's probably not going to be that attractive in comparison to something in USD, which is really freely usable.”

From a market perspective, the hurdles are just as steep. “Ninety-eight percent of all stablecoins and stablecoin transactions are dollar-based,” said Tan. 

For Tan, the real issue is systemic: “If China wants to make the digital yuan attractive, it needs to make the yuan attractive first. And to make the yuan attractive requires significant, large systemic political and economic changes and reforms, which, given the current climate in China, I think would be extremely challenging at best.”

Whether China's stablecoin push succeeds or stalls, it signals one thing clearly: Stablecoins are no longer just crypto plumbing; they've become tools in a larger geopolitical contest over the future of money.

The Mystery of America's Peanut Allergy Surge—And the Promising Science behind New Treatments

Peanut allergies more than tripled in U.S. kids between the late 1990s and late 2000s, and the prevalence has risen even more since then. Scientists are still searching for answers—and new ways to treat them.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

An estimated one out of every 10 people in the U.S. has some kind of food allergy, which adds up to more than 33 million Americans. Peanut allergies are among the most common and certainly take the lead as the most visible.

But peanut allergies weren't always so prevalent. In the late 1990s a nationwide survey found that peanut allergies were reported in 0.4 percent of American children. Just over a decade later that number had more than tripled.

Scientists still aren't completely sure what led to this big uptick, but it could stem in part from parental anxiety over peanut allergies—and misguided advice about how to keep kids safe.

Here to tell us more about the latest research on peanut allergies, including new avenues for treatment and prevention, is Maryn McKenna, the author of a recent article on the subject for Scientific American. Maryn is a journalist who covers food policy and public health.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Maryn McKenna: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So what do we know about the origins of peanut allergies?

McKenna: This is a really interesting mystery still. No matter how much study and how much research funding has gone into the problem of peanut allergy—and food allergies more broadly—a lot of it still remains kind of opaque.

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: We know the biological mechanisms of what makes an allergy happen, but why peanut allergy in particular came on the scene 20, 30 years ago or so and why it blew up to such a major public health problem—people are still working that out.

Feltman: So I guess let's start with the easier question, then, which is: What is a food allergy? How does it work, both genetically and in the moment in a person's body?

McKenna: I think most people are familiar with the concept of our having an immune system that, through a variety of mechanisms, defends our bodies against the outside world, broadly speaking—against things that are not us. Most of the time the immune system works really well to adapt its reactions, its defenses of us, to the way we continue to live our lives.

Sometimes its reactions get wildly out of scale, and that's what happens in food allergy and peanut allergy. The immune system recognizes proteins in these foods as being sort of not self, not part of us, and mounts an extraordinary reaction that expresses itself in the kind of symptoms that, if you're allergic, you've experienced or that you may be familiar with from hearing about them from other people: hives, itchiness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing; in the worst presentations depressed blood pressure, inability to breathe and sometimes, in, in the worst case, a heart attack.

Feltman: And what are the actual rates of nut allergy? It's definitely one of the ones we hear about a lot, but how prevalent is it?

McKenna: This can be a frustrating question to try to answer because what we know about people being allergic depends on their telling researchers that they're allergic ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: So it's all self-reported. There are biological markers for allergy, but we don't apply tests for those biological markers to the entire population, so all of the data relies on people telling researchers who have asked that an allergy is present in themselves or in their kids, if they're parents answering for children.

All of that said the numbers are really big. It's estimated that one out of every 10 individuals just in the United States has some kind of food allergy ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: That's more than 33 million people. And one of the folks I spoke to for this story said: “If you think of the average size of a classroom in elementary school, for instance, that means in every classroom two to three kids are going to have food allergy ...”

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And peanut is one of the most common food allergies. It's actually probably not the most common, but it tends to be the one that we hear about the most: if we have kids in school and they're aware that in, in the lunchroom there's a peanut-free table, or if you get on an airplane and realize that you can't have peanuts on the airplane because there might be an allergic person on the plane with you that day. So peanut's very sort of front of mind ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: For a lot of people.

Feltman: Yeah, and why is that? Why do you think it's the one that we hear about the most? Is that to do with the, like, typical degree of the allergy?

McKenna: The funny thing is that, according to the best data, the number-one food allergy, the most commonly experienced food allergy in the United States, is actually against shellfish ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And it affects, in the most recent data, more than eight million people, whereas peanut and milk allergies, which are two and three, affect a little bit more than six million. But most people don't stroll around their lives eating shrimp, right?

Feltman: [Laughs] Sure.

McKenna: This is not a thing that, for most of us, that we munch walking down the street or eat in a protein bar. But peanuts are incredibly portable, they're a favorite food for kids—peanut butter is pretty much ubiquitous, and so peanuts are just present in our lives a lot.

But why peanuts cause such reactions is one of those enduring unanswered questions. There are a lot of hypotheses advanced for why that is, ranging from the way that allergy happens in general; that there are things in the environment that are more present than they used to be or that the environments that we grow up in are cleaner and so we tend to overreact to them; to the ubiquity of ultraprocessing in food, which might be distributing these proteins more broadly so that kids are exposed to them when they aren't aware that they're exposed to them; or it could just be that we like peanuts [laughs].

Feltman: [Laughs]

McKenna: But as a result, for all of those reasons and probably others as well, peanut allergy is very present in the lives of families, and it can be very serious.

Feltman: And speaking of the top food allergies in general, what are the “big eight”?

McKenna: So the “big eight,” that's an actual legal term, and it indicates the allergens, the proteins, that are present in food that, when it's a processed food, have to be declared ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: On the label. Up to 90 percent of food allergies are caused by these eight things; that's why they were made the subject of legislation back in 2004. So peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts—so things like almonds, for instance—wheat and soybeans, and there's actually a ninth, a sort of footnote to the “big eight” that was added just a few years ago, which is sesame.

So those nine allergens are responsible for an enormous amount of food allergy in the United States, and sometimes they're linked allergies, like someone who has an allergy to peanut might also be allergic to egg or to milk, but as a category they cause a great deal of distress.

Feltman: And I know you touched on this a bit a minute ago, but how much do scientists know about how we got to the point we are now with food allergies? Why are they so prevalent?

McKenna: The question of why food allergies, and peanut allergy within that, is so common and seems to be getting more common, at the base—like, why this starts—is still really an unanswered question. But that it's increasing, no one disputes that.

You can go by some sort of qualitative measures, like if you are an adult who's been flying on airplanes for 30 years, 30 years ago you might have been able to have a peanut snack inside an airplane, and you would not have heard a member of the cabin crew saying, “If you brought peanut snacks on board, please do not eat them because there's an allergic person sitting somewhere near you.”

A set, a sort of nested set, of surveys of the population done over a couple of decades made it really clear how food allergies are increasing. The first was done in 1997; these were all done by researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. And 11 years from the first study—1.4 percent of kids in the U.S. were allergic to peanut. So that's a threefold increase across just 11 years, starting in the late 1990s. That's really remarkable.

Feltman: Yeah. So your piece really focuses on treatments. You know, even with all the remaining uncertainty around peanut allergies, what did you find out about where science is making the most progress and how they're doing that?

McKenna: Reporting this story was really a journey because I went into it being interested in one particular therapy that had been advanced just a [few] years ago. It was the first [Food and Drug Administration]-approved therapy ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: For peanut allergy, not a cure—a method of desensitization. This method of desensitization is a drug called Palforzia, and what it actually is, is minutely powdered peanut protein ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: That's given to kids in very precisely measured doses by mouth over a period of time, and it's meant to desensitize them. I was interested in it because I felt that it hadn't done very well in the marketplace, and I wasn't sure if that was because of the dosing regime or because it happened to be introduced to the market at the start of COVID, but I wondered, “If this [allergy] was such a big problem, why hadn't this [medication] taken off?”

So I started to look at this, and it turns out that there was a bunch more science that I was not aware of. And this one particular FDA-approved therapy, Palforzia, was only a small part of the story.

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: So the bigger story is that there have been really remarkable advances in desensitizing people to the allergy ...

Feltman: Right.

McKenna: So that they can go from being in danger of anaphylactic shock to actually being safe to eat a small amount of peanut or peanut protein or peanut butter. And exactly how small that small amount is depends in part on how allergic they were to begin with.

Some people have been made relatively safe from accidental exposures ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: Like cross-contamination in food manufacturing. Some people who were less allergic to start with have actually been made safe enough to be able to eat peanuts or peanut butter if they want to.

Feltman: Wow.

McKenna: Now, some researchers in this field will say, “Well, you still aren't getting all that far. We are making people safe in their lives, but they still have to be careful about what they're eating; they can't go face first into a jar of peanut butter.” And therefore, I found as I was working on this story, there are other really interesting efforts going on to try to keep the allergy from developing and to effectively nullify the allergy once it has developed. And those are sort of like the far horizons of food-allergy science, [but] as it says in the story they are things that people are beginning to explore.

Feltman: Yeah, what's your sense of where things are going in the next few years?

McKenna: So right at this moment a clinical trial is starting that is really unusual, and it's extremely early days; they are getting to just a phase 1 at this point—only one patient has actually been reported out. But what it does is it uses a combination of drugs made by a company called Regeneron, to essentially reset or rewrite the body's understanding of what it's supposed to react to.

And there was research into the effect of one of these drugs; the name for it is Dupixent. And researchers gave this drug and then tested people with their allergy, with the food they were allergic to, which was peanuts, and discovered that though it seemed promising it didn't actually have a long-term effect.

And then they decided to try adding in a second drug, which has just been approved for a particular cancer, a cancer of the cells that make the antibodies that cause the body to overreact in an allergic situation. They believe they can use that combination to cause the body to forget that it's overreacted to a particular thing ...

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: To essentially set the allergy back to zero—again, very early. But if that trial, which will take a number of years, if that trial proceeds, that's a really promising avenue of inquiry.

The other thing that's really interesting and that's beginning to get traction is that there is a school of thought based on a set of studies that were done in England that asks: Well, maybe food allergy, especially peanut allergy, maybe it's kind of our fault because maybe we, as a society, are not introducing children ...

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: When their immune systems are developing to peanuts at a time when their immune systems could handle them and not overreact to them.

And where this came from was an accidental finding by a British pediatrician who was speaking to a group of pediatricians in Israel and asked them how many of them were treating food-allergic kids, expecting every hand to shoot up ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: And in fact, almost no one did. Very few people in the audience were actually treating allergic kids. And this was a fascinating difference between the U.K., where the scientist had come from, and Israel, where he was speaking at the time.

And through a set of very clever experiments they discovered that the difference was that there's a ubiquitous snack in Israel called Bamba. That was what ...

Feltman: Yeah, it's also ubiquitous in Germany [laughs] ...

McKenna: Oh, interesting.

Feltman: I love Bambas, yeah [laughs].

McKenna: So they, they—there's—here in the United States, in Trader Joe's, they make a Bamba equivalent; I saw it the other day.

So Bambas are kind of—for people who have not experienced them—Bambas are kind of like Cheetos. They're a puffy, extruded product, but instead of cheese on the outside they have peanut butter on the outside. And they're very light and wispy, and they collapse, and they're easy to chew; they're not as tough as a Cheeto.

And Israeli kids, it turned out, get them quite early in life, and so they were getting an exposure to peanuts at a time when the British kids were being held strictly away from peanuts ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: Because that was the dominant advice at the time—this is just a few years ago—for any child in a family with a history of allergy was: keep them away from allergenic foods.

And so this pediatrician who led the study, Dr. Gideon Lack, proposed that if we sort of abandoned our current guidelines, if we started to introduce kids to peanuts very early—which takes some doing because they have to be introduced to solids in time to be able to swallow peanut butter or peanut powder safely—then it seemed likely that they would be at less risk of developing allergy.

And, and his research proved that was correct. And now the public health establishment and pediatrics and pediatric nutrition are struggling with this conundrum of the excellent advice that seemed to keep kids safe for so long may actually have set some kids up for allergy instead ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And how do we implement the new findings now that they exist?

Feltman: Yeah, that's really interesting. My last question is just that, you know, you were really careful with the word “cure” in your story for Scientific American, but do the [researchers] that you talk to seem to think that that's a possibility in the future?

McKenna: Everyone is extremely careful around the word “cure” in this situation, and I respect that. They're careful about it for a couple of reasons.

First, even the most optimistic researchers to whom I spoke are clear in saying that when they do these various new modalities of desensitization, that's all they're doing; they are not curing the allergy, but they are making it safer for people to live everyday lives.

And the second is: these other avenues in which the allergy might actually be remodeled, those are such early days that whether it's actually going to work in broad populations, either the very early feeding or this drug administration, it's way too early to make confident statements about them.

But I think, also, the reason that they're so careful about this word “cure” is because there are so many families out there—you know, families of millions of kids in the U.S. have had their lives disrupted by food allergy, especially peanut allergy. It really profoundly changes the life not just of a child, but the life of a family.

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And therefore, families are very eager for something dramatic to happen, and no one wants to overpromise. Even though they believe they see real hope coming over the horizon it's too early for them to say with confidence that it will really change the game.

Feltman: Thank you so much for coming on to talk us through this story. I'm sure our listeners will enjoy checking it out in the magazine.

McKenna: I hope they read it. Thank you so much for having me.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Monday.

If This Asteroid Hits the Moon, Watch for Shooting Stars and Stricken Satellites

The 60-meter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4 percent chance of hitting the moon. Could such a lunar collision create a dangerous new meteor shower?

For a brief few weeks in early 2025, astronomers were worried about the asteroid 2024 YR4.

Discovered in late 2024 by an automated telescope in Chile as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) sky survey, it's a not only a near-Earth asteroid but one that astronomers feared could get too close for comfort to our fair planet and pose a potential impact risk. At 60 or so meters in diameter, 2024 YR4 wouldn't cause global damage if it fell to Earth, but it would explode upon impact with the energy of an eight-megaton bomb, so local damage would be considerable. Thus, astronomers were right: it was something to worry about.

Initial observations indicated the asteroid might hit Earth on December 22, 2032. Calculating the trajectory of an asteroid is tricky, and the further ahead the prediction goes, the fuzzier the numbers get. By mid-February 2025, astronomers had refined that Earth-impact probability to around 3 percent, which wasn't high but was still somewhat concerning.

Happily, follow-up observations tightened the uncertainties in the projected orbit, effectively ruling out a late-2032 impact.

They ruled out an Earth impact, that is. Amazingly, a chance remains that 2024 YR4 will hit the moon!

As it stands now, the chance of a lunar impact on December 22, 2032, is actually higher than the mid-February probability of the asteroid hitting Earth on that date: about 4 percent. That's still small but not zero.

If 2024 YR4 does whack into our lone natural satellite, what will happen? Is Earth (or, more to the point, those of us who live on it) in any danger? In a preprint paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers investigated the potential fallout. The answer they got is reassuring—mostly.

Given the uncertainties in the asteroid's exact trajectory, the scientists found that—if the asteroid were to hit at all—its chance of striking the moon's near side would be around 86 percent, meaning we'd likely get a good view of the fireworks. If so, Earth-based observers could see a brief flash as 2024 YR4's immense kinetic energy—its energy of motion—would convert into light and heat, though it's difficult to predict just how bright this would be.

In January 2019, however, a meteoroid impacted the moon during a lunar eclipse, so we can use that as a comparison.

That flash was bright enough to be seen by eye, reaching about magnitude 4.2, and came from an object estimated to be less than half a meter across. The asteroid 2024 YR4 is more than 100 times wider, so its volume is well more than a million times larger, which means the energy of its impact would be that much more powerful. If the amount of light released were to scale in a similar way, the flash could be brighter than the full moon! But it would be concentrated in a single point on the surface, so it would be exceedingly bright as seen from Earth.

The astronomers calculated that 2024 YR4's impact would carve out a crater approximately one kilometer in diameter—small for a lunar crater but big enough that the material excavated and ejected would total about 100 million metric tons. That's a considerable amount, but even the moon's low gravity would pull most of the material back down to the surface; 99.8 percent or more of the debris wouldn't have enough speed to escape. Given the uncertainties in the researchers' calculation, however, this still means that some 10,000 to 100,000 metric tons of lunar rock would be ejected, and a lot of it could be headed our way. How much?

That would depend on many factors, including the location of the asteroid's impact on the moon. It's possible that all the ejected debris could be flung into deep space, missing Earth entirely. But for other scenarios, it's possible that approximately 10 percent of the material could be thrown into an Earth-impacting trajectory. In the latter case, that material would hit us within three to five days of the lunar impact, so around December 25 to 27, 2032. Happy holidays!

But this potential blow could be softened considerably if most of the ejecta were small particles rather than bigger chunks. How big would these lunar particles be? The paper's authors caution that their calculations are rough and only yield an order-of-magnitude estimation, meaning it could be too high or low by a factor of 10. Still, their results are illuminating.

According to the astronomers' back-of-the-envelope reckoning, it's likely that the ejecta would be small. The researchers predict that many trillions to quadrillions of pieces of the ejected debris would be larger than a tenth of a millimeter. Of those, something like 100 billion to 10 trillion particles would be larger than a millimeter in size (roughly that of a grain of sand), and 100,000 to a billion would be bigger than a centimeter.

Happily, at these size ranges, they would all burn up safely in our atmosphere, dozens of kilometers above the surface. At the high end, and averaged out across the globe, these numbers mean that a sugar-cube-size moon rock would burn up over every square kilometer of the planet! Something that size would make for a pretty bright meteor, and thousands of them might be visible from a given location over the course of several days.

The smaller sand-grain pieces would streak through Earth's atmosphere in much larger numbers—10 to 1,000 times the usual background level of meteors that we see—which means an observer might witness as many as one per second. They would fall to Earth far slower than normal meteors coming in from interplanetary space, however, so they wouldn't be nearly as bright. And the smallest particles wouldn't be visible at all. In total, somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000 metric tons of debris could burn up in Earth's skies from the lunar impact. For comparison, our planet typically sops up about 50 to 100 metric tons of space debris each day.

The bottom line, though, is that we'll be safe because our air protects us.

But what about our assets in orbit, essentially above our protective atmosphere? What are the chances that a satellite will be hit?

There are more than 12,000 working satellites in orbit right now. By 2032, that number will increase ferociously because SpaceX and other companies plan to launch tens of thousands of additional satellites into orbit. Looking at the standard sizes of satellites and the number of meteoroids raining down, the paper's co-authors estimate that if 2024 YR4 were to make lunar impact, hundreds to thousands of sand-grain-size impact fragments could strike satellites within a few days. That number is big enough to do damage but not necessarily to destroy satellites. The probability that any satellite would get hit by the bigger, centimeter-size pieces is only about 10 percent (taken, of course, with a sand-size grain of salt due because of the various uncertainties).

At the moment, we don't know the trajectory of 2024 YR4 well enough to make better predictions. During its next close approach to our planet in 2028, more observations will likely nail down the impact probability even better.

So if the asteroid does strike the moon—and that's still a big if—we'll get quite the light show, but our satellites could be at risk. This shows us that while we rightly are concerned about mitigating Earth impacts from larger asteroids, even smaller ones hitting the moon are a cause for concern and may be worth trying to prevent as well. The good news is that such 2024 YR4–size lunar impacts are extremely rare, and the chance of one in 2032 is still slim. It would make for a spectacular event, but we'd be far better off if the asteroid missed.

Pastel Pink Lobsters, Goofy-Looking Squid Among Deep-Sea Oddities Discovered in Ocean Abyss

Researchers spied a wild array of life, including dozens of suspected new species, in an underwater gorge

Two miles below the ocean's surface, off the coast of Argentina, an underwater gorge plunges nearly twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. The trench and the nearby ocean floor are crawling with creatures that seem like they belong in an alien carnival, including a see-through squid with a hornlike appendage, pale pink lobsters, a lumbering king crab carrying 100 hitchhiking barnacles and a ghostly squid that hovers somewhere between goofy and grotesque.

In July and August scientists onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel Falkor (too) spotted the oddities through the eyes of an underwater robot as they explored the Mar del Plata Canyon. Over the course of three weeks, the team recorded many strange and startling sights, including more than 40 species that may be new to science.

“The deep sea is a place full of life, not only in terms of abundance but also in the variety of species,” says the expedition's chief scientist Daniel Lauretta of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences. One of his favorite areas was a large stretch of seafloor he nicknamed the “Beet Field” because it was covered in spidery red octocorals. A fan favorite for the millions who livestreamed the dives was a cheeky seastar that looked like the SpongeBob SquarePants character Patrick Star.

The researchers had visited the Mar del Plata Canyon in 2012 and 2013 but were then only equipped with trawls and fishing nets. They found hints of unique ecosystems and identified new species at that time. In revisiting the area with state-of-the-art technology, however, the scientists can develop a far more complete understanding of the region.

The area, situated about 190 miles off Argentina's northeastern coast, is shaped by two converging currents: one is salty and flowing down from the tropics, and the other is cold, full of nutrients and swelling up from Antarctica. Deep-sea canyons such as Mar del Plata act like funnels, channeling and concentrating the waters. “This confluence creates one of the most energetic oceanic regions in the world, fueling high productivity and supporting remarkable biodiversity,” says Jonathan Flores, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. Flores was not part of the expedition but reviewed livestreamed footage of it as an independent expert.

Some creatures found there might not exist anywhere else in the world. “Deep-sea canyons are biodiversity hotspots and play key roles in ecosystem functioning, yet we still know very little about them,” Flores says. “Continued exploration is essential to document species before they are lost—to understand how these ecosystems respond to environmental change and to inform conservation and management decisions.”

The expedition set out to establish a baseline of what life inhabits Mar del Plata. When the underwater robot dove deep, the science team saw red. A mother octopus clutched her eggs in a protective embrace as she sheltered behind pink and orange corals, blush-toned lobsters ambled around in a tight pack, spiky scarlet crabs scuttled around, and a crimson comb jelly glittered with bioluminescence. Peachy corals of a potentially new species clung to the canyon wall.

Scientists scooped up several of the organisms to study back in laboratories on land to verify whether they're new species.

“One way to confirm is by bar coding—sequencing a piece of mitochondrial DNA,” says Mike Vecchione, a research zoologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who was not involved in the expedition. Vecchione has cataloged many new species over the course of several decades. “But for some deep-sea organisms, this can take years,” he says. “Some species are so poorly known that their mitochondrial DNA has not been sequenced, although the species have been described.”

Such painstaking work is par for the course in deep-sea biology, where entire ecosystems remain unexplored. “Discovering multiple candidate new species in such a short exploration window is not unusual in deep-sea research,” Flores says, “precisely because these ecosystems remain so poorly sampled.”

Cash Rewards Have Less Sway in Collectivistic Cultures

Money talks louder in some languages than others

By Thomas Talhelm edited by Daisy Yuhas

If you're trying to get someone to do something, what's the best way to achieve that? Paying them probably comes to mind, and this intuition is a basic tenet of economic theory. In a massive 2018 study, researchers tested 18 ways to motivate people to do a simple task—and found that money worked best.

In that work, economists at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago asked nearly 10,000 people on a crowd-work website to push the “A” and “B” buttons on their keyboard as many times as they could for 10 minutes. To motivate people, the researchers used different strategies with different participants. They gave some people more money if they pushed the buttons more times. They gave other people nudges—essentially, messages or framings that serve as small psychological pushes. For instance, to instill a social norm about working hard, the economists told some participants that many other people pressed the buttons more than 2,000 times. As another example, some people saw how their score compared with that of others, which prompted social comparison and competition.

The result was a blowout. Paying people beat out nudging them in every case. Even just a little bit of money, such as an extra penny for 1,000 button pushes, motivated workers more than every psychological nudge.

But as a cultural psychologist, I couldn't help but wonder whether that was the end of the story. The majority of the study's participants were located in the U.S., but 12 percent were in India. I wondered whether money was an equally dominant motivator in both places. That question led my colleagues and me on a multistep journey across cultures and, ultimately, to new data that suggest cash may be more persuasive in the West than in more collectivistic cultures outside the West.

Thanks to the researchers of the 2018 study, who shared their data with me, I was able to take a closer look at their findings. I found that the behavior of participants from India looked very different from that of people in the U.S. In one of the scenarios tested, the researchers had some people work to earn money for themselves and other people earn money for charity. In the pay condition, workers received 10 cents for every 1,000 times they pushed the buttons. In the charity condition, those 10 cents went to the Red Cross. According to classical economics, people should work hard for their own pocketbook but slack off when that money is going to charity. And that described American participants quite well. Button pushes in the U.S. dropped 14 percent when money went to charity versus to participants. But in India, it made almost no difference—there was a decrease of less than 1 percent.

The plot thickened when I looked at the nudges. Giving people a social norm (by telling them how many times other participants pressed their buttons) influenced them, just like psychology says it should. But doing so had more power in India. Providing a social norm boosted button presses by 19 percent in the U.S. and 26 percent in India. Across 11 different conditions, money outperformed psychology by about 20 percent in the U.S. but only by 10 percent in India.

Why would money influence people in the U.S. more than in India? One possibility is that more Americans have studied economics, which teaches people to behave more like economists say they should. There is in fact some evidence that people in econ classes behave more “rationally”—that is, selfishly—in games where researchers ask people to make choices about earning real money versus being nice to other people. Another explanation is that the U.S. is an especially capitalistic culture, which, some people argue, makes people hyperfocused on money and competition. The movie Jerry Maguire embodied that image of American culture when its eponymous character, played by Tom Cruise, shouted into the phone, “Show me the money!”

But my research team thought these cultural differences were broader than a story about American cultural uniqueness. We thought a deeper explanation might reflect what psychologists call “relational mobility.” In cultures with lots of relational mobility, social ties are free and flexible, with lots of choice and opportunities to meet new people. In cultures with less relational mobility, relationships are binding and fixed, with an emphasis on stability and commitment rather than freedom and choice. People in individualistic Western cultures, such as those of the U.S., France and Australia, tend to describe their relationships as free and flexible. One byproduct of this dynamic is that, in the West, work often revolves around clear expectations and explicit exchange. If you work one hour, you get one hour's wage. Growing up in the U.S., I learned this lesson at home when my parents paid me an allowance for washing the dishes a specific number of times each week.

Research suggests that explicit exchange and contracts are probably less important in “low-mobility,” collectivistic cultures. Sure, India, China and Mexico—all more collectivist than countries such as the U.S. and U.K.—have plenty of contracts and wage labor. But people there tend to feel more enmeshed in their relationships than Americans or Brits do. And those relationships—even at work—bind people together in fuzzy ways that aren't outlined perfectly in contracts. That could explain why, when I looked through data from the study, I found that participants in India worked harder in response to a social norm, to social comparison (“We will show you how well you did relative to other participants”) and even to a simple request to “please try as hard as you can.”

We reasoned that, if our hypothesis was correct and this difference reflected a broader cultural difference, we should be able to find differences in other cultures beyond the U.S. and India. So my research team tested a new task on people in Western, individualistic cultures in the U.S. and U.K., as well as in more collectivistic ones in India, Mexico, China and South Africa. Again, money spoke louder in the West, as we reported in Nature Human Behaviour. For example, money outperformed psychological nudges by more than 100 percent in the U.K. but only by about 20 percent in China.

This difference is especially surprising because the same dollar buys more in India and Mexico than in the U.S. or U.K. And because incomes are lower in South Africa and China, basic economic logic predicts that they should work harder for that same dollar. But that wasn't the case.

One thing we worried about was whether the differences came down to trust. Did our participants in the West simply trust the scientists and payment system more than people in other nations? Our data suggested that trust was not the explanation. For example, we asked our participants whether working hard on the task could help build a relationship with us and lead to more earnings in the future. Our participants in more collectivistic countries were more likely to agree. That investment of time and effort only makes sense if they have some trust in us and the platform.

One problem with comparing people in different nations is that it involves comparing different environments as well as psychologies. After all, the U.S. and South Africa have structural differences. For example, the two countries have different gross domestic products and average Internet speeds. And we found more participants in South Africa than in the U.S. completed the task on their phones. If we compare countries, it's hard to know whether the differences are caused by what's in people's heads versus what's in their environments.

To isolate the psychological differences, we randomly assigned more than 2,000 people in India to complete our study in English or Hindi. India does not have a single national language, but Hindi and English are both official languages. We recruited our participants through Ashoka University, which is in Haryana, a primarily Hindi-speaking part of the country. Much of India's university system teaches in English, so people wouldn't bat an eye if our study instructions popped up in either language. We also selected participants who reported very good or fluent language skills in both languages. When the instructions were in Hindi, we expected this would cause a subtle frame shift that would emphasize Indian culture and embedded relationships. And conversely, we guessed that English might prompt thinking in terms of how relationships are structured in Western culture.

Sure enough, language changed the power of money. The sway of monetary payments over nudges was about twice as large in English as it was in Hindi. So even in the same economy, money spoke louder in English.

Our findings raise many interesting questions about rationality and ethics. First, despite the tendency in classical economics to talk about “rational actors” and how people should behave, what's rational depends on the social environment. If explicit contracts are more important in one culture, it makes more sense to read the contract carefully and ignore the polite request to “try hard.” But in cultures where relationships matter more, it makes more sense to pay attention to social cues.

On the flip side, our findings probably give ammunition to critics of the U.S.'s obsession with money. But as with biases more broadly, identifying patterns in behavior that are shaped by culture is empowering. It may make us more aware of our own tendencies, for example.

Understanding money's power also has implications for development aid and the growing “nudge” movement, which tries to find subtle ways to change people's behavior using psychology. Our study used trivial tasks, such as mashing buttons on a computer. But people often use money or nudges to motivate changes that are good for society, such as donating organs or saving electricity. Understanding culture can make us better at making our world a better place.

A recent study found that a nudge to change social norms about female entrepreneurship in Niger was enough to boost household income as much as giving people money—and it cost far less. Our findings suggest that psychological nudges may be most effective in the places they help people the most.

Why a Classic Psychology Theory about Vision Has Fallen Apart

The downfall of a long-standing theory in psychology raises a question: How much does the environment we're raised in change how we literally see the world?

By Nora Bradford edited by Allison Parshall & Sarah Lewin Frasier

During her training in anthropology, Dorsa Amir, now at Duke University, became fascinated with the Müller-Lyer illusion. The illusion is simple: one long horizontal line is flanked by arrowheads on either side. Whether the arrowheads are pointing inward or outward dramatically changes the perceived length of the line—people tend to see it as longer when the arrowheads point in and as shorter when they point out.

Most intriguingly, psychologists in the 1960s had apparently discovered something remarkable about the illusion: only European and American urbanites fell for the trick. The illusion worked less well, or didn't work at all, on groups surveyed across Africa and the Philippines.

The idea that this simple illusion supposedly only worked in some cultures but not others compelled Amir, who now studies how culture shapes the mind. “I always thought it was so cool, right, that this basic thing that you think is just so obvious is the type of thing that might vary across cultures,” Amir says.

But this foundational research—and the hypothesis that arose to explain it, called the “carpentered-world” hypothesis—is now widely disputed, including by Amir herself. This has left researchers like her questioning what we can truly know about how culture shapes how we see the world.

When researcher Marshall Segall and his colleagues conducted the cross-cultural experiment on the Müller-Lyer illusion in the 1960s, they came up with a hypothesis to explain the strange results: difference in building styles. The researchers theorized that the prevalence of carpentry features, such as rectangular spaces and right angles, trained the visual systems of people in more wealthy, industrialized cultures to perceive these angles in a way that make them more prone to the Müller-Lyer illusion.

The carpentered-world hypothesis took off. Psychologists tested other illusions involving straight lines and linear perspective across cultures and found similar results, suggesting that the culture or environment in which someone grows up could shape their brain's visual system and literally affect how they see the world. This is also known as the “cultural by-product hypothesis.”

It turns out that the story wasn't so simple. After connecting with Chaz Firestone, now a cognitive scientist at Johns Hopkins University, Amir learned that other studies of the Müller-Lyer illusion contradicted the anthropological explanations she had been given in grad school. The two researchers recently compiled a slew of evidence against this claim, publishing their argument in Psychological Review. For starters, the illusion still works when the lines are curved or even when there are no lines at all and dots take their place, suggesting the illusion's effect isn't reliant on hallmarks of carpentry. Even more convincing, kids who have been blind their whole life and undergo lens replacement surgery are susceptible to the illusion shortly after gaining sight. And even some animals, such as birds, fish, reptiles, insects and nonhuman mammals, seem to fall for the trick. It seems that our susceptibility to the Müller-Lyer illusion comes not from shared visual environments but from something more innate.

So what explains the results in the seminal carpentered-world studies? It's possible—or rather quite likely—that these were the results of “research practices now recognized to be problematic by modern methodological standards (including discarding inconvenient data points, and failing to conduct appropriate statistical tests),” Amir and Firestone wrote. Even then, the results were highly inconsistent across studies, the researchers found.

Many psychologists now think it's unlikely that culture or environment could affect brain processes as ancient and foundational as the basic features of vision, such as the detection of depth, contrast and lines. But culture might affect how we see the world at a higher level. Some results suggest that more complex cognitive capacities such as memory and attention are guided by our upbringing, which can impact what we report seeing in the world around us, Amir says.

In a recent study, Michael Frank, a developmental psychologist at Stanford University, and his team studied perceptual and cognitive differences between people in the U.S. and China. The results, published last year in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, were a mixed bag. The researchers found no strong cultural differences in the Ebbinghaus illusion, in which the perceived size of a circle is affected by the size of circles around it.

But they did find cultural differences in visual tasks that relied more on attention and interpretation. When Chinese participants were asked to describe an image they had just seen, they tended to describe the background more than the objects in the foreground, whereas U.S. participants did the opposite. For example, given an image of a red bike set against the background of a vibrant lawn, Chinese participants would focus on providing detail about the green grass, whereas U.S. participants would describe the red bike.

“The tasks that yielded differences in our study tended to tap into linguistic descriptions and slow, effortful reasoning processes,” Frank explains.

It's challenging for researchers to pinpoint what aspects of culture are driving these higher-level differences. Some cross-cultural psychologists point to Eastern collectivism and Western individualism to explain such results, but Frank remains agnostic. So does Sumita Chatterjee, a research consultant, who earned a Ph.D. studying the influence of culture on visual perception at the University of Glasgow.

Linking the behaviors of specific cultural groups to larger concepts always comes “with the risk of overgeneralization,” Chatterjee says. “Stringently ascribing a list of behaviors to specific categories like ‘East' and ‘West' can blind us to the true reasons behind the differences in behavior.”

Similarly, Amir says that when tying a perceptual difference to a specific aspect of culture, such as carpentry or collectivism, researchers should think hard about what they are truly measuring and avoid making too many assumptions, especially those that involve cultures outside their own.

For example, in one recent preprint paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed by other researchers, a team found differences in both visual attention and perception between members of the Himba tribe in rural Namibia and participants from urban parts of the U.K. and the U.S. When viewing a complex black-and-white image called the Coffer illusion, Himba participants focused on circular parts of the image while urban participants picked out the rectangular parts first. More research would be needed, however, to ascribe this difference causally to disparities between the shapes of each group's buildings.

“I do think the general call to arms to study cognition across cultures is really important,” Amir says. “Some things might vary, and some things might not, but careful studies can potentially reveal both.”

Some initiatives are attempting to do just that. Frank and his colleagues began the Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE) project to improve cross-cultural comparison of learning and cognition across development. He also participates in large team science initiatives, such as ManyBabies, that bring together research groups from around the world to share methods and data. “Critically, in all of these efforts, there is ‘local' representation, meaning that the research team includes individuals from the groups being studied,” Frank says. “These issues are super tricky, but I'm excited that we are moving forward as a field.”

The newly-discovered ecosystem surrounding a hydrothermal vent could give scientists clues as to how life began on Earth.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ocean covers about 70% of Earth's surface, yet less than 30% of the sea floor has been explored and mapped. So, it isn't surprising that scientists are frequently making new discoveries deep beneath the waves. This time, researchers discovered a vast hydrothermal system that they have since dubbed the Kunlun system. Published in the journal Science Advances, their recent study details just how extraordinary the newly-discovered deep sea network really is. 

The Kunlun hydrothermal field is a tectonically active site in the Pacific Ocean. It sits roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Mussau Trench on the Caroline Plate, located just north of New Guinea. A crewed submersible explored the area and discovered that the system consists of 20 circular craters in the sea floor, with some exceeding one kilometer (half a mile) in diameter. The entire field spans a whopping 4.3 square miles (11.1 square kilometers).

In the ocean, hydrothermal systems occur when seawater seeps down through cracks in oceanic crust and rapidly heats as it nears Earth's mantle. And while they are often associated with the briny depths of our oceans, hydrothermal vents aren't exclusive to the sea. In fact, one of the most well-known hydrothermal systems is the network of geysers at Yellowstone National Park. Each geyser is a small piece of (or a feature in) the larger system. 

So, why should we care about nature's jacuzzis jets? According to some scientists, they could be key to understanding how life began on Earth. Deep sea hydrothermal vents are surrounded by water that is rich in hydrogen—an element that serves as a building block for the organic molecules that make up life as we know it. But just because you have flour and water doesn't mean you'll end up with a loaf of bread. The conditions surrounding hydrothermal systems give scientists the perfect natural laboratory to research what that precise recipe for life was when it began millions of years ago. 

Not only is the Kunlun hydrothermal field exciting because it's newly-discovered, but it also isn't your average hydrothermal system—according to Sun Weidong, corresponding author on the study, the field has several abnormal characteristics. 

“The Kunlun system stands out for its exceptionally high hydrogen flux, scale, and unique geological setting,” he explained in a press release. 

Researchers say that the location of the field in particular is “challenging long-held assumptions,” as it shows that hydrogen generation—and extremely rich generation, at that—can occur far from mid-ocean ridges. 

The Kunlun system's discovery comes years after researchers found the “Lost City” system in the Atlantic Ocean. While the Lost City hydrothermal field is no lost city of Atlantis, it's still remarkable—in fact, it may be the longest-lived venting environment in history. But what the Lost City has in years, the Kunlun system has in size. The newly-discovered field is over 100 times larger than the Lost City and, according to the research team, the Kunlun system may get us even closer to confirming how and where life began.  

“Compared to the carbonate towers formed in the Lost City,” the paper reads, “these pipes/pits provide a more sustained and stable evolutionary time frame, offering a potentially more suitable environment for the evolution of early life.” 

Scientists spend a lot of time researching what life must have looked like around hydrothermal vents in their earliest days, but that doesn't mean the deep sea systems are devoid of residents now. In fact, the Kunlun system is crawling with enough creatures that it could be considered the next “lost city.” 

“What's particularly intriguing is its ecological potential,” Sun said in the press release. “We observed diverse deep-sea life thriving here—shrimp, squat lobsters, anemones, and tubeworms—species that may depend on hydrogen-fueled chemosynthesis.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover crystal that breathes oxygen like lungs","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821004248.htm","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 08:04:54 GMT","

A team of scientists from Korea and Japan has discovered a new type of crystal that can ""breathe"" -- releasing and absorbing oxygen repeatedly at relatively low temperatures. This unique ability could transform the way we develop clean energy technologies, including fuel cells, energy-saving windows, and smart thermal devices.

The newly developed material is a special kind of metal oxide made of strontium, iron, and cobalt. What makes it extraordinary is that it can release oxygen when heated in a simple gas environment and then take it back in, all without falling apart. This process can be repeated many times, making it ideal for real-world applications.

This remarkable study has been led by Professor Hyoungjeen Jeen from the Department of Physics, Pusan National University, Korea, and co-authored by Professor Hiromichi Ohta from the Research Institute for Electronic Science, Hokkaido University, Japan. Their findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications on August 15, 2025. ""It is like giving the crystal lungs and it can inhale and exhale oxygen on command,"" says Prof. Jeen. Controlling oxygen in materials is crucial for technologies like solid oxide fuel cells, which produce electricity from hydrogen with minimal emissions. It also plays a role in thermal transistors -- devices that can direct heat like electrical switches -- and in smart windows that adjust their heat flow depending on the weather.

Until now, most materials that could do this kind of oxygen control were too fragile or operated only at the harsh conditions like extremely high temperatures. This new material works under milder conditions and remains stable. ""This finding is striking in two ways: only cobalt ions are reduced, and the process leads to the formation of an entirely new but stable crystal structure,"" explains Prof. Jeen. They also showed that the material could return to its original form when oxygen was reintroduced, proving that the process is fully reversible. ""This is a major step towards the realization of smart materials that can adjust themselves in real time,"" says Prof. Ohta. ""The potential applications range from clean energy to electronics and even eco-friendly building materials.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient fossil discovery in Ethiopia rewrites human origins","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821094506.htm","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:43:01 GMT","

A team of international scientists has discovered new fossils at a field site in Africa that indicate Australopithecus, and the oldest specimens of Homo, coexisted at the same place in Africa at the same time -- between 2.6 and 2.8 million years ago. The paleoanthropologists discovered a new species of Australopithecus that has never been found anywhere.

The Ledi-Geraru Research Project is led by scientists at Arizona State University and the site has revealed the oldest member of the genus Homo and the earliest Oldowan stone tools on the planet.

The research team concluded that the Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus teeth are a new species, rather than belonging to Australopithecus afarensis (the famous 'Lucy'), confirming that there is still no evidence of Lucy's kind younger than 2.95 million years ago.

""This new research shows that the image many of us have in our minds of an ape to a Neanderthal to a modern human is not correct -- evolution doesn't work like that,"" said ASU paleoecologist Kaye Reed. ""Here we have two hominin species that are together. And human evolution is not linear, it's a bushy tree, there are life forms that go extinct.""

Reed is a Research Scientist at the Institute of Human Origins and President's Professor Emerita at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at ASU. She has been co-director of the Ledi-Geraru Research Project since 2002.

Ledi-Geraru

What fossils did they find to help them tell this story? Teeth, 13 of them to be exact.

This field site has been famous before. In 2013 a team led by Reed discovered the jaw of the earliest Homo specimen ever found at 2.8 million years old. This new paper details new teeth found at the site that belong to both the genus Homo and a new species of the genus Australopithecus.

""The new finds of Homo teeth from 2.6 - 2.8 million year old sediments -- reported in this paper -- confirms the antiquity of our lineage,"" said Brian Villmoare, lead author and ASU alumnus.

""We know what the teeth and mandible of the earliest Homo look like, but that's it. This emphasizes the critical importance of finding additional fossils to understand the differences

between Australopithecus and Homo, and potentially how they were able to overlap in the fossil record at the same location.""

The team cannot name the species yet based on the teeth alone; more fossils are needed before that can happen.

How old are the fossils?

How do scientists know these fossil teeth are millions of years old?

Volcanoes.

The Afar region is still an active rifting environment. There were a lot of volcanoes and tectonic activity and when these volcanoes erupted ash, the ash contained crystals called feldspars that allow the scientists to date them, explained Christopher Campisano, a geologist at ASU.

""We can date the eruptions that were happening on the landscape when they're deposited,"" said Campisano, a Research Scientist at the Institute of Human Origins and Associate Professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change.

""And we know that these fossils are interbed between those eruptions, so we can date units above and below the fossils. We are dating the volcanic ash of the eruptions that were happening while they were on the landscape.""

Finding fossils and dating the landscape not only helps scientists understand the species - it helps them recreate the environment millions of years ago. The modern faulted badlands of Ledi-Geraru, where the fossils were found are a stark contrast to the landscape these hominins traversed 2.6 - 2.8 million years ago. Back then, rivers migrated across a vegetated landscape into shallow lakes that expanded and contracted over time.

Ramon Arrowsmith, a geologist at ASU, has been working with the Ledi-Geraru Research Project since 2002. He explained the area has an interpretable geologic record with good age control for the geologic time range of 2.3 to 2.95 million years ago.

""It is a critical time period for human evolution as this new paper shows,"" said Arrowsmith, professor at the School of Earth and Space Exploration. ""The geology gives us the age and characteristics of the sedimentary deposits containing the fossils. It is essential for age control.""

What's next?

Reed said the team is examining tooth enamel now to find out what they can about what these species were eating. There are still remaining questions the team will continue to work on.

Were the early Homo and this unidentified species of Australopithecus eating the same things? Were they fighting for or sharing resources? Did they pass each other daily? Who were the ancestors of these species?

No one knows - yet.

""Whenever you have an exciting discovery, if you're a paleontologist, you always know that you need more information,"" said Reed. ""You need more fossils. That's why it's an important field to train people in and for people to go out and find their own sites and find places that we haven't found fossils yet.""

""More fossils will help us tell the story of what happened to our ancestors a long time ago -- but because we're the survivors we know that it happened to us.""

The paper ""New discoveries of Australopithecus and Homo from Ledi-Geraru, Ethiopia,"" was published in the journal Nature. The team of scientists and field team working on this project is widespread and many work at Arizona State University, or are alumni of ASU.

ASU alumni and current faculty authors include; Associate Professor Brian Villmoare, Associate Professor Lucas Delezene, Professor Amy Rector, Associate Research Professor Erin DiMaggio, Research Professor David Feary, PhD Candidate Daniel Chupik, Instructor Dominique Garello, Assistant Professor Ellis M. Locke, Lecturer Joshua Robinson, Assistant Professor Irene Smail and the late Professor William Kimbel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","What came before the Big Bang? Supercomputers may hold the answer","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821094530.htm","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:55 GMT","

We're often told it is ""unscientific"" or ""meaningless"" to ask what happened before the Big Bang. But a new paper by FQxI cosmologist Eugene Lim, of King's College London, UK, and astrophysicists Katy Clough, of Queen Mary University of London, UK, and Josu Aurrekoetxea, at Oxford University, UK, published in Living Reviews in Relativity, in June 2025, proposes a way forward: using complex computer simulations to numerically (rather than exactly) solve Einstein's equations for gravity in extreme situations. The team argues that numerical relativity should be applied increasingly in cosmology to probe some of the universe's biggest questions-including what happened before the Big Bang, whether we live in a multiverse, if our universe has collided with a neighboring cosmos, or whether our universe cycled through a series of bangs and crunches.

Einstein's equations of general relativity describe gravity and the motion of cosmic objects. But wind the clock back far enough and you'll typically encounter a singularity-a state of infinite density and temperature-where the laws of physics collapse. Cosmologists simply cannot solve Einstein's equations in such extreme environments-their normal simplifying assumptions no longer hold. And the same impasse applies to objects involving singularities or extreme gravity, such as black holes.

One issue might be what cosmologists take for granted. They normally assume that the universe is 'isotropic' and 'homogeneous'-looking the same in every direction to every observer. This is a very good approximation for the universe we see around us, and one that makes it possible to easily solve Einstein's equations in most cosmic scenarios. But is this a good approximation for the universe during the Big Bang?

""You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations,"" explains Lim. ""Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost.""

Beyond the Lamppost

Numerical relativity was first suggested in the 1960s and 1970s to try to work out what kinds of gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of spacetime) would be emitted if black holes collided and merged. This is an extreme scenario for which it is impossible to solve Einstein's equations with paper and pen alone-sophisticated computer code and numerical approximations are required. Its development received renewed focus when the LIGO experiment was proposed in the 80s, although the problem was only solved in this way in 2005, raising hopes that the method could also be successfully applied to other puzzles.

""You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations. Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost,"" says Eugene Lim.

One longstanding puzzle that Lim is particularly excited about is cosmic inflation, a period of extremely rapid expansion in the early universe. Inflation was initially proposed to explain why the universe looks the way it does today, stretching out an initially small patch, so that the universe looks similar across a vast expanse. ""If you don't have inflation, a lot of things fall apart,"" explains Lim. But while inflation helps explain the state of the universe today, nobody has been able to explain how or why the baby universe had this sudden short-lived growth spurt.

The trouble is, to probe this using Einstein's equations, cosmologists have to assume that the universe was homogeneous and isotropic in the first place-something which inflation was meant to explain. If you instead assume it started out in another state, then ""you don't have the symmetry to write down your equations easily,"" explains Lim.

But numerical relativity could help us get around this problem-allowing radically different starting conditions. It isn't a simple puzzle to solve, though, as there's an infinite number of ways spacetime could have been before inflation. Lim is therefore hoping to use numerical relativity to test the predictions coming from more fundamental theories that generate inflation, such as string theory.

Cosmic Strings, Colliding Universes

There are other exciting prospects, too. Physicists could use numerical relativity to try to work out what kind of gravitational waves could be generated by hypothetical objects called cosmic strings-long, thin ""scars"" in spacetime-potentially helping to confirm their existence. They might also be able to predict signatures, or ""bruises,"" on the sky from our universe colliding with neighboring universes (if they even exist), which could help us verify the multiverse theory.

Excitingly, numerical relativity could also help reveal whether there was a universe before the Big Bang. Perhaps the cosmos is cyclic and goes though ""bounces"" from old universes into new ones-experiencing repeated rebirths, Big Bangs and big crunches. That's a very hard problem to solve analytically. ""Bouncing universes are an excellent example, because they reach strong gravity where you can't rely on your symmetries,"" says Lim. ""Several groups are already working on them-it used to be that nobody was.""

Numerical relativity simulations are so complex that they require supercomputers to run. As the technology of these machines improves, we might expect significant improvement in our understanding of the universe. Lim is hoping the team's new paper, which outlines the methods and benefits of numerical relativity, can ultimately help get researchers across different areas up to speed.

""We hope to actually develop that overlap between cosmology and numerical relativity so that numerical relativists who are interested in using their techniques to explore cosmological problems can go ahead and do it,"" Lim says, adding, ""and cosmologists who are interested in solving some of the questions they cannot solve, can use numerical relativity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just cracked the quantum code hidden in a single atom","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821094524.htm","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 08:04:54 GMT","

To build a large-scale quantum computer that works, scientists and engineers need to overcome the spontaneous errors that quantum bits, or qubits, create as they operate.

Scientists encode these building blocks of quantum information to suppress errors in other qubits so that a minority can operate in a way that produces useful outcomes.

As the number of useful (or logical) qubits grows, the number of physical qubits required grows even further. As this scales up, the sheer number of qubits needed to create a useful quantum machine becomes an engineering nightmare.

Now, for the first time, quantum scientists at the Quantum Control Laboratory at the University of Sydney Nano Institute have demonstrated a type of quantum logic gate that drastically reduces the number physical qubits needed for its operation.

To do this, they built an entangling logic gate on a single atom using an error-correcting code nicknamed the 'Rosetta stone' of quantum computing. It earns that name because it translates smooth, continuous quantum oscillations into clean, digital-like discrete states, making errors easier to spot and fix, and importantly, allowing a highly compact way to encode logical qubits.

GKP Codes: A Rosetta Stone for Quantum Computing

This curiously named Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code has for many years offered a theoretical possibility for significantly reducing the physical number of qubits needed to produce a functioning 'logical qubit'. Albeit by trading efficiency for complexity, making the codes very difficult to control.

Research published on August 21 in Nature Physics demonstrates this as a physical reality, tapping into the natural oscillations of a trapped ion (a charged atom of ytterbium) to store GKP codes and, for the first time, realizing quantum entangling gates between them.

Led by Sydney Horizon Fellow Dr Tingrei Tan at the University of Sydney Nano Institute, scientists have used their exquisite control over the harmonic motion of a trapped ion to bridge the coding complexity of GKP qubits, allowing a demonstration of their entanglement.

""Our experiments have shown the first realization of a universal logical gate set for GKP qubits,"" Dr Tan said. ""We did this by precisely controlling the natural vibrations, or harmonic oscillations, of a trapped ion in such a way that we can manipulate individual GKP qubits or entangle them as a pair.""

Quantum Logic Gate and Software Innovation

A logic gate is an information switch that allows computers - quantum and classical - to be programmable to perform logical operations. Quantum logic gates use the entanglement of qubits to produce a completely different sort of operational system to that used in classical computing, underpinning the great promise of quantum computers.

First author Vassili Matsos is a PhD student in the School of Physics and Sydney Nano. He said: ""Effectively, we store two error-correctable logical qubits in a single trapped ion and demonstrate entanglement between them.

""We did this using quantum control software developed by Q-CTRL, a spin-off start-up company from the Quantum Control Laboratory, with a physics-based model to design quantum gates that minimize the distortion of GKP logical qubits, so they maintain the delicate structure of the GKP code while processing quantum information.""

A Milestone in Quantum Technology

What Mr Matsos did is entangle two 'quantum vibrations' of a single atom. The trapped atom vibrates in three dimensions. Movement in each dimension is described by quantum mechanics and each is considered a 'quantum state'. By entangling two of these quantum states realized as qubits, Mr Matsos created a logic gate using just a single atom, a milestone in quantum technology.

This result massively reduces the quantum hardware required to create these logic gates, which allow quantum machines to be programmed.

Dr Tan said: ""GKP error correction codes have long promised a reduction in hardware demands to address the resource overhead challenge for scaling quantum computers. Our experiments achieved a key milestone, demonstrating that these high-quality quantum controls provide a key tool to manipulate more than just one logical qubit.

""By demonstrating universal quantum gates using these qubits, we have a foundation to work towards large-scale quantum-information processing in a highly hardware-efficient fashion.""

Across three experiments described in the paper, Dr Tan's team used a single ytterbium ion contained in what is known as a Paul trap. This uses a complex array of lasers at room temperature to hold the single atom in the trap, allowing its natural vibrations to be controlled and utilized to produce the complex GKP codes.

This research represents an important demonstration that quantum logic gates can be developed with a reduced physical number of qubits, increasing their efficiency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why some people age faster. And the 400 genes behind it","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821094516.htm","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 05:50:51 GMT","

It's a fact of life: Some people age better than others.

Some ease into their 90s with mind and body intact, while others battle diabetes, Alzheimer's or mobility issues decades earlier. Some can withstand a bad fall or bout of the flu with ease, while others never leave the hospital again.

New University of Colorado Boulder-led research, published this month in the journal Nature Genetics, sheds light on why that is.

In it, an international team of co-authors identify more than 400 genes associated with accelerated aging across seven different sub-types. The study reveals that different groups of genes underlie different kinds of disordered aging, a.k.a. frailty, ranging from cognitive decline to mobility issues to social isolation.

The findings lend support to what is known as the ""geroscience hypothesis"" -- the idea that to treat the multiple chronic illnesses that come with aging, we must treat aging itself.

""To be able to identify treatments to stop or reverse accelerated biological aging, you need to know what the underlying biology is,"" said Isabelle Foote, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral researcher at CU's Institute for Behavioral Genetics. ""This is the largest study yet to use genetics to try to do that.""

Redefining 'frailty'

The study centers around ""frailty,"" a catch-all term for the ""multisystem physiological decline"" that often comes with aging.

More than 40% of U.S. adults over age 65 are considered frail.

Doctors typically assess frailty using a 30- point index that measures things like walking speed, grip strength, number of diagnosed illnesses and amount of social activity. The problem, said Foote, is that two people can get the same high frailty score even though one is cognitively sharp but can't walk and another is in good physical health but has a poor memory.

This lack of distinction has made it hard for doctors to make recommendations and for scientists to pinpoint the underlying causes of unhealthy aging.

""Aging is not just one thing. There are many ways to be frail,"" said Dr. Kenneth Rockwood, a leading expert in frailty, based at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada and co-author on the study. ""The question then becomes: What genes are involved?""

To find out, the team conducted a ""genome-wide association study"" analyzing DNA and health information from hundreds of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank and other public datasets to see which genes were associated with 30 frailty symptoms.

They identified 408 genes associated with accelerated aging/frailty, a significant increase from the 37 genes previously identified.

Some genes, they found, were strongly linked to certain subtypes of unhealthy aging, including: ""disability""; ""poor cognition""; ""metabolic problems""; ""multiple diseases""; ""generally unhealthy lifestyle""; and ""limited social support.""

For instance, the SP1 gene, associated with immune function and Alzheimer's disease was strongly associated with the broad ""poor cognition"" subtype, whereas the FTO gene, a gene known to be associated with obesity, seemed to underly several different categories of unhealthy aging.

""What this paper does is not only identify sub-facets of disordered aging but also demonstrate that there is very different biology underlying them,"" said senior author Andrew Grotzinger, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at CU Boulder. ""The tangible next step is to figure out how to treat this underlying biology.""

An anti-aging pill?

In the near term, the authors suggest that clinical measurements of frailty -- which often shows up long before specific diseases -- be expanded to include the six subtypes.

That way, someone diagnosed as cognitively frail could be guided toward therapies to prevent dementia, while someone frail in the metabolic domain might take steps to prevent diabetes or heart disease.

Foote envisions a day when people could get a ""polygenic risk score"" offering more detailed insight into what kind of unhealthy aging they are prone to.

But the holy grail, she says, would be to identify the molecular pathways that drive aging itself and develop therapies to put the brakes on.

Is a single anti-aging pill on the horizon?

Not likely.

But could there one day be a pill to treat a package of age-related metabolic issues, and another to address numerous cognitive issues?

It's a tantalizing idea, said Grotzinger.

""This paper suggests that it's probably not going to be a single magic pill to address all the diseases that come with aging, but maybe it doesn't need to be hundreds anymore.""

The world will warm more than expected due to future changes in ozone, which protects Earth from harmful sun rays but also traps heat as it is a greenhouse gas.

While banning ozone-destroying gases such as CFCs has helped the ozone layer to recover, when combined with increased air pollution the impact of ozone could warm the planet 40% more than originally thought.

A new study led by the University of Reading found that from 2015 to 2050, ozone is expected to cause 0.27 watts per square meter (Wm⁻²) of extra warming. This figure -- which measures how much extra energy gets trapped per square metre of Earth's surface -- would make ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 after carbon dioxide (1.75 Wm⁻² of extra warming).

Professor Bill Collins, lead author from the University of Reading, said: ""Countries are doing the right thing by continuing to ban chemicals called CFCs and HCFCs that damage the ozone layer above Earth. However, while this helps repair the protective ozone layer, we have found that this recovery in ozone will warm the planet more than we originally thought.

""Air pollution from vehicles, factories and power plants also creates ozone near the ground, causing health problems and warming the planet.""

Simulating the atmosphere 

The research, published on August 21 in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, used computer models to simulate how the atmosphere will change by the middle of the century. The models followed a scenario with low implementation of air pollution controls, but with CFCs and HCFCs being phased out as mandated by the Montreal Protocol (1987).

The findings show that stopping CFC and HCFC production -- done mainly to protect the ozone layer -- provides less climate benefit than previously calculated. CFCs and HCFCs are greenhouse gases that warm the planet. Countries banned them to save the ozone layer, expecting this would also help fight climate change. But as the ozone layer heals, it creates more warming that cancels out most of the climate benefits from removing CFCs and HCFCs.

Countries that reduce air pollution will limit some ozone formation near the ground. However, the ozone layer will continue repairing itself for decades regardless of air quality policies, creating unavoidable warming.

Protecting the ozone layer remains crucial for human health and preventing skin cancer. The ozone layer shields Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can harm people, animals and plants. However, the research suggests climate policies need updating to account for ozone's larger warming effect.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr wants a study about vaccines retracted.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Sipa US via Alamy

US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. Aluminium has been used for almost a century to enhance the immune system's response to some vaccines. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism.

Public-health officials in Kennedy's position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Through this request, “Secretary Kennedy has demonstrated that he wants the scientific literature to bend to his will”, says Oransky.

The study1 in question, published in Annals of Internal Medicine in July, is one of the largest of its kind, looking at 1.2 million children born over more than two decades in Denmark. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines. 

In an opinion piece published on TrialSite News on 1 August, Kennedy called into question the study's methodology, analysis and results. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has bypassed normal scientific review processes to change vaccine recommendations and terminated grants for projects on mRNA vaccines.

Annals of Internal Medicine says it stands by the study and has no plans to retract it. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study's web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”.

The Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy's article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to Nature's questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction.

Aluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues2,3. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines.

But in 2011, a study4 published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry claimed to show a causal relationship between rising autism diagnoses in children and increased exposure to aluminium-containing vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “seriously flawed” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data.

Since then, Grohmann says, the claim that aluminium in vaccines causes autism has been debunked “again and again”. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we'd see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don't,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds.

Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe.

Among Kennedy's criticisms of the Danish study are that the analysis excluded children who had died before the age of two. According to Kennedy, this means that the children “most likely to reveal injuries” associated with aluminum exposure were excluded.

Kennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.

Other critiques posted on the journal website overlapped with Kennedy's criticisms, says Anders Hviid, the senior author and an epidemiologist at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark's public-health agency. Hviid says he and his colleagues addressed the critiques “one by one”. He also published a rebuttal of Kennedy's article on TrialSite News on 3 August.

COVID-19 and long COVID are characterized by a dysregulated immune response. However, the role of macrophages during viral infection is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in increased macrophage numbers and extensive formation of enlarged lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells using humanized mice, rhesus macaques and post-mortem human lung tissue. Notably, infection by other coronaviruses tested, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and two bat coronaviruses (SHC014-CoV or WIV1-CoV), did not result in macrophage proliferation or foam cell formation. Foam cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung tissue display a pro-fibrotic and pro-thrombotic phenotype as they are enriched for genes associated with platelet activation and aggregation, as well as extracellular matrix organization and collagen synthesis. After viral clearance, macrophage numbers remain elevated, and lung fibrosis and thrombi persist. Importantly, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment with a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, EIDD-2801, prevents increases in macrophage cell numbers and foam cell formation, and reduces fibrosis markers. These observations highlight the contribution of macrophages to lung inflammation and tissue injury leading to the pulmonary fibrosis observed in COVID-19 patients.

Earlier this month, the Chinese aerospace company Geespace said it sent 11 satellites into orbit. The satellites went up in Geespace's fourth rocket launch since 2022, bringing its total “IoT constellation” from 30 to 41 satellites. By the end of this year, it has ambitions to deploy 72 satellites, which will provide global data coverage “excluding only the polar regions,” according to a press release.

Like any other satellite firm, Geespace has relationships with several telecommunications companies, spread out over more than 20 countries, to provide high-speed internet and other connectivity services. Earlier this year, it signed new agreements with Moroccan, Malaysian, and Saudi Arabian firms.

But Geespace is also owned by the parent company of Geely, the second-best-selling carmaker in China, which also sells vehicles across five continents. Which means the rocket launch, and the in-development low-Earth-orbit constellation, also has a mobility bent. Geespace says the satellites will provide support for advanced driver-assistance systems in cars and commercial vehicles, “significantly improving travel safety and convenience.” (The company left open the possibility of supporting other vehicles' systems too.)

This makes Geely the only global automaker with its own dedicated satellite internet constellation and a public plan to integrate that connectivity into its advanced driving tech. At a time when most global automakers are struggling through concurrent crises—a rocky transition to electric vehicles; confused and confusing approaches to software; questions around the future of autonomy; global economic upheaval and trade reorientations; and the rise of Chinese auto manufacturers—the Chinese automaker's space play demonstrates a veritable long-term, international strategy.

“Geely has the reach, it has the capital, and obviously it has the capability to put satellites into orbit,” says Tu Le, the founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy. The automaker is arguably the most international of China's vehicle companies. In addition to its popular Geely Galaxy, Zeekr, and Lynk & Co brands, its parent company owns the majority of Volvo Cars and Lotus, nearly half of EV company Polestar, and 17 percent of Aston Martin. In 2018, Geely founder and chair Li Shufu bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Mercedes-Benz. Operating its own infrastructure in space could help support all those brands into the future. “There is no doubt that Geely has international ambitions,” says Le. “This just reinforces the mindset that Geely is going to be a global player.”

Continuing to expand globally could be existential not only for Geely, but the wider Chinese auto industry. The Chinese government has attempted to tamp down on a now-years-long auto price war that has seen round after round of aggressive cuts as the country cranks out tens of millions of vehicles annually. EV-maker BYD, which toppled Tesla this year as the globe's number one seller of new-energy vehicles, has come under special scrutiny. Chinese government and industry officials have likened the situation to Chinese real estate developer Evergrande; the firm's 2021 collapse plunged the nation into economic turmoil. Healthier growth might depend on international exports, which surged by 300 percent between 2021 and 2024 despite US and European trade barriers to Chinese cars.

Satellite communications should have some upside for advanced auto tech—and people who buy cars equipped with it. They can give vehicle software highly precise, centimeter-level data on where cars are on the road, as well as stable (and redundant) connections, which allow better route planning and driving efficiency, Fanni Li, a principal research analyst focusing on auto technology at S&P Global Mobility, writes in an email. Right now, that sort of data might help cars perform some safety functions by themselves: stay in lanes, avoid specific collisions. One day, though, satellite communications could help autonomous vehicles, those without drivers, maintain constant connectivity in a way that today's ground-based cellular networks can't, especially in places where cellular infrastructure is spotty or nonexistent.

Geely has already advertised that it's going to capitalize on its satellite capabilities. Several Geely models, including the Geely Galaxy Xinyao 8 PHEV sedan, Lynk & Co 900 PHEV SUV, and all-electric Zeekr 001, come with satellite communication technology.

So far, though, other automotive companies seem to have concluded that while constant connectivity is a nice-to-have, it's not worth the cost or the trouble, at least right now. Satellite connections require some sort of antennae to be built into each vehicle. The car business is one with razor-thin margins; adding any new component to a vehicle can be a hard sell.

“It's not [automakers'] priority in terms of their business models,” says Partha Goswami, who studied satellite connectivity in the automotive business while he worked as a technology fellow at General Motors, and who now runs his own consulting firm.

Case in point: Tesla shares its CEO, Elon Musk, with SpaceX, which operates the satellite internet service Starlink. While some Tesla drivers have written in online forums about hooking their electric cars up with Starlink Mini, the company's most compact and portable transceiver, Tesla doesn't offer Starlink-enabled connectivity built into its vehicles.

Other auto-satellite linkups, even those involving automakers “renting” satellites rather than deploying them themselves, have foundered. A 2000s-era partnership between Volvo Cars and satellite company Orbcomm petered out with the latter's bankruptcy filing. In 2016, Toyota announced it would work with US-based antenna tech company Kymeta to equip its cars with satellite communications; a Kymeta spokesperson tells WIRED that the partnership is “no longer active.”

Geespace, meanwhile, has outlined a three-phase approach to its “Future Mobility Constellation.” Phase one ends when the last of the 72 satellites reach low Earth orbit later this year; phase two will involve more than 200 more satellites to support existing mobile phone service; phase three focuses on thousands of multimedia satellites.

The plans seem overwhelming, and that's sort of the point, says Le, the analyst. Geespace and Geely “are using this as a marketing tool,” he says. They want to broadcast internationally that they are motivated, technology-forward, and focused on execution. Maybe, the messaging goes, your next car will be great, inexpensive, Chinese-made—and speak to space.

“You're covering it,” Le says to me. “The international media is taking note.”

As a laptop reviewer of over 10 years, it's tempting to think you've seen it all. Laptops with foldable displays or even dual screens have come and gone, as have a half-dozen other gimmicky trends. Then a box arrives at your door that subverts what you thought was possible. That's the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable.

We first saw it at CES 2025. It's a laptop that can extend from a 14-inch display up to 16.7 inches, all at the press of a key. It's the party trick to end all party tricks. And yet, as I lived with this machine, I found it far more practical than I assumed it could be.

There's nothing quite like the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. It uses the same curved OLED technology as seen in concept televisions and smartphones but never in a product this commercially viable. (I should note that as of publication time, Lenovo's retail page says it's not yet available. We've asked Lenovo for a concrete timeline on availability.)

It starts as a 14-inch display with a 5:4 aspect ratio, which is already odd. That's as square a laptop display as you'll find. But then push the dedicated key in the function row and the magic happens. The gears start rotating, the mechanisms crank up, and eight seconds later, your laptop's display has expanded up to 16.7 inches, which is 50 percent more screen than before. Just watching it transform is fun. Seeing that display unroll out of the hinge feels futuristic.

Now, I've always been a fan of vertical space on laptops. I tend to prefer 3:2-aspect-ratio devices like the Surface Laptop over 16:10 or 16:9. At its full extension, though, the 16.7-inch screen (measured diagonally) has an 8:9 aspect ratio, making it considerably taller than it is wide. It looks both awesome and ridiculous simultaneously. Nothing will catch the attention of every other person in a coffee shop like rolling up with one of these babies. The use case is not that you'll be switching between these two sizes while in the middle of your workflow but instead that it's a portability benefit. While it's in your bag, it's just a 14-inch laptop, but when it's out on your table, it can grow into a much larger screen.

And the benefit of that larger screen? Well, you've likely seen someone using a laptop with a vertical screen attached to the top of the display. This is the same idea. You can have two 16:9 windows stacked vertically, which is perfect for multitasking. I found it super easy to throw a video, social media feed, Slack window, or source up top, with my writing window down below. Windows 11 split-screen handles that effortlessly, and I'm sure you can easily think of what you might use that extra vertical space for. Lenovo does include a custom, built-in widget panel that takes up the bottom third of the display, which can be populated with reminders, to-do lists, and calendars, but I didn't find it very helpful.

The screen is OLED, so it naturally has better color and contrast than a typical IPS display. The machine I tested had perfect color saturation, covering 100 percent of the sRGB, AdobeRGB, and Display P3 color spaces. That's not something I've seen happen very often. It also gets up to 328 nits in SDR and 662 nits in HDR, meaning it's plenty bright for almost all lighting conditions and even has decent HDR performance when watching movies and videos or playing games.

The surprise for me came in the ergonomic benefits of the design. I've been reviewing a lot of laptop stands recently and thinking about ergonomics, and as it turns out, the tall screen of the ThinkBook Plus Rollable is a surprising solution to hunching over to look down at the screen all the time. That's not a reason to buy this laptop on its own, but it just might be its secret weapon.

My only real issue with the display is that, because it's flexible OLED, it has that same plasticky protective layer over the panel that gives it a cheap look. When fully extended, you can also see the faint crease line where the original screen was. It's not overly distracting, but you can see it on dark backgrounds.

Beyond the screen, Lenovo has done its best to make this laptop look as discreet as possible. When fully extended, it certainly looks odd from behind. The device is mostly quite sturdy and well-built, but the screen hangs ever so slightly at the crease. The ThinkBook Plus Rollable also has some thick side bezels, which are there to house the “rolling” mechanism, as well as provide enough width for the laptop to still have room for a full-size keyboard.

It's 0.78 inches thick, so it's not exactly as portable as a conventional ThinkBook or ThinkPad laptop. Nor does it have as many ports. On the left side, you'll find just two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The right side has no ports at all. If you're using one USB-C port for charging, that leaves just one free for other accessories. Even just one more USB-C port would have been helpful. You'll need a hub.

As a laptop with a premium price, it's important that Lenovo didn't phone in the parts of the device that don't have to do with the rollable screen. For example, the keyboard and touchpad are both fantastic. The keys are snappy and precise, but still feel like they have enough travel. Meanwhile, the touchpad is haptic, simulating a mechanical click. It's like the ones you get on the Surface Laptop or the MacBook Pro, and it's great.

The webcam uses a 5-megapixel camera and comes with an IR camera for facial authentication. In my testing, it struggled a bit in low light, introducing too much noise and overexposing the image. One thing I like about it, however, is the placement. Due to that tall screen, the angle of the webcam places you in the center of the screen, a bit more like a desktop webcam that's attached to the top of a monitor. Heck, there's even a somewhat decent set of speakers on this thing. They're not going to blow your mind with bass, but they surprised me nonetheless.

The ThinkBook Plus Rollable is not about its performance, though Lenovo made a good choice in using the Intel Core Ultra 258V. Or so I thought. This is an efficient chip that gets solid performance, but more importantly, it usually gets great battery life. Not the case on this ThinkBook.

There are a few things Lenovo does to make the ThinkBook Plus Rollable last longer on a charge out of the box. By default, HDR is turned off and the refresh rate is set to 60 Hz instead of 120. The power settings are also set to Best Power Efficiency on battery rather than Balanced. It's not that those are bad settings necessarily, but they skew the numbers when you test the battery life compared to other machines. Using the normal settings I test on, the ThinkBook Plus Rollable lasted 10 hours in local video playback and considerably less in real-world applications and tasks. You can get a couple more hours by lowering these settings, but that's true of just about any laptop.

Performance was about as expected for this chip. It's not nearly as fast as Apple's M4, in either single-core or multi-core performance, but that's not Lenovo's fault. One of the strongest aspects of this Intel chip is its integrated graphics performance, and here the ThinkBook Plus Rollable delivers expected results, allowing you to play some lower-tier games like Fortnite or Marvel Rivals at decent frame rates, so long as you're willing to drop graphics settings to Medium and use upscaling as necessary.

There's just one configuration available, and it happens to be a stacked model, coming with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage. That's nice to have, but it's partly what makes this laptop so expensive. For what this machine is meant to do, which is basic work and multitasking, 32 GB of RAM isn't necessary.

Lenovo knows there's just one reason someone would buy a laptop like this. For fun. It's got that geeky, gadget appeal that so few pieces of modern tech still have. Buy this thing, and you'll want to show off the transformation just to see the look on people's faces. And once that excitement wears off, you'll still have a laptop that is both premium and immensely useful. That's what separates gimmicks from innovation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Scientists Find a New Moon Orbiting Uranus","https://www.wired.com/story/new-moon-identified-on-uranus-orbiting-close-to-its-ring-system/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:26:53 GMT","

A team of astronomers has found what appears to be a previously undiscovered moon orbiting Uranus. If confirmed, this finding would mean the gigantic blue-green ice planet would have 29 moons. The discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), extending the instrument's list of achievements and raising expectations that other new discoveries might be made within the solar system.

With JWST's infrared camera, the researchers took ten 40-minute exposures of Uranus and detected a tiny, fuzzy dot accompanying the icy giant's other moons. With the preliminary information gathered, the researchers estimate that it is a body of about 10 kilometers in diameter, located 56,000 kilometers from the center of the planet.

This new satellite is part of Uranus' group of 13 inner moons, which are characterized by their irregular shapes and low brightness. It orbits just beyond the outer edge of the planet's main ring system, along with other nearby moons such as Mab, Cordelia, and Ophelia.

At the moment, the object has the code name S/2025 U1. To confirm its status as a natural satellite, the team plans to make further observations; if its status as a moon is confirmed, it will then be given an official name. Traditionally, Uranus' moons have been named after characters from works by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope—such as Francisco, Stefano, Miranda, Trinculo, Ariel, and so on. Any new name for it or any other newly discovered satellite must be approved by the International Astronomical Union.

William Herschel discovered the first two moons of Uranus in 1787—Titania and Oberon—six years after identifying the planet. Dozens of others have since been found. The last time observatories detected an official satellite was in 2003, when Margaret was found using the Hubble telescope. Along with S/2025 U1, there is another unnamed moon also awaiting confirmation, S/2023 U1, which was discovered two years ago. In total, the scientific community has identified 29 moons (including these two awaiting confirmation).

The discovery of S/2025 U1 marks a new step in the observation of the solar system. Neither the Hubble Telescope nor the Voyager 2 probe that flew by Uranus in 1986 were able to find this moon; the fact that the JWST was able to uncover it suggests there is still more complexity to be discovered within Uranus' ring system, and that thanks to this new tool, more discoveries could follow.

“Looking forward, the discovery of this moon underscores how modern astronomy continues to build upon the legacy of missions like Voyager 2, which flew past Uranus on January 24, 1986, and gave humanity its first close-up look at this mysterious world,” said Maryame El Moutamid, leader of the team that conducted the study, in a NASA statement. “Now, nearly four decades later, the James Webb Space Telescope is pushing that frontier even farther.”

In a market that is becoming increasingly more crowded (for the better, as getting more people on bikes is good for all of us), Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has planted its flag as a brand that offers the fun and utility of an ebike at a lower cost than its competitors, thanks in large part to its direct-to-consumer model.

What started as a single-product brand quickly grew into what it is today: North America's largest ebike manufacturer, with a line that includes off-road bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and even a trike. The RadRunner Max takes one of the brand's cornerstone models and jacks it up with plenty of upgrades, new styling, and cutting-edge battery technology aimed at keeping its owners safe.

As a certifiable bike nut and a bit of a wrencher myself, I was not very concerned about assembling the bike when its massive, cartoon-adorned cardboard box arrived on my doorstep a few months ago. Armed with my portable bike shop (a fishing tackle box full of small bike tools and parts), my trusty torque wrench, and a rag or two, I cut open the box and emptied everything onto my garage floor and discovered that a Rad bike is no different than a piece of Ikea furniture. All I needed to build the bike was a trio of Allen keys and a small adjustable wrench, all of which were included in the packaging. Of course, a torque wrench wouldn't hurt, as the bike's assembly guide offers helpful torque recommendations for anything a user needs to tighten.

Going from a sealed box to a rideable bike took about 25 minutes, since all that required assembly was mounting the handlebars, front wheel, kickstand, front fender, and 450-lumen headlight. Everything else was ready to go straight out of the box.

The only knock I had during assembly is how, in an effort to protect the bike's paint while in transit, much of its frame was covered in masking tape. While the tape did its job perfectly, it did leave plenty of residue on the RadRunner's stunning hunter green finish (unfortunately the bike's only color option). That left me reaching for my bottle of Goo Gone to scrub away all those would-be magnets for dirt and grime once out on the road.

Eager to try the bike, I forgot to add air to the tires once I had it fully built. I thought what's what led to the overly cushy ride feel, but then I realized that the bike came loaded with a front suspension unit that boasts 80 millimeters of travel. You may feel different, but unless I'm riding off road, I hate suspension. The first thing I did on realizing this was lean over and click the suspension setting to rigid. I did this while rolling down the street—that's how easy it is to change the fork's setting. Then I turned back up to my garage and added air to the tires.

Speaking of the tires, the only big issue I had with the rideability of the RadRunner was the absolutely massive fat tires that give the bike bit of a lumbering feel, especially when riding with any bit of speed. Granted, between the massive amounts of rubber beneath the bike and the front suspension, you can easily dial the RadRunner so as to not feel anything beneath you as you roll around town.

A major concern for ebike owners (current and prospective alike) is the notion of thermal runaway, which is the official terminology for “lithium-ion batteries catching fire.” It's been a concern for some time. Rad Power Bikes has been at the center of at least a few of these incidences over the years, but the RadRunner Max has the brand's Safe Shield batteries, which debuted last year and which remedy any potential for thermal runaway.

Safe Shield earns the batteries a UL-2271 certification. It encapsulates the batteries' cells in a heat-absorbing resin so that any fire remains localized and will (hopefully) extinguish itself. The battery is also semi-integrated into the frame, giving the bike a much sleeker and more high-minded look than iterations past.

The bike's Dutch-style step-through design, combined with its telescoping seat post, makes it an easy family vehicle, as both my wife (5'6”) and I (6'4”) can easily adjust and climb on the RadRunner Max. That said, when I adjust the RadRunner Max to my riding specs, it requires pulling the seat tube to its maximum height setting. Even then, my legs felt a bit jammed in during rides. If only I had checked before heading out, I would have taken note of the range—from 4'11” to 6'2”. Still, I was able to cover plenty of miles with no pain or discomfort. Still, I would not recommend the RadRunner Max to anyone taller than me.

Where it might fall short in height accomodation, however, the 750-watt, 90 newton-meter motor housed in the bike's rear hub—which can power the bike to a maximum 28 miles per hour—provided plenty of juice to get me and all of my 260 pounds easily up and over any of Chapel Hill, North Carolina's endlessly undulating bumps. With a combination of pedal assist and hand-grip throttle, an eight-speed rear derailleur covering a wide-enough 11- to 34-tooth cassette, the RadRunner Max handled riding around with aplomb over the few weeks I spent testing it.

The pedal assist features five modes that range from completely off to full power, but there were definitely times where I cranked the throttle and treated the RadRunner more like a moped than anything else. Though it's scientifically impossible to prove, this is probably when the smile on my face was at its biggest.

Of course, the more power used, the faster I watched the battery run down on the RadRunner's massive, full-color display. Hoping to get anywhere near the bike's claimed 60 miles of range, I did my best to keep the motor set between 1 or 2 on flats and completely off on descents. Thanks to the bike's manageable thumb buttons, switching between settings became second nature within seconds.

And, as stopping is equally important as riding, the RadRunner's massive 180-mm rotors, which boast 2.3 mm of thickness and are operated by hydraulic brakes, gave me plenty of stopping power, even as I was rolling down a 12-percent hill one rainy afternoon.

On the safety and security front, the RadRunner Max features two major upgrades beyond its new battery. First, its rear light not only boasts turn signals but also radar, which alerts riders to traffic coming up on them within 100 meters, even displaying the vehicle's speed. It also alerts drivers: Its rear light will blink when it detects traffic.

Second, the RadRunner Max is loaded with redundant safekeeping measures which include a key fob, Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, an option for passcode unlock (and the ability to assign multiple passcodes for multiple users), and even a built-in Apple Find My feature, which will help you track down your bike if anyone lifts it. Me? I'm old-school, so I simply wound my U-lock and cable through the bike's rear rack, which not only boasts a reported 120-pound capacity but also has an additional battery mount, where a second unit can double the bike's claimed 60-mile range.

Is the RadRunner Max perfect? Hardly. Then again, no bike is (other than, of course, a hand-painted Dario Pegoretti, but I still can't convince WIRED to let me test one of those. While it may fall a bit short in height (no pun intended), ride feel (at least for me), and color options (though the hunter green finish with Rad's signature orange badging certainly pops), the RadRunner Max more than compensates in utility, ease of use, cool new safety features, and, perhaps most importantly, fun factor.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Astronomer's New CEO Speaks—Yes, About That","https://www.wired.com/story/astronomers-new-ceo-speaks-coldplay/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The only people from Astronomer attending the Coldplay concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 16 were CEO Andy Byron and his head of HR, Kristin Cabot. They were swaying in mid-hug when the roving kiss cam, a staple at the band's performances, zeroed in on them. You have probably seen the clip of what happened next. The two of them scrambled like kids caught raiding a cookie jar. Even Coldplay's anodyne frontman Chris Martin couldn't ignore their response. “They're either having an affair, or they're just very shy,” he remarked. The CEO and his subordinate are no longer with the company. Astronomer, a billion-dollar startup you'd likely never heard of until last month, will never be the same.

“We found out the way the rest of the world found out,” says Pete DeJoy, who cofounded the company and took over as chief executive when Byron left. He's speaking to me from Astronomer's new headquarters in the Flatiron district of New York City. Until our conversation, his main public statement following the concert had been a LinkedIn post thanking his employees for their resilience and conspicuously omitting any mention of why a “surreal” spotlight was suddenly trained on the company. DeJoy, a self-described nerd, can still hardly believe what happened last month. But don't be fooled. The kiss-cam incident created a rare opportunity to call attention to the company's accomplishments, and show off a bit of corporate savvy in how to handle the situation. The most entertaining thing that has ever happened at a Coldplay concert turned out to be weirdly rhapsodic for the company it supposedly humiliated. (Though maybe not so much for Byron and Cabot.) But it still makes DeJoy cringe.

That's why, in our extensive conversation, DeJoy made a point of distancing himself from the events at Gillette Stadium. He managed to twist every question about the presumably sizzling goings-on in the corporate suite into a tribute to the heads-down, stick-to-business ethos of the firm's 300 workers.

DeJoy insists that within the company, there was no inkling of any hanky-panky in the C-suite. Still, I wonder, could the company have been in any way lax in allowing its frisky executives to shatter the bounds? “Look, we're reviewing all of our policies,” he tells me. “It's really important to me that we make sure that we prohibit relationships between employees that create real or perceived conflicts of interest.” So there's an outside investigation? “I'm just going to say all of our workplace policies are being reviewed no matter what. It's important to get this one right.” He won't say whether the “review” entails Astronomer hiring an outside firm to investigate the scandal. Nor did he answer my question about whether Byron got a severance package upon his untimely departure.

I asked him directly: Is DeJoy pissed at his former boss for embarrassing the company? “No, no, I don't think I can say I am,” he insists. “People make mistakes. We really just want to continue focusing on what matters here, which is our customers and our business.” (See what I mean about messaging?) I ask when he last spoke to Byron. “A long time ago,” he says. “Before the event.” Wait, you haven't talked to him since the Jumbotron? “That's correct,” he says. Now that's cold play.

On the other hand, Astronomer's outsourced response to the incident will go into the marketing hall of fame. While employees were working overtime to assure customers that the kiss-cam drama wouldn't impact the company's services, its executives hired Ryan Reynolds' cheeky media firm Maximum Effort. The result was a 60-second ad with Gwyneth Paltrow (Martin's ex), who displayed Oscar-level deadpan when she promised the internet she'd answer their questions about the incident. The joke was that her responses to queries about the concert were bromides about the firm's geeky business. (Kind of like my interview with DeJoy.) Responding to “OMG! What the actual f!” she said. “Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow.” The absurdity of Paltrow, who is more often associated with organic skin-care products and jade eggs, talking about “data workflow automation” was priceless. It successfully shifted the narrative, at least a bit, to a question that many people were suddenly asking: What the actual f is Astronomer?

DeJoy, who says he never got to meet his famous (albeit temporary) spokesperson, is more than happy to answer the question. The company was started by a small group of techies in Cincinnati in 2017. The original idea involved data tracking. That's sort of why they named their firm Astronomer. “Astronomers were the first data engineers, because they were making sense of how the world worked by intuiting how the stars were moving in the night sky,” says DeJoy. “That's very much the job of a data engineer these days, right?” If you say so!

The original plan was scrapped a year later for another opportunity: building a commercial operation around an open source app called Apache Airflow, which was originally invented in 2014 by an Airbnb engineer named Maxime Beauchemin and open-sourced a year later. The app is like an automated to-do list, organizing and directing data to show up at exactly the right time and place. Astronomer saw a business opportunity in supporting the software, much in the way that Red Hat once acted as a for-profit middleman between Linux and corporate customers. The company worked closely with Beauchemin to develop its own products, including a “data orchestration” app called Astro that runs on top of Airflow.

“We went through just about everything that you can go through as a startup, including the collapse of a major bank and scaling the company and raising capital during a global pandemic,” says DeJoy. (The bank he's referring to is Silicon Valley Bank, which experienced a bank run in 2023, resulting in Astronomer's assets being temporarily unavailable.)

In 2019, Astronomer's cofounder and CEO Ry Walker felt that the company needed a more experienced leader. That was Byron. “That decision turned out very well for the company, and me personally—I don't regret it at all,” Walker said on X post-Coldplay. Byron seems to have done his job well, if you disregard human relations. The company's 800-plus customers now include Sweetgreen, Adobe, Northern Trust, and T. Rowe Price. DeJoy, a baseball fan, is particularly proud of Astronomer's work with the Texas Rangers baseball club. “They do a bunch of game analytics with our product, and that contributed to them winning the World Series in 2023,” he claims.

Life goes on. DeJoy says that in the age of generative AI, Astronomer's services are more important than ever before. “Customers need access to really strong, structured data,” he says, shifting into sales mode. “When you ask the model something, it needs to do retrieval against some subset of information. Our product is often the thing delivering that context, so that when models are interfacing with datasets, they are not producing responses that are hallucinated or inaccurate in some way.”

The future of Astronomer seems even brighter than it was before its former CEO became internet famous. According to DeJoy, Astronomer has won new customers due to its recent fame. DeJoy's future looks shiny too. The board is searching for a new CEO, and while DeJoy won't confirm that he's in the running, he doesn't deny it. In his LinkedIn post, he boasted that his company is now “a household name.” So I ask him: Was that wandering kiss cam at the Coldplay concert the best thing that ever happened to Astronomer?

There's a pause before he answers. “I definitely don't want to say that,” he says. “This was a very serious event for us and our employees, and one that we certainly didn't take lightly.”

That prevarication is at odds with the message he so relentlessly tried to deliver during our conversation—that Astronomer has not only recovered from potential disaster but has renewed momentum and some feel-good fame. He doesn't even duck the question when I ask him about a future IPO, acknowledging that would be nice, though it's not the ultimate goal. “The end goal for me is building something that actually can last a very, very long time and leave a legacy,” he says. Maybe that legacy will be much more than a viral moment. But when the history of Astronomer is written, those few seconds at a Coldplay concert may mark how a quietly successful data company reached much loftier heights. Though it's hard to imagine how fledgling startups might emulate that trick—or want to.

The road to startup success is often a bumpy one. Aatish Parson prefers it that way, for now, as the cracks and potholes on roads in the Seattle area provide key data for something called CivicScan.

A Redmond, Wash., native and recent computer science graduate from the University of Washington, Parson has been spending the summer working on the project he first started in school, with the goal of expanding it and making it more usable.

CivicScan is an AI-powered app that works via a mobile device pointed at the road from a vehicle windshield or dashboard. Parson's platform scans the road ahead, using computer vision and machine learning models to automatically detect pavement defects, providing visual evidence and location data for more streamlined maintenance planning.

In a post on LinkedIn this week, Parson said his tech identified more than 13,000 cracks after just an hour of driving around Redmond. His vision is for municipal road departments to use such technology to head off bigger nightmares around failing pavement and the cost associated with such upkeep.

Parson did a software engineering internship at Amazon last summer, in which he worked on expanding map data coverage of road conditions and vehicle maneuverability to enhance safety for delivery drivers.

Asked whether anything else in his background created an interest in transportation or city infrastructure and made him want to address the problem of deteriorating roads, Parson offered up an answer that plenty of drivers can relate to.

“Maybe frustration,” he said. “To be honest, my car suspension has been pretty rocky. I was like, ‘I keep hitting these potholes.'”

Driving a 2009 Acura MDX with a $15 magnetic mount off Amazon holding his phone in place, Parson feels like it's his civic duty to help his hometown — and any other cities or counties which might be interested.

On the CivicScan website, users can view a live “Pavement Defect Map” showing roads in Redmond that Parson has scanned. His model doesn't just paint a box around a crack in the surface, but accurately traces the outline of the defect.

Certainly every flaw in the surface of every road doesn't rate as a priority for fixing. But Parson worries that cracks left unattended will just invite water to seep in and more deterioration to occur, causing the price of an eventual fix to rise.

Across Lake Washington, the Seattle Department of Transportation relies on a lower-tech system for keeping an eye on roadways.

Residents can report potholes through a number of channels, including the “Find it, Fix It” app, SDOT's website, or by calling 206-684-ROAD. Maintenance crews also identify potholes during routine work, and requests can come in via the Mayor's Office and City Council. Pothole crews respond with a first reported, first repaired method as the prioritization model, according to SDOT.

The agency does not use AI or computer vision for any pothole detection at this time, but it does have its own map — called the “Pothole Status Map” — where the public can track repair requests in real time. It's updated nightly with both open and completed reports. 

More broadly across Washington state, the County Road Administration Board (CRAB) deals with many of the intricacies of preserving and enhancing the transportation infrastructure of the state's 39 counties.

In order to be eligible for arterial road repair funds, counties must have a Pavement Management System in place to help analyze pavement life cycles and pavement ratings to determine the best timing and cost-effective method for pavement preservation.

Parson just pictures workers from a city or county road department driving around now and then with a phone on their windshield scanning the roads ahead of them, collecting useful data. He'd be happy to have CivicScan process it all and build an action dashboard or any other necessary visualization to help with repair decisions.

“I want to give everyone the data to make a more informed decision, because budgets are already tight, right?” he said. “I think that'd be pretty cool. And our roads would all be quite smooth.”

Seattle startup Electric Era is raising more cash to fund its DC fast-charging systems that include giant batteries to help deliver and store power. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the company has raised nearly $8.9 million in debt. 

Startups raise capital via debt financing to help pay for operations without giving up equity. An Electric Era spokesperson declined to comment on the new funding.

Electric Era launched in 2019 and previously raised $20.5 million from investors. Last summer the business moved into a spacious, 18,000-square-foot facility located south of Seattle's downtown.  

This past June, Electric Era and Washington state officials celebrated the opening of an eight-port, electric vehicle charging system at an A1 Gas and Food off State Route 530, north of Seattle near the town of Arlington. The station was co-funded by the Washington Electric Vehicle Charging Program, which is supported by the state's Climate Commitment Act. 

The company is steadily deploying its charging stations across the U.S. despite efforts by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to curb the EV sector. President Trump took steps in February to halt the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, but last week his administration issued new guidance to states eager to apply for $5 billion worth of NEVI grants. 

The GOP's “Big Beautiful Bill” ends tax credits after Sept. 30 for consumers purchasing EVs, and it eliminates a tax break for EV charging infrastructure by the end of next year.

Electric Era's strategy is to pair its stations with existing businesses. It has installed chargers at a Costco in Ridgefield, Wash., mini-marts in Oregon, a shawarma shop outside of Boston, and locations in California, Florida, New Mexico, Kentucky, Delaware, Tennessee and Missouri. Dozens of additional sites are in the works according to the company's station map. 

CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee touts the speed at which Electric Era stations are built and installed, and their affordability and reliability. 

Fast-charging stations gulp electricity, but Electra Era's inclusion of a battery storage system eliminates the need for new high-power grid connections for the chargers. It can also slash operating costs by up to 70%, the company reports, by drawing power from the batteries instead of the grid during times of high demand. 

Each Electric Era charging device, which has ports for two vehicles, can deliver as much energy as is consumed by 200 homes. A typical station will have four chargers and serve about 150 cars per day.

Joe Nguyễn, director of the Washington State Department of Commerce, praised the Electric Era installation at the A1 Gas and Food site. Its opening was the first of 136 new public DC fast charger installations funded through the state's program. 

“This charging station is a result of collaboration between Washington state, private industry and local leaders to solve real-world challenges,” Nguyễn said in a statement. “It's about cleaner air, stronger communities, and creating a more reliable EV experience for Washington drivers.”

Beijing may have thrown a wrench into Nvidia's plans on making a comeback in China's AI market.

Nvidia has instructed its component suppliers to stop production related to its H20 AI chip, according to The Information.

The production halt comes after Beijing reportedly warned Chinese companies against using these chips because of potential security issues and fears of backdoors that would give the U.S. access to sensitive data. China's government is urging companies to use domestic chips instead, The Information reported.

This comes a month after companies including Nvidia were given the green light to start selling its AI chips designed for China's market.

An Nvidia spokesperson sent TechCrunch the following statement, “We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions. Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have ‘backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them. The market can use the H20 with confidence.”

In an effort to cut down on abuse and fake engagement, Elon Musk's X is removing access to two key features of its developer API for those on the free plan. Now, free users will no longer be able to use the API to like posts on behalf of a user, nor follow other users.

The company says these changes will help protect X's platform from “spam, bots, and manipulative activities” that degrade the user experience.

Developers on paid plans like the Basic, Pro, or Enterprise tiers will be unaffected. These plans also include access to more capabilities, higher rate limits, and support for a broader range of features.

While restricting access to some of the most common actions on X could help cut down on programmatic abuse, it could also push developers with legitimate businesses or projects who want to continue to move toward paid plans. 

X has made a number of significant changes to its API platform under Musk, initially ending free access with little developer warning, then later changing its mind to support some free usage. When its new API pricing arrived in spring 2023, it was clear the company had revenue generation in mind, as its most bare-bones, basic plan would do little more than support those that were offering “good bots” — that is, automated accounts that provided useful information, like weather alerts.

Last October, X increased the prices for its basic tier as well, from $100 to $200 per month, and added higher limits.

Waymo has been granted a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the first such approval granted by the city. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing “immediately.” 

The company is allowed to deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace SUVs in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. Waymo's vehicles must have a trained safety operator in the driver's seat, with at least one hand on the wheel at all times. The company cannot pick up passengers (since it would need a license from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission) and it has to regularly meet with and report data to the city's Department of Transportation (DOT), according to the mayor's office.

The permit brings Waymo one step closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city, which would be arguably its most challenging to date. The company currently operates in San Francisco, Austin, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. All of those are warm-weather cities, and only San Francisco comes close to the complexity of operating in New York City.

Waymo has spent years poking at the Big Apple, starting in 2021 when it used its Chrysler Pacifica minivans to manually map the city. And receiving this permit was no sure thing. The company applied in June, and has spent the last few months meeting with lawmakers and local organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 

The permit is part of a new autonomous vehicle safety regime launched by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024. To apply, Waymo had to coordinate with first responders, as well as submit a testing plan to the local DOT, along with a safety plan that documented the qualifications of the vehicle operators, among other things. Waymo has also obtained the “necessary permits” from the New York state Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the mayor's office.

When Waymo's trial period ends in late September, it will have to apply for an extension if it wants to keep testing.

Google announced Friday that it's enhancing the editing experience for Drive videos with a new shortcut button for Vids, the tech giant's AI-powered video-creation tool. 

The new feature allows Workspace users to initiate a video edit using Vids directly from the Google Drive interface. Now, while previewing a video in Drive, users will see an “Open” button in the top right corner that opens the video in the Vids app. Vids will automatically launch the video file, allowing further edits such as trimming the clip or incorporating music and text. 

This new shortcut, which is activated by default, suggests that the company is integrating the app more closely with Google's Workspace suite. Launched last year, Vids aims to streamline video production, including the ability to generate videos from basic text prompts, automatically craft scripts, rearrange video clips, add transitions, and more. 

This comes on the heels of the company introducing another Gemini AI feature for Workspace users in May, which allows them to use AI to summarize video files stored in Google Drive.

OpenAI is asking Meta to produce evidence related to any coordinated plans with Elon Musk and xAI to acquire or invest in the ChatGPT-maker.

The request was made public in a brief filed Thursday in Elon Musk's ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI. Lawyers representing OpenAI said they subpoenaed Meta in June for documents related to its potential involvement in Musk's unsolicited $97 billion bid to take over the startup in February. It's unclear from the filing whether such documents exist. OpenAI ultimately rejected Musk's bid.

OpenAI's lawyers said they discovered that Musk communicated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning xAI's bid to purchase the ChatGPT-maker, including “about potential financing arrangements or investments.”

Meta objected to OpenAI's initial subpoena in July; the ChatGPT-maker's lawyers are now seeking a court order to obtain such evidence. OpenAI is also asking the court for any of Meta's documents and communications related to “any actual or potential restructuring or recapitalization of OpenAI” — the core issue in Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed TechCrunch to a section of OpenAI's filing which states that neither Meta nor Zuckerberg signed Musk's letter of intent to acquire the ChatGPT-maker.

Meta declined to comment further. OpenAI and legal counsel for Musk did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

In the background of OpenAI's fight with Musk, Meta has significantly invested in its own efforts to develop frontier AI models. In 2023, Meta executives obsessed over developing an AI model that could beat OpenAI's GPT-4, court filings in another case revealed. By early 2025, Meta's AI models had fallen behind the industry standard, reportedly infuriating Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg has upped the pressure in recent months, poaching several of OpenAI's leading AI researchers, including Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT, who now leads research efforts at the company's newest AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta also invested $14 billion in Scale AI and reportedly approached several other AI labs about acquisition deals.

While it's unclear how far talks progressed between Musk and Zuckerberg, the mere idea of a partnership between the two billionaires represents just how much of a threat OpenAI poses. Two years ago, Musk said he would physically fight Zuckerberg in a cage match (though it never happened).

The rise of AI may have prompted Musk and Zuckerberg to set aside their differences.

The filing disclosed Thursday is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI that takes issue with OpenAI's conversion of its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Such a conversion is necessary for OpenAI to obtain funding from investors, and eventually go public. However, Musk — a cofounder and early investor in OpenAI — has attempted to throw a wrench in the endeavor, claiming that the restructuring goes against the startup's founding mission.

Lawyers representing Meta asked the court to reject OpenAI's request for evidence, arguing that Musk and xAI can provide any relevant information. Meta also argues that its internal discussions of OpenAI's restructuring and recapitalization are not relevant to the case.

This story has been updated to add more information about the case, as well as the history of Musk and Zuckerberg's relationship.

A former software developer has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his former employer's network after leaving the company.

Davis Lu, 55, was convicted of installing a “kill switch” on the network of his former employer by planting malicious code designed to crash its servers in the event that he was fired.

The kill switch was activated when the company terminated Lu's employment and deactivated his credentials, causing the kill switch, “IsDLEnabledinAD” — referring to whether Lu's account was still active in the company's Active Directory. The incident locked out thousands of employees from accessing the company's systems.

The Justice Department, which prosecuted the case, said Lu's employer, which was not named but reportedly was the power tech company Eaton, said the incident caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. 

Lu was discovered in part through his internet search history, the Justice Department said, which included searches researching “methods to escalate privileges, hide processes, and rapidly delete files.”

Hey YC! We're Jonathan and Jeffrey.

tl;dr We've built the best computer use foundation models in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGht355DYzY







Today's foundation models are great at generating text, but they can't reliably act. We're building foundation models that can use computers, using human behavior data rather than text. In two months, we've beaten OpenAI's GPT-5, o3, and Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet computer use at OSWorld, an industry standard computer-use benchmark.



Our model also has 16x lower latency to action at better performance and lower compute spend:



Examples of the model in action at https://inductionlabs.com/news/axiom-1!

Our ask

The field of computer use is still in its early days, and one of the biggest gaps is rigorous, real-world evaluation. We want to partner with teams building computer use agents to train models and create benchmarks that reflect real workflows, and we're willing to fund these efforts.

Reach out at founders@inductionlabs.com if you want to work with us to build the next benchmark for your use case!

The team

Jeffrey and Jonathan were the owners of Cohere's reinforcement learning infrastructure, unlocking RL for Cohere's reasoning models. They touched the entire training stack, improving long context performance, reasoning post-training, and model inference.

At 17, Jonathan joined Cohere as the youngest member of the modeling organization, where he was promoted two levels to a full-time role within his first six months. In high-school, he published machine learning research to top-tier NLP venues such as ACL and EMNLP. Jeffrey built reasoning models at Cohere for two years. His natural habitat is in mathematics research, where he worked on Lie Algebras at the University of Ottawa.

You know why we don't give everyone a full body MRI every year? Too many false positives, too many benign findings that result in unnecessary action, too expensive.This is the same. It's going to have errors, it's going to find benign things, and it's going to be expensive. It's going to hurt people who fundamentally did nothing wrong.If it's expensive and hurting innocent people, it sure looks like cruelty is the point.

Point is, the false positive concern is only a concern if you use the old model with the new corpus. Don't do that! That's dumb!The net effect of MRIing everyone on public health would likely be enormously positive as long as you don't do that.

With the MRI, you don't get back simple dichotomous things, but you get back potential indications. That can be scary - talk about calibration all you want, but if patients see things and start thinking about the big C word there are likely to be a lot of unnecessary biopsies.The bottom line is that it's possible to imagine a benefit, but it is not reasonable to pretend it's as simple as ""just re-calibrate your interpretation of the results!"". There's a reason that a lot of thought goes into when to do screening.

This just isn't true. In practice any such screening model can ALWAYS improve with more data—basically because the statistical power goes up and up—up to an asymptote set by noise in the physical process itself.> That can be scaryHandling that is the job of professionals, is now and will continue to be.It is extremely reasonable to imagine a benefit! What is doubtful is imagining  there wouldn't be one!I find the line of reasoning in this whole anti-MRI-everyone argument to be bewildering. I think it is basically an emotional argument, which has set in as ""established truth"" by repetition; people will trot it out by instinct whenever they encounter any situation that suggests it. It reflects lessons collectively learned from the history of medicine, its over-estimation of its own abilities and its overfitting to data, and its ever-increasing sensitivity to liability.But it is not inherently true—it is really a statement about poor statistical and policy practices in the field, which could be rectified with concerted effort, with a potential for great public upside.Not that any of this matters at the current price point. But, on a brief investigation, the amortized cost of a single MRI scan is ~$500-800—perhaps 1/5 what I would have guessed!

I have spent more than two and a half years filing forms and preparing paperwork for the U.S. government. I handled everything myself, without any “special” help or legal advice. I simply downloaded the forms from USCIS, filled them out using the required information, and submitted them.What I can tell you is this: there is a massive market in the United States built on gray-area schemes, semi-legal shortcuts, and so-called expert advice. For example, there are companies charging $30,000 to submit a form that costs only $745 to file. Many “helpers” sell visa “upgrades.” The idea is that you arrive on a tourist visa and then follow a specific sequence of steps to convert it into a green card - something packaged and sold as a premium service for an extraordinary price.This is a very large and lucrative slice of the pie that most people know little about. Both the U.S. visa process and tax filing system are riddled with gray practices and questionable “solutions.” Too often, the end result is that people are told to outright lie about their visa status or their taxes because they were instructed to do so.From what I have observed, I would not call these practices outright foolish. Overblown at times? Yes, perhaps. But unnecessary? Not really.

I'm sure you're confident about the ability of your citizens to hold up the nation without any help. I'm not going to argue. I admire all societies and cultures for their unique abilities and achievements. But you would be worried if you knew how much these 'guests' contributed to your nation's greatness across time and across every strata of your society. They built everything from your earliest railroads to your biggest rockets. They man your remotest farms to the top echelons of your administration. You'd be underestimating their importance to your welfare at your own peril.But forget the guests. I'm worried about you people too. Nations treat the visas they issue and even asylum requests with great respect. The guests are given almost all the protections as citizens - only the right to influence the governance is denied. But that situation has changed rapidly recently. Not only are the legal guests being abused, the treatment is gradually being extended to legal citizens, with the attempts to cancel birthright and naturalized citizenship. Two measures are extremely concerning - many of the deported immigrants had no criminal records anywhere. And citizens like the 4 year old cancer patient were deported by putting their immigrant parents in an impossible situation. At this rate, how long till they start applying it to citizens like you? Never forget what someone said about 'home growns'. Clearly, your conduct is not what defines your standing. Are you sure you're on the right side in this regime's eyes?I could taunt you for your confidence, which I wouldn't hold in the same situation. But I don't enjoy anyone's pain or misery. That pain and misery won't be as bad as what others had to suffer due to the cruelty of some of your leaders - like shell-shocked orphans wandering aimlessly in the streets or mothers wailing inconsolably over the graves of their toddler children. But pain is still pain. And I'm worried. Just prepare for whatever is coming and hunker down. No one's future is guaranteed, including mine. So, good luck for now. I hope to continue this conversation on the other side.

Flagging is there for stuff that's off-topic or generating low-quality discussion in the views of the people clicking the flag link. Sometimes the admins will step in to unflag the article if it looks like neither of these apply, and/or if it would be helpful to have a containment topic for discussion of a particularly popular contentious topic.

reply

Tautology isn't a useful reply to this question. At best it's a distraction, and at worst deflection. That people clicked the flagged link is already apparent by virtue of the post having been marked as flagged. That doesn't engage with why it was flagged.

reply

0. the link was clicked by users of the site. The admins claim not to have any influence; I'm sure they do (if they want), but they seem to often enough rescue discussions from the flagged set that we can assume the readership exercises significant influence and there's no shadowy cabal generally trying to suppress wrongthink, as some seem to suppose. (Of course, perhaps there are a lot of people in the readership that are, and maybe they collude, but that is true for everything, and a far less interesting point)1. if you want to know why the article was flagged, you will have to individually ask the people that flagged it.

My relatives didn't get a vote when I added my genetic profile to a crime-fighting database.

Last year, I added my DNA profile to a private genealogical database, FamilyTreeDNA, and clicked “Yes” to allow the police to search my genes.

In 2018, police in California announced they'd caught the Golden State Killer, a man who had eluded capture for decades. They did it by uploading crime-scene DNA to websites like the one I'd joined, where genealogy hobbyists share genetic profiles to find relatives and explore ancestry. Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.

There's a lot of genetic data out there. We're still figuring out how to use and protect it.

This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults. Still, while the technology is potent, it's incompletely realized. It operates via a mishmash of private labs and unregulated websites, like FamilyTree, which give users a choice to opt into or out of police searches. The number of profiles available for search by police hovers around 1.5 million, not yet enough to find matches in all cases.

To do my bit to increase those numbers, I traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts.

The staff of the local district attorney, Anthony D. Gulluni, was giving away free FamilyTree tests at a minor-league hockey game in an effort to widen its DNA net and help solve several cold-case murders. After glancing over a consent form, I spit into a tube and handed it back. According to the promotional material from Gulluni's office, I'd “become a hero.”

But I wasn't really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers. Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person's DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim.

Indeed, the only reason FIGG works is that relatives share DNA: You share about 50% with a parent, 25% with a grandparent, about 12.5% with a first cousin, and so on. When I got my FamilyTree report back, my DNA had “matched” with 3,309 people.

Some people are frightened by FIGG or reject its punitive aims. One European genealogist I know says her DNA is kept private because she opposes the death penalty and doesn't want to risk aiding US authorities in cases where lethal injection might be applied. But if enough people share their DNA, conscientious objectors won't matter. Scientists estimate that a database including 2% of the US population, or 6 million people, could identify the source of nearly any crime-scene DNA, given how many distant relatives each of us has.

Tech companies collect brain data that could be used to infer our thoughts—so it's vital we get legal protections right.

Scholars of big data have termed this phenomenon “tyranny of the minority.” One person's voluntary disclosure can end up exposing the same information about many others. And that tyranny can be abused.

DNA information held in private genealogy websites like FamilyTree is lightly guarded by terms of service. These agreements have flip-flopped over time; at one point all users were included in law enforcement searches by default. Rules are easily ignored, too. Recent court filings indicate that the FBI, in its zeal to solve crimes, sometimes barges past restrictions to look for matches in databases whose policies exclude police.

“Noble aims; no rules” is how one genetic genealogist described the overall situation in her field.

My uncertainty grew the more questions I asked. Who even controls my DNA file? That's not easy to find out. FamilyTree is a brand operated by another company, Gene by Gene, which in 2021 was sold to a third company, MyDNA—ultimately owned by an Australian mogul whose name appears nowhere on its website. When I reached FamilyTree's general manager, the genealogist Dave Vance, he told me that three-quarters of the profiles on the site were “opted in” to law enforcement searches.

One solution holds that the federal government should organize its own national DNA database for FIGG. But that would require new laws, new technical standards, and a debate about how our society wants to employ this type of big data—not just getting individual consent like mine. No such national project—or consensus—exists.

I'm still ready to join a national crime-fighting database, but I regret doing it the way I did—spitting in a tube on the sidelines of a hockey game and signing a consent form that affects not just me but all my thousands of genetic relatives. To them, I say: Whoops. Your DNA; my bad.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tesla Will Use a Powerful New Weapon in AI Race","https://gizmodo.com/tesla-deepseek-ai-2000646701","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:34:19 GMT","

Tesla will partner up with AI darlings DeepSeek and Bytedance's Doubao on new tools in its cars in China, according to a document uploaded to Tesla's official website.

Bloomberg reports that Doubao will work on voice command-related tools like the temperature in a Tesla, navigation, and in-car entertainment, while DeepSeek will handle the AI side of things.

The move may be a way for Tesla to boost its Chinese deliveries, which dropped 8.4% from December to June compared to the same time period last year.

DeepSeek is currently used in several Chinese Tesla rivals, including carmakers Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and YD Co.

Representatives from Tesla and Bytedance did not respond to requests for comment.

The scramble for Chinese buyers has meant that companies not based in the country, like BMW and Tesla, have had to find new ways to tempt drivers with more tech.

That has lead them to ink deals with local providers like DeepSeek and Alibaba, which has teamed up with BMW to offer its QWen large language model in cars. DeepSeek's most recent AI model has also had market watchers sit up and take notice.

“While many recognize DeepSeek's achievements, this represents just the beginning of China's AI innovation wave,” Louis Liang, an AI sector investor with Ameba Capital, told Bloomberg. “We are witnessing the advent of AI mass adoption, this goes beyond national competition.”

This may be good news for many AI enthusiasts who were wowed by DeepSeek's release of its V3.1 model earlier this week, a debut which showed a surprising amount of power and range from the Chinese company compared to Western competitors.

“Deepseek v3.1 scores 71.6% on aider—non-reasoning SOTA,” tweeted AI researcher Andrew Christianson at the time, adding that it is “1% more than Claude Opus 4 while being 68 times cheaper.” That speed matched performance levels previously reserved for the most expensive proprietary systems, lifting DeepSeek into a whole new level of prestige.

Tesla cars in the U.S. currently use an AI model created by xAI dubbed Grok. Bloomberg theorizes that rolling out Grok in China has hit some legal hurdles abroad, which are likely a speed bump for CEO Elon Musk's ambitions in the AI race.

Companies all over the world are currently racing to shrink their workforces and replace them with AI. Often, it seems, this isn't working out for the firms involved. Case in point: A bank in Australia recently did so, but then had to ask its workers to come back after it turned out that the chatbot that it had launched to replace them couldn't cut the mustard.

Last month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced that it would be laying off 45 customer service workers as it rolled out a new AI-powered ‘voice bot' that could supposedly do their job, Bloomberg reports. The bank claimed that the chatbot reduced the bank's call volume significantly. However, the workers' union got involved and says it has determined that wasn't the outcome.

Australia's Finance Sector Union, which represents workers in the banking industry, called BS on the bank's claims and engaged CBA in a workplace relations tribunal. Now, it appears that the bank has admitted it made a grievous mistake, telling Bloomberg that its initial assessment that the customer service reps were no longer needed “did not adequately consider all relevant business considerations and this error meant the roles were not redundant.”

“We have apologized to the employees concerned and acknowledge we should have been more thorough in our assessment of the roles required,” a bank spokesperson told the news outlet. The same spokesperson said that the fired workers were being offered several options, including continuing in their old positions. Gizmodo reached out to CBA for more information.

FSU put out a statement on Thursday, sharing details about the situation. “CBA last month announced the jobs would be made redundant due to the introduction of a new AI-powered ‘voice bot', which they claimed had led to a reduction in call volumes. Members told us this was an outright lie and did not reflect the reality of what was happening in Direct Banking,” FSU writes. “Call volumes were in fact increasing and CBA was scrambling to manage the situation by offering staff overtime and directing Team Leaders to answer calls.”

“Getting CBA to rescind these job cuts is a massive win – but the damage has already been done for our 45 colleagues who have had to endure the stress and worry of facing redundancy, some of whom have been with the bank for decades and were suddenly confronted with the prospect of being unable to pay their bills,” the union added.

While the particulars of this whole episode aren't readily available, it certainly seems like yet another example of a company putting the cart before the horse with AI. Ultimately, AI is still an experimental technology, and its results are hit or miss. A much-publicized MIT study recently claimed that 95 percent of AI pilot programs at companies have, so far, been failures. With numbers like that, companies would be wise to keep their headcount high for the time being.

Spawn of the Living Dead is shuffling forward with some new cast members. The third season of Percy Jackson has found its Olympian huntress. Plus, get a look at what's coming on Peacemaker. Spoilers, away!



During a recent interview with People, Kirsten Dunst jokingly pitched her participation in the upcoming sequel to Minecraft, adding, “maybe I can just make a movie where I don't lose money?“

According to Deadline, Casper Van Dien, Bill Moseley, Michael Berryman, Kane Hodder, and Trina Parks are attached to star in no less than two movies from director Ani Kyd Wolf, Spawn of the Living Dead and Organism 46-B: The Unseen. Based on a script by Night of the Living Dead‘s John A. Russo, Spawn is said to be set at the end of the “1968 zombie plague” and concern Dr. Harold Ormsby and his team “collecting zombie specimens” in hopes of “finding out what caused the plague and how it can be cured.” Meanwhile, Organism 46-B: The Unseen will concern a group of scientists “trapped beneath four kilometers of Antarctic ice” who accidentally awaken “an ancient predator, a shape-shifting horror who mimics its prey and controls the mind.”

Deadline also reports Victorian Psycho, starring Maika Monroe, Jason Isaacs, and Thomasin McKenzie, is scheduled to begin filming in Ireland next week for a planned nationwide theatrical release through Bleecker Street next year.

Tricia Helfer talks Vietnamese dinosaurs in a new clip from Primitive War, in theaters today.

A ten-year-old time traveler from 3,000 years in the future visits 2075 via rainbow in the trailer for Arco, starring the voices of Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame), Natalie Portman, Mark Ruffalo, and Andy Samberg.

 

TV Line also reports Dafne Keen and Saara Chaudry have joined the third season of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Keen will play Artemis, the Greek goddess of the moon and the hunt, while Chaudry has been cast as the “immortal hunter” Zoë Nightshade, “who serves as Artemis' lieutenant.”

Finally, HBO Max has released a new “this season on…” trailer for Peacemaker season two.

Fans of stealth video games likely have a soft spot in their hearts for Splinter Cell. Ubisoft's sub-series of stealth-action games endorsed by Tom Clancy has been MIA for over a decade, even with a remake of the original game on the horizon. After doing guest roles in other Clancy games and in Netflix's Far Cry anime, series lead Sam Fisher is back in all his shadowy glory in Splinter Cell: Deathwatch.

Developed by John Wick alum Derek Kolstad, the animated series sees Fisher—voiced by Liev Schreiber rather than longtime game actor Michael Ironside—as a field commander for the covert Fourth Echelon unit. Like in the games, Sam is assigned to stop a threat to global security: in this case, the mission is “personal.”

Splinter Cell: Deathwatch deploys on Netflix October 14.

Forks have been made, making it hard for AMD to do much about it.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has commented on the leak of its FSR 4 source code along with the release of its new FidelitySDK earlier this week, confirming that it was indeed accidental. It has since pulled the files down from the GPUOpen Github, but that may not matter. When they were originally released, it was under the MIT license, effectively allowing anyone who downloaded them to use, copy, or modify them as they wish. Taking the files down doesn't change the license, it merely prevents others from downloading the files.

On August 20 AMD updated its FidelitySDK on Github, adding support for FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5 frame generation. This is the toolset used by game developers to add FSR upscaling and other related technologies to their games. AMD also plans to use this as the base for future machine learning neural rendering technologies, including FSR Redstone.

But alongside the SDK update, AMD also accidentally released the source code for FSR 4, exposing all of its techniques to the entire Github community.

This was confirmed by Chips and Cheese editor System360Cheese on X.

So, I just got an update from @AMD and @GPUOpen about the FSR4 situation that occurred yesterday (8/20/25) with FSR4's Github repo debacle...AMD's Official Statement:Some of our development code was posted on GPUOpen GitHub in error. It has since been taken down.August 21, 2025

Although AMD swiftly deleted the files when it realised the error, it was far too late to undo the damage. VideoCardz and various Github members grabbed screenshots of the files, and other members made forks of their own, essentially securing those files as publicly available in perpetuity. Since those files were released under the permissive MIT license, too, there's not much AMD can do to pressure anyone to take them down.

This is quite a problem for AMD, which made the decision to keep FSR 4 proprietary and internal. This marked a stark change from previous versions of FSR, which were all released under an open source license. While FSR 4 wasn't, that doesn't really matter now, because it's publicly available anyway.

Although AMD's upscaling solutions are not quite as impressive as Nvidia's, and therefore this is unlikely to give its competition any real leg up, it's still not good for AMD which may have been keeping some parts of how its system works secret. Indeed, analysis of the files has revealed AMD was working on a version of FSR 4 that could have worked with RDNA3 GPUs, opening them up for frame generation and the more advanced algorithm that AMD uses in its latest upscaler. Unfortunately, the project hasn't been completed and it's not clear how far along AMD was with it before this accidental release.

Reports claim that Nvidia's AI chip for China is ending

Following a turbulent summer that saw sales of Nvidia's China-only HGX H20 AI chip banned and then unbanned in China, the AI GPU now faces an uncertain future. A new report suggests that Nvidia is abruptly stopping production of the HGX H20, which Nvidia has responded to in a statement provided to Tom's Hardware. This comes soon after reports earlier this week that Nvidia is preparing a successor to the chip, the Blackwell Ultra-based B30A.

A report from The Information claims that Nvidia has asked suppliers to wind down production of H20-related work. According to the report, Nvidia sent these communications to Amkor Technology, which handles packaging for the H20, and Samsung Electronics, which provides the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) for the AI chip. This could potentially signal that production of the H20 is winding down, but that leaves the door open to more questions.

When quizzed on whether or not the H20 would remain in production, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware, ""We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions"". While this isn't an exact response to our question about whether or not the H20 is still in production, it implies that some degree of the communications from Nvidia to Amkor and Samsung do indeed hold some weight.



Nvidia also insists that the H20 is not a political tool or has security backdoors, with a spokesperson for the company stating, ""As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure"". Cybersecurity was also on the mind, with Nvidia once again insisting that the H20 has no security backdoors, despite the CAC's claims: ""NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them. The market can use the H20 with confidence.""

This is a sentiment echoed by CEO Jensen Huang, who spoke to journalists in Taipei, Taiwan: ""We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors, there are no such things, there never has, and so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient"".

In between rumors of the H20 seemingly winding down production, and the perceived highlighted risk of security backdoors, another factor has emerged: A potential successor to the H20 itself, a new high-powered chip, specifically for China.

Earlier this week, reports emerged that the company was working on a de facto successor to the H20, which will comply with existing export control rules, and could be sold on the Chinese market. The Blackwell Ultra-based B30A is a substantially more powerful chip than the H20, which beats the full-fat H100 in many ways, but remains significantly slower than the B300. Samples are expected to land in September. But the product has yet to be greenlit by the U.S. Government. The earliest that commercial units could be shipped would be by the end of 2025, to early 2026.

Huang further stressed: ""Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow-on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government, and we're in dialogue with them, but it's too soon to know"".

Nvidia is caught between two global superpowers: The U.S. Government and the People's Republic of China. It's an unenviable situation, with complex factors at play, including the race to develop the most advanced AI models and local fabrication. China is making moves to reduce reliance on U.S. hardware with a new strategic alliance to reduce fragmentation, and the open-sourcing of CANN, in a bid to reduce reliance on Nvidia's CUDA.

Nvidia's HGX H20 has long been a point of contention for the company, the U.S. Government, and the People's Republic of China. As the H20 is commonly used to develop AI applications in China, Nvidia's chips are likely being used for training leading AI models, such as DeepSeek R2.

The HGX H20 itself is a significantly scaled-down version of Nvidia's H100 GPU, which is approximately 3.3 to 6.6 times faster than the H20. China has access to rapid hardware, such as Huawei's rack-scale CloudMatrix 384, but a reliance on Nvidia's CUDA-shaped moat has thrown a wrench into China's AI aspirations.

Despite attempts to switch to Huawei platforms for training the new DeepSeek R2 model, the company has reportedly now switched back to using Nvidia hardware instead, highlighting the strategic importance of high-powered AI hardware. However, in April 2025, sales of the H20 to China were banned, causing Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory.

This decision was later reversed in mid-July 2025. China's access to Nvidia's H20 chips was no longer hampered. With the floodgates opened, the inventory of existing H20 stock quickly became limited. So, Nvidia reportedly put in an order for 300,000 AI GPUs with TSMC in late July. This deal is believed to be worth around $3.9 billion, if each H20 GPU is valued between $12,000 - $14,000 per unit (via Reuters).

Then, the U.S. wanted a slice of the pie, with the government requesting that 15% of each GPU sold to China be diverted into federal coffers. Days later, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) asked major companies to pause new H20 purchases, as it investigated potential security risks, a claim which Nvidia has since rebuffed.

Whether China's efforts will be successful remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear. The demand for high-powered chips remains strong, but whether or not Nvidia will be able to provide them for Chinese customers is a question only the U.S. Government can answer.

An RTX 5090 blower that didn't come out of a shady Chinese factory


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The GeForce RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards for gamers, is also a desirable option for AI applications. Graphics card manufacturer AFOX (via VideoCardz) has launched the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional, which is currently selling for $5,999 at a U.S. retailer.

AFOX is well-versed in producing blower-style graphics cards. The vendor has been manufacturing them since the era of the GTX 10-series (codenamed Pascal) and continued through the hard-knock times of the GeForce RTX 30-series (Ampere), during which Nvidia reportedly discouraged partners from releasing RTX 3090 blower-type graphics cards. AFOX has been around since 2008; however, it doesn't appear to be an official Nvidia AIB partner, so perhaps that's why the vendor is exempt from Team Green's rules.

We are currently uncertain regarding Nvidia's position on GeForce RTX 5090 blower-type graphics cards. Since no official models have been announced from Nvidia's partners, we suspect that the chipmaker has not reconsidered its stance on this matter. Nonetheless, overseas Chinese factories have been transplanting GeForce RTX 5090 silicon and memory chips into blower-style enclosures ready for AI servers.

The GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional from AFOX features a blower-style cooler and a dual-slot design, making it ideal for multi-GPU configurations. This is the perfect form factor for users who want to use up to four of these graphics cards on a HEDT or workstation-grade motherboard.

The graphics card operates with a 2,017 MHz base clock and 2,407 MHz boost clock; therefore, it performs exactly like a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition. It still utilizes the 16-pin (12VHPWR) power connector. Still, instead of being positioned in the middle of the shroud, AFOX relocated it to the rear, similar to how you would find the connector on a professional graphics card.

To say the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional (AF5090-32GD7H4-6344) costs an arm and a leg is an understatement. HydraCluster Tech, currently the only store that sells the graphics card, has it listed for $5,999, allegedly marked down from the regular price of $6,500. Even in our current sad reality, where MSRP has become a distant memory, you can still acquire two GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards and have leftover funds for a complete build, all for the price of the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional.

With the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional, you can say that it's from an established brand, as opposed to getting one from a clandestine factory in China. Then again, AFOX's factory is most likely situated in China, too, so the point of origin is any different. But there is the aspect of the warranty, which you get from AFOX. But we haven't purchased any GeForce RTX 5090 blower graphics cards from China lately, so who is to say that the Chinese factories aren't offering similar guarantees?

 August 22, 2025  

Despite more treatments and heightened awareness, Americans with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report worsening impacts on work, home, and social life compared with a decade ago. 

A new survey from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), in partnership with The Harris Poll, revealed that IBS symptoms interfere with people's lives an average of 19 days each month — about 11 days affecting work or school and 8 days curtailing personal activities. 

Missed work or school has climbed to 3.6 days per month from 2.1 days in 2015 — the last time the AGA released the “IBS in America” survey. And more patients report spending less time with family and friends because of their symptoms (58% now, up from 48% in 2015). 

The latest survey was conducted in fall 2024 among more than 2000 patients with IBS and 600 healthcare providers, including gastroenterologists, primary care physicians, and advanced practitioners.

Fewer patients in 2024 described their IBS symptoms as very or extremely bothersome (43%, compared to 62% in 2015), yet three quarters said it's tough to manage their symptoms and most can't accurately predict whether they will experience symptoms on a given day.

All this affects patients' willingness or ability to make plans. More than three quarters (77%) said they avoid situations where bathroom access is limited, and nearly that many (72%) said their symptoms cause them to stay home more often.

About 7 in 10 patients said their IBS symptoms make them feel like they're not “normal” or that their symptoms prevent them from reaching their full potential.

“The findings of this survey underscore the persistent challenges and impact IBS has on patients' lives,” Andrea Shin, MD, gastroenterologist with UCLA Health, Los Angeles, and AGA patient education advisor, said in a statement. 

“Despite progress in the medical community's approach to diagnosing and managing IBS, patients continue to suffer significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives,” Shin noted. 

Treatment options for IBS have evolved over the last decade or so and now include several FDA-approved agents, such as plecanatide (Trulance) and tenapanor (Ibsrela) for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and rifaximin (Xifaxan) and eluxadoline (Viberzi) for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D).

According to patients who have tried them, prescription medications are among the most helpful treatments (18% for IBS-C and 19% for IBS-D).

Yet, clinicians tend to prioritize fiber, nonprescription laxatives, and exercise for IBS-C, and diet changes, antidiarrheals, and probiotics for IBS-D, over prescription medications, the survey found. 

Nonetheless, about 78% of patients reported being satisfied with what they take for their symptoms, with about one quarter very satisfied.

Compared to 10 years ago, more physicians in the latest survey said effective relief of abdominal pain (49% vs 39%) or diarrhea/constipation (47% vs 33%) and the availability of treatment options (49% vs 34%) are what is most lacking in IBS treatment today, despite advancements in the IBS treatment landscape.

“IBS is a condition that continues to challenge patients to find a treatment that consistently works for them,” Jeffrey Roberts, founder of the IBS Patient Support Group community and World IBS Day, said in the release.

“The AGA IBS in America Survey sheds light on patients who are still not being offered a variety of treatments that could provide them with a better quality of life. This continues to result in disruptions to their career, schooling, and life with their families and friends,” Roberts added.

 August 22, 2025  

New guidance on preventing cardiovascular (CV) and renal complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D) emphasizes tailoring therapy to a patient's individual risk profile.

The living guidelines, published as part of the BMJ's “Rapid Recommendations” initiative, include a strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) in patients at high risk for CV or kidney complications but recommend against their routine use in lower-risk patients with a preference for treatments based on each individual's specific needs.

“These risk-stratified recommendations provide personalized medicine and represent the first international living guidelines on this topic, meaning they will be dynamically updated, and therefore continue to be relevant for all doctors in the world,” senior author Per Olav Vandvik, MD, PhD, of the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation and the Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo's Faculty of Medicine, Oslo, Norway, told Medscape Medical News.

With T2D significantly associated with multiorgan morbidity and representing the ninth leading cause of death, preventing CV and kidney complications is a high priority.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs, along with finerenone, a nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid RA, and tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 RA, have transformed the management of T2D in recent years.

However, with evidence rapidly advancing regarding which drugs or drug combinations are most effective for the prevention of complications in specific patient types, the need for living guidelines to continuously provide updates on emerging evidence was deemed necessary.

The guideline, created by an international panel of clinicians, methodologists, and two patient partners, is based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis of evidence from nearly half a million adults with T2D across 869 randomized controlled trials, involving 63 medications and 26 outcomes.

In assessing the data to determine the benefits of the four key medications for adults with T2D based on their risk level for CV and kidney-related complications, the panel concluded that:

For patients at higher risk, defined as having established CV disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) with high risk for complications, or established heart failure, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs for treatment is strongly recommended, with a weak recommendation in favor of the use of finerenone in adults with CKD.

“The cardiovascular and kidney benefits of GLP-1s are independent of significant reductions in weight,” Vandvik noted. “These benefits are more or less equal to those of SGLT2 inhibitors, meaning that patients at moderate to highest risk should be offered one of these drugs for cardiorenal protection,” he said.

For those at lower risk, defined as having three or fewer CV risk factors without established CVD or CKD, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs.

“[In low-risk patients], the benefits are not considered to outweigh the harms and burdens of the drugs,” Vandvik said. “Experts did not find drugs clinically effective [in those patients], and they will also represent a waste of precious health resources for patients and society.”

With the soaring popularity of the newer drugs, particularly GLP-1s, the key issue of the level of risk for complications is often overlooked in real-world prescribing, Vandvik noted.

“To our knowledge, there is both undertreatment, ie, not ensuring all those patients at highest risk get the right drug, and overtreatment, ie, offering the drugs to those with the lowest risk, potentially [leading to] more harms and burden than benefits,” he said.

Newer drugs, meanwhile, come with the caveat of having less robust evidence on safety and efficacy.

For instance, with a lack of evidence of benefits with finerenone, as well as notable potential harms, including hyperkalemia, the drug was recommended only among the highest-risk patients with CKD.

And regarding tirzepatide, although the drug had consistently been shown to provide greater weight loss than GLP-1 RAs, the authors suggest consideration of the stronger evidence of CV and kidney benefits with GLP-1 RAs.

The guidelines feature MATCH-IT, “an interactive decision support tool that allows further visualization of the comparative benefits and harms across therapeutics to support shared decision-making,” according to the authors. Details on the guideline's recommendations and evidence base are available for download in the MAGIC app.

The goal of the tools is to “empower patients and allow them to take an active part in shared decisions about what drug is best for them,” Vandvik said.

In a related editorial, Aikaterini Theodoraki, MD, consultant/physician in endocrinology and diabetes with the Chelsea and Westminster National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, England, noted that the recommendations expand on existing guidelines with “a pragmatic approach.”

“Given the wide variation in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes among individuals with diabetes, risk stratification is essential in guiding therapy in modern diabetes care,” Theodoraki said.

However, due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the optimal glycemic targets needed to balance risks and benefits, poor glycemic control remains a key cause of complications. 

“Therefore, managing glycemia in parallel with cardiovascular and renal risk factors remains essential, particularly for complications less affected by newer therapies,” he stated.

“Overall, the new recommendations may be most applicable to patients with HbA1c [glycated hemoglobin] values between 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and 8% (64 mmol/mol), in line with the evidence base supporting these guideline interventions,” Theodoraki wrote.

Further commenting on the research, Jaime Almandoz, MD, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program and associate professor of internal medicine in the Division of Endocrinology at the Internal Medicine Subspecialties Clinic, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, underscored that the study's risk-stratified approach “complements guidance from the American Diabetes Association, European Society of Cardiology, and KDIGO [Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes] by providing clearer gradations of risk rather than broad categories.”

“Importantly, it prioritizes prevention of cardiovascular and renal complications beyond glucose control alone, reflecting the growing evidence that targeting outcomes beyond HbA1c improves survival and quality of life for people with type 2 diabetes,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“For lower-risk patients, modest benefits may not outweigh the current cost or potential adverse effects,” Almandoz said. “These guidelines highlight the need to match therapy intensity to risk so that those most likely to benefit are prioritized.”

The guideline authors underscore that considerations of cost-effectiveness are inevitable factors, with the costs of some of the drugs being prohibitive, and Almandoz agreed.

“Most importantly, cost and access remain major barriers worldwide, and the guideline appropriately acknowledges that implementation will look very different depending on the health system context,” he said.

Vandvik, the other authors of the recommendations, and Theodoraki reported having no disclosures. Almandoz reported serving on advisory boards and receiving consulting fees from AbbVie, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly and Company, Haleon, Kailera Therapeutics, Metsera Inc., Novo Nordisk, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, and Rivus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

New evidence counters the conventional wisdom that limb amputation leads to reorganization of the map the brain uses to track the body's location. When researchers compared three patients before and after hand amputation, they found the somatosensory cortex remained largely the same.

These findings point to new approaches to the management of phantom limb pain, a debilitating condition with a lifetime prevalence of 76%-87% after amputation.

Rather than relying on common rehabilitation strategies like mirror box therapy, virtual reality, or graded motor imagery, reconnecting severed nerves to muscle or other tissues may reduce the risk for phantom pain. These findings could also inform the redesign of brain-computer interfaces.

“The take-home is that the brain's body map remains highly preserved after amputation,” lead study author Hunter Schone, PhD, postdoctoral associate in the Rehab Neural Engineering Labs at the University of Pittsburgh, told Medscape Medical News. “Our results show…the sensory map is maintained, with no evidence for reorganization.”

The study was published online on August 21 in Nature Neuroscience.

The current research also counters a long-standing belief that cortical maps are competitive. Traditional thinking is that when one input disappears, neighboring inputs expand to take over the area changed through amputation. He and colleagues refuted this by tracking input from the lips, which did not take over the parts of the brain map that normally track the hand and fingers.

Unlike previous cross-sectional studies, the researchers in this study scanned the same patients both before and after planned amputations. This design allowed testing this competitive belief directly for the first time, added Schone, who is also affiliated with the National Institutes of Health's Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, England.

“Across multiple analyses, we saw no evidence of takeover,” Schone said. “These findings call for a critical rethinking of phantom limb pain treatments, shifting focus downstream, toward peripheral nerves and the spinal cord.” The investigators assessed the three adults before and 6 months after hand amputation. The procedure was indicated because of a rapidly developing arteriovenous malformation in the upper arm of one patient, to remove a slow-growing sarcoma tumor in a second, and because of multiple bone fractures in an arm resulting from Servelle-Martorell syndrome in the third participant.

A control group of 16 able-bodied individuals was included in the study. An additional cross-sectional analysis involved amputees and controls from three previous studies.

Participants completed functional neuroimaging tests, including finger motor control, kinesthetic vividness, and a functional index, as well as pain rating scales. Specific tasks included visually cued finger tapping, lip pursing, and toe flexing during scanning. Researchers created contrast maps for attempted vs phantom hand movements, for hand and lip movements, and for finger selectivity.

The results showed “strikingly consistent hand and lip cortical maps” before and following surgery, the researchers noted.

The hand and individual finger activity in the somatosensory cortex remained stable. Phantom activity was similar in amplitude and spatial activity spread before surgery.

“We were struck by the remarkable stability of the hand map, even after years without the hand's rich sensory input to the brain,” Schone said. The hand map did not fade over time. Instead, it retained such precision that a machine learning decoder trained on pre-amputation finger movements reliably decoded phantom finger movements years later.

“This degree of selectivity after such a dramatic loss of input was unexpected,” Schone added.

The investigators also compared their case studies with a group of 26 chronic upper-limb amputees an average of 23.5 years after surgery. The authors noted that the similar findings suggest hand and lip representations remain stable over the long term, even after amputation.

Schone and colleagues plan to investigate why the brain maintains these maps in the absence of the sensory input. This persistence suggests that the somatosensory cortex is more than a passive relay of signals from the periphery, Schone said.

The researchers also plan to use these findings to develop next-generation brain-computer interfaces. The goal is to take advantage of these preserved maps to restore movement and sensation for people with amputations or spinal cord injuries.

“Because the adult brain maintains these sensory-deprived representations, they can serve as a stable foundation for clinical translation of these technologies,” Schone added.

The study was independently supported. Schone reported having no relevant financial relationships.

In a phase 3 trial, toripalimab-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy without concurrent cisplatin achieved noninferior 3-year failure-free survival compared with standard therapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The less intense treatment regimen also led to fewer incidences of vomiting, supporting the feasibility of omitting concurrent cisplatin.

“Toripalimab combination therapy without concurrent cisplatin resulted in noninferior 3-year failure-free survival and improved safety in vomiting, along with a favorable QOL tolerability profile in patients with locoregionally advanced [nasopharyngeal carcinoma],"" the authors concluded.

The study, led by Cheng Xu, MD, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diagnosis and Therapy, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Guangzhou, China, was published online in JAMA.

The findings may not be generalizable to nonendemic populations, as only a few participants were from nonendemic provinces. The study lacked objective long-term toxicity assessments, such as hearing tests and neurologic examinations. Additionally, the open-label design could have introduced reporting bias.

The study received support through grants from multiple organizations, including the Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases-National Science and Technology Major Project, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation, and others. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Dr Rob Hicks

 August 22, 2025  

The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) has urged mental health employers in England to adopt 15 measures to reduce disability discrimination in the NHS workforce.

NHS England data show that staff with disabilities are twice as likely to report discrimination from a colleague or manager compared with their nondisabled peers —12.2% vs 5.8%.

The College said that almost a quarter of employers still fail to provide consistent adjustments for staff with disabilities, highlighting a gap between legislation and practice.

Its new campaign, Delivering for Disability, is supported by new guidance, Providing Reasonable Adjustments — Essential Guidance for Mental Health Employers. The initiative is designed to empower NHS services to offer practical support for staff with disabilities and long-term health conditions. 

The guidance “bridges the gap between policy and lived experience” to enable all staff to thrive, said the college.

More than 52,000 NHS staff (3.7%) declared a disability through the NHS Electronic Staff Record in 2021, an increase of 6870compared with 2020.

“Disability discrimination comes at an immense cost to individuals, teams, and ultimately impacts our ability to retain experienced professionals and thereby look after patients,” said RCPsych president Dr Lade Smith.

The guidance sets out 15 recommendations covering four key areas for mental health employers to implement. These include developing a co-produced disability workforce strategy and implementation plan, providing an independent and confidential point of contact for staff to raise concerns, ensuring leaders and managers are aware of reasonable adjustments and mitigations and providing reasonable adjustments within a defined, agreed timeframe.

Smith said that reasonable adjustments help staff feel valued, reduce sickness absence, improve retention, and strengthen teamwork. Examples include safe access to buildings, reduced or compressed hours, exemption from on-call duties, and additional breaks to manage health conditions or sensory needs.

Work is underway across NHS services in all four UK nations to tackle disability discrimination, but a unified framework is needed to accelerate progress, the college noted.

“Tackling the barriers that interfere with people with disabilities being able to give their best at work is imperative to improving productivity,” said Smith.

Rob Hicks is a retired National Health Service doctor. A well-known TV and radio broadcaster, he has written several books and has regularly contributed to national newspapers, magazines, and online publications. He is based in the United Kingdom.

In symptomatic patients undergoing MRI of the hand or wrist, about 23% of scans had one or more incidental anomalies, and only about 3% overall needed further workup, a study found. The risk for incidentalomas was lower than that in solid organs, increased with patient age and trainee reporting, but decreased when intravenous contrast was used.

""The risk of incidentalomas and incidental findings in MRI of the hand and wrist is lower than solid organs. Our data may be used to inform patients about the risks of imaging and allow health services to plan the capacity and capability to deal with such events,"" the authors wrote.

""The current guidance on the management of incidental findings is limited and inconsistent,"" they added. ""More robust clinical frameworks on the management of incidental findings, coupled with increased education for clinicians to improve the consenting process would prove beneficial for patient care,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Megan A. Beese, MBChB, and Prasant Gurung, MBChB, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, England. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in the British Journal of Radiology.

This study was conducted at a single UK tertiary trauma centre and included only symptomatic patients, so its findings may not be generalisable to other settings or healthier populations. Its retrospective design relied on verbatim data extractionfrom radiology reports, which may have introduced inconsistencies. The use of ""further imaging"" as an indication carried ambiguity, which may have masked true incidentalfindings. Additionally, time‐confounding factors, such as an ageing population and the number of trainees reporting, were not formally modelled.

No relevant funding information was provided for the study. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Patients who initiated the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) antiretroviral regimen during acute HIV infection had greater increases in BMI, systolic blood pressure, and cholesterol levels than those who initiated efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC), over nearly 2 years of follow-up.

“Clinicians should remain vigilant about long-term body weight and blood cholesterol changes following ART [antiretroviral therapy] initiation, especially in those with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Phillip Chan, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. It was published online on July 30, 2025, in HIV Medicine.

These study findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as women and older adults with HIV infection. The analysis excluded patients who were intolerant to EFV or DTG as well as those who switched from EFV/TDF/FTC to DTG/ABC/3TC before completing 96 weeks. Fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels and the occurrence of metabolic syndrome were not assessed.

This study was supported by the Henry M.

Long-term results from a phase 3 study showed that adding a focal boost to standard external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) improved 10-year biochemical disease-free survival (DFS) and reduced biochemical failures by more than 50% in patients with localized intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. The approach also significantly improved DFS, local DFS, and nodal DFS but not overall survival or distant metastasis-free survival. 

The 10-year results demonstrated the “sustained benefit of focal boosting for patients with intermediate- and high-risk [prostate cancer] on their [biochemical disease-free survival],” the authors wrote. Moreover, “in comparison with other therapy options (eg, hormonal therapy, brachytherapy), there is no additional treatment-related toxicity, but 15% more men can be spared the potential burden of [prostate cancer] recurrence.”

The study, led by Karolina Menne Guricova, MSc, the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was published online in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

The study was underpowered to detect differences in additional outcomes. Imaging standards and contouring guidelines evolved during the study, leading to heterogeneity in focal boost dose delivery.

The study received funding support through grants from the Dutch Cancer Society. Some authors reported receiving honoraria or research funding from and having other ties with various sources. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

DISCLOSURES August 22, 2025  

SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked with early vascular aging in the long term, especially in women, according to a recent study in the European Heart Journal.

In the multicenter CARTESIAN study, researchers found all individuals with COVID, including those with mild cases, had stiffer arteries, as shown by increased carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, than did those who had not been infected, according to Rosa Maria Bruno, MD, PhD, professor at Paris Cardiovascular Research Centre-PARCC, Paris, France, who led the study.

“You are as old as your arteries, meaning that your blood vessels can be older than your chronological age,” increasing the risk for heart disease, Bruno said.

For the study, Bruno and colleagues categorized 2390 individuals (mean age, 50 years; 49.2% women) from 16 countries into four groups: those who never had COVID, those who had recent COVID but were not hospitalized, those hospitalized for COVID in a general ward, and those hospitalized for COVID in an ICU. They assessed pulse wave velocity, which served as the main outcome, at 6 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data showed pulse wave velocity was 0.41 m/s higher for those with COVID who were not hospitalized, 0.37 m/s higher for those with COVID who were hospitalized in general wards, and 0.4 m/s higher for those with COVID who were hospitalized in ICUs.

The average increase in pulse wave velocity in women who had mild COVID was 0.55 m/s, 0.60 m/s in women hospitalized with COVID, and 1.09 m/s for women treated in the ICU, according to Bruno.

“The effect was much greater in women than in men and in people who experienced the persistent symptoms of long COVID, such as shortness of breath and fatigue,” she said. “This is clinically relevant since it is equivalent to aging around 5 years, with a 3% increased risk for cardiovascular disease in a 60-year-old woman.”

The researchers found ongoing symptoms of infection were associated with higher pulse wave velocity among women with COVID, regardless of disease severity or cardiovascular confounders, such as age, BMI, and smoking.

After 12 months, pulse wave velocity increased in individuals who did not have COVID but remained unchanged or improved in those who recovered from COVID.

Small sample sizes, lack of stratification by disease severity, and lack of sex-specific data hampered previous studies on the association between pulse wave velocity and COVID, according to the authors of an editorial accompanying the journal article.

“Importantly, the [CARTESIAN] study population was not restricted to individuals who met formal criteria for postacute COVID-19 syndrome and therefore included both asymptomatic and symptomatic survivors,” they wrote.

The study underscores the importance of sex in the understanding of vascular biology and response to various diseases, in this case postacute COVID, according to Behnood Bikdeli, MD, MS, of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and an author of the editorial.

“Clinicians and patients should remain cognizant not only in addressing short-term complications, such as pneumonia or acute blood clots, but also long-term consequences, as assessed by markers of vascular change, such as aging,” he told Medscape Medical News. “A somewhat reassuring finding is that some features of vascular abnormalities were partially reversible over time. This differs from the traditional assessment of vascular aging.”

Clinicians can identify people with accelerated vascular aging and can help them reduce the risk for heart attacks and strokes in the long term, according to Bruno.

“Vascular aging is easy to measure and can be stopped with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, lowering blood pressure, and taking cholesterol-lowering drugs,” she said.

In his Substack, Ground Truths, Eric Topol, MD, chair of the Department of Translational Medicine at Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, noted the risk for long COVID is greatly increased in women. Having two copies of the X chromosome, as well as hormonal factors, such as estrogen and progesterone, has been associated with the immune system and propensity to inflammation, which may explain this increased risk, according to Topol.

“About 80% of autoimmune diseases occur in women,” Topol wrote. “It is possible that there's more propensity for endothelial inflammation after COVID in women compared with men, which sets up more chance of stiffness, fibrosis, and features of early vascular aging. Another factor acknowledged by the authors [of the study] is that there is less survivorship among men, a bias that could have contributed to the marked difference by sex.”

Bruno reported honoraria for lectures or advisory board service (unrelated to the topic) from Medtronic, Servier, LXO, and El Kendi Pharmaceutical. Bikdeli reported having no financial conflicts of interest relevant to this study.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 17, 2025, titled ""The influence of cancer on a forensic age estimation tool.""

In this study by Charlotte Sutter, Daniel Helbling, Cordula Haas, and Jacqueline Neubauer from the Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich, and Onkozentrum Zurich, the researchers investigated how cancer might affect the accuracy of forensic tools used to estimate a person's age from blood samples.

DNA methylation is a natural chemical modification of DNA that changes with age. Forensic scientists can use these changes to predict someone's age from biological traces, such as blood found at a crime scene. However, medical conditions like cancer can alter these patterns and potentially reduce the accuracy of such predictions. This study investigated whether various cancer types influence the DNA markers used in age estimation.

The researcher stated, ""Our study is among the first to show whether it might be necessary to account for the influence of cancer on forensic age estimation tools in order to enhance estimation accuracy as much as possible.""

The researchers applied the VISAGE enhanced age estimation tool, a widely used DNA methylation-based method, to blood samples from 100 cancer patients and 102 healthy individuals. Age predictions in the control group were generally accurate, with small average errors.

Patients with solid tumors, including breast and lung cancers, showed only slightly less accurate results. In contrast, individuals with blood cancers, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), sometimes had large errors, with ages overestimated by as much as 50 years. 

Despite these few extreme cases, the study found that cancer does not typically have a strong impact on the accuracy of this forensic tool. Most cancer patients, even those undergoing treatment, had DNA methylation patterns similar to those of healthy individuals. The researchers found no consistent differences based on cancer type, stage, or treatment, except in isolated cases involving aggressive forms of cancer.

The findings support the continued use of current forensic age estimation methods. While aggressive cancers may occasionally affect prediction accuracy, such cases are rare. The researchers suggest noting these conditions as a possible factor in unusually large errors, without requiring changes to standard practice.

This study provides valuable information about how health conditions, such as cancer, may influence DNA-based age estimation. It strengthens confidence in the reliability of forensic age prediction tools, even when applied to individuals with a medical history of cancer.

Did you know the same protein that gives blood its red color and carries oxygen throughout the body is also present inside brain cells? Hemoglobin, long celebrated for ferrying oxygen in red blood cells, has now been revealed to play an overlooked - and potentially game-changing - antioxidant role in the brain.

In neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and aging, brain cells endure relentless damage from the aberrant (or excessive) reactive oxygen species (ROS). For decades, scientists have tried to neutralize ROS with antioxidant drugs, but most failed: they couldn't penetrate the brain effectively, unstable, or indiscriminately damaged healthy cells.

This new study, led by Director C. Justin LEE of the Center for Cognition and Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon, South Korea, set out to identify the brain's own defenses against a particularly harmful form of ROS - hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Using advanced imaging and molecular analysis, the team discovered that hemoglobin exists in the nucleolus of astrocytes - star-shaped brain cells critical for neuronal support - where it acts as a ""pseudoperoxidase,"" breaking down H₂O₂ into harmless water.

The key was to uncover hemoglobin's antioxidant potential in the brain and design a 'first-in-class' compound that could selectively enhance it. By boosting a natural defense mechanism rather than introducing an external antioxidant, we achieved strong and lasting protection across multiple disease models associated with oxidative stress.""

Dr. Won Woojin, first author 

The team developed KDS12025, a small, water-soluble molecule capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier. KDS12025 binds to hemoglobin's heme center and boosts its ability to decompose H2O2 by nearly 100-fold, without disrupting its normal oxygen-carrying function. In disease-like conditions in astrocytes, KDS12025 sharply reduced harmful H2O2 levels. In mouse models, oral administration through drinking water protected neurons, calmed reactive astrocytes, and restored brain function.

In animal models, oral administration through drinking water suppressed neuronal death, normalized reactive astrocytes, and restored brain function. ALS model mice showed a delayed disease onset and lived more than four weeks longer than untreated controls. In Parkinson's models, KDS12025 restored motor function, while in Alzheimer's models, it recovered memory performance. In aging mice, the treatment extended median lifespan from the typical two years to as long as three years. The drug also alleviated inflammation and joint damage in a rheumatoid arthritis model.

The study also uncovered a damaging feedback loop: excess H2O2 depletes astrocytic hemoglobin, weakening the brain's natural antioxidant defenses and accelerating degeneration. By boosting hemoglobin's levels and activity, KDS12025 reversed this trend, reducing oxidative stress, preserving neurons, and maintaining healthy brain function.

No previous treatment has targeted astrocytic hemoglobin as an antioxidant system, nor demonstrated such broad protective effects.

""This is a major step forward in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases. By enhancing the brain's own hemoglobin to combat oxidative stress, we are opening an entirely new therapeutic avenue,"" said Director Lee.

The team now plans to further study the distinct roles of α- and β-globin in the brain, refine KDS12025 derivatives for potential human use, and explore its applications in other oxidative stress–driven disorders.

This work transforms hemoglobin from a familiar oxygen transporter into a precision antioxidant defense system for the brain. It marks a potential paradigm shift in how scientists approach neurodegenerative diseases, age-related decline, and autoimmune conditions.

By Michael Booth (Inorganic Ventures)

Laboratories face new challenges almost daily. Methods are demanding lower detection limits even as sample complexity rises. To meet these demands, instruments must operate at peak performance. However, we understand that instrument sensitivity naturally degrades with time.

Detection limits are rarely as low as on an instrument's first day in service. Fortunately, there are techniques to achieve high-quality results as your system ages.

One key technique is to follow a rigid schedule of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual hardware and sample introduction system maintenance. Calibration and tuning are just as important, but often get overlooked.

ICP-OES equipment requires periodic wavelength calibration with standards containing elements with emission lines throughout the UV/VIS spectrum.

Accurate wavelength calibration ensures precise peak centering and improves sensitivity. It also improves the accuracy of the built-in spectral interference correction algorithms.

ICP-MS systems require mass calibration, as well as routine lens and mass filter tuning. Calibration standards should include elements with a wide mass range, providing benefits similar to wavelength calibration in ICP-OES: increased sensitivity and better interference correction.

Tune solutions are tailored to specific methods, such as collision cell or non-collision cell operation. They aim to:

Advanced users can create custom tuning solutions for specific mass ranges or analyte profiles.

Maintaining high performance requires more than tuning and calibration; thorough documentation is essential. Detailed maintenance and performance log:

This data-driven strategy provides long-term dependability and high analytical performance.

To get the most out of any calibration, tuning, or performance check procedure, the quality of your reference materials is essential. Inorganic Ventures provides high-purity, NIST-traceable reference materials (CRMs) for:

Researchers at Kyushu University have demonstrated that yogurt intake increases the diversity of gut microbiota and alters its composition. Furthermore, bathing in chloride hot springs after yogurt intake was found to improve defecation status more than yogurt alone. These findings suggest that combining two lifestyle interventions-yogurt intake and hot spring bathing-may contribute to better health, highlighting their potential application for preventive medicine. The study was published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.

Maintaining a healthy gut environment is vital for overall health, as it plays a key role in regulating digestion, immune responses, and even neurological function. Yogurt, which contains prebiotic microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, have been known to modulate the gut microbiota and provide a range of health benefits.

In this context, researchers at Kyushu University focused on Japanese hot springs, also known as Onsen. ""We have previously reported the beneficial effects of onsen bathing on the gut microbiota. However, little has been known about how the combination of diet and onsen bathing influences health."" says Professor Shunsuke Managi of Kyushu University's Urban Institute who led the research. ""Therefore, we collaborated with Beppu City here in Kyushu, a region well known for its onsen, to investigate the effects of onsen bathing after yogurt intake.""

This study enrolled 47 healthy adult men and women who had not bathed in onsens within 14 days prior to the start of the trial. The participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group, a yogurt group and a yogurt plus onsen group.

The control group received no intervention, while the yogurt group consumed 180 g of low-sugar yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus after dinner daily. In addition to this, the yogurt plus onsen group bathed in Beppu's chloride spring for more than 15 minutes at least once every two days. Before and after the four-week intervention period, gut microbiota surveys were conducted using stool samples, and a questionnaire on defecation status containing 14 items which includes evaluating stool frequency, stool consistency, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the use of laxatives was administered.

The results revealed a significant increase in gut microbiota diversity in the yogurt group, accompanied by changes in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial species. Notably, these microbial changes were not observed in either the control group or the yogurt plus onsen group. However, both the yogurt group and the yogurt plus onsen group demonstrated significant improvements in defecation status scores, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect.

These findings suggest that yogurt intake may enhance gut microbial diversity, and that its combination with onsen bathing may exert an additive or synergistic effect to improve defecation status.

Although the sample size is small, our findings suggest that combining two accessible lifestyle interventions-yogurt intake and onsen bathing-may offer enhanced health benefits, particularly by promoting gut microbiota diversity and improving defecation status in healthy adults. These results are especially relevant given the growing interest in non-pharmaceutical, lifestyle-based strategies for preventive health and wellness. Furthermore, this research may support the development of evidence-based wellness tourism, particularly in regions known for their onsen, by providing scientific validation for health-oriented travel and services.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Data-driven approach improves speed and consistency of prosthetic leg fitting","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250822/Data-driven-approach-improves-speed-and-consistency-of-prosthetic-leg-fitting.aspx","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 04:40:00 GMT","

Researchers have developed a new, data-driven way of fitting prosthetic legs which could lead to better fitting prosthetics, in less time and at a lower cost.

The technology has been developed by Radii Devices and the University of Southampton, and the results of an NHS trial have been published today [22 August 2025] in JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology.

The study shows that below-the-knee prosthetic limbs designed using the new approach were as comfortable on average as those created by highly skilled prosthetists, but with more consistent results. Crucially, the new method generates a basic design instantly.

The team behind the software hope that data-driven 'socket' designs – the connection between the person and their prosthetic – will reduce the time, number of iterations and number of appointments it takes to arrive at a prosthetic limb the patient is comfortable with. This would not only improve patients' experience but could also help to clear waiting lists.

Prosthetic sockets are personalised to make sure the prosthetic is comfortable, functional, and safe to walk on. The socket bears the person's whole body weight and dynamic forces when walking, so it needs to be carefully balanced to distribute pressure without damaging limb tissue or creating discomfort.

Traditionally, a prosthetist makes a plaster cast of the leg and reshapes it to produce a socket which achieves the right balance, producing trial versions before settling on a definitive one. Today, many prosthetists use CAD (computer-aided design) software in a similar way. Importantly, this creates a digital record of the design process, which the team were able to utilize.

Radii Devices Ltd, a spin-out company from the University of Southampton, has developed software which draws on data from previous prosthetic socket designs to generate recommendations for the most comfortable socket shape using a 3D scan of the patient's residual limb.

By analyzing hundreds of previous prosthetic designs, we've been able to identify trends between different patient characteristics, such as the shape and size of the residual limb, and successful socket shapes.

We can then scan a new patient's residual limb and generate a personalised design recommendation based on features that have been successful for similar patients in the past.""

Dr. Joshua Steer, Founder and CEO of Radii Devices and co-author of the study

To test the effectiveness of the data-driven socket designs, the team carried out a study with patients from three NHS prosthetic rehabilitation centres. Seventeen patients were given a trial socket designed by a prosthetist and one designed using the new method. They were then asked to compare the comfort of the sockets, giving them a score out of ten, and interviewed about their experience of socket fitting.

The study found there was no difference in the comfort scores on average, and less variation in comfort in the data-driven socket designs. Several participants preferred the fit of the data-driven socket design when asked for feedback, and had it turned into their definitive prosthetic.

The design recommendations aren't intended to be used on their own in clinical practice. Instead, the team envision prosthetists working with the technology to further enhance the patient experience.

Alex Dickinson, Professor of Prosthetics Engineering at the University of Southampton, helped to develop the new method and the evidence base behind it. He said: ""3D scans can tell us a lot about the shape of the residual limb from the outside, but they don't tell us what is going on under the skin. Only a highly skilled prosthetist can identify things like bone spurs and neuromas, and know how to tweak designs to avoid causing pain or damage at these sensitive areas.

""We developed the data-driven socket design approach to save prosthetists' time by giving them a solid base to work from so they can use their expertise where it is most valuable, in making precise adaptations tailored to their patients' specific needs. The method effectively helps prosthetists to learn from each other.""

Nearly 100 people have now had a prosthetic leg designed this way, across multiple centres in the UK and the USA.

The project team included physiotherapists, health scientists, and software engineers.

Maggie Donovan-Hall, Professor of Psychology in Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University of Southampton and co-author of the study, said: ""This study was designed to test the 'worst-case' use of data-driven socket designs, with no additional input from prosthetists.

""The fact they performed so well in these circumstances is both surprising and encouraging, but the real value of this tool is to give the prosthetist a starting design quickly, meaning they can spend much more of their time working with their patient on perfecting the more complex, personalised aspects of the design. This is what prosthetists spend years learning and is most crucial to their patients' experience.""

The final stage of this study is now underway, where the software interface is being developed with clinicians to provide them the most effective way to incorporate data-driven socket designs into their practice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Computational framework deciphers cellular organization","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250822/Computational-framework-deciphers-cellular-organization.aspx","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 04:43:00 GMT","

One of the most fundamental processes in all of biology is the spontaneous organization of cells into clusters that divide and eventually turn into shapes – be they organs, wings, or limbs.

Scientists have long explored this enormously complex process to make artificial organs or understand cancer growth – but precisely engineering single cells to achieve a desired collective outcome is often a trial-and-error process.

Harvard applied physicists consider the control of cellular organization and morphogenesis to be an optimization problem that can be solved with powerful new machine learning tools.

In new research published in Nature Computational Science, researchers in the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have created a computational framework that can extract the rules that cells need to follow as they grow, in order for a collective function to emerge from the whole.

The computer learns these ""rules"" in the form of genetic networks that guide a cell's behavior, influencing the many ways cells chemically signal to each other, or the physical forces that make them stick together or pull apart.

Currently a proof of concept, the new methods could be combined with experiments to allow scientists to understand and control how organisms develop from the cellular level.

The research was co-led by graduate student Ramya Deshpande and postdoctoral researcher Francesco Mottes. The senior author was Michael Brenner, Catalyst Professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics at SEAS.

The search for rules that cells must follow was enabled by a computational technique called automatic differentiation. This method, which forms the backbone of training deep learning models in artificial intelligence, consists of algorithms designed to efficiently compute highly complex functions. Automatic differentiation allows the computer to detect the precise effect that a small change in any part of the gene network would have on the behavior of the whole cell collective.

For the last several years, Brenner's team has been applying such algorithms to problems beyond neural networks, including designing self-assembling colloid materials, improving fluid dynamics simulations, or engineering certain types of proteins.

Deshpande said the principles from the paper could help guide follow-up experiments on physical systems of cells.

Once you have a model that can predict what happens when you have a certain combination of cells, genes, or molecules that interact, can we then invert that model and say, 'We want these cells to come together and do this particular thing. How do we program them to do that?'""

Ramya Deshpande, Graduate Student, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

Mottes said that by enabling the scaling of physics-based systems biology models, automatic differentiation offers a promising path toward achieving the predictive control needed to, in the distant future, engineer the growth of organs - the holy grail of computational bioengineering.

""If you have a model that is predictive enough and calibrated enough on experimental data, the hope is that you can just say, for example, 'I want a spheroid with these characteristics. How should I engineer my cells to achieve this?'"" Mottes said.

Synthetic sweat is giving scientists new ways to study how PFAS, so-called ‘forever chemicals', are absorbed through the skin, an often overlooked pathway.

Pickering Laboratories has developed formulations that replicate how products interact with the skin's surface liquid film (SSLF), or sweat.

Recent research into pollutants such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PBDEs suggests that skin contact may be a significant source of exposure.

While direct research on PFAS is still in its early stages, techniques such as artificial sweat are helping us learn more about how these persistent chemicals interact with the human body.

Studies on PBDEs and BFRs highlight the importance of dermal absorption: 

From dust to skin: A study employing artificial skin models found that 3 % of PBDEs can be absorbed by dermal exposure, making it the second biggest contributor to total body burden after dust consumption.

From fabrics: Studies suggest skin contact with BFR-treated materials like couches may result in greater chemical uptake than dust. This research used artificial sweat to simulate genuine exposure scenarios.

Pickering Laboratories produces synthetic biological fluids, including sweat, saliva, and urine, used in research on how chemicals are absorbed through the skin.

Its complex formulations are designed to accurately imitate human biologicals, resulting in consistent and dependable in vitro dissolution testing.

These formulations are especially useful for determining the dissolution of compounds in a variety of materials, such as wearable technology (electronics), jewelry, fabrics, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals that come into contact with human skin.

These formulations are critical for developing accurate in vitro models that mimic in vivo skin conditions.

Pickering's artificial sweat formulations address the issues identified in research in which the content and pH of sweat and sebum in artificial systems did not always correspond to human skin surface liquid films (SSLF).

Pickering Laboratories uses an extensively developed SSLF model to produce a more accurate portrayal of human sweat and sebum. This ensures that testing conditions such as pH, temperature, and chemical concentration reflect real biological conditions.

In addition, while employing Pickering's formulas, researchers can consider elements that influence test results, such as SSLF temperature, agitation, and the material qualities of both the test products and containers.

This improves the accuracy of tests, making it easier to predict how chemicals interact with skin. The outcome is improved risk assessment and subsequent preventive measures for exposed individuals.

Key features of Pickering's artificial sweat formulations include: 

PFAS, valued for their water and oil-repelling qualities, are widely employed in consumer and industrial products. Researchers can use artificial sweat to simulate real-world settings and explore how these substances behave when they come into contact with the skin. This approach is especially beneficial for:

The development of artificial biological fluids that provide realistic, reproducible, and biologically relevant conditions is helping researchers understand the complexity of PFAS exposure.

New genetic analysis reveals that insomnia and gut microbes shape each other, offering fresh clues to why poor sleep and gut imbalances so often go hand in hand.

  

Study: Investigating bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiota and insomnia. Image Credit: Leonid Sorokin / Shutterstock

Many researchers have investigated the link between sleep attributes and the state of the gut microbiome. A recent paper in the journal General Psychiatry assesses associations between insomnia and gut dysbiosis.

Insomnia affects up to a fifth of people worldwide, and at least half of those affected have chronic sleep disturbances. This can leave them irritable or tired when they are awake and expected to be functioning. Insomnia is often the prelude to other mental or physical illnesses that not only have a heavy social cost but herald premature death. For instance, depression risk doubles among people with insomnia compared to those with normal sleep.

The causes of insomnia remain elusive, though genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors are known to intertwine in causing abnormal wakefulness. Stress due to work, family circumstances, unmet financial needs, or other illnesses often impacts sleep adversely.

The gut-brain axis connects the gut microbiome and its metabolites to brain functioning. In healthy adults, the gut microbiome is dominated by a mix of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, comprising up to 90% of the total. Diet, age, and stress all affect the structure and composition of the gut microbiome, as does pregnancy. Sometimes, the resulting changes cause gut disease reflected in systemic conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune illness.

The gut microbiota is key to the establishment of the enteric nervous system that regulates visceral gut movements, including peristalsis. Gut microbes produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) like butyric acid and the neurotransmitter serotonin. These act on the enteric neurons and nerves.

SCFA receptors are abundant in the brain, forming part of the gut-brain pathways. They impact cognitive and emotional pathways. Babies with higher propionate levels in the gut tend to sleep uninterrupted for longer periods. Older people with insomnia tend to sleep more poorly if they have higher SCFA levels.

Not getting enough continuous sleep can also change the gut microbiome, and vice versa. Depletion of the gut microbiota is associated with brain wave changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The tenth cranial nerve, the vagus, mediates the gut-brain axis and is instrumental in the pathogenesis of mild cognitive impairment and depression.

In the current study, the scientists expected to find two-way relationships between insomnia and gut microbiota. To uncover this, they used Mendelian randomization (MR). This is a method of analysis that aims to minimize the effect of confounding and help reveal causation in a single direction.

The data came from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 386,533 individuals with insomnia, and gut microbiome data from two different databases (MiBioGen n=18,340 and the Dutch Microbiome Project n=8,208; all participants of European descent). Over 211 taxa in MiBioGen and 207 taxa in the Dutch dataset were screened. This yielded 4,089 instrumental variables for the MR analysis, and 5,118 for the reverse MR analysis.

Multiple analytic methods were used to detect and validate the associations in either direction, as well as to verify causality.

There were 22 bacterial clades (an ancestor with all groups of descendants) that were causally related to insomnia. Among these, 14 bacterial taxa may increase the risk of insomnia, while eight are protective. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, only the Clostridium innocuum group remained significant in the microbiota → insomnia direction, and forward-direction effect sizes were small (odds ratios ~1.01 to 1.04 for risk taxa and 0.97 to 0.99 for protective taxa).

At the same time, a reverse MR analysis revealed that insomnia contributed to a decrease in the abundance of seven taxa by up to 80%, while 12 taxa were increased in abundance by up to 4.4-fold. Most reverse-direction associations did not remain significant after FDR correction, and Cochran's Q indicated heterogeneity for Sutterella. The directionality of the association for Odoribacter was supported by a Steiger test.

These findings agree with many earlier studies, despite some inconsistencies. Some biological support for these results comes from the knowledge that Clostridium innocuum produces acetate (an SCFA) and breaks down tryptophan (a neurotransmitter precursor) while Coprococcus 1 produces propionate (an SCFA). Tryptophan gives rise to serotonin and melatonin, both of which are important in regulating emotional, cognitive, and other psychological processes.

The gut microbiota structure and composition vary with the presence of major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. For instance, Coprococcus 1 and Lachnospiraceae are linked to depressive symptoms. Prevotella is a taxon associated with chronic local and systemic inflammatory conditions, including periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Insomnia also affects the gut microbiome. For instance, it may upregulate virulence genes in response to stress molecules like interleukin-6 (IL-6), released by the enteric nervous system. More evidence comes from changes in IL-6 in mice transplanted with gut microbiome from sleep-deprived humans. Insomnia also shifts the levels of serotonin and dopamine, in turn altering the gut microbiota that produces these neurotransmitters.

The circadian rhythm of the gut microbes may also be important in these associations. Circadian disruption of the host is reflected in the gut and the brain as well, finally causing gut dysbiosis and leaky gut phenomena – the outcome being metabolic disease. Conversely, disruption of gut microbiota circadian clocks can trigger similar shifts in the body clocks, within the gut and in other tissues, while the SCFAs and other bacterial metabolites may reset the host's rhythms.

“Our study highlighted the reciprocal relationships between gut microbiota and insomnia.” These provide preliminary evidence of causal relationships. However, the authors note that only a small number of associations survived multiple-testing correction, and residual confounding cannot be entirely excluded. This predicts such relationships, but the underlying mechanisms need to be elucidated.

The study is preliminary, limited to individuals of European ancestry, and effect sizes were small, making the results hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. It may help scientists better understand how to prevent and treat insomnia through approaches that modify the gut microbiome.

Researchers from the McCullagh Group in Oxford University's Department of Chemistry have published an innovative method in Nature Protocols today (22 August) that provides comprehensive analysis of metabolites found in cells, tissues and biofluids.

The new method delivers a step-change in capability for analysing highly polar and ionic metabolites. The innovation comes from using anion-exchange chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (AEC-MS) to meet a long-standing need for improving the large-scale analysis of highly polar and ionic metabolites which drive primary metabolic pathways and processes in cells.

Ion-exchange chromatography has been used by generations of chemists since the 1970s, but historically it has been very difficult to couple directly to mass spectrometry, unlike other types of chromatography. The new method uses electrolytic ion-suppression which links the high-performance ion-exchange chromatography system directly with mass spectrometry, an innovation that improves molecular specificity and selectivity. This has led to new applications that were recently reviewed by the McCullagh Group (Ngere et al., Anal. Chem., 2023). The new method is designed for metabolomics applications which involve the large-scale analysis of metabolites in biological samples.

Rachel Williams, a D.Phil. student in the McCullagh Group, whose research focusses on the development of ion-exchange chromatography-mass spectrometry, said, ""Ion-exchange chromatography offers a retention and elution mechanism which is new to metabolomics and is proving to be a powerful solution for long-standing analytical challenges in the field.""

Metabolomics, is one of several 'omics' technologies, that include genomics and proteomics, offering a powerful combinatorial approach to comprehensively analyse molecular systems in cells, tissues and whole organisms. Changes in metabolite levels are sensitive biomarkers for specific diseases, diets, nutritional states, treatments and chemical exposures and metabolomics provides a tool for discovering these molecular changes. It can be applied to research questions in many disciplines, including biological chemistry, molecular biology, molecular medicine, pharmacology and environmental science.

The new AEC-MS protocol has been used in several research studies including in collaboration with the Kennedy Institute, Oxford to investigate how the gut microbiome utilises energy substrates. This led to the discovery that the microbiome-derived energy substrate product butyrate is found in circulation and can help bolster the host immune response (Schulthess et al., Immunity, 2019).

In another study it was used to investigate metabolism in diabetic pancreatic β-cells. We found the activity of GAPDH and PDH (enzymes involved in the production of ATP from glucose) were inhibited when glucose levels increased, leading to the accumulation of upstream intermediates which caused changes in gene expression including impaired insulin secretion and build-up of glycogen (Haythorne et al., Nat. Comms., 2023).

Professor James McCullagh (Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford) who led the project, said: ""Developing a new metabolomics protocol is very exciting, it expands capability for existing applications but also enables us to explore and develop new applications: in our lab we are now applying the protocol in several research areas including investigating gut microbiome metabolism, how antimicrobial resistance impacts bacterial metabolism and in the discovery of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer.""

Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Antioxidant-1 (ATOX1) has been implicated in oncogenic processes across various cancer types; however, its specific role in HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of ATOX1 and its underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC.

Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to assess ATOX1 expression in HCC tissues. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell migration, flow cytometry, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were employed to evaluate the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. A xenograft mouse model was employed to assess the effects of ATOX1 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo. DCAC50 treatment was performed to inhibit the copper transport function of ATOX1. RNA sequencing was conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of ATOX1 in HCC.

ATOX1 expression was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues. ATOX1 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Knockdown of ATOX1 suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, ATOX1 activated c-Myb, and thus enhanced the malignant phenotype of HCC cells via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Additionally, ATOX1 reduced intracellular copper accumulation and inhibited ROS production and apoptosis. Inhibition of ATOX1 by DCAC50 decreased cell proliferation while increasing ROS levels and apoptosis in HCC cells. Notably, acetylcysteine reversed the reduction in c-Myb expression induced by ATOX1 knockdown.

This study elucidates that ATOX1 promotes HCC carcinogenicity through the c-Myb/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway while inhibiting copper accumulation, ROS generation, and apoptosis. These results indicate that ATOX1 represents a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Moreover, the compound DCAC50, by obstructing ATOX1's copper transport function, effectively suppresses the malignant behavior of HCC cells, suggesting its promising role in HCC treatment, particularly when combined with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors.

Cutting off food benefits erodes hard-won dietary gains, while sustained support shows how simple subsidies can narrow health gaps and strengthen food security.



Study: Healthy Food Benefit Programs, Fruit and Vegetable Consumption, and Food Security. Image Credit: Simxa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the JAMA Network Open, researchers leveraged a cohort study comprising 1,973 participants to investigate the on-ground benefits of “Fresh Bucks”, a healthy food benefit program. Specifically, the study evaluated the program's impact on participant food security and fruit/vegetable consumption.

Fresh Bucks used Seattle's beverage tax revenue, creating a sustainable local funding stream distinct from federal programs.

Study findings revealed that among new enrollees, the program was associated with a 5.5 percentage-point increase in food security and a 7.5 percentage-point increase in the proportion of participants eating fruits and vegetables three or more times daily. By contrast, the study found no statistically significant effect on overall continuous daily fruit and vegetable intake. Conversely, losing the benefit was linked to a substantial decline in these outcomes.

These findings provide robust evidence from randomized program assignment that such programs can be an effective tool for reducing health disparities within America. However, the authors caution that further research is needed to confirm long-term health impacts.

Poor diet quality is a major driver of chronic diseases, with a growing body of evidence identifying low intake of fruits and vegetables as a key contributor. For many low-income and marginalized communities, the high cost and limited availability of fresh produce create significant barriers to healthy eating, contributing to food insecurity and widening health disparities between the rich and the poor.

To address these disparities, “food is medicine” initiatives, including produce prescription programs, have gained popularity as a potential solution. These programs aim to make healthy foods more accessible by providing financial incentives.

Unfortunately, a combination of their relative nascency and the fact that much of the existing research on these programs has been hampered by weak study designs, often lacking a proper comparison group, has made empirical validation of these programs' benefits hitherto impossible. This has fueled criticism of these initiatives, with a growing voice undermining their impacts.

Participants could redeem the $40 monthly benefit flexibly – all at once or split across multiple trips – at major grocery chains, local independent stores, or farmers' markets.

The present study aims to address the ongoing debate on “food is medicine” initiatives' social impacts by conducting a lottery-based cohort study evaluating the outcomes of Seattle's Fresh Bucks program, which offers a $40 monthly benefit for fruits and vegetables.

The study design treated the program as a natural experiment, leveraging the program's oversubscription in 2022, which required a random lottery to select participants from a pool of over 6,900 applicants. This randomization created natural treatment (initially selected) and control (waitlisted) groups.

The study simulated and examined two distinct scenarios: 1. ‘Gaining Access', wherein 757 newly enrolled participants were compared to a waitlisted control group over 6 months, and 2. ‘Losing Access', wherein a separate group of 1,216 prior beneficiaries was studied, comparing those randomly disenrolled (and placed on the waitlist) to those randomly selected to continue receiving benefits for an additional 6 months.

Study outcomes of interest included: 1. Food security, assessed using the validated 2-item Hunger Vital Signs screener, and 2. Fruit and vegetable consumption was measured using a modified Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire. Data for analysis were collected via surveys administered at baseline (October 2021) and follow-up (June 2022).

Study analyses included linear regression models (LRMs) to estimate the program's effects, controlling for participants' household size, presence of children, income, race/ethnicity, preferred language, age, preferred retailer, and baseline outcome values to increase statistical power and precision.

Nearly 7 in 10 participants (68%) were aged 60 or older, and over half (51%) identified as Asian, reflecting the program's reach within specific Seattle communities.

Study outcomes revealed statistically significant evidence of the Fresh Bucks program's benefits. Among new applicants, being randomly selected to receive the $40 monthly benefit was associated with marked improvements in both diet and food security compared to being placed on the waiting list.

Specifically, enrollment led to a 5.5 percentage point (pp) increase in food security (95% CI, 0.05-10.91 pp), representing a 31% improvement from the baseline food insecurity rate. Simultaneously, a 7.5 percentage point (pp) increase in the proportion of participants consuming fruits and vegetables three or more times per day (95% CI, 0.39-14.52 pp) was observed, representing a 37% improvement from baseline. However, the study reported that average daily fruit and vegetable intake, measured continuously, did not show a statistically significant change.

The second part of the analysis, which looked at what happens when the benefit is lost because of random participant disenrollment, reinforced these findings. Previously enrolled participants who were randomly disenrolled from the program experienced a significant decline in both outcomes.

Specifically, these participants reported a 4.97 pp reduction in food security (p = .03) and a 7.34 pp decrease in the likelihood of eating produce at least three times a day (p = .01) compared to those who continued to receive benefits for the six additional months. They also ate fruits and vegetables 0.37 fewer times per day on average.

Importantly, the study found heterogeneity in outcomes. Gains in continuous fruit and vegetable intake were significant among lower-income participants (≤200% of the federal poverty level), those identifying as White or Black, and English speakers. By contrast, effects were weaker or absent for Asian participants and Vietnamese speakers, suggesting language or cultural barriers may influence program impact.

The present study's findings strongly suggest that “food is medicine” initiatives like Fresh Bucks are a powerful tool for addressing diet-related health disparities. The sharp decline in outcomes observed upon disenrollment also highlights the critical importance of sustained funding for these programs to ensure lasting benefits.

This study hence provides rigorous evidence of meaningful improvements offered by these initiatives, highlighting them as a direct and effective way to improve population health. However, given limitations such as a 28.5% survey response rate, reliance on self-reported data, and potential selection bias, the findings should be interpreted with caution and not yet generalized as a “global model.”

Men assessed as healthy after a pathologist analyses their tissue sample may still have an early form of prostate cancer. Using AI, researchers at Uppsala University have been able to find subtle tissue changes that allow the cancer to be detected long before it becomes visible to the human eye.

Previous research has demonstrated that AI is able to detect tissue changes indicative of cancer. In the current study, published in Scientific Reports, the researchers show that AI can also find cancers missed by pathologists.

""The study has been nicknamed the 'missed study', as the goal of finding the cancer was 'missed' by the pathologists. We have now shown that with the help of AI, it is possible to find signs of prostate cancer that were not observed by pathologists in more than 80 per cent of samples from men who later developed cancer,"" says Carolina Wählby, who led the AI development in the study.

The project is based on a collaboration with Umeå University, where the researchers collected samples from men called for sample-taking over a number of years. All 232 men in the study were assessed as healthy when their biopsies were examined by pathologists. After less than two-and-a-half years, half of the men in the study had developed aggressive prostate cancer, while the rest were still cancer-free eight years later.

As all tissue samples were initially assessed as negative, the researchers developed a new way to train the AI tool. It was trained by analysing each biopsy image bit by bit, with the assumption that abnormal patterns ought to be present somewhere in the biopsies that came from patients who later developed aggressive cancer, while the other images should not contain such patterns. The AI was then tested on an independent set of images.

When we looked at the patterns that the AI ranked as informative, we saw changes in the tissue surrounding the glands in the prostate - changes also observed in other studies. This shows that AI analysis of routine biopsies can detect subtle signs indicating clinically significant prostate cancer before it becomes obvious to a pathologist.""

Carolina Wählby

The researchers suggest that this type of analysis could be used to decide how soon men who have been assessed as healthy should be followed up. The imaging data collected and the researchers' methods are openly available for further research and development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","University of Vienna team develops method to measure molecular charges","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250822/University-of-Vienna-team-develops-method-to-measure-molecular-charges.aspx","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 04:17:00 GMT","

An international research team led by the University of Vienna has succeeded in developing a new method to directly measure partial charges in molecules. The results, now published in Nature, provide new insights into molecular interactions and offer potential applications in drug development and materials science.

Electrostatic forces – the attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms or molecules – lie at the heart of all molecular interactions: They are fundamental to how molecules assemble, align, and respond to one another. In chemistry, these forces are described in terms of partial charges: tiny imbalances in how electrons are distributed within a molecule.

These subtle shifts in charge govern how molecules interact with each other and their surroundings. They are key to understanding chemical reactivity, biological function, and material behavior. In medicine, for instance, partial charges influence how drugs are absorbed, distributed, and metabolized – and can shape both their therapeutic effects and potential side effects. Yet despite their significance, partial charges have remained purely theoretical: until now, there was no way to measure them directly.

A research team led by Tim Grüne, Head of the Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis, and Christian Schröder from the Department of Computational Biological Chemistry at the University of Vienna, has now developed a method that allows partial charges to be determined experimentally.

We used a technique called electron diffraction. It involves directing a fine beam of electrons at a tiny crystal. Because electrons are charged, they are sensitive to the electrostatic potential within the crystal and thus to the partial charges of atoms. The resulting tiny deflections in the beam were recorded using a new camera developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.""

Tim Grüne, Head, Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis, Department of Computational Biological Chemistry, University of Vienna

The team combined the diffraction data with a new analysis method called ionic scattering factor modelling (iSFAC). In this approach, each atom of a molecule is modelled simultaneously as a neutral and as a charged species. By comparing the model with the experimental data, the researchers were able to quantify the partial charge of each atom.

""Until now, partial charges were estimated using computational methods"", says Christian Schröder. ""Some of these fit atomic charges to reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential, resulting in so-called electrostatic potential-derived charges (ESP charges). Others partition the electron density itself among atoms. While widely used in molecular modeling, these methods can yield different values depending on the algorithm. Our new experimental technique now provides a means to assess and refine these theoretical models by offering a direct link.""

To demonstrate the broad applicability of their method, the researchers examined a diverse set of crystalline compounds – including the industrial catalyst ZSM-5, the amino acids tyrosine and histidine, tartaric acid from Austrian wine, and the widely used antibiotic Ciprofloxacin. For Ciprofloxacin, which appears on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines and is commonly administered as a hydrochloride salt, the analysis showed that the chloride ion (Cl⁻), carries only about 40 percent of a full negative charge. This demonstrates how strongly a molecule's environment can influence local charge distribution.

The Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis at the University of Vienna has played a key role in advancing electron crystallography in recent years. With this latest breakthrough, the technique moves beyond determining atomic positions to experimentally revealing electronic properties. The ability to measure partial charges opens new possibilities for designing pharmaceuticals with greater specificity and fewer side effects, as well as functional materials with precisely tuned properties.

Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout.

With Christian and Mark Pulisic in the midst of having a war of words with former U.S. men's national team standouts, we thought this five-part series, It runs in the family, would be appropriate to repost. It gives background of both Pulisics. This is the final part of a five-part series about the Pulisic family. This interview with Mark Pulisic took place in 2017.

Final of a five-part series

By Michael LewisFrontRowSoccer.com Editor

Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout.

Headlines hail the 18-year-old Pulisic as the next superstar, the team's savior.

Prior to the U.S.'s World Cup qualifier in Mexico in June, a picture of Pulisic dominated the front sports page of Reforma with the headline: American dream.

“Listen, here's my take on the media and I really never discuss this,” Mark Pulisic said earlier this year. “Most interviews, they don't go this direction. But its borderline amusing, OK? For them to compare a 17-, 18-year old player to a Landon Donovan, for instance, who has done so much, who has been so successful in this country, who's had such a great career — I don't care if it was in Europe or the U.S. — for his national team, is ridiculous. OK?”

Now, Pulisic, a native of Centereach, L.I. knows his son his talented, but he also stressed that Christian was only a teenager and at the cusp of his career for club and country. Donovan set the standard for American men's soccer in Major League Soccer and the national team, performing in three World Cups.

“Landon Donovan had a great career,” said Pulisic, who is assistant coach of the Rochester Lancers in the United Soccer League. “Landon Donovan is Landon Donovan. and he'll always be remembered as Landon Donovan. Don't put another name next to that. It's not fair, it's not right to do. That's my opinion. My son is 18. To say he's the best or going to be the best, it's ridiculous. My son's so young. He hasn't had a serious girlfriend yet. Who knows how he's going to react to that part of his life? Who knows how he's going to react to his first major setback when he's left out of a national team, when he's left out of the first team? How he is going to come off an injury?”

Pulisic then tapped the table he was sitting at three times.

“How is he going to psychologically handle that?” he added.

“I mean. He's a young kid. Just let him play, let him develop. Enjoy the moment, enjoy the now. For me, as much as the media says they don't want to put too much pressure on him or hype him too much, like did Freddy Adu. They're still doing it. So, we can help Christian to some degree with that as well as his surrounding team his agent, but I just don't like when people say they're not hyping because they are. Just let him be. He's going to fail. He's going to have bad [days]. If you really want to see an American player who's at the highest level — and I'm not saying it's my son, it may not be my son — talk about the veterans and the older players who have established themselves on the national team and put them in the spotlight, ok?

“Don't say you don't want to hype him but you do anyway. … I think it's important [for U.S. Soccer and be very smart on how they handle their young players. Not Christian, all of them. There are some very good other young players coming up in U.S. soccer. Christian is one player. This is not an individual sport, it's a team sport. There are some very good young players coming up. Give all of them the opportunity, whatever environment they're in, to develop, to start a career, to start having a good career before you start putting them and comparing them to the best players.

Now, don't get Pulisic wrong. He understands publicity, but not when it is over the top.

“I understand the hype,” he said. “I'm not saying I'm surprised by it. I understand what media has to do and I understand their job. I guess as a parent we're just trying to be a little more protective. So that's just a natural protective mechanism as a parent. You don't want your son to hear all those things. You just want him to focus on playing. And i get it all. But some of the things I do read and some of the things I do hear are quite amusing and are a little bit too much.”

At a Tuesday press conference in New York City Tuesday, this reporter asked Christian what he thought of all the hype and attention.

“Of course, I hear about all this stuff people talk about,” Pulisic said. “This kid, there's hype, whatever. I just try to keep it out of my mind as much as I can because that doesn't really matter to me. I put enough pressure on myself. I don't need all this outside tension or whatever. I just try to do the best I can for myself and the people around me.”

It has been quite a year for the teen as Christian has earned a starting spot with his club team, Borussia Dortmund, and has become a fulcrum of the U.S. national team attack.

“For me everything happened a little bit too fast,” he said. “The past year has been a roller coaster. Being able to play at club level at a high level, and then getting called into the national team, it's amazing. But I'm just trying to stay as level-grounded as I can, finding a balance.”

Chelsea's 2025-26 third kit has already been made available in stores, confirming that the FIFA Club World Cup champions badge will be placed on the left chest - the spot typically reserved for the club crest. Thanks to @jordyxcollins & @CFCDREM.

The reason for this unusual placement is the design of the third kit itself. The new Chelsea 25-26 third shirt features a centralized club crest.

With the Chelsea crest and the Nike Swoosh already occupying the center of the shirt, this leaves no room for the FIFA CWC badge in its usual position. As a result, the badge has been moved to the left chest, opposite the Nike logo.

This is a different approach compared to Chelsea's 2025-26 home and away kits. On those jerseys, which feature a traditional crest placement on the left, the FIFA Club World Cup badge is applied in the standard central position.

This small but interesting detail shows how specific kit design choices can impact the application of official league and competition badges.

What do you think of this badge placement on the Chelsea third kit? A smart solution to the central crest problem? Let us know in the comments below.","{'href': 'https://www.footyheadlines.com', 'title': 'Footy Headlines'}","soccer"

The pictures of the Oval Office in the White House have stunned a few football fans across the globe, as the FIFA Club World Cup trophy can be seen sitting behind President Donald Trump. The FIFA Club World Cup trophy was won by Chelsea
after beating European Champions PSG 3-0 in a match in New Jersey last month, but fans spotted that the trophy is still in the Oval Office when the White House released a new picture recently.

The picture released by the White House showed Trump meeting European leaders and the Ukrainian President on Monday, and the trophy can be seen at the back. This led to a huge chatter on social media among football fans over why the trophy, which was won by Chelsea, is still in the Oval Office.

The truth is that he was handed over the trophy by FIFA itself. Why? As a token of appreciation for hosting the newly-expanded FIFA World Cup. This was confirmed by Trump in an interview.

“I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump said in an interview with DAZN.

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

But that claim is not 100% true.

The real truth, as per FIFA, is that there are three Club World Cup trophies in existence at the moment. The original one is at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The world governing body follows the same process for the World Cup trophy as well.

The second replica is with Chelsea, and the third one is in the Oval Office of the White House. FIFA told BBC that the replica of the Club World Cup trophy was given to Trump as a “recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts.”

After Chelsea triumphed over PSG in the Club World Cup last month, a match-issued Cole Palmer shirt has sold for £27,636 on football auction site MatchWornShirt.

The England attacker scored twice in the first half, helping the Blues secure the first-ever Club World Cup trophy in this format.

João Pedro added a third before half-time, which was enough to help Chelsea secure victory over the European Champions.

It was a successful tournament for Chelsea, who had to overcome Benfica, Palmeiras and Fluminese in their route to the final, perhaps an easier run than their French opponents, who overcame Inter Miami, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

The victory puts the Blues in a good position for this Premier League season, as they will be encouraged after beating the winners of the Champions League.

Following the trophy lift, which awkwardly involved President Donald Trump, match-issued shirts were put up for auction on MatchWornShirt.

MatchWornShirt partners with football clubs to put match-worn and signed shirts in the hands of fans via their online auction platform.

The shirts are collected in the dressing room after the game, and are signed by the players before being authenticated in their offices.

The auction for the shirts gained a lot of interest across the whole of the Chelsea side, with goalscorer João Pedro's shirt selling for £13,119. Additionally, Reece James' shirt sold for £8,734 while Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernández's shirt sold for £4,407.","{'href': 'https://www.vavel.com', 'title': 'VAVEL.com'}","soccer"

Pictures of the Oval Office have recently shocked many football fans when they noticed the FIFA Club World Club trophy there. For the unversed, the trophy was won by Chelsea when they defeated Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 3-0. The match was held in New Jersey last month. While Chelsea won the cup, the trophy was seen sitting behind Trump.

In the photo, US President Donald Trump was holding a meeting with European leaders when fans spotted the trophy. This led to questions amongst fans as to why the trophy was still in the Oval Office. According to Firstpost, the trophy was handed over to Donald Trump by FIFA itself. 

The same was reportedly confirmed by the US President during an interview with DAZN. He stated that the trophy was given to him as a token of appreciation for hosting the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Trump said,

However, the trophy in Trump's office isn't the original one. According to FIFA, there are three Club World Cup trophies at the moment. The original one sits at the FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The second replica is with Chelsea and the final replica is sitting in the Oval Office behind Trump.

Thus, based on the clarifications by FIFA, it could be concluded that the the FIFA Club World Cup trophy in the viral photo is the third replica of the original one that is now in Zurich. FIFA told the BBC that the third replica was given to Donald Trump as ""recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts.""

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kickstarted on June 14, 2025, and continued till July 13, 2025. According to the BBC, FIFA president Gianni Infantino called this event the ""world's most successful club competition.""

The tournament featured about 32 teams, with Chelsea securing the winning spot for themselves by defeating Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in MetLife Stadium.

Shortly before the final match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. took place in New Jersey, Gianni Infantino spoke about the event and said,

Infantino added,

Infantino continued by stating that the organizers had heard that they wouldn't be able to financially pull off such a massive event. He confirmed that the entire tournament had already generated a revenue worth $2 billion, according to the BBC. He additionally stated that they earned about $33 million per match.

As far as the final match was concerned, Donald Trump was also set to attend the same. While Infantino believed that the tournament was a success, he could not avoid one issue which was the high temperature in the summer across the United States.

While FIFA president Gianni Infantino highlighted that the tournament in the US was a massive success, not everybody was of the same view. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not seem to be very fond of the idea that there was an expansion to 32 teams this time.

According to reports by the BBC, Klopp even called it ""the worst idea ever implemented in football"". He reportedly was concerned about ""players' welfare."" In June, he had an exclusive interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. In the interview, Klopp said,

The former Liverpool manager believed that amid all these constant tournaments, the players got very less time and chance to recover physically as well as mentally.

As far as the shining trophy in Donald Trump's office is concerned, it should be clarified that it is not the original FIFA Club World Cup trophy but only a replica of the same.

Five short weeks after winning the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea returned to competitive play at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, banners celebrating their latest championship adorned around their stadium. The Blues, though, swapped an impressive 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last month for a sluggish 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace, the scoreline a perfect reflection of the performance.

External factors likely played a sizable role in Chelsea's underwhelming showing on Sunday, the Club World Cup creating wonky preseason schedules for the European teams that made deep runs. Enzo Maresca's side, for example, played an 11-month season, took three weeks off, and had just 13 days of preseason preparation before facing Palace on Sunday, while the opponent had a much more traditional build-up. Maresca did not feel his side were underprepared as a result, but it was hard to ignore the circumstances.

""I don't think [the team was unprepared] because, until the end, we competed,"" Maresca said. ""We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good. For sure, [Palace] have already played seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.""

Even then, Chelsea have room for improvement as they prepare to face West Ham United on Friday, a trip to the London Stadium offering a perfect opportunity to put Sunday's performance in the past. While Palace were organized defensively and provided real hurdles for the Blues' attackers, the Hammers are unlikely to pose the same challenge. West Ham are coming off a 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland, which could be the first sign of a troubling season ahead for a team that has not refreshed much this summer and poses a limited attacking threat.

Chelsea were clearly the more dominant attacking team on Sunday, when they outshot Palace 19 to 11 and generated almost a full expected goal more than the Eagles. It was a performance that was more about quantity than quality, though – the Blues took just three shots on goal, unideal no matter the preseason disruptions. It offered a stark reminder that despite the Club World Cup triumph and the UEFA Europa Conference League win before that, Maresca's Chelsea may have plenty of potential but are still a great unknown.

Maresca boasts a bloated squad jam-packed with attackers, but has yet to figure out what his preferred combination is yet. Considering the circumstances – specifically, an ownership group that is unusually eager to sign new players – it is understandable that the manager has not cracked the code just yet. Cole Palmer has earned the right to be a regular starter but the rest of the spots just might be up for grabs.

The journey to figure out Chelsea's first-choice attacking unit has been a constant feature of Maresca's tenure at the club but the Club World Cup run offers important context thanks to the introduction of a batch of new players. Liam Delap, who chose Chelsea despite interest from several clubs around Europe, was a starter at the start of the summer tournament but by the time the trophy was in the Blues' sights, Joao Pedro was in the mix. He joined the team midway through the tournament and notched three goals in three games, including one in the final, and translated that into a start on Sunday against Palace.

Joao Pedro was at the top of a 4-2-3-1 that included Palmer, as well as Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens on the wings, but the returns were not spectacular. Joao Pedro took just two shots in 73 minutes, a throwback to his average returns during his two years with Brighton and Hove Albion. The less-than-exciting outing for Chelsea, though, perhaps opens the door for Delap to earn a starting role while 18-year-old Estevao Willian may play a sizable role himself this season after making a 36-minute cameo on Sunday.

Friday's match at West Ham, then, feels like the unofficial start of auditions to be one of Chelsea's first-choice attackers, all of whom will be tasked with helping the Blues live up to the hype they created last season.

Donald Trump has a close relationship with Fifa and presented the Club World Cup trophy to Chelsea in the summer

The draw for the 2026 men's World Cup will take place in Washington this December, US President Donald Trump has announced.

The tournament will take place across the United States, Canada and Mexico and will feature 48 nations - up from 32.

The draw had been expected to be held in Las Vegas, which is where it was completed when the US hosted the 1994 tournament.

However, the draw, on 5 December, will instead go ahead at the Kennedy Center - the performing arts venue where Trump is chairman.

""It's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports,"" Trump said.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who brought with him the World Cup trophy, also took part in the draw announcement from the Oval Office at the White House.

""The draw will be broadcast live all over the world and will be watched by one billion viewers,"" Infantino said.

""It will be 48 participating teams. There will be 104 matches - 104 Super Bowls!""

Infantino offered Trump the opportunity to hold the trophy during the news conference on Friday. ""Can I keep it?"" Trump asked.

President Donald Trump hasn't been shy about his excitement for the U.S. to host next summer's FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico. The head of state has spent an inordinate amount of time with FIFA President Gianni Infantino since taking office and, as of last month, the trophy from this past summer's Club World Cup has become a permanent fixture in the Oval Office. 

In April, Sports Business Journal was the first to report that Trump planned to appoint Andrew Giuliani as the executive director of the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026. The one-time New York gubernatorial candidate (and son of former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani) spoke with SBJ this week about the federal government's role in preparing for the 39-day mega-event. 

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

You oversaw sports-related issues in the Office of Public Liaison during President Trump's first term. What did that job entail and how did it prepare you for your current role? 

I think one of the main reasons the president was inclined to select me for this is because we created a novel visa system in 2020 [during the COVID-19 pandemic], when nobody was getting in the country at all, to get 15,000 accredited athletes and personnel into the United States. That way, we could start the PGA Tour season, Major League Soccer, the U.S. Open, all the other major sports as well, the NFL and so on. So, doing that, I was able to really get a good idea for what a visa process for the World Cup would look like.

What are the most important priorities the task force needs to address? 

More than anything, it's making sure state and locals have the resources that they need to protect the sites, the fan fests and the 48 different base camps around the country. That's why when we look at the visa process here, it's key that we're welcoming the world without sacrificing our national security and our footprint here. That's a mandate directly from the President, echoed by Vice President (J.D.) Vance, [Secretary of State Marco Rubio], [Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem] and all our other incredible task force members.

The way I look at success is, I want what people are talking about on July 20 next year to be about what happens on the field, not something off the field. If we can do that, then I think the task force has accomplished its goals. 

Protecting stadiums from drone threats has been a major focus of lawmakers. How is the task force preparing to take that on? 

Over the past year, we've had lots of discussion about drone security and how important it is to major events where you have tens of thousands of Americans gathering. All these stadiums have detection capability, but when you're looking at your standard NFL or MLB games, they don't have the authority to mitigate. We've gone to Mexico City already for the first counter — UAS trilateral meeting between the United States, Canada and Mexico — I was honored to lead that delegation. We've been out to West Virginia with Secretary Noem to look at all the different drone mitigation technologies.

That'll be different next year because these are Level 1 and 2 events, and [federal law enforcement] will have the ability to mitigate. We also want to make sure that we have that ability without taking prized assets, let's say, off the southern border. So, it's a matter now of making sure that we're acquiring all the right assets we need to make sure these 78 games are safe. 

Would it be local law enforcement or federal law enforcement overseeing that? 

Because these are Level 1 and 2 events, we'll have federal jurisdiction to be able to utilize mitigation capabilities. As a legacy project, there's talk of legislation about potentially giving state and locals, in some instances, the ability to mitigate as well. That won't be necessary for the World Cup in particular, but moving forward past July 20, I think it's one of the great potential opportunities for this major event. 

You talked earlier about visas and the sheer volume of people that will want to come to the U.S. for this event. What is the task force doing to make sure fans are able to get in and out of the country easily? 

First and foremost, some of the results that we can point to already are the wait times in four soccer-enthusiastic countries. Mexico's wait time was over 800 days a year ago. That number is less than 275 days. We've got some work to do to get that number even lower, but that's why the State Department is telling people to apply early. We put it back within the timeline of the World Cup, and we want to keep it within that timeline of the World Cup.

Colombia is another example that the media really focused on. It was over 750 days for the wait time — that number is below 300 days. Argentina and Brazil — not bad at soccer these two countries. Argentina went from over 500 days of wait time last year to effectively nothing, which means less than a month. Brazil went from over 300 days to less than a month.

That's really where we focused before teams are qualified. We looked at where fans will end up coming from regardless of whether or not their country qualifies for the World Cup. Deploying consular officers to those consulates is really key. 

Then, we're looking at other processes to make sure that we can process the 350,000 accredited individuals — that's a number per FIFA — and the ticket holders. If you break down the numbers, you're looking at five-and-a-half million to 6 million tickets. Of that, about two-and-a-half milloion to 3 million will be international. And of that, you're looking at 1.2 to 1.6 million visa holders. So,we're targeting that 1.2 to 1.6 and making sure that, without sacrificing our national security, they get to go through the process. Not everybody is going to get a yes, but we want to make sure that they get processed, so that way there is a conscious decision.

How closely is the task force working with the host committees in the 11 American cities? 

We worked directly with them to make sure the $625 million [for security] was in President Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill.” That's something we had to fight to keep in there, and we were honored to do that. That was our direct work with the host city CEOs, security leads, their government affairs teams that will allow them to have these resources. Now that the Club World Cup is over, we're starting more regular meetings with them to go through updated concerns and checklists as we get closer and closer to the World Cup.

Will the $625 million for security be allocated directly to the host committees or to local law enforcement? 

The plan right now is through the host committees. We're working on a reimbursement plan so that we can verify the money is used for safety and security as the host committees projected to Congress and to the White House. As long as they submit the receipts that show that it's for “X” amount of overtime for law enforcement or it's for “X” equipment that's used specifically for the World Cup, then we are happy to reimburse that. 

Beyond safety and security, the cities have a lot of other expenses related to hosting the World Cup. Some are struggling to raise the necessary funding and, as a result, are scaling back fan fests and legacy programs. Can the task force help ease that burden or encourage FIFA to kick in a bit more money to help out the host cities? 

For us, it's about making sure that when the fan fests are open, when the games are going on, that they're as safe as possible. We were instrumental in securing the $625 million in this bill, along with the half a billion dollars for drone mitigation. So, I think the federal government has done more than its share to make sure that that these sites are safe and secure. 

Now, it's up to the host committees to make sure that they're also raising from the state and local [governments]. This is going to be a huge, profitable opportunity for these cities to host the World Cup for 40 days. We hope they can figure it out. I'm also hopeful that as we get into the World Cup year, as the draw happens, as people get more and more excited, some more of those of those spigots will turn on for the host committees.

Speaking of the draw, it has been reported that FIFA is planning to hold the event in Las Vegas this December, but over the past couple of weeks I've been hearing chatter about it winding up in Washington, D.C. 

Were you listening in on my last call? Is that what you were doing? 

No, but is that your understanding of where it's trending? 

I would say it's to be determined, but it will be exciting.

What else do you think our readers in the sports business community should know about the White House's approach to the World Cup? 

We're always happy to engage the private sector to see ways that they believe that we can be doing better and how we can be better partners. But if we do our job on the task force, it's going to leave the biggest runway for the sports business world to be able to go and run with this mega sporting event. 

This is the largest sporting event ever hosted, and I think obviously the sports business world is going to play a huge role in maximizing this, not just for the American fans that are here, not just for the 7- or 8-year-old that's going to watch their first World Cup game, but also for the international visitor here that is just learning about the United States of America. The sports business world is going to play a huge role in maximizing this World Cup in so many different facets.

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C.

Trump made the announcement flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.

The draw is the event at which all qualified teams learn their three group-stage opponents.

The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively.

Trump will almost certainly have a role in the event, which is both procedural and a spectacle. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups.

Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so.

Last time the men's World Cup took place in the U.S., 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark hosting the event which included performances from Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart.

The draw determines the exact split of the 48 qualified nations into 12 groups of four for the first stage of the World Cup.

Before the draw, the 48 teams will be allocated evenly into four ‘pots', according to the most up-to-date FIFA rankings. Pot 1 will contain the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who qualify for the tournament automatically as host nations, and the next highest-ranked nine teams. That continues across Pot 2 and Pot 3, with Pot 4 containing the 12 lowest-ranked teams. Each group will contain one country from each pot.

It has already been confirmed that the first game of the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, meaning Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the U.S. will play the third match and is in Group D. Those games will be the only ones on June 12.

At the time of the draw, 42 of the 48 teams competing at the World Cup will be known. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.

Some players have refused to sign a contract despite having the pen in their hand, while others have gone into hiding to avoid a transfer

As we all know, football is no longer a sport. It's a business - and a pretty ruthless one at that. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the transfer market, where money is king and the idea of a 'gentleman's agreement' is utterly laughable. This is why it's so naive for supporters to think that a 'Here we go!' is akin to confirmation that a deal has been done.

In reality, clubs cannot take anything for granted until a player signs on the dotted line, given there are all sorts of things that can go wrong at the 11th hour. Remember, even a faulty fax machine can scupper a proposed move!

However, the biggest threat to the completion of a transfer is last-minute interest from elsewhere - as Tottenham have once again discovered to their considerable cost. So, with Eberechi Eze's move to Arsenal in mind, GOAL runs through the most dramatic hijackings in football history:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Los Blancos may have won their first game of the season but the new coach has an awful lot of work to do at the Santiago Bernabeu

There's no other way to cut it: Real Madrid were very poor in their 1-0 win over Osasuna to open the season. Fans looking for signs of encouragement, or hoping to be moved by new tactical ideas, would have been left largely disappointed. There was nothing definitive to be found, no glitzy new system, or innovative way of playing.

Instead, Madrid fell back into a lot of similar patterns. Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe disagreed a lot. The midfield lacked balance. The team looked vulnerable on the break here and there. If Los Blancos really do want to compete for the league, then they will have to perform a whole lot more convincingly than this. 

The good news, though, is that it is early on in the season. Xabi Alonso may have a lot to do, but he also has a lot to work with. It helps, too, that such is the quality of the squad - and relative weakness of La Liga - that Madrid can still be carried by moments of individual magic. 

Still, individualism can only sustain them for so long, and even if he is given time, the new coach will have to start piecing together something more tactically coherent.

ByMatt Craig,

Forbes Staff.

There's plenty to look at during a tennis spectacle like the U.S. Open, where a night match in Arthur Ashe Stadium might hold 23,000 fans, hundreds of sponsor activations, dozens of celebrities and who knows how many Honey Deuces. But everyone watching, whether in-person or on TV at home, looks at one thing more than any other during a match: the tennis ball.

Given that exposure and the makeup of a crowd at a typical ATP Tour event—where 60% to 75% of spectators identify as tennis players themselves, according to tour data—manufacturers have long paid for the privilege of serving as the official provider of tournaments' tennis balls, hoping to increase their market share in a global marketplace that sells $1.5 billion worth of balls annually. With each tournament free to negotiate with any brand it chooses, Forbes estimates the biggest events on the calendar can fetch $200,000 to $500,000 annually, in addition to a supply of the 70,000 or so balls used during play.

This sponsorship free-for-all has become a hot-button issue for professional players since different brands make balls with slightly different weights, densities and felt—all of which affect how it feels to hit for hours each day. Balls have become a scapegoat for players' inconsistent performance and, increasingly, for shoulder, elbow and wrist injuries.

“A lot of players are adamant about the effects that changing balls week in and week out have had on their body,” says Chris Eubanks, a former Wimbledon semifinalist and the ATP's 160th-ranked singles player, who will serve as an analyst for ESPN at the U.S. Open next week. “At least give us time to adjust to the different balls so that we can make whatever modifications we need to. Then our bodies will naturally adjust.”

Andy Roddick, an American tennis legend who won the 2003 U.S. Open, put it another way on his Served podcast earlier this year. “Imagine if pitchers, what would happen to their elbows if the baseballs they were throwing [had] different weights?” he said. “Tell me that if you had to do that professionally, over and over again, in an extreme way, that those wouldn't affect your body differently.”

The ATP, which organizes the men's tour, had been hearing these complaints for years but felt powerless to address them until 2023, when it passed a moratorium on tournaments signing new contracts with ball manufacturers and secured the rights to negotiate future deals on behalf of all of its tournaments. After another quiet two years, the tour unveiled its grand plan in June, finally taking action to create some tour-wide consistency.

The catalyst, as it so often is, was money—or in this case, a lack of it.

While the ATP broadly oversees the events on the men's tour, each tournament is owned and operated by a different entity, each of which is naturally trying to maximize its revenue. Historically, tennis balls were too important a sponsorship category to disrupt. As recently as the 1990s, ball manufacturers were the title sponsors of some ATP Tour stops.

During the pandemic, however, differences between ball brands became more of a focus as worker shortages at rubber and felt companies and strained supply chains led to inconsistent quality. At certain tournaments, players reported low ball pressure and overly fluffy balls that were leading to more stress on the arm.

“Four weeks—four different balls. When are tournaments going to listen to players?” three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka wrote on social media in 2023. Nick Kyrgios, a player never afraid to wade into controversy, later posted, “The people who think balls aren't a big enough factor to result in an athlete being hurt are potatoes.”

By that point, the relative weight of tennis balls as a sponsorship category had decreased dramatically. At big events like Masters 1000s and Grand Slams, airline, banking and car brands today might pay ten times as much as ball manufacturers for their partnerships, and the tour also distributes more money from media rights and data collection deals, making ball sponsorships a less significant slice of the revenue pie. That new financial reality allowed the ATP to step in.

“Clearly it wouldn't have happened even 10 years ago,” says Geoffroy Bourbon, the ATP's executive vice president for Europe. “Now, it's become much easier to go to tournament directors and say, ‘Relinquish your grip on the category, and let's do what's right from a sporting standpoint.'”

The ATP now plans to divide the calendar into a handful of “swings,” such as the Australian hardcourt circuit in January or the European clay-court events in May, with the same brand of ball being used at each tournament within that stretch. Any existing sponsorships will be honored until the end of their current term, the last of which run through 2028, and as the tour negotiates short-term deals timed to expire simultaneously that same year, the ATP has guaranteed tournaments that any new deals will match or increase the revenue they currently generate.

""By creating swings, we've created a scarcity of opportunities to be present on tour, so that's the commercial leverage we have over manufacturers,” Bourbon says. “And they had the threat of what was going to happen in 2029 if they don't play along.”

About 25% of tour events were forced to change their ball sponsor, but “as long as the money stayed the same, we're happy,” one tournament organizer told Forbes. “Plus, now players can't complain to us—they have to complain to the tour.”

The manufacturers have been less receptive to the plan now that they will no longer be able to pick and choose which tournaments to sponsor. Instead of partnering with an individual marquee event or one that arrives at a strategic point on the calendar—for instance, one Masters 1000 tournament in the spring and one in the fall, for a six-figure combined sum—a brand might need to make a seven-figure offer to sponsor a swing of Masters 1000-, 500- and 250-level events.

“It wasn't ideal for them from a marketing standpoint, for sure, but at the same time they recognize what we're trying to do,” Bourbon says.

The ultimate goal, Bourbon says, is to provide manufacturers with objective, data-based player feedback they can use to improve the quality of balls, which in turn should raise the quality of play and limit injuries. But Bourbon is quick to shut down the suggestion that the ATP is going through all this effort out of the goodness of its heart.

“That's clearly a business decision,” he says. “When you end up not having your best talent show up at your most important tournaments because they've switched balls three times in three weeks and they've got a wrist ache, that is more important to us than $5,000 more here or there.”

In the short term, ball centralization remains an imperfect system. The four Grand Slams, for example, are not controlled by the ATP and still negotiate their ball deals individually, which could lead to a situation where players use a Dunlop ball through the clay-court swing and then a Wilson ball at the French Open. Meanwhile, tournaments with existing sponsorships will continue to disrupt the schedule for the next handful of years. And while the ATP worked with the WTA Tour for sponsorships at men's and women's combined events, the WTA continues to operate on a tournament-by-tournament basis for the time being.

For players like Eubanks, continuity can't come soon enough.

“When we're having two weeks on, three weeks off, back to Ball A for another week and then using Ball C for this week, it just continues to drive us crazy,” he says. “And we're already crazy enough.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","tennis"

 Brandon Nakashima returns to the site of one of his best Grand Slam showings: the US Open. Twelve months ago, the American upset Holger Rune and Lorenzo Musetti in a breakout fourth-round run at his home major. 

 Now firmly established in the Top 40 of the PIF ATP Rankings, the 24-year-old Nakashima will hope to channel home support once again to notch further successes in New York. ATPTour.com caught up with the American to talk his US Open memories, his approach to the stunning culinary scene on offer in ‘The Big Apple' and more. 

 Read more US Open insights and memories from ATP Tour stars in our ‘My US Open' series. 



What is your first memory of watching the U.S. Open? 
Growing up, I never went to it live to watch. But watching on TV, I remember always watching [Roger] Federer play there when I was super young. I would always wait until he was playing to turn on the TV, it didn't matter what time of the day. I think that was one of the earliest memories. 

What do you remember about playing it for the first time? 
Playing it for the first time, I remember it was in the men's qualifying when I was 16 because I won the National Boys' 16 and under and that got me a wild card into the men's qualifying. I remember winning the first round 7-6 in the third and losing the second round to [Ugo] Humbert in a pretty close match. I also remember playing juniors that year and I think making the second or third round. 

What was that experience like? 
It was an unbelievable experience. For any young tennis player to be able to compete at the US Open is super special. And for me, it was definitely very eye-opening to see how Grand Slams work, how all the players, top players, are going about their schedule every day there and just seeing their routines, and also with the fans there, too. It was the first time where I was playing with some big crowds and having that attention, so that was definitely a special experience.

What about the venue? Because you get there, you're coming from Manhattan, and you see Arthur Ashe Stadium.
That's also another thing. I remember going around the grounds for the first time and people are going crazy. There's a lot of music and loud support from all the fans across all the courts. That was something that I remember. It was like this huge event that I was playing in. And it was a shock for me at the beginning, too. 

Do you have a favourite court at the US Open? 
I've never played on Arthur Ashe before. I'd say favourite for me has to be Court 17. Last year, I had a couple of great matches there, had some great atmosphere on that court, too. That is definitely one of my favourites for sure right now. 

How about a favourite match that you've played? 
It has to be last year against Musetti in the third round. That match was one of the best atmospheres I've played in. People were going crazy all around the court, the whole match. I also had a lot of friends from college there and a lot of my family there. So that was one of my favourite matches in my career so far. 

A post shared by Brandon Nakashima (@brandon_nakashima)

What about the city of New York? How much do you enjoy that? Is there anything about it you like? 
I definitely enjoy it during the tournament there, just everything being so busy there. There's so much stuff to do when you're not at the courts, so many nice restaurants that we're able to go with the team, with some family and friends some evenings. It's always a nice time in New York. At the end of last year, I spent a couple of days in New York as well, so that was also nice. 

Are there any tourist attractions you like? 
I've walked around Times Square a bunch and Central Park, too. That's always nice and relaxing to walk around the park. Other than that, we've had a lot of great restaurants, a lot of great dinners there, so those are always fun times too.

Any favourite restaurant? 
I've been to Cote, it's a Korean barbecue place. I also know the owner of Fly Fish Club, which is also a great restaurant and I've had some great memories there. There are a bunch of restaurants that I would also like to try that are pretty famous.

With Wimbledon you think of strawberries and cream. What do you associate the US Open with? 
Probably the American fans. They definitely go crazy for the US players, which is always nice. And the atmosphere on the courts, especially at night, is something that you don't get anywhere else, I think.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

As is always the case with it being played the week right before the US Open, the ATP 250 in Winston-Salem didn't exactly feature a star-studded field, but it has still been a great week of tennis so far. With four players remaining it's anybody's guess who will take the trophy home. None of the four players left is expected to make big waves at the US Open given their recent form but a title here could well give them the necessary momentum for a run in the year's last Slam.

Head-to-head: first meeting

Both players are having very disappointing seasons but can turn them around for a title here. While Mpetshi Perricard is young and expected to have a long career as at least a solid ATP level player, for van de Zandschulp winning this event would arguably be the biggest achievement of his career so far. He has reached two finals, both in Munich, but is yet to actually win an ATP level event. Last year at the US Open he beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in what was undoubtedly the biggest win of his career, and he seems once again to be playing quite well at this time of the year. That said, this match is very likely to be closed by tiebreaks, and whoever can keep their composure and execute better in the biggest points will have the edge.
Prediction: van de Zandchulp in 3

Editor's Note: This article was accidentally published early. Marton Fucsovics had not yet won his quarterfinal match at the time of publishing. We will leave the article as is and will update if necessary.

Head-to-head: Korda 1-1 Fucsovics

While it's clear that his injury issues haven't helped, Korda hasn't really been able to deliver on the expectations many had of him. So far he has peaked at #15 in the rankings with only two titles, which is a disappointing resumé for someone with his level of talent and who has shown the ability to beat the likes of Alcaraz, Zverev, and Medvedev. Fucsovics is a veteran of the circuit still going strong, but the outcome of this match will depend mostly on what kind of level Korda can bring to the table.
Prediction: Korda in 2

Mariano Puerta's career was anything but ordinary. Born in Cordoba, Argentina, he moved to Buenos Aires as a teenager to pursue tennis professionally, inspired by countryman Guillermo Vilas. 

Results came quickly, especially on clay. As a junior, his biggest achievement was reaching the Roland Garros boys' final in 1995 against Mariano Zabaleta, though he fell short of the title.

Still, Puerta's promise was clear. By 1998, he broke through on the ATP Tour, capturing his first career title in Palermo, Italy, against fellow Argentine Franco Squillari. The year 2000 marked his real emergence. He was second only to Guga Kuerten in clay-court victories, winning the Bogota Open and reaching finals in Mexico City, Santiago, Gstaad, and Umag.

But Puerta's rise was derailed by a serious wrist injury while training with coach Hernan Gumy. The setback shook him both physically and mentally. “It happened while warming up with Hernan Gumy. First ball, he hit it softly, I set up my forehand, swung, and felt a tremendous pain. That year I ended up playing with injections. The injury got worse until we decided on surgery, which I had in the United States. That's when instability in my career began, along with mental struggles,” Puerta told La Nacion.

His return was rocky. Puerta later admitted it took him time to realize he needed psychological help. “In 2002 I wasn't bouncing back. I felt 100 percent responsible for the failure of my comeback after surgery. I was so aware of it that during many tournaments I was hurting myself on purpose—sometimes hitting balls out deliberately, not being humble, not chasing certain shots. It takes a lot of humility to succeed. Having so much success at a young age can make you arrogant. There was a moment when I said: ‘Either I forgive myself or this ends here. I couldn't go on like that,'” Puerta recalled.

By 2003, Puerta was rebuilding his form. But at the ATP tournament in Viña del Mar, after losing to fellow Argentine Agustin Calleri, he tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned substance. He was suspended for nine months.

“After that match in Chile, I had a doping test—everything seemed normal. Months later they told me it was positive. I thought, ‘What is this? Oh, the medicine!' I cannot believe it!,” Puerta said.

Cleared to compete again in mid-2004, Puerta mounted an impressive comeback. He reached the Buenos Aires final in 2005, then won his third ATP title in Casablanca by defeating Juan “Pico” Monaco.

That set the stage for the best run of his career: the 2005 Roland Garros. Puerta advanced to the final, where he faced a young Rafael Nadal, who was seeking his first Grand Slam title. Puerta stunned the Spaniard by taking the opening set 7–6, but Nadal stormed back to win the next three and claim his maiden major crown.

Days later, Puerta's career unraveled. A drug test from Roland Garros came back positive, this time for epinephrine. Puerta argued the trace amount found in his body came from accidentally drinking from his wife's water bottle, which contained medication.

The penalty was severe: an eight-year suspension, effectively a career-ending sanction. In 2006, the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced it to two years, allowing him to return in 2007. He won a Challenger in Bogota in 2008, but he never came close to his previous heights. In truth, that 2005 Roland Garros final would remain the defining match of his career—the peak and the turning point.

Despite the controversies, Puerta still left his mark on Argentine tennis. He reached a career-high ranking of World No. 9 in August 2005 and played a crucial role in Argentina's Davis Cup win over Australia that same year, teaming with David Nalbandian to defeat Wayne Arthurs and Lleyton Hewitt in doubles on grass.

A campaign group has said it will seek to take its legal battle over plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to the Court of Appeal after losing a High Court challenge.

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) previously took legal action against the Greater London Authority (GLA) over its 2024 decision to grant planning permission for the expansion, but Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge last month.

The proposals, submitted by the All England Club, would see the construction of 38 new tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, allowing it to host Wimbledon qualifiers on-site.

On Friday, SWP said that it had asked the Court of Appeal for the green light to challenge the High Court's ruling, a decision it said had “not been taken lightly”.

Jeremy Hudson, a director of SWP, said: “Above all, this is a public interest case. Planning is ultimately concerned with whether a development is in the public interest.

“The existence of rights of the public, imposed through the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants in the public interest, should plainly be very material to the planning decision.

“Unwanted development of public open spaces is proposed all over London: Wimbledon Park is just one example.”

Barristers for SWP told the High Court at a two-day hearing in early July that the decision to approve the plans was “irrational” and should be quashed.

They claimed that Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by trusts and covenants governing how it could be used.

The GLA and the All England Club defended the challenge, with the court told that the restrictions were not “material”.

In a ruling, Mr Justice Saini found that the decision to approve the plans was “a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors”.

SWP said on Friday that it believed Mr Justice Saini “took insufficient account of the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants”.

It continued that a decision on whether it could appeal against the ruling was expected later this year.

Among the group's supporters are comedian and writer, Andy Hamilton, and actress, Thelma Ruby.

Mr Hamilton said that the plans would come at “devastating cost to the local environment and community”, while Ms Ruby said that the plans would “desecrate a precious heritage landscape”.

The expansion proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure.

They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake.

After Merton Council approved the plans, but Wandsworth Council rejected them, the Mayor of London's office took charge of the application, but Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process after previously expressing public support for the development.

Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”.

Debbie Jevans, chairwoman of the All England Club, said at the time that the proposals would deliver 27 acres of “newly accessible parkland for the community”.

Following the ruling, Sir Sadiq said that the decision would “cement Wimbledon's reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world and London as the sporting capital of the world”.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","How to score Wimbledon tickets without spending thousands","https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/lifestyle/wimbledon-tickets-cost-lottery/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:02:17 GMT","

There are few sporting experiences that truly live up to the phrase “once in a lifetime.” Stepping onto the grounds of Wimbledon is undeniably one of them. As the world's oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, it has been played on the same grass courts since 1877. 

For tennis fans, scoring tickets to Wimbledon feels like getting to immerse yourself in a grand British tradition. However, securing a seat at Wimbledon is far from simple. Whether you're determined to win the public ballot, willing to brave the legendary Queue, or considering a splurge on debenture tickets, the road to Centre Court is tough.

This year, in what felt like serving an ace to win, I snagged a last-minute public ballot ticket to the tournament. As applications open in September, the ballot is the best way to secure a ticket without breaking the bank.

The ballot typically opens in early September and stays open for two weeks to allow individuals to submit their application. It's a lottery system that allocates tickets at random, with no choice over the court or day, and limits tickets per household to two for the whole tournament.

Once closed, the drawings start later in October and continue through early spring, ending once all tickets are allocated. You will need to create a myWIMBLEDON profile through the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) website, which will be your hub for purchasing tickets. Sign up now to receive information on when the ballot goes live.

While the odds are very low of receiving tickets through the ballot, do not be discouraged. Unsuccessful applicants are placed in the Ballot Returns Shop, where tickets go if returned. Starting mid-May/June, you will see tickets start to pop up, with many being released closer to the start of the tournament, around the third week of June. 

This is how I got in: a last-minute single ticket coupled with a reasonable flight. My Centre Court ticket was £90 ($120), with prices starting at £55 ($73) and climbing through the tournament with a cap of £315 ($420). Seats are grouped based on rows, which will determine ticket price, and your seat number is only assigned once you purchase the ticket(s). The AELTC provides a full ballot pricing chart on its website to inform you of the pricing structure.

Tickets cannot be privately resold, which helps maintain lower ticket pricing and fairness of distribution. The person who purchased the tickets must attend and will be asked for ID at entry.

What to know:

For those seeking a more premium Wimbledon experience, Debenture Tickets offer more exclusive perks and flexibility. While not the budget-friendly route, Debenture Tickets can be legally resold and come with access to hospitality and amenity spaces. These are listed as premium seats, but the people I sat next to had purchased debentures, which goes to show that the ballot provides great seating choices. You can buy these through debenture holders and authorized platforms. (Starts around £1800 or $2,395).

A Wimbledon tradition on its own, the Queue is famous for its long lines and eager fans trying their luck to purchase day-of tickets. People camp overnight for these or start queuing in the early morning. Hundreds of tickets are distributed through this method, including the ability to purchase Grounds Passes, which allow entry to outdoor courts and grounds. If you purchase a Grounds Pass, you'll have the ability to watch tennis sitting on the Hill, and purchase tickets that have been given back to AELTC as ticket holders leave for the day. A Grounds Pass starts at £20 ($27), and the afternoon resale ticket is similar.

What to keep in mind: 

Though securing tickets required persistence and patience, the magic of my first steps past the purple and green banners, ivy-clad Centre Court, and the deafening roar from the stands made every second worthwhile.

Matthew Grover is paving the way for para standing tennis after taking to the manicured lawns of Wimbledon last week in what was an unforgettable experience at SW19. 

Grover, 31, who lives in Horsham featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Grover, who won the world championship doubles and singles title in 2024, was part of a para standing tennis exhibition match during the tournament and noted just how important it is to shine a light on the sport.

He said: ""Wimbledon is such an historic venue and so to be able to be in Play Your Way To Wimbledon just helps us show people who don't necessarily think that tennis is for them that they can play on these courts.

""It's a fantastic experience to see all the age groups and disability formats. For us as para standings tennis players, to show our sport on the same courts that so many pros have been on is brilliant.

""It brings disability sport to life and brings so much for visibility.

""I never knew about para based sport until London 2012 and I've now become world and European champion in singles and doubles as well as playing at the US Open in a couple of weeks time.""

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett OBE and Gordon Reid OBE were in attendance to cheer on the players at SW19 and offer their experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.

Campaign group Save Wimbledon Park has taken another step in its bid to block Wimbledon's expansion plans.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) approved plans last September for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which runs the Wimbledon Championships, to build 38 tennis courts and an 8,000-seater stadium on the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, nearly tripling its site.

But SWP, which has been fighting the plans since they were submitted back in 2021, has now announced it has applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The statement read today (22 August): “SWP's decision to make this application has not been taken lightly. However, it has been advised that there is a realistic prospect of success.”

SWP argues the scale and nature of the development is in breach of local, regional and national planning policies and would set a precedent for other green spaces in London and around the country.

Christopher Coombe, Director of SWP, previously told MyLondon that, if it goes ahead, would set a ""worrying precedent"".

Mr Coombe said: ""If it goes ahead, it spells real threat to so much green belt and open space all around London, and around the country, because the protections are enormous for this kind of open space, and the GLA has driven a coach and horses through that so far.""

A decision on whether it can appeal is expected in two to four months, with a hearing likely to be next year if it is successful.

Simon Wright, a member of SWP, previously told the LDRS the decision made by the GLA was ""the wrong one"".

He said: ""It's David versus Goliath on a massive scale. AELTC are incredibly rich, they're incredibly well connected, but they're a private members' club. There's no scrutiny of what they do, there's no accountability, and we think they shouldn't be allowed to affect so many people's lives for two weeks of the year. The other thing to say is we love tennis, we all love tennis, we just like tennis the way it is rather than the way they want to make it.""

Wimbledon chair Deborah Jevans said following the judicial review decision: “It is clear that we have a robust planning permission that enables us to create a permanent home for the Wimbledon qualifying competition as well as delivering 27 acres of beautiful new parkland for local people, providing public access to land that has been a private golf course for over 100 years.”

AELTC submitted a planning application for the project to Merton and Wandsworth councils in 2018, as the site straddles the boroughs. It was refused by Wandsworth but approved by Merton in 2023. The case was then considered by the GLA, which approved it last September.

Jules Pipe, the GLA's Deputy Mayor for Planning, said at the time the project would ""bring significant benefits to the local area, the wider capital and the UK economy, providing increased access to open green space and sport, new parkland and a host of new jobs"".

The top men's and women's tennis players are poised to go far at the 2025 US Open.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are expected to face off in another major final in the men's singles draw. 

Women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka isn't the betting favorite, but she should be considered as the top choice to win given her track record on hard courts. 

Upsets will happen in the first few rounds, but there shouldn't be dreams of an unlikely winner in either bracket. 

Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Jannik Sinner (+110; bet $100 to win $110)

Carlos Alcaraz (+175)

Novak Djokovic (+1400)

Jack Draper (+2000)

Ben Shelton (+2200)

Alexander Zverev (+2200)

The last seven men's singles major titles have been won by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. 

The two stars of the men's game are on track to face each other in another final in New York. Sinner is the No. 1 overall seed and Alcaraz is the No. 2 seed. 

Alcaraz has the more difficult path to the final with Novak Djokovic and the top two Americans, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, all in his side of the draw. 

The US Open has sprung more surprises than the other three majors in the past. Marin Cilic, Juan Martin Del Potro and Dominic Thiem all snuck in major titles during the Djokovic-Nadal-Federer reign. 

Fritz and Shelton are the two best long-shot betting options. Fritz made the final in New York last year and Shelton was a semifinalist in 2023. 

The two Americans probably have to get through both of Djokovic and Alcaraz just to get to the final, but it's worth noting that Djokovic and Alcaraz were both out by the third round in New York last year.

Sinner might be on cruise control until the final, which is bad news for whomever emerges from the gauntlet on the bottom half. 

The draw is favorable and Sinner is in solid form, so unless an upset occur before the final, the top-seeded Italian has to be viewed as the favorite. 

Prediction: Sinner over Alcaraz

Iga Swiatek (+250)

Aryna Sabalenka (+275)

Coco Gauff (+950)

Elena Rybakina (+1200)

Mirra Andreeva (+1200)

Naomi Osaka (+2000)

Madison Keys (+2000)

The last repeat women's winner of the US Open was Serena Williams from 2012-14.

That statistic doesn't bode well for reigning champion Aryna Sabalenka.

However, the top-seeded woman won three of the last five hard-court majors. She won twice in Australia and once in New York during that span.

Sabalenka is a lock to go far in New York. She's advanced to four straight semifinals at the US Open and she's made to the semifinals in seven of her last nine hard-court majors.

Iga Swiatek's had mixed results on the hard courts. She only has three semifinal appearances between Australia and New York and she's gotten past the fourth round just twice in six US Open appearances.

Swiatek reached the semis in every major so far in 2025, but she's far more vulnerable to an upset than Sabalenka on the hard court, which is why it's safer to bet on Sabalenka to win.

Australian Open winner Madison Keys and fellow American Coco Gauff will be tough to beat in Swiatek's portion of the draw.

Keys is a three-time US Open semifinalist and she should play freer in front of the home crowd with a major now under her belt.

Look for Keys to make a deep run, and if she plays well, we could see a rematch of the Australian Open final between her and Sabalenka.

Prediction: Sabalenka over Keys

...

On a rainy, nasty Wednesday night in Queens, Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed under a closed roof despite the start of the U.S. Open, the final tennis grand slam of the year, not officially beginning until Sunday. The week before the start of the tournament has, for the last several years, been known as fan week, where admission is free to check out qualifying matches and other ancillary attractions to boost revenue and provide a taste of the action before the real party begins.

This year, the United States Tennis Association conceived a move: shifting the mixed doubles tournament, previously treated as a relative afterthought, from the final week of the U.S. Open, where top players focused on their singles matches, to the main event of fan week. Sixteen premier duos competed on the two main courts — Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadium — in a shortened, TV-friendly format for a prize that increased from $200,000 to $1 million. It was an experiment to boost attendance, interest, and revenue during the Tuesday and Wednesday of a fan week that's always been treated like an amuse-bouche to the main course of the tournament's traditional fortnight.

Top players flocked to participate. We had teams featuring Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys, Gael Monfils and Naomi Osaka, and Ben Shelton and Taylor Townsend. And those were just duos that were bounced in Tuesday's first round.

More than 20,000 fans filled Armstrong on Tuesday, and 78,000 fans were on-site during the two days of competition, per the USTA, despite Wednesday being a washout that postponed qualifying matches.

""I don't think I've ever believed in an idea more than this,"" Eric Butorac, the USTA's Senior Director of Player Relations and Business Development, told Boardroom. ""I really thought this was going to be something special.""

When the team of Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper stepped out onto the court to face the duo of Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud in Wednesday's first semifinal, Ashe was as packed and boisterous as it would be for a main event night match in the quarterfinals.

""It was super loud and it was not quite as comparable as when I played the final here last year with the roof closed,"" Pegula, who lost last year's singles final to Aryna Sabalenka, said, ""but it was close. It was really fun. I don't think the atmosphere could really beat it.""

Although Swiatek and Ruud came back to win in a thrilling tiebreaker, losing to the Italian doubles aces Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, last year's mixed doubles champs, in the final, the event was an unqualified triumph.

""The feeling of walking into an arena, 24,000 seats at night under the lights, seeing young kids jumping out of their seats at 11 p.m. when a match point is saved,"" Butorac continued, ""that makes you feel pretty special.""

The stars came out on Wednesday, with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Anna Wintour, Ronnie Chieng, Matt Friend, Billie Jean King, Ilana Kloss, Christie Brinkley, Andy Roddick, Devon Walker, and Michael Longfellow taking in the action for an event that's largely been buried in the traditional tennis calendar.

""Andy Roddick commented to me,"" Butorac recalled, ""'I never thought I would watch three hours of mixed doubles and be completely captivated in the stadium.'""

Although the event offered tickets for free, the sales of food, beverages, alcohol, merchandise, suites, and hospitality generated additional revenue, something that was not possible even a year ago, when some of tennis' biggest stars were absent. The reimagined mixed doubles tournament was introduced in June, a month after the USTA announced an $800 million self-funded project to renovate Ashe, add a new level of suites, and build a new player performance center. Novel ideas and concepts, such as this mixed doubles tournament, would, over time, help pay for the upcoming improvements.

Butorac said, however, that the mixed doubles tournament and the renovations weren't connected in any way, and this initiative was simply shining a light on men and women competing on the court together, like the NBA did at the 2024 All-Star Weekend with Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu competing in a 3-Point Contest.

""I think it's great to be honest, playing on a big court in front of people,"" Draper said. ""I love competing, and it's such a good feeling to get the energy from the crowd. It'd be cool if all the slams did this.""

Not surprisingly, Butorac said he expects the U.S. Open to have a similar mixed doubles tournament next year. It checked off all the important boxes of a successful event. The matches were sold out and nationally televised. The crowds were authentically into it, and the packed concession lines provided a revenue boost to a tournament that was breaking financial records of attendance and sales on an annual basis. And the players loved the new format, too.

All in all, the mixed doubles tournament was a success on every front, and it should only be a matter of time before the three other grand slams follow suit as a new way to bring fans -- and their dollars -- further into the fold.

U.S. Open

The U.S. Open begins Sunday in New York City, and the draws for the men's and women's singles have thrown up some blockbuster first-round matches.

The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, analyze an intriguing draw, as well as offering some of their picks for the best matches of the opening days.

The main question for Novak Djokovic, comfortably the third-best player at the Grand Slams for the past year, was always going to be which order he would have to play the two guys above him.

When those two have been as dominant as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have shared the past seven majors, that's especially the case.

Advertisement

So for Djokovic, cast back in the role of men's tennis's “third man,” all eyes were on whether he would end up in the Sinner half of the draw or the Alcaraz one. Given their head-to-head record, he will surely be happier with Alcaraz — especially as he would not meet the Spaniard until the semifinals. Djokovic's No. 7 seeding meant he could have played Alcaraz as early as the quarters, as he did at the Australian Open seven months ago.

Djokovic won on that occasion, as he did in last year's Olympic final. The world No. 1, by contrast, dispatched Djokovic in straight sets at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon, and seems a more reliable bet to reach the latter stages of the majors.

Alcaraz has been slightly less consistent, falling in the second round at last year's U.S. Open against Botic van de Zandschulp. But he has also developed his serve into a pressure release valve, beaten Djokovic in two Wimbledon finals, and come through two potentially discomfiting matches against physically limited opponents to win the Cincinnati Open.

After being thrashed by Sinner at Wimbledon, Djokovic spoke about not having enough gas left in the tank to beat one, let alone both, of the current Big Two in men's tennis. If someone took out Alcaraz earlier in the tournament, that would be an enormous boost for Djokovic. Defeating Sinner would be an almighty task, but doing so after overcoming Alcaraz looks borderline impossible this year.

Others in the draw might have something to say about Djokovic's progress, especially Taylor Fritz, who would meet him in the quarters. But aside from a mid-match retirement against Alexander Zverev, the only player not named Sinner or Alcaraz to beat him at a Grand Slam since 2022 is Alexei Popyrin. When? Last year's U.S. Open, of course.

Aryna Sabalenka or Iga Świątek, the top two seeds, didn't want Coco Gauff in their half of the draw at the U.S. Open. Especially Sabalenka, who crumbled under the crush of a pro-Gauff New York crowd two years ago. Gauff can become a force in New York, and loves the atmosphere, especially at night.

But right now, she is in a vulnerable moment. Gauff hasn't looked convincing since the French Open final, and now she is reconstructing her serve. She's brought in the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who helped Sabalenka fix her serve three years ago when she was about where Gauff is now, double-faulting 20 times every match.

Gauff tapping MacMillan the week before a Grand Slam — arguably her most important tournament as the leading American — could be a sign she didn't think she had any shot of winning this thing, or maybe even winning matches, in her current state. She was ready to take the long view, trying to fix her serve so she can rely on it for 10 years instead of 10 minutes. That process starts now, even if a massive tournament is just days away.

If Gauff ends up in a semifinal against Świątek, she might feel like she has already won, because she will have registered more wins in one tournament than she has all summer, but solving her serve problems could take months. She knows that. Her team knows that. MacMillan knows that. He doesn't tweak and tinker. He re-teaches a repeatable, efficient motion. She doesn't have that. In her mind, getting it as soon as possible is more important than whether she can find a way to beat Świątek in one match in one of what will likely be 80 Grand Slams she plays during her career.

Aside from Sinner and Alcaraz, does anyone have a better chance of winning the U.S. Open than Ben Shelton? Or at least, reaching the final?

Shelton has only lost to Sinner or Alcaraz at the Grand Slams this year. He had good chances to take early leads in all three matches. Then he won the Canadian Open, which Sinner and Alcaraz skipped, making something of a statement.

Shelton, the world No. 6, would face Alcaraz in the quarters. It is not the easiest draw — he might have preferred landing in Taylor Fritz's quarter — but he would probably take it if it means avoiding Sinner. As for Fritz, he may have to go through Djokovic to make the semis and the world No. 4 is 0-10 against the Serbian.

The percentages would suggest all of this is moot. Sinner and Alcaraz are levels above everyone else — but things happen in New York. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal never faced each other here. It's the back end of the season. It's hot and crowded and noisy. It's the tournament with an “if-this-man-should-fall” vibe.

Sinner and Alcaraz are probably going to meet in the final but Shelton might fancy his chances on a hard court in front of a frothy Ashe crowd against Alcaraz — at least, more than against Sinner, who is 21-0 in the last three hard court majors.

Novak Djokovic (7) vs. Learner Tien: The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who hasn't played a singles match since Wimbledon, likely under the lights on Ashe, against a promising young American lefty with a knack for top-10 upsets on his favorite surface. Sign me up.

João Fonseca vs. Miomir Kecmanović: Fonseca is an outrageous 19-year-old talent from Brazil in his first U.S. Open main draw. There are an estimated 500,000 Brazilians in the New York area. This will be loud.

Coco Gauff (3) vs. Ajla Tomljanović: Gauff is beatable. Tomljanović ended Serena Williams' career on Ashe three years ago. She won't be afraid of facing Gauff and 24,000 fans



The women's draw looks bottom-heavy, with all three of this year's Grand Slam winners in that half. Gauff and Madison Keys are slated to meet in one of the quarterfinals, with Amanda Anisimova due for a rematch of the Wimbledon final that Świątek won 6-0, 6-0 a month ago. Świątek, full of confidence after winning at the Cincinnati Open, doesn't have too many banana skins until that point.

In the top half, Sabalenka will be pretty pleased with the three other high seeds being Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva — players she has a lot less baggage against than the quartet above, three of whom have beaten her at the slams this year. Sabalenka will want to avoid Elena Rybakina, a possible quarterfinal opponent. Rybakina thrashed Sabalenka 6-1, 6-4 in Cincinnati last week and is not afraid of the world No. 1.

In the fourth round, Sabalenka is slated to meet the big-hitting Clara Tauson, another player who has beaten her this year. Leylah Fernandez might also be waiting in the third round but if Sabalenka can get through that tricky mid-section, she would look a strong favourite to reach the final. For Świątek, she might relish the prospect of facing all these top players and acquiring the match-toughness that Sabalenka might get less of from her later rounds.

Lois Boisson and Victoria Mboko have made good on the wild cards they received from their national tennis federations this year. Boisson took hers all the way to the Roland Garros semifinal. Mboko took hers to the Canadian Open title.

Those achievements earned them the ranking points required to enter directly into the main draws without any charity. Both had to play qualifying at Wimbledon. Mboko survived. Boisson did not. 

Mboko's triumph in Montreal has earned her the No. 22 seed, supposedly protecting her from facing the highest quality opponents in the early rounds — no luck there. The 18-year-old has drawn two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejčíková in the first round. 

Krejcikova has not been in Grand Slam-winning form for a while and has battled injuries the past year, but she won three matches in Cincinnati. This might be a tough ask for Mboko, who could feel the pressure of expectation for the first time.

As for Boisson, can her game transfer to a hard court? She has drawn Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the first round. 

Of those just below Sinner, Alcaraz and Djokovic, Fritz and No. 5 seed Jack Draper are theoretically the most likely to have a deep run — not just because of their ranking, but their pedigree, too. Fritz reached the final here last year, while Draper was a semifinalist. Both look entirely at home on this surface and in these conditions.

Fritz appears to have a relatively straightforward passage to the quarters, with the out-of-form No. 16 seed Jakub Menšík the highest other seed he could face before then. He could also face the similarly out-of-form No. 21 seed Tomáš Macháč or Fonseca in the fourth round.

Meanwhile, Draper, who hasn't played since Wimbledon, has some dangerous opponents in his quarter. The exciting Canadian No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo is his slated third-round opponent, while one of the Italians, Lorenzo Musetti or Flavio Cobolli, could await in the last 16. Draper could also play the huge-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at that stage. He opens up against a qualifier or lucky loser.

Alexander Zverev is the No. 3 seed but has been unconvincing since reaching the Australian Open final in January. He has Alex de Minaur, Karen Khachanov, and Andrey Rublev as the highest-ranked players in his quarter. Were it not for his ropey form this year, he would be a big favourite to work his way through that and set up a likely semifinal against Sinner. But at present there are few certainties for a player who knows he needs to be more aggressive but fighting his more conservative instincts.

Venus Williams (WC) vs. Karolina Muchová (14)

The most exciting wild card in the draw by a distance, up against a player with a throwback game that wouldn't have looked out of place when Williams made her tour debut 31 years ago. Muchová was a semifinalist last year, and is a mighty fun watch — this should be very entertaining.

Barbora Krejčíková vs Victoria Mboko (22)

After her thrilling run to the Canadian Open title, Mboko is looking to back that up with her first run to the second week of a Grand Slam. A former Wimbledon champion and two-time major singles champion with plenty of know-how stands in her way.

Reilly Opelka vs Carlos Alcaraz (2)

OK, hear me out. I know recommending someone with as big a serve as Opelka's might sound like a wind-up, but he's also the classic “on his day” opponent. Even a five-time Grand Slam champion might struggle — or at the very least, be forced to produce some magical defense.

Despite the fact she's already earned millions in prize money

Pro tennis player, Sachia Vickery has clapped back at criticism over her OnlyFans account whilst she's playing in the US Open, describing it as the “easiest money” she's “ever made.”

Despite Sachia earning over $2 million in prize money throughout her career, she explained that the platform has massively helped her finically when she's not playing matches.



A post shared by Sachia Vickery (@sachiavick)



During a Q&A on Instagram, she discussed her OnlyFans account, which she set up seven months ago. She explained: “I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me.

“It's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it. I will never talk s**t about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook, really.”

Sachia Vickery currently charges $12.99 per month for her OnlyFans, with a representative for the tennis playing confirming that her content is more suggestive than explicit.



A post shared by Sachia Vickery (@sachiavick)



They stated that her content shouldn't be seen as “sex work” and clarified that there are “no full nudity or sexual acts performed” on her account.

The representative also went into further detail about why the tennis pro decided to start her account in the first place, saying: “Vickery was off [for] six months due to a major injury and in that time, OnlyFans was pursued, tennis was not stopped to go into OnlyFans.”

After her match at the US Open on Thursday, Sachia opened up more about her account, explaining that the adult site is “a great moneymaker.”



A post shared by Sachia Vickery (@sachiavick)



She told The Post: “Yeah, and another part of, you know, the tennis and OnlyFans aspect is that when you're on tour you're not automatically making a ton of money.

“Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. I've made great investments from the time I was young, so you know, it's like I'm fine.”

She continued: “So if I have another avenue where I'm able to make a lot of money to support that, you know, I don't see anything negative with it, personally.

“It's an expensive sport, so you know I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand.

“They think it's, you know, I'm just doing it to do it. It's a great moneymaker. It's a great investment. If I have the potential to make a lot of money on there, why am I not going to take it? It's it's giving me a better life.”

   10:58 EDT 22 Aug 2025, updated  12:03 EDT 22 Aug 2025    By JAMES COHEN, SPORTS REPORTER  

American tennis player and rising OnlyFans star Sachia Vickery has revealed the brutal financial truth that pushed her to launch an adult content career.

The 30-year-old returned to the court for US Open qualifying this week, beating Anastasiya Soboleva in the first round before losing against Germany's Ella Seidel.

While her comeback has made headlines, it's Vickery's lucrative side hustle that has truly set the internet ablaze in recent days. 

The Florida native, who charges $12.99 a month for access to what she calls 'content too spicy for Instagram', has faced sharp criticism since joining the x-rated platform. 

Some fans claim she's tarnishing the sport but Vickery insists her OnlyFans success has helped keep her tennis career alive.

'When you're on tour you're not automatically making a ton of money,' Vickery told the New York Post from Flushing Meadows. 

'Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. I've made great investments from the time I was young, so you know, it's like I'm fine.

'But at the same time, tennis players spend $100K plus a year on coaching, hotels, food, training, physio. So if I have another avenue where I'm able to make a lot of money to support that, you know, I don't see anything negative with it, personally.'

Vickery has banked just over $2million throughout her 14-year career on the court. Outside of the sport, she demands a $1,000 deposit fee just to date her. 

'It's an expensive sport, so I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand. They think I'm just doing it to do it,' she added. 

'It's a great moneymaker. It's a great investment. If I have the potential to make a lot of money on there, why am I not going to take it? It's giving me a better life.'

Her OnlyFans platform teases her 'longest shower vid yet,' strip teases and 'spicier' pictures, while also asking her fans to rate her 'riding skills' as she shares risque videos and saucy snaps. 

'I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me 1,000 and we can make it happen my cashapp is $Sachiavick,' she told her 39,4000 followers during an Instagram Q&A session earlier this week.

While Vickery's move may have sent ripples through the tennis world, she has no regrets. She previously revealed that she's always seen herself as something of a revolutionary.

'I've always pushed boundaries,' she said on the Black Spin Global podcast earlier this year. 'I've always been outspoken about racial hate I get online, bodyshaming. I'm very open about a lot of stuff.

'I'm still playing tennis, my career is still going but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I'm starting to explore more opportunities on social media.'

'Obviously there are levels to OnlyFans, you have athletes like Nick [Kyrgios] and Alex [Muller] who are going to be posting tennis content for the most part and then you have the other complete extreme, which I'm not. I'm in that middle gap,' she added.

'I set it up in January and it just took off. Being a tennis player definitely helped my marketing. I'm at a stage where I don't do the absolute most on there but I'm comfortable as I need to be. I'm doing really well.

'Obviously, I'm going to get some negative feedback but that's just normal. Whatever you do in life there's always going to be some criticism. If I was doing nothing I'd be getting criticism, so I might as well get on the platform and make money while I'm at it.'

Yet as she stepped onto the Grand Slam stage in Flushing Meadows again this week, Vickery once again hit back at her critics.

'I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me … it's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it,' said Vickery when asked about balancing the two entirely different worlds together in an Instagram Q&A session.

'I will never talk s*** about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really.'

Vickery, whose father Rawle is a former soccer player and brother Dominque Mitchell played football at South Carolina State, turned professional in 2011 after training with USTA and Mouratoglou Academy in France.

But her career peaked back in 2018, when she managed a career-high ranking of World No 73.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

Tennis

One year ago, Taylor Fritz had a Grand Slam quarterfinal problem.

Four times he had reached the last eight of a major; four times he had lost. Notoriously hard on himself, the best American male tennis player of his generation did not wear that record lightly.

Twelve months on, Fritz returns to the U.S. Open occupying a different place in the sport's hierarchy, looking to end America's 22-year wait for a men's Grand Slam champion.

After reaching the 2024 final to break his personal glass ceiling, Fritz last month backed up that result with a run to the Wimbledon semifinals. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat him last year in New York, and this year in southwest London, world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz took him down. Everyone in men's tennis knows the feeling, and Fritz's progress over the past year means he will be the No. 4 seed this fortnight — the highest U.S. Open seeding for an American man since Andy Roddick in 2005.

“I've got to the point where it doesn't feel like it's such a big deal,” Fritz, 27, said during a news conference at Wimbledon.

“When you have that feeling, it allows you to play your best tennis in the situation and the moment.”

“Experience helps,” added Paul Annacone in a recent interview. Annacone, who worked with serial winners Pete Sampras and Roger Federer and is on Fritz's team led by Michael Russell, emphasized how Fritz's having been “to the rodeo once or twice before” means he knows what is required.

Fritz has never entered his home major as such a contender, despite a rough year featuring several injuries and some recent underwhelming results. A Cincinnati Open defeat to world No. 136 Terence Atmane followed a straight-sets Canadian Open loss against Ben Shelton, who is looking to usurp Fritz as the top U.S. player.

Striving to be the best he can be without putting suffocating pressure on himself, even during a run that falls below his standards, has been key to Fritz's improvement.

Four years ago, he wrote a note to himself: “Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f—-ing good, but 40 in the world, get your f—ing s— together.” By his own admission, he sets himself extremely high standards and can be “a bit delusional,” a quality that peers and friends, such as fellow player Reilly Opelka, remember from his junior days.

“I would say he's not delusional, I'd say he is very obsessed with trying to be as good as he can be,” said Annacone. “That focus is a huge asset if he maintains his balance, which he's starting to get.

“Now he gets annoyed when he loses and he's frustrated when we talk about it, but he can move on. That's the change. When you're not No. 1, tennis is a lot of getting your backside kicked for a while. So his obsessive, compulsive desire to win everything, to always win, to be better? It can burn you out.”

Fritz said during Wimbledon that in training, he's still as hard on himself as ever, but has learned to stay calmer during actual matches. He credits girlfriend Morgan Riddle with helping him stay focused and improving his results.

Fritz's game has developed along with his mindset during his rise to establish himself at the top of the sport. He has “graduated,” Annacone said, from relying on his huge serve. His backhand is rock-solid and his forehand is more devastating.

“He's done a remarkable job of having a crystal clear idea of what makes him the player that he is and not straying from it,” Jim Courier, a former world No. 1 and now Tennis Channel analyst, said in a phone interview during Wimbledon.

“The most important thing is his clarity of shot selection. It's when he is in an offensive position, whether it's the forehand or a backhand, trusting that his shots are good enough. Because they are, he can hurt you with both sides. The forehands come in quicker, but the backhand is pretty lethal, too.”

Fritz has also further developed what was already one of the ATP Tour's keenest tactical minds. His news conferences have become appointment viewing, as he thoughtfully breaks down strengths and weaknesses — his own, as well as those of his opponents. During the Wimbledon semifinal against Alcaraz, he hit a monstrous serve while holding set point in the fourth set. Alcaraz somehow returned it, then won the point, the set, and, with it, the match.

Fritz later blamed his attention to detail, saying he had tossed the ball an iota too far to his right. That meant he sliced it a little, so it curved through the air toward Alcaraz and gave him slightly more leeway to get it back.

Fritz “isn't going to do something just because you tell him, you better be able to back it up,” Annacone said. His charge also shares another key characteristic with those two. “My number one trait that I look for is someone who's an unconditional competitor,” Annacone said. “This kid competes, I would argue, better than anybody.”

But having established his ability to compete with the best, Fritz now has to beat them. Sinner was much too good in last year's final, winning in straight sets, and Fritz has admitted to sometimes feeling powerless against Alcaraz. Last year's loss to the Italian still encouraged him because Fritz thought he had reached the final without playing that well.

At Wimbledon, things were different.

“The way I played the first two sets today, there's not much any opponent can do,” Fritz said after beating Karen Khachanov to earn the right to face Alcaraz.

Whether or not that's “a bit delusional,” self-belief has gotten Fritz this far, and each time he plays Sinner or Alcaraz, he learns a bit more about how to beat them. For 2025, if the U.S. Open draw goes to form, it would be Alcaraz first in the semifinals, then Sinner for the trophy, again.

This year's problem may be tougher to solve than last year's, but it's a far more preferable one to have.

NEW YORK — Tennis apparel sponsorship is a big business. It is also one that, among the top players, is dominated by a small group of industry titans.

Brands like Nike, Adidas and Asics provide the outfits for most of the top 100, with their recognizable logos splashed across the shirts and skirts of Grand Slam favorites.

But if one looks beyond that upper echelon and into the U.S. Open's qualifying tournament – where lower-ranked players compete for spots in the main draw – there's a world of local startups and small clothing businesses making their way into the booming tennis business.

For many players in the qualifying tournament, their apparel sponsors are companies local to their home country. These companies often specifically seek out their countrymen. 

“It's key to sponsor and help our Swiss players,” said Laura Tolub, the chief operating officer of Fourteen Company. Fourteen is a small sportswear brand based in Geneva, Switzerland, that sponsors a couple of Swiss players in the qualifying draw. “It doesn't mean we're only sponsoring Swiss players, but it's important to us to … be there for them.”

That country connection is often important on the player's side, too. Swiss player Marc-Andrea Hüsler, ranked 228th, won his second round qualifying match Thursday afternoon in Fourteen apparel.

“It's a Swiss brand, so I wanted to do something with the Swiss if possible,” he said about his decision to join the brand two years ago. “They were new and they were building up.”

They've built into a tight-knit community, according to Tolub.

“(Some players) want to have the feeling they are part of a family, which Fourteen is,” she said. “It's more of a family than a big brand.”

Arianne Hartono went a similar route. She is sponsored by The Indian Maharadja, a Dutch company known for its hockey clothing and based out of Nieuwkuijk, a small town of about 5,000 people.

“They were a very small startup, like three, four years ago,” Hartono said. “They approached me through social media, they just came at me and said, ‘Hey, we're a small company, we want to start coming into tennis.'”

She agreed, and their spiral logo was on full display as the Dutch player, ranked 158th, made her way into the third round of the qualifying tournament with a tight victory Thursday afternoon.

Other qualifiers look for the right fit beyond country lines. Argentine Marco Trungelliti, ranked No. 183rd, found one with personal ties.

His match clothes are made by a small upstart in Mexico called Lega, an apparel brand that's run by “a friend of a friend,” who the Argentine said he has become quite close with through their time working together. His shirts have been getting attention from keen-eyed fans – at the French Open, his top had a large Eiffel Tower design, and now in the U.S. Open's qualifying rounds, it's a Statue of Liberty.

“It's a complete new run,” he said of the New York City shirt, which was designed and manufactured by Lega specifically for his U.S. Open matches.

“I'm not a designer at all, but I had some opinions in there,” he said after winning his second round qualifying match. “But this one was completely on (the Lega designer), and I loved it.”

 Now firmly established in the Top 40 of the PIF ATP Rankings, the 24-year-old Nakashima will hope to channel home support once again to notch further successes in New York. ATPTour.com caught up with the American to talk his US Open memories, his approach to the stunning culinary scene on offer in ‘The Big Apple' and more. 

 Read more US Open insights and memories from ATP Tour stars in our ‘My US Open' series. 



What is your first memory of watching the U.S. Open? 
Growing up, I never went to it live to watch. But watching on TV, I remember always watching [Roger] Federer play there when I was super young. I would always wait until he was playing to turn on the TV, it didn't matter what time of the day. I think that was one of the earliest memories. 

What do you remember about playing it for the first time? 
Playing it for the first time, I remember it was in the men's qualifying when I was 16 because I won the National Boys' 16 and under and that got me a wild card into the men's qualifying. I remember winning the first round 7-6 in the third and losing the second round to [Ugo] Humbert in a pretty close match. I also remember playing juniors that year and I think making the second or third round. 

What was that experience like? 
It was an unbelievable experience. For any young tennis player to be able to compete at the US Open is super special. And for me, it was definitely very eye-opening to see how Grand Slams work, how all the players, top players, are going about their schedule every day there and just seeing their routines, and also with the fans there, too. It was the first time where I was playing with some big crowds and having that attention, so that was definitely a special experience.

What about the venue? Because you get there, you're coming from Manhattan, and you see Arthur Ashe Stadium.
That's also another thing. I remember going around the grounds for the first time and people are going crazy. There's a lot of music and loud support from all the fans across all the courts. That was something that I remember. It was like this huge event that I was playing in. And it was a shock for me at the beginning, too. 

Do you have a favourite court at the US Open? 
I've never played on Arthur Ashe before. I'd say favourite for me has to be Court 17. Last year, I had a couple of great matches there, had some great atmosphere on that court, too. That is definitely one of my favourites for sure right now. 

How about a favourite match that you've played? 
It has to be last year against Musetti in the third round. That match was one of the best atmospheres I've played in. People were going crazy all around the court, the whole match. I also had a lot of friends from college there and a lot of my family there. So that was one of my favourite matches in my career so far.

What about the city of New York? How much do you enjoy that? Is there anything about it you like? 
I definitely enjoy it during the tournament there, just everything being so busy there. There's so much stuff to do when you're not at the courts, so many nice restaurants that we're able to go with the team, with some family and friends some evenings. It's always a nice time in New York. At the end of last year, I spent a couple of days in New York as well, so that was also nice. 

Are there any tourist attractions you like? 
I've walked around Times Square a bunch and Central Park, too. That's always nice and relaxing to walk around the park. Other than that, we've had a lot of great restaurants, a lot of great dinners there, so those are always fun times too.

Any favourite restaurant? 
I've been to Cote, it's a Korean barbecue place. I also know the owner of Fly Fish Club, which is also a great restaurant and I've had some great memories there. There are a bunch of restaurants that I would also like to try that are pretty famous.

With Wimbledon you think of strawberries and cream. What do you associate the US Open with? 
Probably the American fans. They definitely go crazy for the US players, which is always nice. And the atmosphere on the courts, especially at night, is something that you don't get anywhere else, I think.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Tjen, Ito set US Open qualifying meeting; Valentova, Jones advance","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4346784/ito-tjen-set-us-open-qualifying-meeting-valentova-jones-advance","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:48:45 GMT","

An intriguing all-Asian matchup in the final round of US Open qualifying will take place on Friday as No. 3 seed Aoi Ito takes on fast-rising Pepperdine University graduate Janice Tjen for a berth in the main draw.

Ito, the unorthodox Japanese 21-year-old who has scored upsets over Jasmine Paolini and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova this summer, came through a see-saw contest over Spain's Guiomar Maristany Zuleta De Reales 6-0, 1-6, 6-1. Tjen notched her 99th match win since graduating last May 7-5, 7-5 over Poland's Maja Chwalinska, coming from 5-3 down and saving two set points in the first set.

Their first-time encounter will be one to watch not just because of their form but also their contrasting game styles. Ito attacks with her backhand while feeding her opponents an array of slices and high balls on the forehand wing; Tjen boasts a combination of a formidable forehand and a precise backhand slice, reminiscent of Ashleigh Barty. Both excel in the forecourt.

Tjen, 23, is bidding to become the first Indonesian player in a Grand Slam main draw since Angelique Widjaja at the 2004 US Open.

Valentova, Jones wrap up wins; Jimenez Kasintseva shines after rain

Wednesday's qualifying action was a near-washout due to continuous rain. Only eight women's matches were started, and none were completed; as a result, the entire second round is scheduled for Thursday, with the scheduled final round pushed to Friday.

Two of the most highly-rated teenagers in the draw were among those who had their matches delayed at a crucial juncture. No. 2 seed Tereza Valentova trailed Tatiana Prozorova 5-4 in the first set, while Emerson Jones led Laura Pigossi 5-4 -- having just failed to serve out the opener. Both returned on Thursday to wrap up their wins. Valentova, 18, sped through nine out of 10 games on resumption for a 7-5, 6-1 victory. Jones, 17, came through 6-4, 6-4.

Australia's Jones will next face another former junior No. 1, Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva. The 20-year-old Andorran, who is bidding to become the first player from her country to compete in a Grand Slam main draw, trailed Astra Sharma by a set and a break overnight. However, on resumption she played with substantially more purpose and confidence to win 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.

It was a good day to keep up with the Joneses. British No. 1 seed Francesca Jones -- no relation to Emerson -- came through a remarkable second-set tussle to defeat Ekaterine Gorgodze 6-1, 7-6(11). She trailed the Georgian 4-1 in the set and 6-2 in the tiebreak, but saved five set points before converting her own fifth match point.

No. 86-ranked Jones extended her winning streak to seven matches (following her Palermo WTA 125 title in July), and will next face Arianne Hartono. The Dutchwoman defeated No. 19 seed Olivia Gadecki 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

Vandewinkel, Salkova escape from match points down

Two players came through the second round after saving match points. Belgium's Hanne Vandewinkel trailed No. 5 seed Viktoriya Tomova by a set and 5-3, but saved two on her own serve at 5-4 before roaring back to win 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. The result was the 21-year-old's first Top 100 victory, and puts her into the final round of a Grand Slam qualifying event for the first time. Though Vandewinkel has yet to compete in a tour-level main draw, she delivered an eye-catching performance in the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers by stretching Emma Navarro to a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 scoreline.

Czech 21-year-old Dominika Salkova reached the third round of Grand Slam qualifying for the second time this year with a marathon 6-3, 5-7, 7-6[8] win over Kristina Dmitruk, the 2021 US Open girls' runner-up. Salkova led by a set and 2-0, but ended up having to fend off four match points trailing 6-5 in the decider before edging the super-tiebreak.

Slovenia's Veronika Erjavec continued to deliver standout performances on the major stage, advancing 6-4, 6-4 past Canada's Cadence Brace. Erjavec qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the Australian Open, made the final round of Roland Garros qualifying and upset Marta Kostyuk to reach the Wimbledon second round as a qualifier. Her record at Grand Slams in 2025 stands at 11-3 so far -- compared to a modest 10-15 at all other levels.

The final qualifying round of the US Open is as follows:

[1] Francesca Jones (GBR) vs. Arianne Hartono (NED)[2] Tereza Valentova (CZE) vs. [18] Arantxa Rus (NED)[3] Aoi Ito (JPN) vs. Janice Tjen (INA)[4] Dalma Galfi (HUN) vs. [29] Panna Udvardy (HUN)Hanne Vandewinkel (BEL) vs. [27] Priscilla Hon (AUS)[6] Varvara Gracheva (FRA) vs. [20] Ena Shibahara (JPN)[7] Katie Volynets (USA) vs. Jana Fett (CRO)Destanee Aiava (AUS) vs. [21] Ella Seidel (GER)[9] Zhang Shuai (CHN) vs. Wei Sijia (CHN)Emerson Jones (AUS) vs. [28] Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva (AND)Alina Charaeva vs. [31] Wang Xiyu (CHN)[12] Darja Semenistaja (LAT) vs. Linda Klimovicova (POL)[WC] Ayana Akli (USA) vs. Oksana SelekhmetevaDominika Salkova (CZE) vs. [17] Rebecca Marino (CAN)Lucrezia Stefanini (ITA) vs. Hina Inoue (USA)[SR] Claire Liu (USA) vs. [32] Veronika Erjavec (SLO)

To win the title, they would need to topple Swiatek and Ruud, who first bonded over the clay-court swing when Ruud expressed his support for the former world No. 1 after a disappointing defeat at the Mutua Madrid Open. Competing together for the first time in Flushing Meadows, they shrugged off Swiatek's quick turnaround from winning the Cincinnati Open to beat both Madison Keys-Frances Tiafoe and Caty McNally-Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets. In the semifinals, they rallied from a set down and won the match tiebreak from 4-8 down to book their first mixed doubles major final.""It's been an honor and really fun to share the court with Iga and other players,"" Ruud said. ""It's the first time they're doing this. I know it's created a lot of reaction, somewhat bold to do it. You can't argue that it's not great for fans because you have full packed Arthur Ashe at midnight on a Wednesday of the quallie week. How often do you get that?""Errani and Vavassori initially appeared to have the upper hand as their doubles experience helped them capture the first set and take a 5-3 lead in the second. But just as the Italians looked to have the match sewn up, Swiatek and Ruud scored a crucial break as Vavassori served for the match, breaking Errani to force another Sudden Death.With the title on the line, Errani and Vavassori stepped up once more, showing superior net play to take a 9-5 lead on the Polish-Norwegian team, converting their second championship point when Swiatek netted a final volley.

We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Sara Errani

""In doubles is not just serving good, hitting good, returning good,"" said Errani, herself a former top tier singles player. ""There are many other things that are not easy. I think the doubles players improve that things a lot to see, to cross, many other thing that is not only hitting the ball.""We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Singles has other things and doubles has another things. We show that we are good on doubles, you know, to change the game, to know what to do.""While Errani and Vavassori will look to make a clean sweep when they enter their respective doubles events next week, Swiatek and Ruud will both feature in the singles. Swiatek will be the No. 2 seed after winning her sixth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon earlier this summer. Ruud, a former US Open finalist, is projected to be the No. 12 seed in the men's singles tournament.

""I don't really feel like I'm playing great tennis. At times, I am, but I feel very up and down, kind of sloppy, which I don't like. It really bothers me.

Valtteri Bottas has been linked with a seat at new team Cadillac in recent weeks – and his current boss Toto Wolff would support such a move.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff believes that Valtteri Bottas is fully deserving of a Formula 1 comeback, amid the Finn's links to the Cadillac F1 Team ahead of their debut 2026 season.

Bottas dropped off the F1 grid at the end of 2024, having lost a race seat at Kick Sauber, which led to him rejoining Mercedes in a reserve role alongside regular drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.

Although he has not been racing, Bottas is still playing a key role at the Silver Arrows – a team he previously raced with from 2017 to 2021 – through simulator work and his presence at the track.

With the aforementioned Cadillac team set to arrive on the grid next year, and 10-time Grand Prix winner Bottas one of the names being tipped for a drive, Wolff has shown his support.

“Valtteri has been part of the Mercedes family for a long, long time,” began Wolff, talking in a mid-season review video for his team's social media channels.

“He is a driver that, if some of our guys would have fish poisoning, you put him in the car and he's going to be absolutely on [the] pace. That's great to know, that your reserve and third driver is as quick as it gets.

“But obviously, with Valtteri, he deserves a race seat. Hopefully that door is going to open. Watch this space.”

Bottas himself has described Cadillac's project as “very interesting” – the operation being backed by TWG Motorsports and General Motors, and led by former Virgin Racing/Marussia chief Graeme Lowdon.

“[It's] something new to F1, an American team with maybe a different view to the sport,” he told F1's Beyond The Grid podcast earlier this year. “If I would be there as a driver, it would be actually very interesting because you can start from scratch.

“The team starts from zero. You could actually make a big influence on certain things, which direction to go, and that would be very motivating and rewarding when the success comes.

“I think the rule change is always a good point to jump in because you just never know, if you suddenly get it right you might actually be doing really well from the get-go.”

Along with Bottas, another experienced pair of hands in former Red Bull driver – and six-time Grand Prix winner – Sergio Perez has been linked to Cadillac, who are yet to confirm either of their two drivers for 2026.

It has been another encouraging season for Williams, but can they keep up the momentum in the second half?

Williams have continued their upward trajectory under team boss James Vowles in 2025, rising to fifth position in the Teams' Championship via some impressive points-scoring displays. But it has not all been smooth sailing for the Grove-based outfit, with a big second half lying ahead as they try to keep their midfield rivals behind. Here is the team's half term report…

Alex Albon – 5th in Australia, Miami and Emilia-Romagna

Alex Albon made a storming start to the 2025 season by scoring points in seven of the opening eight Grands Prix, kicking off with an eye-catching top-six grid slot and top-five finish amid tricky, mixed weather conditions at the Australian Grand Prix.

Albon added further P5 finishes at the Miami and Emilia-Romagna rounds, underlining his and Williams' impressive run, and thrice marking the squad's best result since George Russell's surprise podium in the brief, rain-hit 2021 Belgian Grand Prix.

Albon 8-6 Sainz

Williams served up one of the more intriguing intra-team battles for 2025 when they signed Carlos Sainz from Ferrari, giving incumbent Albon a multiple Grand Prix-winning benchmark to gauge where he stood some five years after being dropped by Red Bull's senior team.

While Albon managed to hit the ground running in a familiar environment, Sainz needed time to adapt to a different outfit and chassis/engine package – over one lap, that included an initial struggle to get the most out of the FW47 on Pirelli's soft tyres when it mattered.

Sainz made progress after a particularly puzzling experience across the first three weekends, though, to log four successive top-eight starts between Bahrain and Emilia-Romagna, and he entered the summer break just a couple of marks down on Albon in their head-to-head.

Albon 9-4 Sainz

There is more of a gap between the Williams pair when it comes to race days and points scored, with Albon's aforementioned run – which has helped him reach a mid-season tally of 54 points compared to his team mate's 16 – leaving Sainz in the shadows for the most part.

As per Qualifying, Sainz has been working hard to understand the nuances of Williams' challenger across a race distance – his best Grand Prix result so far coming through eighth-place finishes in Saudi Arabia and Imola, along with a P6 result during the Sprint in Belgium.

Both drivers' efforts have been impacted by a trio of retirements or non-starts so far, with their double elimination in Austria – Sainz due to pre-race brake problems and Albon due to in-race engine cooling woes – not counting towards the head-to-head score.

All three of Albon's top-five results could be thrown into the mix for Williams' best moment of the year, with Australia being a statement of intent, Miami seeing him beat both Ferraris and a Mercedes in the dry and Imola including a push for the podium.

Looking at the bigger picture, Williams moving up to fifth in the Teams' Championship following their double points finish at Jeddah delivered another landmark moment in a resurgence that is building more and more momentum under Team Principal Vowles, who arrived in early 2023.

To put it into perspective, Williams scored a combined total of 84 points across the seven seasons held from 2018 to 2024. Just over halfway into 2025, they are only 14 points off that number, having bagged 70 between the season opener and Hungary.

After such a competitive start to the season, Williams endured their first blip of the year across the Spanish, Canadian and Austrian Grand Prix weekends, where they scored just one point with Sainz and saw Albon retire from all three – two due to his engine overheating.

Austria was a particularly painful event, with Sainz unable to even start when he got stuck on the grid, pushed to the pit lane and then withdrawn altogether, and Albon managing only 15 laps before Williams' season-long cooling problems reared their head again.

Thankfully for Williams, recent updates appear to have done the trick in terms of keeping car temperatures under control, something that could be vital if they are to hold onto fifth in the championship and achieve their best classification since the 2017 campaign.

While Williams have bigger ambitions and are already focused on 2026 and the rules reset, converting their current position – by keeping Aston Martin, Kick Sauber, Racing Bulls, Haas and Alpine behind them – would be another clear message to the competition.

“It would mean the world to this team,” Vowles said of that coveted P5 spot in Canada. “It's a team that's been through so much hardship, so much pain, and it is great to see everyone's faces light up with how we're performing now. It means everything to us. I think it's a realistic proposition and it's one that we'll keep fighting for until the end.

“We have a few things coming; it's not the end of the road for this car, but we've put our wind tunnel focus on next year's car – we have to. It's an opportunity to reset and start again. Let's see if it's enough to hold our position. A few cars have had updates and we're still able to fight with them, so let's see how we get on to the end of the year.”

Legends Roundtable: 7 drivers with 14 World Titles talk Formula 1

25 years of team radio

With Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri proving a formidable pair for McLaren, the duo are emulating the achievements of strong driver line-ups from the team's past.

The first half of the 2025 season has seen McLaren not only carry forward their championship-winning form from last year but build on it even further, with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri leading a seemingly two-horse race for the title whilst also giving the squad a huge lead in the Teams' Standings.

Both Norris and Piastri have earned praise for their commanding performances along the way, making them a driver pairing that looks set to follow in the footsteps of other impressive duos to have raced for the Woking-based outfit over the years. As such, we've been taking a look back at eight of McLaren's strongest line-ups from seasons gone by…

Should Norris and Piastri seal the Teams' Championship for McLaren this season, they will be emulating the achievements of Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, the first drivers to take back-to-back titles for the squad back in the 1980s.

Prost had won a number of races with Renault when he arrived at McLaren in 1984 to partner the then two-time World Champion Lauda. It was Prost who triumphed at the season-opening race in Brazil, kicking off a campaign that would see the outfit claim victory in 12 out of 16 Grands Prix.

While Prost won on seven occasions in comparison to Lauda's five, the latter ultimately took the title by just half a point from his team mate. But the French driver did not have to wait long to achieve the feat himself, beating Lauda to the championship in 1985 before the Austrian walked away from the sport at the end of the season.

One pairing who just missed out on claiming consecutive Teams' titles – despite succeeding in the Drivers' Championship – were Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, who raced alongside each other at McLaren between 1996 and 2001.

During those six years, the partnership scored 30 wins between them including 13 1-2 finishes, as well as 33 pole positions. However, while the duo were a strong force, it was Ferrari's Michael Schumacher who ultimately became Hakkinen's main opponent for the title in 1998.

The Finn triumphed, McLaren taking both championships that season, while he went on to narrowly beat the Scuderia's Eddie Irvine to a second Drivers' crown in 1999. Though Hakkinen and Coulthard did not bring home another title in the years that followed – as Ferrari's period of dominance started to take hold – they ensured that McLaren remained the Italian outfit's closest challenger.

After Hakkinen opted to leave Formula 1 at the end of 2001, another ‘flying Finn' joined the team in the form of Kimi Raikkonen. But with McLaren struggling in comparison to the high-flying Ferrari – dropping back to fifth place in 2004 – title success again eluded the squad.

However, amid the introduction of new technical regulations, the team looked to be in resurgent form in 2005, a season in which they also welcomed race winner Juan Pablo Montoya as Raikkonen's team mate following Coulthard's switch to Red Bull.

The pair notched up 10 victories between them, two more than rivals Renault in a championship fight that saw them only just lose out to the French manufacturer. Things proved more challenging in 2006, a year in which Montoya exited midway through the campaign while Raikkonen went on to sign with Ferrari for 2007 – more on which in the next entry…

Following the end of the Raikkonen and Montoya era, McLaren made a bold move for 2007, recruiting reigning World Champion Fernando Alonso from Renault to be paired with a rookie by the name of Lewis Hamilton.

What came next was a memorable season in which both drivers fought for the World Championship alongside the Ferrari of Raikkonen, with an increasingly tense intra-team rivalry brewing along the way at the Woking-based outfit.

Alonso and Hamilton both lost out on the title to Raikkonen by one point and the partnership between them came to an end after just one season, with Alonso making an early exit from the team to rejoin Renault for 2008 – a year in which Hamilton would become a champion for the first time.

In terms of delivering championship success, the pairing of Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme – both proven World Champions – was an inspired move for McLaren in 1974.

Hulme opened the campaign with victory in Argentina – a win that would ultimately to be his last in Formula 1 – while Fittipaldi triumphed in front of his home crowd at the next event in Brazil. After standing on the top step twice more that year, Fittipaldi became a champion for the second time.

It was a first for McLaren, however, and the Brazilian racer's partnership with Hulme also brought home the squad's debut Teams' Championship. The outfit have gone on to clinch a total of nine in the time since, with their longest consecutive run of titles being kicked off by perhaps their most famous line-up…

Prost's second appearance in this list is of course alongside Ayrton Senna, a line-up that became perhaps the team's most famous. Following the exit of Lauda, Prost was partnered with Keke Rosberg and Stefan Johansson in 1986 and 1987 respectively before McLaren brought in rising star Senna for 1988.

The combination of Prost – by that stage a two-time champion – alongside the proven race winner Senna and the remarkable MP4/4 car led to a dominant campaign for the squad, with McLaren taking victory in all but one race while Senna beat his team mate to the title by just three points.

Tensions between the two drivers boiled over in 1989, culminating in a controversial collision in Japan that saw Prost seal a third championship. The Frenchman departed for Ferrari at the end of the campaign but the rivalry remained, while McLaren backed up the two Teams' titles won by Senna and Prost with another two in 1990 and 1991, marking their most successful championship-winning streak.

Another driver to make a repeat appearance in this rundown is Hamilton. Following two seasons racing alongside Heikki Kovalainen after Alonso's departure, the Briton welcomed a new team mate in 2010 in the form of Jenson Button.

With Button having just won the World Championship for Brawn GP, the all-star line-up paired the two most recent Drivers' title winners together and, during the three years that followed, the duo brought home a total of 19 victories for McLaren.

Title success ultimately eluded the team during this era, with Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull embarking on a run of consecutive championships. Hamilton started a new chapter with Mercedes in 2013, while Button remained with the squad and later went on to pair with another champion – a returning Alonso – in 2015 and 2016.

Unfortunately for Alonso, his comeback to McLaren coincided with one of the toughest phases in the team's history. A seemingly romantic reunion with Honda in 2015 – the squad's engine partner during the Prost/Senna years – quickly turned sour, leading to some challenging seasons for the outfit.

Following signs of progress amid a switch to Renault, the team went on to welcome a brand-new driver line-up in 2019 when Carlos Sainz joined with rookie Lando Norris. The duo's amiable relationship off the track made them a hit with fans, while their form on the circuit started to reap results.

After a P6 finish for McLaren in 2018, Sainz and Norris helped to elevate them to P4 one year on before going one step better to finish third in 2020, marking the squad's most successful championship placing in 10 years. And while the professional partnership ended when Sainz moved to Ferrari for 2021, the ‘Carlando' bromance appears to live on.

Legends Roundtable: 7 drivers with 14 World Titles talk Formula 1

25 years of team radio

After dropping off the F1 grid last year, Daniel Ricciardo is gradually telling more stories from his career.

Daniel Ricciardo has revealed the story behind the ‘Honey Badger' nickname he took on during his time in Formula 1, explaining that the animal represented his “alter ego” whenever he jumped into the cockpit.

Found across Africa, Southwest Asia and the Indian subcontinent, the honey badger is famous for its aggression, strength and toughness, with skin so thick that it can withstand various stings and bites.

Speaking in an interview at Ray White's Connect conference in Australia earlier this month, Ricciardo shared how his relaxed nature off the track, mixed with his hunger to succeed on it, led to the amusing label being adopted.

“Honey badgers are cuddly and cute, super good-looking,” he began with a laugh. “But when something takes what's theirs, they fight back, and I think that was sort of like my alter ego when I got behind the wheel.”

Given his easy-going ways, Ricciardo admitted that he had to work hard on extracting that alter ego, or “killer instinct”, as his F1 career developed.

“I have had a competitor in me since when I was a kid; I was always competitive in everything I did,” he commented. “But the killer instinct I needed to develop and work on extracting it out of myself. I'm naturally more easy-going.

“One of my first trainers at the time, Stu Smith, he really brought it out of me. I did have to work at it, but when I let it out it did feel kinda nice – it's nice to be a badass sometimes.

“I would use too much energy trying to be tough all the time because it's not natural for me. I would see other drivers who had that killer instinct from morning to night and I wished I could be like them.

“I think people would see me laughing and joking, and they would see that as weakness and underestimate me. But I would put the helmet on and think, ‘Okay, now it's time to be tough like the others'.”

Ricciardo's killer instinct was perhaps best represented through overtaking – the Australian catching the eye with an array of late lunges and bold passes across his career.

“There's a lot of drivers who could go on the track by themselves and be fast, but go on the track with 20 others and it's about race craft, and overtaking is a big part of that,” he emphasised.

“It becomes quite scary because there's some unpredictability and risk involved. You might be in third place and think, ‘Well, I've got a podium, do I need to risk crashing?', but it's the most fun, and I always thought it was better to crash than not try.

“It got to a point [where] to me it was just instinct. You accept that if it doesn't work you can be proud that you gave it a crack. I loved it, and I felt like the competitors would see me coming and knew I'd have a go, so I was already one step ahead.”

Ricciardo recently opened up about his journey of “self-exploration” since leaving the F1 world, with the 36-year-old “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing.

In just under a decade-and-a-half as an F1 driver, he amassed 257 starts, three pole positions, eight victories, 32 podium finishes and more than 1,300 points, while representing HRT, Toro Rosso (later AlphaTauri/RB), Red Bull, Renault and McLaren.

In an individual hearing, Menendez learned his misbehavior in prison and the killing of his mother 36 years ago were factors in the decision.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	Thirty-six years and one day after the Menendez brothers gunned down both of their parents in the living room of the family's Beverly Hills home, Erik Menendez sat before the California Parole Board and was denied bail for the first time, bringing a disappointing end to his unanticipated march toward freedom.


	Erik Menendez, the younger brother of Lyle Menendez, whose hearing takes place separately on Friday, sat at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, where he is incarcerated, for the 10-hour hearing via video link. Upon the denial of parole by the board, he was told he now has to wait another three years for his next chance at parole.

	Several reasons were cited for the denial, including burglaries that Erik participated in as a youth, prior to the 1989 double murder, as well as some of the 54-year-old's behavior in prison, which over the decades has included possession of contraband cellphones, inappropriate behavior with visitors, drug smuggling, misuse of state computers and an incident of violence. None of these were recent infractions, aside from his possession of a cellphone in January.


	One major aspect of his crime from over three-and-a-half decades ago did come up at the hearing.


	“The killing of your mother especially showed a lack of empathy and reason,” Commissioner Robert Barton told Menendez as he noted that while no longer a minor in 1989, he could have left his family home. The board then publicly acknowledged the abuse the brothers say they suffered at the hands of their parents. “We recognize and understand that many sexual assault victims find it hard to come forward, especially when the perpetrators are family members.”

	











	Erik Menendez, who, with his older brother, claims that Jose Menendez sexually and emotionally abused them for years while they were boys, explained why he was able to point a gun at his mother that night.


	“I saw my mother and my father as one person after I learned that she knew [about the abuse], so when I was running into the den, I was in a state of terror, of panic, of rage,” he said.


	Forensic evidence shows that Kitty Menendez crawled along the floor of her living room after being shot multiple times by her sons as Lyle Menendez returned to the car the brothers arrived in at home that night to reload the shotgun. She was finally killed by a gun blast to the back of her head.


	As his parole was denied, Erik was told that the heinous nature of the matricide he committed 36 years ago was not the main reason he was being denied bail on Thursday.


	“Contrary to your supporters' beliefs, you have not been a model prisoner, and frankly, we find that a little disturbing,” Barton said, adding: “We find that you continue to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.


	“You have two options: one is to have a pity party…and then you become a self-fulfilling prophecy, probably not getting granted [parole] next time. Or you can take to heart what we discussed. I hope that the people that are out there supporting you continue to motivate you,” Barton concluded.


	Indeed, the decision is a massive blow for those people. Many of the legion of supporters of the Menendez brothers and their release saw their potential release from prison as a correction of the injustice of their second criminal trial, in which they were denied any discussion of Jose Menendez's abuse, which ultimately kneecapped the brothers' defense strategy. Family members who rallied around the brothers in their fight for their freedom released a statement following Thursday's decision.

	











	“While we respect the decision, today's outcome was of course disappointing and not what we hoped for. But our belief in Erik remains unwavering and we know he will take the Board's recommendation in stride. His remorse, growth, and the positive impact he's had on others speak for themselves. We will continue to stand by him and hold to the hope he is able to return home soon,” it reads.


	Tomorrow, we turn our attention to Lyle's hearing,” the family's statement continued. “And while it is undoubtedly difficult, we remain cautiously optimistic and hopeful that the commissioner will see in Lyle what so many others have: a man who has taken responsibility, transformed his life, and is ready to come home.”


	The Menendez case reignited public outcry when Ryan Murphy's controversial, multifaceted take on their crime and its aftermath, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, hit Netflix in September. Javier Bardem, Chloë Sevigny and Cooper Koch (who portrays Erik) are currently up for acting Emmys for their performances, and the show took in a total of 11 Emmy nods overall, including for best limited series.


	This series and another documentary led the Menendez case to once again become a political football. Many still see the muting of their defense at their second trial in 1996 as an election-year act to get a guilty verdict and appease voters in L.A. after the O.J. Simpson verdict rattled the city; as the brothers came up for parole, conflicts involving the District Attorney's office once again became a factor. Los Angeles DA Nathan Hochman has spoken out aggressively against the Menendez brothers' potential release, and he was dealt a blow last month when the brothers saw their sentences reduced by an L.A. judge, who was responding to a request from Hochman's far more liberal predecessor.

	











	All of these factors led to a feeling among supporters that the brothers' story would conclude with their release on parole. Though this was denied for Erik Menendez, he still has one final hope. A clemency push has been made, and California Governor Gavin Newsom — who is considered to be the top contender for the Democrats to retake the White House in 2028 — can decide alone to grant it for the inmate. Until then, Erik Menendez can ask the parole board to review his case for errors, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Zach Cregger's sleeper hit is the second notable win for the horror genre this year following Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners,' which is likewise an original story. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Who says lightning can't strike twice and on the same Hollywood studio lot?


	On Thursday, writer-director Zach Cregger‘s Weapons became the second original R-rated pic of the year to achieve the $100 million milestone domestically after Ryan Coogler's Sinners at a time when the overall genre has come under siege. And it's a triple win on the horror front for Warner Bros.' film empire, led by Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy. The. main studio made Sinners, while New Line is home of Weapons and the R-rated Final Destination: Bloodlines franchise reboot, which surprised many in scaring up more than $385 million at the early summer box office. Like Bloodlines, Weapons is no slouch overseas for an early worldwide tally of $170 million or thereabouts.

Weapons achieved the $100 million North American milestone in its 14th day in release, compared to nine days for Sinners, which opened to $48 million in April. Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations when winning the Aug. 8-10 weekend with a $43.5 million domestic opening.

	The script for the creepy R-rated pic was the subject of a heated bidding war when the package hit the market. New Line and Warners prevailed over rivals after plunking down $38 million, including a $10 million payday for Cregger to direct, write and produce after he made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed. Sources say he commanded a $20 million fee for his deal to make Sony's next Resident Evil movie.

	











Weapons stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. (Madigan's performance as the ghoulish and creepy Aunt Gladys is already sparking awards chatter.)


	Yet there's another reason to be on the lookout for the unforgettable character. Multiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Warner Bros. and New Line are already talking with Cregger about making a prequel exploring the origin story of the strange aunt who suddenly arrives in town.


	One of Weapons' conceits is its chapter structure centering on particular characters, and sources say that Cregger actually had a chapter focused on Gladys and some of her backstory. He ultimately pulled that section from the script for length purposes. Now with the movie's wild success, that lost chapter would be expanded into a full-length story. Sources say no deals have been made, nor is there any timeline.


	That's partly because Cregger is already in prep on his next feature — he wasn't even in town for the opening of Weapons, as he was in Prague in pre-production on Resident Evil.


Weapons landed an impressive 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, an almost unheard of grade for a horror pic. Exceptions include Jordan Peele's seminal horror pic Get Out, which also earned an A- and made Peele one of the most sought-after directors overnight.

	











	Rival studios add that Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. It also got a coveted two-week berth in coveted Imax auditoriums. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening weekend gross.


	Heading into its opening this spring, Sinners had the advantage of being shepherded by Coogler, one of Hollywood's most proven directors and the filmmaker behind the Black Panther and Creed franchises. The pic also reunited him with his go-star, Michael B. Jordan. 


Sinners has grossed north of $278 domestically to become the first original movie since Disney's Coco in 2017 to earn north of $200 million in North America. And it has narrowly bested Jaws — not adjusted for inflation — to rank as the top-grossing R-rated horror film ever domestically, although its worldwide tally of $366 million puts it well behind Jaws' global cume of $477 million.


Weapons was the seventh Warner Bros. release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record. The studio is also getting ready to celebrate DC Studios' and James Gunn's Superman crossing the $600 million milestone on Friday, while F1: The Movie, released in partnership with Apple Original Films, should zoom past $600 million over the weekend.

“I'm so excited to be bringing Away From Home to the U.S., and for the first time, a two-day festival!” Tomlinson said in a statement. “Really honored and grateful to have such a strong lineup over both days, got a few things up my sleeve too. Can't wait to see you all there — it's going to be special!”


	Away From Home will be held on Oct. 4 and 5 at the Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown. Pre-sale tickets will be available on Aug. 26 at 10 a.m. ET, and general onsale starts on Aug. 28 at 10 a.m. ET. Full details for the festival can be found at its official website.

	Tomlinson launched Away From Home in London in 2021 as a means of celebrating the return of live music following the pandemic shutdown. Since then, the festival has traveled to Malaga, Spain, in 2022; Camaiore, Italy, in 2023; and Mérida, Mexico, last year, with artists including The Cribs, DMA's, Hinds, and The Vaccines among the artists who have performed at the festival.

	











	Since One Direction's final album in 2015, Tomlinson has released two full-lengths — 2020's Walls and 2022's Faith in the Future. Walls scored a No. 9 peak on the Billboard 200, while Faith in the Future did even better, reaching No. 5 on the albums chart three years ago. In May, Tomlinson shared photos of himself in the studio, presumably working on new music, to his 19 million Instagram followers.

More than 20 years after the icon's death, Exceleration Music's John Burk is reissuing four classic Charles albums under his original Tangerine label.


													By
												

	Steve Knopper



While producing what became Ray Charles‘ final album, Genius Loves Company, John Burk asked the soul music legend if he might re-sing a part. “No,” Charles said. “I ain't doing that.”


	Burk revisited the subject later, in a quiet moment at the studio, asking Charles to explain his reluctance. “It's about what I'm feeling, at that moment,” Charles replied. “That's what you want on the record.”


	Charles, of course, was right: Genius Loves Company, released after the singer, pianist and songwriter's death in 2004, went triple platinum and won the Grammy for album of the year. And Burk, a partner at Exceleration Music, remembered that conversation when preparing to reissue four albums from Charles' catalog of 60-plus releases earlier this year. The first, 1974's Come Live With Me, out today (Aug. 22), is what Burk calls a “heartbreak and sadness and loneliness album,” a gem that didn't make the Billboard 200. “It's one of the best examples of Ray truly expressing himself.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The album, Burk adds, is “ripe for discovery” and came out “when the marketplace was just so different than what he was doing. It didn't quite fit in certain charts and radio formats.”


	The four releases Burk has prepared are from Tangerine Records, Charles' longtime indie label, with which Exceleration partnered in 2021. An investment group formed by ex-execs from Concord Music Group, Merlin and others, Exceleration has spent the past five years investing in influential indie labels such as blues powerhouse Alligator Records, alt-country fixture Bloodshot Records and '90s-rock stalwarts Kill Rock Stars. After making a deal in 2021 with the Ray Charles Foundation, Exceleration rolled out reissues from the singer's vast catalog — the 90-track True Genius box set in honor of what would have been Charles' 90th birthday in 2020, then Charles' classic country albums such as Crying Time and the two volumes of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.


	Burk, one of five partners at Exceleration, says the upcoming Charles reissues — Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul is due Sept. 19, Love Country Style, Oct. 24, and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles, Nov. 21 — will be part of a long, gradual rollout of Charles' “massive catalog.” Although Rhino Records reissued much of Charles' catalog in the ‘90s with lavish CD packaging, Burk says, “There's a lot more to discover about Ray Charles than the public may know. A lot of this stuff's just not out.”


	Despite a long association with Atlantic Records, Charles spent much of his career as an indie artist, albeit funded by large corporations such as ABC and British Decca. Love Country Style, from 1970, is in the mode of Charles' 1962 masterpiece Modern Sounds In Country and Western Music and includes a bluesy cover of Johnny Cash‘s “Ring of Fire”; 1963's Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul, which hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200, opens with his classic version of Harlan Howard‘s “Busted”; and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles! is a new title compiling non-album singles from 1962-1965, including “No One” and “Something's Wrong.”


	Tangerine, named after Charles' favorite fruit, was not actually the original record company that released Come Live With Me — that album belonged to Charles' later label, Crossover, according to the singer's 1978 autobiography Brother Ray. The material on the other three reissues comes from ABC, which in the early '60s lured the singer from Atlantic Records, the label that made him famous. “Look,” he told ABC lawyers before signing, according to Michael Lydon‘s 1998 bio Ray Charles: Man and Music: “Since I'm producing my own music, I want to own my own masters.” Such a deal was unprecedented at the time, as labels have insisted on ownership of masters for decades. But ABC agreed — as long as the deal kicked in after five years.


	“He's just completely free and doing what he felt like doing,” Burk says about these recordings. “He built his own everything — his own record company, his own publishing company, his own management company, his own studio, his own tour bus, his own plane. He was completely independent.”


	Charles was with ABC from 1960 to 1973, and for the last five years of that deal, his music came out under the Tangerine-ABC label, according to Brother Ray, the autobiography written with David Ritz. He returned to Atlantic Records in 1977. “I loved Tangerine,” Charles said in Man and Music. “But to run a label, especially a small label, you have to keep your hands in it. I was spread too thin, but I wasn't about to give up my own music or going on the road. At least Tangerine didn't lose any money, and figuring in all I learned, I'd say we came out ahead.”

Mills most recently spent 15 years at Atlantic Records/Elektra and previously served as vice president of Adult Top 40 at Motown Records. –Jessica Nicholson

	Smith is in peak form on “Snowball,” featuring spiky guitar work from her longtime musical consigliere guitarist and co-writer Lenny Kaye and the urgent lyrics, “When it hits me I'm so amazed/ When it hits me I'm feeling crazed/ When it hits me I start to recall/ Memories flooding like a snowball running down a hill.”

	The anniversary edition will also feature RCA demos of the thrilling “Gloria” and “Redondo Beach,” as well as alternate takes on “Kimberly” and “Break It Up.” The album peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 in February 1976. It was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2009 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.

	











	In addition, on Nov. 4, Smith will publish her long-awaited memoir Bread of Angels, which is described by publisher Random House Publishing as the singer's, “most intimate and visionary work.” In it, Smith delves into her post-WWII childhood in working class Philadelphia and South Jersey, as well her teenage years, “when the first glimmers of art and romance take hold, her rise as punk rock icon to her retreat from public life when she meets her one true love and starts a family on the shores of Lake Saint Clair, Michigan.”


	The book, which also covers Smith's marriage to late MC5 guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith — its release date is timed to fall on the anniversary of Smith's 1994 passing — is a look at the pivotal early years when, “Arthur Rimbaud and Bob Dylan emerge as creative role models as she begins to write poetry then lyrics, ultimately merging both into the songs of iconic recordings such as Horses, Wave, and Easter.”


	The 288-page book is the follow-up to Smith's National Book Award-winning 2010 memoir Just Kids documenting her relationship with artist/photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as her acclaimed 2015 follow-up, M Train.


	Smith will embark on a world tour celebrating the Horses anniversary  this fall, kicking off a European run on Oct. 6 in Dublin, Ireland at 3Arena before moving to North American shores starting on Nov. 10 at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. The tour is currently slated to run through a Nov. 29 show at the Met in Philadelphia. She will be joined on the tour by Kaye and another longtime band member, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty, who both played on Horses.

It's the followup to her 2023 collection ""Bewitched,"" winner of the Grammy Award and a top 20 hit on the Billboard 200.

	Head's up, it's Laufey time.


	The Icelandic-Chinese talent returns with A Matter of Time (via Vingolf Recordings / AWAL), the followup to her 2023 collection Bewitched, winner of the Grammy Award for best traditional pop vocal album and a top 20 hit on the Billboard 200.


	For A Matter of Time, Laufey (pronounced lay-vay) tapped a pair of co-producers. Returning to the fold was Spencer Stewart, who worked with Laufey on her first two albums, while Aaron Dessner (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran) collaborated with the contemporary jazz star for the first time.

	Led by the singles “Silver Lining” and “Tough Luck,” A Matter of Time is a dreamy meditation, hugged with Laufey's jazz hands.

	“I'm constantly thinking about classical and jazz, how to properly preserve them and pay homage. For this album,” she explains, “I just wanted to let my heart wander.”




			Trending on Billboard		







A Matter of Time, like 2022's Everything I Know About Love and Bewitched is “for me is a blank book of stories to write,” she explains.


	In support of the new collection, Laufey took over the Grammy Museum's Ray Charles Terrace in downtown Los Angeles this week for Drop: Laufey – A Benefit Program, a presentation that blended new music, candid storytelling, and a touch of star power, as Selena Gomez watched on.


	Laufey Land, as she calls it, captured the imagination of the music business. Sources told Billboard that she sparked a multimillion-dollar bidding war in 2023 among record labels that have rarely seen so much commercial potential in a jazz-adjacent act. She went on to sign a global label deal with AWAL that allowed her to retain ownership of her work.

	











	Raised between Iceland and the Washington, D.C., area, Laufey (full name Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir) grew up surrounded by classical musicians, and counts Chopin, Liszt, Baker, Fitzgerald, and Holiday among her influences.


	As her story grew, Laufey was named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, was one of TIME's 2025 Women of the Year, she has sold out the Hollywood Bowl, Radio City Music Hall, and London's Royal Albert Hall; performed backed by the LA Phil, the National Symphony Orchestra, and the China Philharmonic Orchestra and is behind The Laufey Foundation, which has the primary mission of supporting young musicians with the resources they need, especially through youth orchestras, to reach their full potential.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED with Trump comments: The images on news networks Friday were of an ongoing FBI raid at the Bethesda, MD, home of John Bolton, former national security adviser for Donald Trump, and a frequent commentator and critic of the president's foreign policy.


	The AP and other outlets, quoting unnamed sources, said the raid was part of an investigation into the handling of classified documents. There also were reports that Bolton's office in Washington, D.C. was being searched.


	FBI director Kash Patel posted on X, “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.”

	Bolton has not yet commented. Earlier this morning, he posted on X of Trump's efforts to bring to a close the war between Russia and Ukraine.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Bolton wrote, “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede territory it already holds and the remainder of Donetsk, which it has been unable to conquer. Zelensky will never do so. Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress.”


	When asked about the search, Trump told reporters, “I know nothing about it. I just saw this morning. They did a raid.” Referring to Justice Department officials, Trump said that he previously told them, “I don't want to know. You just do what you have to do.”


	Trump, though, called Bolton “not a smart guy, but he could be very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”


	On CNN, anchors noted that the search got a signoff from a federal judge. But with few details of the reason for the search, some commentators raised concerns over the targeting of Trump's perceived enemies. Patel had previously listed Bolton on a list of members of what he called the “executive deep state.” Democrats highlighted the list in their opposition to Patel's confirmation as FBI director.

	











	Shortly after taking office in his second term, Trump removed Bolton's security detail, something that he had had because of threats from Iran, per CNN. Reporters gathered outside the home, along with podcast streamers. Ben Wittes, author of the Lawfare site, was the first with a camera outside, and then went live on Substack, per CNN, and later spoke to The Bulwark's Tim Miller.


	Also on the scene was attorney George Conway, a Bulwark podcaster and president of the Society for the Rule of Law.


	“The timing of this is chilling,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said of the search on CNN. He noted Bolton's criticism of Trump, including that he “practiced obstruction as a way of life.”


	In 2020, after Bolton left the Trump administration and published his book The Room Where It Happened, the Justice Department sued over its publication. Federal officials claimed that Bolton failed to complete a review process to edit out classified information. But the DOJ dropped the lawsuit the following year, and Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper, said that criminal grand jury proceedings also were ended.


	“We argued from the outset that neither action was justifiable, because they were initiated only as a result of President Trump's politically motivated order to prevent publication of the Ambassador's book before the 2020 election,” Cooper said at the time.

Poor Bolton, looks like that Captain Kangaroo reboot will have to wait.

Fascism pure and simple. Trump is using government powers to go after his critics.

The day of this monster's demise can't come fast enough.

What about when they raided Trumps place. Did that bother you also?

He took secured documents and REFUSED to give them back. And he stored them in his bathroom. Stop with the false equivalencies you ignoramus

Have fun waiting another 3 years!

The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducting an investigation of criminal conduct is now “fascism”? So we've been living under fascism since 1908, the FBI's founding. Pretty terrifying to learn this information. Thank you for notifying us.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit.


	In case you missed it when Deadline posted it on Monday, over the weekend I hosted a conversation with Seth Rogen and five other cast members of The Studio at SAG headquarters in the Wilshire District, and you can see that here. It was total laugh-out-loud with that group, as you can imagine. What I didn't print, and what was not on the video we posted, was equally hilarious — especially because Rogen had never been to SAG headquarters before, which includes the incredible new Meryl Streep Center for Performing Artists that's been built on the penthouse level. And it all provided some instant material for the comedy star.

	











	This center, named after the three-time Oscar-winning and 21-time-nominated star, has all kinds of rooms where actors can attend seminars, self-tape auditions, do voice-overs, take headshots and so much more. It also houses a screening room that seats about 100 or so, and that is where we showed SAG nominating committee members the final two episodes of The Studio‘s season and conducted the conversation — which, due to the limited size of the stage, meant three stars were on the bottom row and three others right above them. “It feels like we're about to play The Match Game,” Rogen cracked.




			Watch on Deadline		







	And before I could work in any questions, Rogen had some observations of his own on the size of the intimate theater in this facility named after Streep (the theater itself is named for Tom & Rita Hanks, who, like Streep donated quite a bit of money for the naming honor). “I would hope Meryl Streep had a bigger theater, if I'm being totally honest. This is it? What Meryl Streep gets is this? Is that Meryl Streep annex? Come on. Give the lady a full-size theater. You got, like, one-eighth of a theater here,” he joked.

	











	But when I mentioned this was all being recorded, he changed his tune a bit. “Wow, what a beautiful [theater]. … Don't worry, she's not going to watch this. I'm not concerned this is going to get back to her — like Meryl's just livestreaming her theater all day. Oh man, this could be an episode of The Studio, trying to hide from Meryl Streep! Anyway, congratulations. “

	Before the actual Q&A began, Rogen was noticing all the other areas of the Streep Center that had been donated by the famous, like the room named for now-divorced Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness, or, notably, the Ryan Reynolds & Blake Lively Balcony right off the Green Room.


	All of this inspired Rogen so much that he grabbed a marker and paper to rename the restroom after himself. Here is that photo. Do you think they left it up?


	This was all in good fun, and I have to say that what SAG-AFTRA has created with this Streep Center is remarkable — a way the union can help its members with all the practical needs for any actor. I have done a few of these conversations there for the SAG Foundation, and the actors who come in for those always leave impressed.


CLOCK IS TICKING FOR EMMY VOTERS


	We are still in crunch time for casting your Emmy ballot, with voting continuing only until August 27. This is why you are seeing so many contenders popping up anywhere they can still bring attention to their nominated work. Alan Cumming is the guest on today's edition of my Deadline video series Behind the Lens, talking about all aspects of his career including as host of Peacock's The Traitors, for which he is nominated for two Emmys. But he goes back in time to recall his first production of Cabaret on Broadway, where the PR representative welcomed him and he thought there wouldn't be much more to do. He says she corrected him and told him she would be seeing a lot of him in the next three months. “It's awards season!” she said. Cumming said he had never heard of an “awards season” before. He certainly has now.

	As this one winds down, it has become apparent we have some real horse races going on. Will it be Hacks repeating or The Studio cashing in a lot of those 23 nominations for its first season? Or, can The Bear make a comeback? This week the Television Critics Association recognized The Studio for best comedy but clearly showered the most love on The Pitt, with four major wins. Severance was shut out has double the number of Emmy nominations, so it looks like the contest for Drama Series is coming down to the wire with both shows firmly in contention. Could The White Lotus come back a la The Bear and triumph once again? Anything is possible, well except in the Limited Series race, where Adolescence has this thing in the bag.


OSCAR CONTENDERS, START YOUR ENGINES


	As the Emmys wind down, next week marks the official start of Oscar Season as Venice and Telluride kick off the Fall Festival circuit. No rest for the weary. Over the course of the next few months, one potential winner after another will be introduced. Some will fade quickly, others will be at the Dolby in March. But from the first eight months of the year, Warner Bros looks to be in the prime starting position with a couple of surprises from the horror genre — Sinners and Weapons — leading the pack of potentials, and Apple's summer smash F1, for which Warner Bros is handling the theatrical release. They are the only surefire Best Picture possibilities among movies that already have had a theatrical release. Last night at the DGA and Wednesday night at AMC Century City, F1 appeared to be the first on the Oscar track in terms of all guild Q&As for the industry. It is getting an early jump on the game. I moderated the DGA screening to a packed house and asked legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer — who was on the panel with director Joseph Kosinski, producer Jeremy Kleiner, casting director Lucy Bevan and supervising sound editor Al Nelson — why the Academy doesn't take these big, beautifully crafted movies more seriously.

	











	It wasn't until Top Gun: Maverick that Bruckheimer received the first Best Picture nomination in his career, and now there is talk for F1, both directed by Kosinski. “I wish I knew this. Then I could make those other kinds of movies he's so good at,” he laughed about Kleiner, who has two Best Picture Oscars for smaller films 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight, both for Brad Pitt's Plan B. “I mean, I love making movies that take you to another world and show you how it actually works as a process,” he said, adding that they worked three long years to pull F1 off, and now it not only is Apple's biggest success, but the streamer let the theatrical aspect play out to an astonishing (for this era) 58 days on an exclusive theatrical window. In fact, Kosinski announced that as we were at the DGA (and showed me on his phone), F1 officially debuted Thursday night on digital at a $19.99 rental price but still has no firm streaming date. It also is hitting $600 million at the worldwide box office, but most importantly, it is a film with emotion and humanity, and some terrific performances led by Pitt. Why shouldn't it be a contender?


	We shall see it and you on the Oscar season trail.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Fathom Entertainment‘s 35th anniversary rerelease of New Line's 1990 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cleared a good first week of $3.3 million, and exhibitors have asked, and will now receive, a second week of play of the costumed character pic.


	But there's more: Given the excitement over the first movie based on the Eastman & Laird 1980s comic book, Fathom, Saga Arts and Warner Bros are now planning to rerelease the 1991 sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze in March 2026.


	The original Steve Barron-directed film when released screamed to the world that, by God, there's a mega franchise in these turtles. Paramount has since absorbed the franchise and was behind a two-pic Michael Bay-directed live-action reboot as well as the 2023 animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which pushed $1 billion in global retail merchandise sales for that calendar year. The first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie opened to $25.3M and now counts a running domestic total of $138.6M. The 35th anniversary rerelease played in around 1,300 theaters this past week.

The Secret of the Ooze opened to $20M in 1991 and and finaled at $78.6M domestic. A third film that petered out the initial run of the franchise, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, debuted in 1993 to $12.4M and ended its run at $42.2M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	All in between both the Warner Bros and Paramount releases of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, the green guys have grossed $1.3 billion worldwide from seven movies. 

	











	”The devoted fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise have shown up in droves with so much passion and enthusiasm in celebration of the iconic film's 35th anniversary, Fathom Entertainment is thrilled to extend its theatrical run for a third time and add an additional full week in select theatres until August 28. Even better, we have confirmed with our partners that Fathom is bringing back the 1991 sequel to the big screen in March 2026,” Fathom CEO Ray Nutt said. “With $3.3M in box office revenues for the opening week of its theatrical return engagement, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 35th Anniversary is currently the highest-grossing 2025 classic/repertory film for Fathom Entertainment.”

Jeffrey Katzenberg Joins Kimbal Musk's Drone Nova Sky Stories: “A Spectacular Technology Platform” For “Family Branded Storytelling,” Ex-DreamWorks Boss Says","https://deadline.com/2025/08/jeffrey-katzenberg-joins-kimbal-musk-drone-company-1236494936/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:01:00 GMT","


					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	Without a doubt there are people who would pay serious money to see Jeffrey Katzenberg hanging out and trudging through the sand and dirt at Burning Man. 


	However, beyond the juxtaposition of the seemingly buttoned down ex-DreamWorks chief and the annual Mad Max-ish desert festival, Katzenberg himself is hoping there are millions who will pay to see drone-fueled storytelling light up the skies over deserts and stadiums around the world with Nova Sky Stories.


	“Dodger Stadium is the end goal,” Katzenberg told Deadline in a joint inteview with Nova founder Kimbal Musk company. “We're not going to get there in a heartbeat, if we haven't built the brand,” the WndrCo founder explains of the high-tech wares and big dreams of the Tesla board member's “spectacular technology platform.”

	











	With promises of a big new “Sky Story” next year, Katzenberg has joined Nova as an investor, a board member and self-styled strategic advisor, an injection that the younger brother of Elon Musk insists will take the company into the stratosphere, so to speak. Amid news of the team-up revealed Friday and plans for a $50 million funding round, Musk and Katzenberg sat down to talk about family entertainment in the sky, aiming high, Paul McCartney, Elton John and getting the show on the road this weekend.




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: I have to say to both of you, this was not on my bingo card for 2025. I did not see this partnership coming. So, can you give us a little bit of a sense of how it happened and how?












KIMBAL MUSK: Well, it started a few years ago. I bought a division of Intel doing drone light entertainment. Took it to Burning Man in 2022 and Jeffrey saw it there for the first time, and …


JEFFREY KATZENBERG: Dominic, did you know I was a Burner?


DEADLINE: One learns something new every day …


MUSK: And then Jeffrey and I have gotten to know each other. I was invited to, he asked me to do a show for a private audience earlier this year. I did an original story, and, the audience was blown away, he was blown away.

A post shared by Nova Sky Stories (@novaskystories)


DEADLINE: Which led to you guys joining forces so to speak?


MUSK: I just wanted his advice, because I have so much admiration for his work as a storyteller. Some of my favorite movies of all time are Jeffrey's movies. And during this process, he said, you know, maybe this could be a fun thing to join. So, he joined as an investor, but also as a strategic advisor to help us build a business and also build the creative now.


KATZENBERG: What he has, what will be revealed very quickly, is a spectacular technology platform that is these proprietary drones. They have been designed very specifically for this purpose — they are purpose-built for art. The features and functions around these are quite dazzling. So, it's not just blinking lights in the sky, but when you look at the complexity of it, think of it as an individual pixel. It is simply amazing in terms of what they are capable of today and what will be coming in the next generation of drones, which is literally next year.


DEADLINE: Ok, but I'm just going to be blunt with you: In today's America, a lot of people hear the names Katzenberg and Musk put together, and they're like, no, you must have a typo there. That can't work. So, how does the relationship work?


KATZENBERG: I will tell you this. There's not a meeting that I've had, not a Zoom that I've had, not a phone call that I've had with Kimbal over this last four or five months in which I hang up from it, and I have not been inspired. He is an artist. He's a creator. He's an entrepreneur, and he's a technologist. Yes, there is the name Musk, but I don't believe he has yet gotten the recognition that he is going to get from what he is doing, what he has done. And what he is doing is great. It's a privilege to be working with him.


MUSK: Thank you. Jeffrey, yeah, honestly.


	Look Dominic, I'm very good at technology, but it's not my love. I love the art form. I've been a musician my whole life, a storyteller. Now, because I've been involved in technology, what I end up doing in those companies, whether it's Tesla or companies I've been part of, it's always in product design. It's always in the customer experience. So, for me, Nova is this beautiful, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely dive in on the storytelling, artistic side of who I am, and it's just been wonderful, especially with Jeffrey now onboard.


RELATED: Fox Corp., Long A Streaming Skeptic, Steps Into The Arena With Launch Of Fox One


DEADLINE: So, you are stepping back from most of those other companies, with your brother, to focus on Nova now?


MUSK: Yes, except for Tesla. Otherwise, Nova's my passion, and I'm just so happy to have the opportunity to grow it. And Jeffrey's done this before so many times, and it just kind of is working out so well that he wants to do this with us.


DEADLINE: You know Jeffrey, after the crash of Quibi, and then the outcome of the election last year, where you were in the fundraising seat for Biden, the consensus was you were stepping back, out of the spotlight. This is very much stepping right back in center stage in many ways.












KATZENBERG: Well, my WndrCo is a venture fund that's doing a number of things and we are almost exclusively tech builders and investors. But I will say, this is the first thing that has come along that has really excited me for a while for a couple of reasons. One, Kimbal has pioneered a technology here that is spectacular, and that it creates a new form of immersive storytelling in a way that is just, it's just not there right now otherwise.


RELATED: Streaming Keeps Surging In July, With YouTube, Netflix And Roku Channel Hitting New Nielsen Highs


DEADLINE: To that, I know Nova has had some successes with concerts, aerial installations so to speak, but how do you plan to monetize this for the big leagues?


KATZENBERG: Dominic, you think today, there are two things that happened in stadiums today, which are mostly empty, yeah?


DEADLINE: Sure …


KATZENBERG: Epic sporting events and epic concert tours, right? If we succeed at, Kimbal's vision for this will be the third leg of that stool just a couple of years down the road.


DEADLINE: Alright …


KATZENBERG:  Let me give you two analogies that I've been using, because it helps people understand what we're doing and where we want to go.


	In 1990, I saw a short film called Luxo Jr and I was blown away by the potential of this absolutely complete breakthrough and spectacular innovation that John Lasseter and Steve Jobs created. Now you jump 20 years later, even more and you know that CGI animation has literally become the single most successful form of storytelling, consistently of any form of art, and it started with that film, that little, short film.


	I believe that is what Kimbal has created today, when he revealed to me not just these things that you're seeing, but what is coming within a year, 18 months. This is that kind of a breakthrough here, in terms of what he has he has created.


	So, that's analogy one that I would say to you, and the outcome here is which will go to story number two. 


	I remember going to see Elton John at The Troubadour here in L.A., a great show, but in a small club. Just a few years later, I went and I saw Elton John at Dodger Stadium. There were 60,000, 70,000 paying customers, one of the most extraordinary shows ever. With Nova Sky Stories, you're looking at Elton John today at the Troubadour. In five years, Kimbal is going to be at Dodger Stadium on the main stage. This technology and his storytelling are going to create an experience that will go to stadiums all over the world: football stadiums, soccer stadiums, racetracks, any place you can gather tens of thousands of people together.


DEADLINE: Ambitious, and on brand, one might say.


MUSK: And we're doing it now. This is a show we started last year. We sold 6000 tickets. We are on track to sell half a million tickets this year. We are flying this weekend alone because it's digital art, we have fleets all over the world. London, Nice, the Netherlands, San Francisco, Australia. I believe those are the five this weekend alone and each one of them is between 3000-5000 paying customers per evening.

A post shared by Nova Sky Stories (@novaskystories)


	Still, I look at it as it's like we're playing bars right now. Yeah, and we are not even in in the clubs yet and not the stadiums. We've worked with Paul McCartney, the NBA and others. We've worked with the greatest artists. What we have found, though, is that we can draw the audience with our own content, with our own stories, and it's just so much more fun.

	











KATZENBERG: It's also a much different business.


DEADLINE: How so?


KATZENBERG: It has been flattering and very valuable to build the brand by being, in effect, an opening act for some of the most interesting and talented and creative artists around the world in different settings. And we will selectively continue to do those things Dominic, as we build to Dodger Stadium.


	Dodger Stadium is the end goal.


	We're not going to get there in a heartbeat, if we haven't built the brand. Otherwise, how do we make sure we fill it? So, earning a reputation and dazzling audiences, you know, as opening acts is good, great. You know, how many opening acts do we know that have gone on to, ultimately, you know, be on the main stage themselves? Well, we have to earn our way there. We understand that that is part of brand building. But our objective here is a branded family entertainment with Nova Sky Stories, creating our own characters, creating our own stories here that build the IP of the company.


DEADLINE: To that, what's the takeaway five years from now?


MUSK: My takeaway is I want you to fall in love with one of our characters. Really emotionally connect with something in the sky that is two football fields high, two football fields deep, two football fields wide, as if it's a close friend.


KATZENBERG: It's what I've done before — help create Nova to be a great family branded storytelling company.

Retire already. Jeez everything he touches wilts

The guy just bounces from failed venture to failed venture. Outside of his run at Disney he's been a joke.

Yeah…this is the definitive “jumping the shark” moment for Burning Man. A great concept that was raped and destroyed by rich boys looking to make a quick buck at any cost. Pass. I'll take actual art over business masquerading as art.

Quibi 2.0

I'm so done with Jeffrey Katzenberg ventures. Add in a lesser Musk and I'm double out.

Yeah, this is the guy who single-handedly derailed and ruined Spielberg's career for decades (firing everyone who had worked alongside Spielberg for decades and then hiring Disney's cast-offs) and lost countless billions on his piss poor mismanagement of DW SKG. Along with his failed time at Paramount, Quibi, etc. ever since, it's no doubt he's glommed on to yet another obvious investor scam like this utter nonsense. Someone on Wall Street will fall for it, of course. And then everyone will cash out, again.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Tina Fey has passed on some advice to the Sky team behind Saturday Night Live UK.


	The 30 Rock star said the “dirty secret” of the NBC version of the show is that its infamous all-night writing marathons are not always necessary.


SNL writers traditionally pen sketches late into the night on a Tuesday before table reads on a Wednesday with the cast and guest presenter.


	“Here's a dirty secret: you don't have to do it that way,” Fey told the Edinburgh TV Festival, marking her first-ever visit to Scotland. “You could start in the morning.”

	During a conversation with Graham Norton reflecting on her career, Fey said it was “intimidating” joining SNL as a writer in 1997 and that the show “was still pretty male” at the time. She grew up watching the comedy and entered a “well-oiled machine.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Her comments come as Sky ramps up preparations for Saturday Night Live UK ahead of its launch next year in partnership with Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video.


	Talent scouts have been in Edinburgh watching comedy shows, while The Late Late Show With James Corden producer James Longman has been confirmed as showrunner (as first tipped by Deadline).


	Earlier in the week, Phil Edgar-Jones, Sky's executive director of unscripted originals, said he wanted the remake of NBC's iconic sketch show to bring “chaos” and “noise” to the screen.


	“It's exciting, a little bit scary as well,” he said. Edgar-Jones said the show will be true to the American original but “has to be a very British thing” if it is going to resonate with audiences in the UK.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian.


	In a highly-anticipated judgement that has felt years in the making, the judge rejected Clarke's claim for damages in a case against the Guardian's bombshell features that carried accusations of sexual misconduct from 30 women.


	The Doctor Who star had been seeking £70M ($93M) in damages. 


	According to BBC News, Clarke's team had said accusations that he was a “serial abuser of women” made across several articles and a podcast were false, arguing he was the victim of an “unlawful conspiracy” across days of testimony.

	In response, the Guardian's team defended what it said was a “careful and thorough investigation conducted conscientiously” by its journalists. There were 18 accounts of Clarke's victims given in court. The judgment found that the meaning of each of the newspaper's articles was “substantially true.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	According to the Guardian's write-up of today's news, the judgment means Clarke, who said his career had collapsed as a result of the articles, faces a hefty legal bill and may also be required to pay the bulk of the newspaper's legal costs.


	The story sent shockwaves through the British entertainment industry when the articles were published in summer 2021.


	Clarke had in the prior days been given an outstanding diversity award by BAFTA and the industry was blindsided by the news. It has since led to a reckoning over the way in which talent treats more junior staffers, with other scandals involving the likes of Russell Brand and Gregg Wallace only fanning the flames. All deny wrongdoing.

	











	Clarke created hit indie movie Kidulthood and had roles in the likes of Doctor Who, Star Trek Into Darkness and Viewpoint.

Hi BAFTA award was not a “diversity award”. It was for outstanding contribution to British cinema. Please stop weaponizing that word.

Bwahahaha!

Karma is tasty.

Well the Doctor isn't coming to save him this time.

“Well the Doctor isn't coming to save him this time.”

But after the story about the toxic culture during RTD's first time as showrunner when Clarke and others' toxic behavior was overlooked came out, the BBC immediately rehired him to save the show, calling it a “no-brainer.” As it proved to be…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","John Cena flexes his dramatic muscles in Peacemaker's confident season 2 premiere","https://www.avclub.com/peacemaker-season-2-premiere-recap-the-ties-that-grind","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

It's fitting that Peacemaker season two should focus on alternate realities and new beginnings, as change has come to define the DC Universe since we last enjoyed the sordid exploits of Christopher Smith (John Cena). Hell, even the streaming platform where our favorite antihero hangs his chromed helmet has rebranded in the interim. (Welcome back, HBO Max.) As the third installment in a revitalized DCU under the stewardship of series creator James Gunn, building on the momentum of Superman and last winter's Creature Commandos, Peacemaker returns energized by positive creative shifts and the new dramatic possibilities of its reality-hopping premise—plus, it still packs the chaotic punch that made its first season such a riot to watch.

For all the delays, it's comforting, and a little miraculous, that Peacemaker still rocks as thoroughly as it does. Story-wise, the fallout from last season's astonishingly violent Butterfly invasion sets a mood best described—at least in this week's premiere—as “gloomy.” Chris, along with his best buddy Eagly (a chirpy digital triumph voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), has relocated from that flag-festooned trailer from season one into his father's house, which he inherited after he killed Auggie Smith (Robert Patrick), the racist supervillain known as the White Dragon. This home is less a place for closure and one for tearing open old wounds, a dwelling where Chris can confront the regret and abuse that have since calcified into his toxic antihero persona, The Peacemaker. 

The gloom spreads to the surviving members of the “11th Street Kids.” Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), last season's reluctant sleeper agent, has embraced a new badass persona at the expense of domestic stability: Estranged from her wife (Elizabeth Ludlow) and now a private security consultant, Adebayo has found her swagger by losing the one person who anchored her. “I'm the hardcore shit now—that's what I do,” she says, awkwardly jamming out to Hanoi Rocks' “Don't You Ever Leave Me” in her beige-colored sedan and holding court in a filthy motel room, or “the worst level of Grand Theft Auto,” as Economos (Steve Agee) later puts it. Adebayo has evolved into a full-on Midwestern rocker washout, an unexpected turn for her character that Brooks manages to render both adorable and sad. 

Harcourt's (Jennifer Holland) life update is grimmer. She blames Adebayo's whistleblowing on Task Force X and her mother, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), for collapsing her career. “You suffer from a particularly severe form of toxic masculinity,” is her psychotherapist's diagnosis for this mid-life L, which Harcourt denies throughout the episode, bloodily taking her angst out on her car dashboard and a pack of barroom goons alike. The question lingers: Is Waller secretly blackballing her ability to get a job in the government? The “nos” piling up from the alphabet soup of U.S. agencies seems to suggest it, but maybe her shrink is onto something. Harcourt's inability to connect puts up some insurmountable barriers of their own. Take her and Chris's inevitable hookup after last season's victory (off-screen, on a party boat): Was this just an adrenaline-sating fling, or the beginning of something more? Why are Chris and Harcourt left to suffer their failures alone when the obvious path to happiness (or something resembling it) is staring in each other's faces? 

While Harcourt stalls out, Chris spots a chance to move up in the DCU, with Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn) inviting Peacemaker to audition for the Justice Gang. “I don't want to be a joke anymore,” he tells Adebayo as she drops him off. “This is all I've ever wanted, y'know? To be a real hero.” Fate, however, proves a harsh mistress: His interview—observed by an indifferent Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) and a mocking Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion)—goes about as well as you'd expect. It's hostile, degrading, and, once his body count (of both kinds) is questioned, demoralizing. “I don't want to be ruled by past experiences and anger” is his sincere confession, reduced to background noise amid fratty banter about asses and Hawkgirl's new carb-light popcorn diet. Chris goes home, defeated. 

This crescendo of failure erupts into the premiere's set piece: an orgy set in Auggie's living room, where breasts, butts, and swinging dongs flail about as Chris puts copious amounts of powder in his nose, a pity party for one in a sea of willing flesh. (Is this Gunn's sneering response to The Boys‘ Herogasm?) Despite his emotional isolation, Chris isn't completely alone: Economos surveys his home—between quizzing Vigilante (Freddy Stroma) on all things owls, natch—on behalf of Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo), father to Rick Jr. (Joel Kinnaman), who was killed by Peacemaker way back in The Suicide Squad. Flag's ascension to director of A.R.G.U.S. is an unexpected development following Adebayo's whistleblowing; he can now abuse the unit's resources to spy on his hated enemy, waiting for Chris to make one wrong move so Flag can cut loose with a long-gestating vengeance. 

As a second-season premiere for a rowdy superhero series, “The Ties That Grind” is a surprisingly lachrymose and tidy table-setter. Gunn indulges his usual shaggy-dog digressions—the Justice Gang sequence overstays its welcome—but the episode's function is primarily restorative, gathering its scattered, damaged cast and resituating them before the dramatic weight of Chris's reality-shifting discovery at the end of the episode detonates all over the place. For now, signs of Gunn's larger narrative architecture hum faintly at the edges: Cleavis Thornwaite (Michael Ian Black in Tucker Carlson mode) blares paranoia about breakouts at Belle Reve and Arkham Asylum (cameos forthcoming?), and we discover that Chris' interdimensional arsenal shares energy signatures with the pocket dimension Lex Luthor (Nicolas Hoult) used to rip Metropolis a new one during Superman. 

Parallel universes are narrative devices that literalize regret and rely almost entirely on easy gimmicks, like dramatic what-ifs, strange new character skins, and inverted pop-culture references. (The amount of hair metal discrepancies in Chris's parallel-Earth bedroom is fodder enough for its own article.) What will matter this season, not just for Chris but the series around him, is what Gunn mines from this premise, how he manages to poignantly explore the ache of what could have been while also carving out an R-rated alcove for his tawdry, Troma-tinted tendencies. Look at Cena's face as he crosses the cosmic threshold for a drink with his alternate-dad—lucid and free of hate—and his living older brother, Keith (David Denman). More than simply presenting the disparity of two lives, one with love and one without, this moment demonstrates reality's many injustices, where personal choices yield cruel, unbending consequences that reverberate across generations. Not too bad for a show that presented us an engorged dick just moments earlier.

Across his DC tenure, John Cena has nurtured Chris Smith from cartoon thug to a character defined by his hangdog, Keatonesque features, a maudlin bruiser whose granite-sculpted mug reveals vulnerability that transcends Peacemaker‘s rock-‘n'-roll bravado. The closing shot of Chris cradling his interdimensional doppelgänger's corpse, an awesome if existentially terrifying sci-fi beat, asks impossible questions of an unknowable future. Cena sells the moment. What kind of man was this? What might have been had love and stability been possible for Peacemaker? 

Cena weaves this speculative ache throughout the premiere. Chris is a man white-knuckling his way to decency, still undone by substances and sex, still haunted by the shadow of Rick Flag and his hate-saturated father. Yet the counter image of the man he could have been suggests new (and possibly shortsighted) possibilities for him. In this sense, Peacemaker has landed on its richest terrain yet. The DCU at large is still cooling after its seismic reset, experimenting with tone and grasping for coherence. Gunn doesn't stabilize things through grandeur; instead, he zeroes in on the smaller, more scalable intimacies of arrested development, thwarted love, the paths never taken—the elements that make growth possible. Its violence is still nuts, its humor still juvenile, but beneath this second season of Peacemaker beats a wiser, more chastened heart.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Lil Nas X reportedly arrested and hospitalized in Los Angeles","https://www.avclub.com/lil-nas-x-arrested-los-angeles","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:01:00 GMT","

Grammy-winner Lil Nas X was reportedly arrested and hospitalized in Los Angeles on Thursday morning. The LAPD didn't name names in its report on the incident—stating that a “nude man” had been arrested on L.A.'s Ventura Boulevard and then hospitalized on worries about a possible overdose in the early hours of the morning—but several outlets, including TMZ and The Los Angeles Times, have reported that the man in question was the “Old Town Road” rapper.

The Times notes that the musician was apparently walking down the street in briefs and cowboy boots, and was arrested on allegations that he had “charged” at investigating officers. (Per People, he's been booked on battery on a peace officer.) So far, representatives from the Montero musician haven't put out a public statement in response to the news, or to TMZ videos and photos that appear to show the incident in question.

The news comes during a somewhat fallow period for Lil Nas X, who exploded into the mainstream with “Old Town Road” back in 2019 and then managed to carve out a piece of the zeitgeist for himself with his sexually charged debut album Montero. (Named after his real first name.) Since then, though, he's released just a handful of new songs and music videos every year, while frequently teasing the release of his second album, allegedly called Dreamboy. (Fans had been wondering whether he was gearing up for some news recently, having done the standard “Wipe your Instagram and fill it back up with promotional posts” thing earlier this week, but if that's the plan, no actual concrete information—outside of teasing “Kimbo,” a Lil Jon collaboration that's been floating around for years—has emerged.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","HBO threatens us with the good time of a Nic Cage True Detective season","https://www.avclub.com/nic-cage-true-detective","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:49:00 GMT","

HBO's True Detective franchise has always prided itself on bringing in big-name talent to flesh out its various highly flawed crime solvers, with a frankly ludicrous number of current and future Oscar nominees and winners cycling through its anthology show seasons. Now the series is reportedly in pursuit of one of the biggest oddball movie stars of them all, as Variety reports that Nicolas Cage is in talks to star in a fifth season of the series.

Said season rests in the hands of Issa López, who previously showran the series through its fourth installment, Night Country (taking over for that other Hollywood Nic, Pizzolatto). Those episodes starred Jodie Foster and Kali Reis as its crimesolvers, investigating disappearances in a remote town in Alaska; the new season will reportedly mix things up a bit, instead zooming over to New York's Jamaica Bay.

Cage has reportedly been circling the part for a good long while, without ever actually sealing the deal. The actor is a relative rarity, these days, in being a big-name movie star who has not dipped a toe into television for a miniseries here or there; until he signed on to star in Prime Video's Spider-Noir series, set to come out some time next year, he'd never really been lured onto the small screen at all. That being said, he feels like a pretty natural fit for True Detective, which is usually as much about exploring its characters' fucked-up moralities as it is actual criminal investigation; it's not hard to imagine the guy who brought us Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call New Orleans fitting in with the show's roster of oddball cops.

Anthony Geary is paying tribute to the life and legacy of his beloved “General Hospital” co-star and friend Tristan Rogers. The actor, best known for his role as Luke Spencer, reflected with deep emotion after learning Rogers had died on August 15 at the age of 79.

Geary, 78, told TV Insider that news of Rogers' death left him “depressed,” but filled with gratitude for their time together. “I have great memories of him and always will,” Geary said. “I've always thought Tristan was a good actor, a very giving actor, and fun to work with.”

He added, “Working with him was an experience that I could always rely on to be funny, exciting, challenging, and infuriating — a perfect day's work.”

Geary first joined “General Hospital” in 1978, with Rogers arriving two years later in 1980. Their characters, Luke Spencer and Robert Scorpio, quickly became fan favorites as their storylines intertwined in thrilling adventures.

“Tristan was an enigma — comfortable enough to create a man of mystery,” Geary recalled. “The fun thing about working with Tristan is that he was unpredictable, always good for throwing in a surprise or taking a scene in his own direction. I always liked that.”

Though their characters faced plenty of drama, Geary said their on-screen relationship was built on a deep bond. “We didn't challenge Luke and Robert's relationship. It was a classic relationship with a couple ne'er-do-wells, who knew the worst about each other, but for the most part, remained friends anyway.”

Rogers' longtime manager, Meryl Soodak, confirmed his death and praised his contributions to the soap. “He loved being Scorpio, and he created that role from nothing,” Soodak told ABC 7 Eyewitness News. “He was supposed to work a day and he ended up making it into something huge. He was just a genuinely loyal, kind human being and he loved his family.”

“General Hospital” executive producer Frank Valentini also released a statement, calling the cast and crew “heartbroken.” He added, “Tristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio). Tristan was a one-of-a-kind talent and will be greatly missed.”

A post shared by finola hughes (@finolafilona)

Rogers' on-screen family also paid their respects. His TV wife, Finola Hughes, and TV daughter, Kimberly McCullough, shared emotional tributes online.

“Wish I could play one more scene with you, my friend,” Hughes wrote. “Serious about his work, but always a rebel. His own man, navigating the system, he protected me, protected Kimberly [McCullough], his character, his friends. God, he was a good one. Silly, funny, kind, serious.”

McCullough echoed the sentiment, calling Rogers a devoted costar who cared deeply for those around him.

Pop star Meghan Trainor is no longer “All About That Bass,” happily showcasing her fit physique and impressive strength in a new social media video on August 21, 2025. But many fans say Trainor, a season 22 advisor on “American Idol” who was very vocal about wanting to be the show's next judge after Katy Perry's departure, is nearly unrecognizable in her new post. 

Less than an hour after Trainor's post, hundreds had already liked one Instagram comment that said, “Wait that's Megan trainor? 😮” while others defended the singer, flooding her with compliments over her new look. 

In March, Trainor opened up about her weight loss journey, which has included “huge lifestyle changes,” from intense workouts to using the weight loss tool Mounjaro, telling People, “I have never been more comfortable in my body.”

A post shared by Meghan Trainor (@meghantrainor)

Trainor's August 21 video featured her take on the viral Nicki Minaj Challenge trend, which dares people to defy gravity by balancing on one foot, in a seated position, on top of random objects, per Today.com. Trainor was filmed in a workout room, calmly balancing on top of two dumbbells that had been flipped on their sides and stacked on top of each other. 

The singer quipped in her caption, “never again #nickiminajchallenge”

Trainor's post was instantly flooded with comments from followers. But the majority of the comments weren't about her impressive balancing act but, rather, about her transformed physique and face. 

“I didn't recognize you,” one person wrote, and another comment — liked by hundreds of followers — said, “Wow why does she look like a different person. This is not her”

One fan noted that Trainor looked more like Ariana Grande than herself, and another complained, “You are starting to look like everything you were once singing against. So much for self lov”e and empowerment…”

But Trainor was deluged with compliments, too, including one that said, “MOTHERRRRR YOU LOOK GORGEOUS 🥹🔥”

Someone else deemed Trainor the “prettiest girl on planet,” while another fan declared, “mama you look AMAZING 😍😍”

The comments from fans won't likely faze Trainor, who's been an open book about the tools she's used to change her look in ways that boost her confidence. 

“No, I don't look like I did 10 years ago,” she wrote on Instagram in May. “I've been on a journey to be the healthiest, strongest version of myself for my kids and for me.”

Trainor, who shares two young sons with her husband Daryl Sabara, wrote after being honored at Billboard's Women in Music event, that “it's a little disheartening that so many of the questions (and comments) were focused on my body instead of my music, my passion, or the decade of hard work that got me here. This is what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.”

Trainor went on to say, “I've worked with a dietician, made huge lifestyle changes, started exercising with a trainer, and yes, I used science and support (shoutout to Mounjaro!) to help me after my 2nd pregnancy. And I'm so glad I did because I feel great.”

“Here's to celebrating talent, growth, and the power of putting yourself first,” she concluded. “Let's keep shifting the convo to what REALLY matters.”

After HGTV shocked fans by not renewing at least seven long-running shows during the summer of 2025, viewers have been eager to know what will air in place of series like “Farmhouse Fixer” and “Bargain Block.” 

They now have their answer. On August 21, the network announced a slate of new series set to premiere in late 2025 and early 2026, in addition to renewing several popular series. 

In a press release, HGTV said it has ordered over 100 episodes of fresh content, including 60 episodes of renewed shows from popular personalities including Ben and Erin Napier, Alison Victoria, and Jasmine Roth.  

A post shared by Paul Head CSA – Reality Casting (@paulheadcasting)

Howard Lee, who oversees HGTV as Chief Creative Officer for US Networks at Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement, “HGTV's passionate fans tune in for our signature home renovation, real estate and design expertise, and they also want content that's unfiltered, escapist and fun. The network's large order of new and returning series has something for everyone.” 

That will include two new series with eye-popping titles — “Cheap A$$ Beach Houses” and “Tropic Like It's Hot.” The first, produced by Bodega Pictures, will premiere in late 2025 to “humorously show viewers how to own a slice of affordable paradise,” per HGTV. The production company posted a casting notice in May, looking for homeowners and realtors searching for beach houses on a budget to be featured on a new show “for a major network.”

The second just-announced series, “Tropic Like It's Hot,” from Leopard USA, will “put alluring destinations and luxury living in the tropics center stage for buyers looking to turn up the heat in life and love.” The show is expected to debut in early 2026. 

HGTV previously announced that another new series starring “Queer Eye” alum Bobby Berk will debut in  late 2025, with a working title of “Junk or Jackpot.”

HGTV has also ordered a new holiday series with the working title “Hoarding for the Holidays,” produced by Exit Four Media, and said it will continue its “White House Christmas” tradition with a one-hour special, though this year's hosts have not been revealed. 

As previously reported, HGTV has renewed multiple series that will premiere new seasons in the fall, including “100 Day Dream Home” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt, “Help! I Wrecked My Home” with Jasmine Roth, Retta's “Scariest House in America,” and “Fixer to Fabulous” with Dave and Jenny Marrs. 

On August 21, HGTV also announced that it has renewed “The Flip Off” for a second season starring longtime HGTV stars Tarek and Heather Rae El Moussa and Christina Haack, and “Renovation Aloha” with Tristyn and Kamohai Kalama for a third season. 

Alison Victoria also returns with a spinoff of her show “Windy City Rehab” — the Las Vegas-based “Sin City Rehab,” premiering on September 17 at 9 p.m. Eastern time. 

In its announcement, HGTV also revealed that a “Home Town” spinoff called “Home Town: Inn This Together” will air in 2026, starring Erin and Ben Napier.

Close to a year before Los Angeles welcomes the FIFA World Cup in June 2026, Snoop Dogg is already rallying his fellow Angelenos to get pumped up in a promotional video. The rapper and coach on “The Voice” has been named the official Community Chairman for the Los Angeles Host Committee. 

According to press materials distributed on August 12, 2025, Snoop will be highly visible before and during the global tournament, with eight soccer matches to take place at SoFi Stadium.

“This isn't just any tournament,” the Los Angeles native said in an announcement video. “This is the biggest event on the planet and it's coming to our city.”

As the Community Chairman for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee, Snoop will work closely with the events team, inspiring “countless Angelenos and fans of the global game” as part of “this once-in-a-generation moment,” per a press release. 

“L.A.'s ready to show up with that signature style, culture, and love for the beautiful game,” Snoop said in a video announcing his new role. “I'm here to make sure that the whole world has a great experience in our city and everyone in our community gets the chance to participate.” 

Officials said Snoop will “represent the tournament at community engagement and legacy programs,” including cheering on the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) in their first match on June 12. 

This isn't Snoop's first time representing the U.S. for a global sporting event. In 2024, he was an official torchbearer during the opening ceremony of the Paris Summer Olympics. He also served as a special Olympics correspondent for NBC, reporting in primetime from a wide variety of events with his signature enthusiasm and humor. 

Snoop was so visible during the Olympics that the BBC dubbed him “America's cheerleader.”

In addition to his new role with the FIFA World Cup, Snoop is also returning to “The Voice” for season 28 alongside fellow coaches Reba McEntire, Niall Horan, and Michael Bublé.

The coaches have already filmed Blind Auditions and Battle Rounds, and are due back at the studio to film the Knockout Rounds on August 28 and 29, according to ticketing manager 1iota. 

The new season is scheduled to premiere on September 22 with a two-hour Blind Auditions episod

It's 2004, and Avi Schwooper (Ben Feldman) is flying home for his little brother's bar mitzvah. Sitting next to him — on an era-appropriate plane with adequate legroom and extra seats filled by casually strewn bags and coats — is his girlfriend, Jen (Angelique Cabral), cradling a CD player in her lap, half-listening to Paul Simon's “The Obvious Child” and half-listening to Avi explain why the song is so good. 

“‘Sonny gets married and moves away'?,” Avi exclaims, quoting the lyrics. “He was just born! How did he– It's because that's time. One moment you're young, you're free. The next moment, Sonny gets married and moves away.”

It's 2022, and Avi Schwooper is sitting in his car, alone. The brown, bouncy curls once atop his head have tumbled down above his ears, leaving just a few strays to crown his suddenly expansive forehead. Jen is nowhere to be seen, but the song she was listening to on the plane is playing on the radio. Does Avi remember their conversation from 18 years prior? Does he recognize the lyric's intention has come to life — his life? Does he feel the same excitement over Simon's song now as he did then? 

 










It's hard to say, given the image lasts a few fleeting seconds, but the poignancy evoked is powerful. Even though Avi's expression is somewhat inscrutable, its dour contrast to his past exuberance is enough to make you reach for the tissues. Whether his life panned out as planned, whether he's still with Jen or once again on his way to see his family, there's a pronounced regret present in Avi's aging; in his abrupt transformation from bright-eyed twenty-something to a silent, solitary forty-something; in the inevitable passage of time, wrought upon Avi as it is wrought upon us all.

Such a reaction, brought about so quickly, would be easier to explain away if Avi's life was definitively a tragedy. Nobody wants to get old, get divorced, or get bald. That's sad! But “Long Story Short” brilliantly and repeatedly embraces the idea that the tragedy isn't found in life's disappointments; it's found in the fact that when it comes to life within a loving family, it will never feel like enough. What you get is largely beyond your control, and you'll always end up wanting more.

The same can already be said about the series itself. Raphael Bob-Waksberg's 10-episode first season is an immensely moving, blisteringly funny temporal travelogue. “Long Story Short” follows the Schwooper siblings across three decades, bouncing back and forth between childhood lodestars and adult crossroads, alongside their parents and partners, friends and enemies, children and one prominent uncle named Barry. The individual episodes engross you in an enchanting mix of absurd situational humor and customary family crises, with each nestled closely next to poignant reminders of time's passing. 

 










It's a savvy, almost inevitable structure for Bob-Waksberg to embrace, who's always loved classic TV sitcoms and long marveled at the tricky nature of time. Be it his landmark Netflix original series “BoJack Horseman” — which often mined BoJack's thorny past for clues to his present tumult, never better than in the Season 4 episode, “Time's Arrow” — or the time-bending magic trick that was “Undone,” the writer keenly identifies the power of accumulated experiences, especially as it applies to TV.

Why do people endlessly rewatch “Friends” and “The Office” if not to exist in a frozen stretch of pure joy? And why do those silly comedies carry such intimate significance for us if not for how long we've spent with them in our living rooms, season after season, year after year? Time is one of television's unique advantages as a medium, just as animation is an ideal medium for depicting temporal shifts without distracting makeup or CGI. 

Rather than mine nostalgia by resurrecting the past (as Hollywood loves to do these days), “Long Story Short” starts from scratch, building connections by telling a story uniquely unburdened by answering the question, “What happens next?” so much as it's doubly invested in the significance of each and every happening, minor and major, even the goofy ones — especially the goofy ones. 

 










For instance, in between Avi's 2004 plane ride that starts the episode's main arc and its last-second flash-forward to 2022, the premiere revels in the rapid wordplay of a gentile girlfriend meeting a vibrant Jewish family and the general tomfoolery of a jubilant bar mitzvah. Jen tries to make a good impression with Avi's mom, Naomi (Lisa Edelstein), by bringing her a vase, but all the put-upon mom can see is another thing for her to do. (“My parents taught me to never show up empty-handed,” Jen says. “So you show up empty-vased!,” Naomi quips back.) Elliot (Paul Reiser) is well-meaning and kind, but he's completely bowled over by his wife, and thus unable to offer the overwhelmed Jen any shelter.

Avi doesn't fare much better. The chaos of the Schwooper household is normal to him, and he quickly falls into familiar patterns: bickering with his younger sister, Shira (Abbi Jacobson); ignoring his wacky baby bro, Yoshi (the bar mitzvah boy); and letting his mother alternate between fawning over her beloved son and making him feel guilty for, well, everything.

But “Long Story Short” isn't beholden to any one perspective. Subsequent episodes are positioned behind Shira, as she tries to start a family with her wife, Kendra (Nicole Byer), or maniacally preps for a school pot luck. Other entries center Yoshi (and thus Greenfield's jaunty, vulnerable vocal performance), as he goes on a spontaneous first date across San Francisco or has to hide a sizable secret from his entire family. Each half-hour episode starts with a scene from childhood that frames the events to come, the bulk of which take place when the kids are at various stages of adulthood. 

 










There's a twist to the formula here and there, like when we get a brief glimpse of Naomi's upbringing to better contextualize her own parenting style, and future seasons could benefit from a bolder, less chronological approach to time's odd little loops and pivots. But as a foundation, the first season tills fertile ground with rich initial results. The cast is excellent, with Greenfield and Edelstein as stand-outs (and Reiser an exciting, underutilized option for Season 2). The humor is clever and sharp, with a half-dozen jokes per half-hour guaranteed to elicit a chuckle or more. (Just wait for the Gary Oldman line in Episode 5.)

And the animation, designed by “BoJack” producer and “Tuca & Bertie” creator Lisa Hanawalt, is an adventure all its own: Big, block colors and blurred background characters put extra emphasis on the leads and their chosen priorities, but a treasure trove of subtle jokes and telling details lie tucked away behind those focal points. (There's a “Rats” play poster, a la “Cats,” that feels ripped straight from Princess Carolyn's office.) The lighting and movement, framing and staging, all keenly evoke memories. Sometimes you're straining to put all the details in place, sometimes you're enmeshed in a fully-realized flashback. But no matter what, it's easy to get swept away. 

 










In “Long Story Short's” first scene, it's 1996 and the family is driving home from Naomi's mom's funeral. Avi tries to comfort his grieving (read: irritable) mother by saying at least his grandmother and grandfather are together again in Heaven. But Naomi isn't hearing it. “Jews don't believe in Heaven,” she says. “For Jews, we focus on this life,” Elliot says, eager to comfort his kids without lying to them. “You don't lead a good, meaningful life for some reward later. You lead a good, meaningful life so that you… lead a good meaningful life.”

Watching the series, it's easy to appreciate the value of a good and meaningful life. By the time the finale circles back to 2022, expanding on Avi's reflective moment in the car, it feels like you've known the Schwoopers forever, yet can't get enough. It doesn't matter if he's still married or long divorced, if he's on his way to see his family or about to move away. You want him to be happy, of course, but what you really want, knowing where that happiness stems from, is a little more time. 

“Long Story Short” premieres Friday, August 22 on Netflix. All episodes will be released at once. Season 2 has already been renewed.

Between Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey, Jodie Foster, Colin Farrell, Mahershala Ali, and Rachel McAdams, “True Detective” has a knack for getting big movie stars onto the small screen, and the latest could be someone who has only recently dipped his toes into television: Nicolas Cage. In fact, the actor hinted way back in 2023 that he may only have a few movies left in him and would've wanted to “have left on a high note” before turning to TV. 

Cage is in talks to star in the fifth season of “True Detective” for HBO, a source told IndieWire. This season is said to be set in the Jamaica Bay area of New York City, and showrunner and writer Issa Lopez, who took over for creator Nic Pizzolatto for the fourth season, “Night Country,” is back. Any other plot details are still under wraps.

HBO had no comment. 

The only other instance of Cage turning to television as the lead for a series still hasn't come out yet. That would be “Spider-Noir,” the live-action, black and white series for Amazon that is a spinoff of Cage's character in the animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” In it he plays a 1930s private investigator/superhero forced to grapple with his past life choices. The series is set to debut in 2026.

 










Not only was “Night Country” the most-watched season of “True Detective” in its four seasons, it also broke the losing streak for “True Detective” and won its lead Jodie Foster an Emmy and Golden Globe, the first time a lead for the series has won the top industry prizes. Cage would still be a Tony and a Grammy away from EGOT status if he managed the same, but we can dream.

Pizzolatto had teased that Season 1 stars McConaughey and Harrelson were interested in reprising their roles, with Pizzolatto saying he had another idea for their characters Cohle and Hart, but Pizzolatto last wrote for the series in Season 3. 

True to form, Cage has been plenty busy in both prestigious projects and lower-budget shlock, starring in last year's “Longlegs,” “The Surfer,” and “Arcadian,” as well as this year's “Gunslingers.” In addition to the “Spider-Noir” series set for next year, Cage is playing NFL legend John Madden in a biopic being directed by David O. Russell, he's starring in a sequel to “Lord of War” from Andrew Niccol, he'll appear in a horror film called “The Carpenter's Son,” and he's in post on “The Prince,” based on a David Mamet script.

Three-quarters of the way through Hand Habits' 2021 album Fun House, Meg Duffy let loose an unexpected wail on “Concrete & Feathers,” their voice twisting to an anguished howl. On their first few releases, Duffy had mostly sung in a hushed voice over intimate, introspective indie rock. But on their third album, they took bolder turns, occasionally bursting into instrumental catharsis—and pushing their singing to newly commanding territory.

Duffy doesn't make you wait until the final stretch of Blue Reminder, Hand Habits' latest record, to hear their voice reach such emotional depths. Opener “More Today” begins with a murmur: Duffy's soft singing over gentle strums; then the crunch of electric guitar, Wurlitzer, drums. Eventually, the instrumentation quiets, making way for Duffy's clear, strong voice: “I want it all or nothing,” they cry at the song's climax—like a starting gun for their most sure-footed, adventurous collection of songs to date.

It would perhaps be too easy to pin this newfound confidence on one specific source—namely, that Duffy wrote much of the album after falling in love. But here, love doesn't inspire grand declarations so much as quiet awe: “I want to wake you up/And tell you how I love you,” they murmur over a gentle brush of keys on “Dead Rat.” “Loneliness has disappeared,” they realize over the propulsive beat of “Bluebird of Happiness”; “I never thought I'd see the day.” They're also acutely aware of love's fragility—“I'm afraid of losing you/I'll do anything to prove my love is true,” Duffy admits on the title track—and of the struggle it took to find it. On “Way It Goes,” they're reminded of a past hearbreak, realizing that you can “lose your confidence for someone who doesnt give a fuck”; the track sounds woozy and warped, underscoring its theme of imperfect recollection.

The midsection of “Way It Goes” is haunted by a wash of flutes and a flutter of piano that spills into the following song, “(Forgiveness),” an instrumental track where a saxophone patiently meanders atop a steadying beat. Outside of Hand Habits, Duffy has a long musical resume—in their instrumental duo with Gregory Uhlmann; as a touring member with Perfume Genius and Kevin Morby; and as a guitarist on records from the War on Drugs, Weyes Blood, and SASAMI—and “(Forgiveness)” feels like a deepening of their genre experiments across those projects.

Though Duffy's voice and sensibility guide the record, the fingerprints of their musical community are all over Blue Reminder, including (among others) Uhlmann on guitar, bass, and percussion; Perfume Genius' Alan Wyffels on piano, Wurlitzer, and flute; producer Blake Mills on organ and guitar. Together, the band shapeshifts across a range of sounds. “Wheel of Change,” with its Americana lilt, swaggers forward then gets knocked off balance; closing track “Living Proof” is insular and subdued, with gentle swells of piano and synthesizer. Throughout, the record highlights Duffy's acrobatic guitar playing, like the playful riffs that tumble through the center of “Bluebird of Happiness” and the understated solo that patiently unfolds on “Quiet Summer.” The jaunty melodies on “Jasmine Blossoms” provide a sly contrast with lyrics about trying to “find a little joy” among the “ending of the western world.”

The album is rife with these dualities: how contentment can commingle with anxiety; how the past bears on the present; how new love can show up just when the world seems hopeless. In one short lyric, tucked into the aqueous synths and pulsating rhythms of “Beauty 62,” Duffy offers something of a mission statement for continuing to probe these paradoxes: “Songs bloom,” they sing, “from the wreckage.”

Consider the strange physics of being a passenger: You're at once in motion and at rest, paradoxically traveling without moving. Scenery hurries by your window. Sometimes your eyes unfocus, scanning a flattened blur of color; other times they might zero in on a road sign or a single leaf, following it out of frame. When you arrive, it's as if time and space are just behind your shoulder, catching up. That's the feeling of listening to That Wasn't a Dream, the spacious and surreal new album from Pino Palladino and Blake Mills. Each song achieves stillness through constant movement and resolution through continuous tension. Isolated melodies occasionally blend into a harmonic cloud before separating once again, drifting nebulously yet highly organized.

The jazz duo's first record, 2021's Notes With Attachments, mined similar territory, if a bit busier. Its compositions had the brisk motion of a crowded city sidewalk rather than the hazy liminality of a long train ride. Palladino, the 67-year-old Welsh sideman who's played with D'Angelo, Don Henley, and De La Soul, hooked his basslines around syncopated percussion and legato tones. Mills, a sought-after producer who's worked with Beck, Fiona Apple, and Alabama Shakes, carefully inserted staccato guitar plucks between the gaps in rhythmic lines. Alongside a who's who of contemporary jazz musicians, including saxophonist Sam Gendel and drummer Chris Dave, Palladino and Mills constructed wholly new shapes out of interlocking elements. On That Wasn't a Dream, they started with similarly complex arrangements but methodically disassembled them, leaving plenty of air between each sound. “If we could make something work with the least possible ingredients, space could become the centerpiece,” Palladino said in a statement. The result is a sparse, enchanting record where time passes circuitously and phrases brush against each other like branches in the wind.

The grooves on Notes With Attachments could be spiky and nonintuitive, locking deeper into place with each additional layer. Here, Palladino and Mills operate with more restraint, patiently allowing a pocket to develop from a small handful of notes. That often means spotlighting the drums for several bars, cyclical patterns settling like a topsheet wafted above a mattress. The first 10 seconds of “What Is Wrong With You” establish its lysergic lurch with a simple combination of quarter-note hi-hats and a gently swinging kick drum. Palladino's four-note bassline leaves a wide margin between the downbeat and the end of each measure; Mills' baritone guitar melody slithers into view, smearing the tune together like a gestural painting. Midway through “Taka,” a bubbling stew of electro-funk, the synth and bass drop out completely, leaving a drum-machine sequence and percussion that sounds like clinking wine glasses to churn in place unimpeded.

A large part of the album's magic comes from its textural palette. Closely recorded acoustic guitars sound like church bells; woodwinds resemble analog keyboards with the noise circuit cranked; human voices are mixed to the fore and kept dry, as if tracked in an anechoic chamber. Mills plays a fretless baritone sustainer guitar, which has an unclassifiable sound somewhere between a muted horn and a bowed bazantar. Gendel's signature mutated saxophone makes a few appearances, but he also crafts wispy, barely there synth pads and an electronic wind controller patch that mimics a harp. Songs can quickly swing from organic to otherworldly, like on “Somnabulista,” where a third of the way through, a flute and vocal refrain gives way to the uncanny, CGI fusion you'd hear on a Mark Egan record. It's bewitching; everything you're hearing is familiar but just slightly off.

The centerpiece of That Wasn't a Dream is the hallucinatory one-chord stunner “Heat Sink.” A chiming baritone figure reminiscent of Sam Wilkes' more sentimental moments carries through its entirety, and a single splashy cymbal marks time, keeping each instrument on a loose tether as it explores the outer reaches. The band members (including Palladino's son Rocco, also on bass) seem both locked in and completely independent, flickering around each other like atomic orbitals. Every few moments, distorted, overdriven melodies overlap and harmonize, resonant frequencies fusing into a softly glowing drone. “Heat Sink” is completely beguiling, a wall of sound that's equally mesmerizing if admiring its towering totality or scrutinizing every exquisite detail. It feels both longer and shorter than its 14 minutes, a trick that Palladino and Mills pull off on every track on the album; each lyrical passage is an instruction manual for experiencing nonlinear time. That Wasn't a Dream is music as quantum theory, using the expanse between speakers to pass through dimensions.

In 2018, SOPHIE and Liz reunited to make a follow-up to their 2015 collaboration “When I Rule the World” at SOPHIE's Nichols Canyon home studio. That song, “Sunscreen,” did not immediately see the light of day, though it leaked on streaming platforms and occasionally popped up in DJ sets. Now, Liz is back, and she is releasing the finished song to mark her return. Below, watch the song's video, shot on the Greek island of Mykonos. James Orlando directed it, and co-designer Renata Raksha drew from an idea conceptualized with SOPHIE.

SOPHIE's brother, Benny Long, and vocal engineer Suzy Shinn worked with Liz to complete the track. The song is also getting a vinyl release. “Sunscreen” is the latest in a string of posthumous SOPHIE releases, the latest being the self-titled album released last year.

Liz wrote on social media, “After all the years of rips, leaks, lore, and speculation, SUNSCREEN is finally here. SOPHIE always wanted me to put this song out, and I'm so grateful to Benny and Emily Long for being the loving and classy individuals they are, and for trusting me with the vision for this release.”

She added, “And to SOPHIE… your brilliance, your spirit, your friendship—I carry all of it with me. Thank you for believing in me. You continue to shape me and so many others; your impact is eternal. SOPHIE FOREVER.”

“﻿Liminal stands at the point of convergence between Lateral and Luminal,” Eno and Wolfe said in a statement. “If Lateral is a kind of landscape painting, a sonic place, Luminal is a dreamlike awakening, a feeling space. Liminal, the newest addition, is a hybrid of the two, a strange new land with a human living and feeling its way through its mysterious spaces.”

The artists continued, “Liminal is set in the borderlands between song and non-song (or ‘nong' as we call it), where the listener is exploring an intimate and unfamiliar new sonic world, as yet unclaimed, and still ambiguous.”

	In 2022, the Dallas MC BigXthaPlug released “Texas,” a slide-guitar-­accented boast celebrating his home state's largesse (“We still ride in ­swangas and put diamonds in our necklace”) and his own hardness (with a shout-out to former Dallas Mavericks player Luka Dončić). Its Southern-fried vibe and BigX's ­booming, honey-dipped voice helped put him on the radar of multiple artists operating in the country sphere, including Jelly Roll, who invited BigX to the Stagecoach festival. 


I Hope You're Happy is the result of that cross-pollination; it's clearly intended to appeal to country listeners who don't mind when Kane Brown or Morgan Wallen drop a hip-hop ­signifier or two into their songs. Trap snares flit around the project, but its heart is on Music Row, with stadium-­ready hooks sung by country chart-toppers like affable everyman Luke Combs and TikTok-born sensation Bailey Zimmerman.

	Much of Happy focuses on tear-in-the-beer heartbreak, although BigX's lyrical nuance adds depth to those feelings — on the title track, he circles the self-pity of Darius Rucker's drawled chorus with pulled-taffy vocals offering sincere well-wishing, while his hexing of an ex on the Ella Langley-assisted “Hell at Night” is ice cold. The project's most intriguing offering is “24-7,” a lusty country-soul cut with blasts of brass, a frizzled guitar solo, and an incendiary chorus belted by the singer-songwriter INK, a newly minted artist who's been writing hits (“Luther,” “Texas Hold 'Em”) for a minute.

	











	In a way, I Hope You're Happy is a temperature check for where country is in the back half of 2025. Raspy guys (Jelly Roll, Zimmerman, Thomas Rhett) are in, especially when they're brooding; alt-rock-­inspired touches like the stomping and hollering ­chorus of “Home,” which pairs BigX with genre-bending phenom Shaboozey, and minor-key maelstroms like “Pray Hard,” where Combs and BigX team up for a gratitude-fueled victory lap, are also hot. BigXthaPlug offers a compelling invitation to other artists who have been thinking about giving genre flights of fancy a shot.

A
va Max greets me in the lobby of her Los Angeles apartment building with a nervous smile, like someone about to rip off a bandage. For much of the summer, she's been MIA — vanishing from social media and seemingly abandoning the rollout of her new album, which drops at midnight. Fittingly, it's titled Don't Click Play, leaving fans to wonder if her disappearance was part of the plan all along.


	It wasn't.  


	Up until this conversation, Max has said nothing online about her album and what led to it. But, as she tells me in the elevator, “the silence has ended.”


	After a Fourth of July performance she now calls “uncomfortable,” Max vanished from social media and public view. She was facing intense online hate, had just cut ties with her managers at MDDN, canceled her fall tour, and began searching for a new team.


	“The change in management really shook the boat, then I just went silent,” she says. “I almost lost myself there for a moment with the transition. I don't know if I'm supposed to say it, but that's the truth. I want to be honest with you: This is a complete reset.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The music on Don't Click Play was also born from heartbreak. For the first time in her career, Max cut ties with Cirkut, her former boyfriend and longtime producer, and Madison Love, her ex-co-writer and former friend. (Both were staples across Heaven & Hell and Diamonds & Dancefloors.) While Max doesn't address it directly, fans have inferred that her single “Spot a Fake” — which was meant to be the lead single off this album, but didn't make the cut — is inspired by Love and Cirkut beginning to date after Max and the producer's breakup. 

	











	“I made this album because I wanted to prove that I can make the album of my dreams without my last collaborators,” she says, without naming names. “I know the fans know the story of what happened: I was betrayed and I was heartbroken, and I was really hurt.”

	Max was forced then to find a new production and songwriting team, and ended up finding Inverness and Pink Slip, who are credited on much of the project. Max says, “A lot of people thought I couldn't make another pop song without my last collaborators.” But Ava Max did and thrived. On Don't Click Play, she delivers her most dynamic and diverse body of electro-pop yet without losing the essence of the artistry she introduced on her early hits like “Sweet But Psycho.” It's the album she's most proud of, and she's ready to promote it full force. Her way. 


	It's been a messy journey to get here, but Max's wounds have healed. And she's ready to be real. From a lounge in her West L.A. apartment building, she speaks out for the first time.


Where have you been? How are you?I'm good. You're making me blush; this is my first interview back. I switched management mid-album cycle. I knew it was a really tough decision, and a lot of people were saying, “Maybe don't do it.” And then the other half were saying, “Yeah, you should do it, because you're not getting the proper support you need.” My support, I guess, it is just a little bit different than what I had in the past. I had to do a complete reset. 


What was that reset like?I had to go away from social media because all of the comments were just pretty negative. I got pretty emotional and down. I had to step away. I was trying to please everybody. I was being pulled from so many different directions. 


What's your response to the fan conversation about your well-being? Are you OK?I so appreciate how much they care and talk about my well-being. I'm just so grateful. I want to let them know I am OK. I'm more than OK.

How long ago was the management split?A few months ago. I was committed to doing the Fourth of July NBC performance, which I decided to go through with, even though I wasn't myself in that performance. I just felt uncomfortable because of the transition. So I decided to disappear. And, no pun intended, it kind of matches up with the album title.


So it was not intentional for you to leave. It wasn't intentional. It almost killed me not to talk to my fans. I want to connect to my fans, I want to talk to them, but it was bad. 

	











What changed?Sometimes it feels like things get thrown at you and you're like, “Which way do I go?” And I am such a people pleaser and I try to please everybody, and I lost myself in the end. So now I'm like, I'm back to focusing on my fans and me. And to be honest, the last few weeks, I have never been happier. I'm really making sure the next tour is perfect, so that's what I'm working on right now. I'm excited to re-announce it. 


So a tour is happening?For sure. It's postponed, it's not canceled. I think once I start touring again, it's not going to stop for a few years now. Now it's just going to go, go, go.


What were the repercussions of the management break? How did that affect you and your person?At the end of the day, they were my friends and they still are my friends, and so that hurt to break that off. But sometimes people need to go their separate ways, even though you love them. I knew it was best for my fans and my music. I knew it was going to be a bit of a halt. After you change management, you have to reset, and I knew that. But I had to be brave, even though I knew the negative comments were going to come. 


The chatter has been like, “Oh, she's rebelling.”I mean, Ava Max has been the biggest mismanaged pop star ever. That's how it feels. That's how the comments put it out to be, right? That's how I feel. But my love for music stays, and that's why I'm still going to be making consistent pop music until I'm like 100 years old (if I'm lucky), because pop music is in my veins. But have I been mismanaged in the past? That's for the fans to decide.


What's it like having new management?I'm really grateful to be with Ron Laffitte and Dana Salant [of Laffitte Management Group, who manage Backstreet Boys, Carly Rae Jepsen]. I tried not to rush it too, too much, but I asked them one question: “Do we have the same vision?” And we did. And I think that was the main thing that was lost in the last managements: We didn't have the same vision. Ron and I are on the same page, where he wants me to tour too, just as much as I want to tour, so that's very important to me.


That's really important. How much of the past year has been in your control?I want people to know that some things are just out of my control, and there's nothing I can do about it. A lot of it, the last year, has been out of my control. It's interesting because a lot of people like to control my situation. I'm a strong female, and I say what I feel. And so when something feels wrong or I don't think it represents my art, I speak up. I think sometimes I offend people with big egos. I feel like sometimes that can sabotage me. It's something I've always dealt with since the beginning, since “Sweet but Psycho.”

	











What's your biggest lesson from the situation?Don't let people tell me what I like and don't like. Don't let people persuade me into thinking I like something. What I want to do works and it makes sense and resonates. I don't want to listen to anyone else anymore. I want to listen to my own gut because that's what guided me towards “Sweet but Psycho” in the beginning. I think I'm going back to my roots and not caring again.


Why didn't you do the classic “Ava Max postpones album release” for this album then?I truly was going back and forth, I am making music because I love music. I can go to the studio right now and make another album in two months. That is my bread and butter. But I don't want to hold music from the fans anymore. And that's why, as you see, everyone's saying, “Oh, my God, she had so many singles on this album.” It's not that I wanted to have so many singles; it's that I wanted the fans to have the music. I fight every single day to put my music out. 


I'm just going to ask straight up. Does that have to do with your label [Atlantic] or just your management?I definitely don't want to get into those logistics. I just want to tell the fans that I always want to put out music for them. There's nothing I can do about the way it's promoted. All I can do is make pop music that resonates with me, and empowers you and empowers myself at the same time. I know the fans talk about it, but there's nothing I can do about the way other people promote and use my music. I can only control me.


What's the goal of Don't Click Play?This album was not only to prove to the fans, but to prove to myself that, yes, I can make pop songs on my own, and to prove to everybody that I am the reason why “Sweet but Psycho” exists and “Kings & Queens” exists. It's because I put my story in those songs, and I worked really hard on those songs. A lot of people thought I couldn't make another pop song without my last collaborators.


Let's talk about it. How different was it to make a new album with a different team?I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hard. I was so used to working with my main producer at the time, Cirkut. I think for me it was emotional. I couldn't get into a studio without crying, and it actually took a month and a half for me to feel comfortable recording without him. And I did end up eventually finding an amazing group of producers that I absolutely love, who are now like family. Pink Slip and Inverness and David Stewart. I think it's wonderful to get yourself out of your comfort zone. 

	











Sonically, you're free from the shackles. I think that's how I felt a little bit with the sound.[Laughs] Oh ,my god. I needed this laugh! I think now that you've listened to the album, I'm sure you can understand that I did not want every song to sound the same; I wanted each song to be unique. I don't love it when each song sounds the same on an album. I love cohesiveness, I love a story, but I definitely want it to be something on the album for everybody.


	I also went through so many emotions the last year and a half of making it that there were different moods in there that I wanted to feel. I am in that writing room, rewriting and rewriting and rewriting until it's perfect.


Musically, you can see the evolution, and I think that's fun to hear. Right. I think for the title, because everyone is so confused about the title, it doesn't mean “don't click play.” It means “Don't click play if you don't want to, because at the end of the day, this album was made to prove to myself that I could do it on my own.” I think at the end of the day, sometimes you just have to do things that feed your soul.


You also address some of the hate on there, especially about your samples in music, and even the comparisons to Lady Gaga.The comments about everything going on are just insane. And I feel like it's constant, and that's why I wanted to put it in “Don't Click Play,” the title track. It's kind of important for me to put that in there.


You addressed it in a way that you're owning it a little bit, or you're in on the joke.One thousand percent. I'm never dissing anybody in my music like that. It's an empowering thing to bring two fan bases together. 


Are there samples on the album?No. A lot of people sample songs and for some reason they like to attack me. At the end of the day, it's like, if you can make an interpolation very well, and you love it, I don't think you should leave it on your hard drive; I think you should let people dance to that song. 


Lyrically, you speak on empowering yourself post-split.Heartbreak stays with you forever. It takes fragments of your heart, and it just stays empty until you fill it back up. I think for me, I will always be able to pull from heartbreak because I've been through some really tough breakups. And when I'm in the studio sometimes, I can go back to that feeling. “Know Somebody” is one of those records; it's going to be very hard to sing this one, but it's very personal to me. And when you guys hear the lyrics, you'll know what it's about. Finding yourself after a heartbreak is one of the most beautiful transformations and rebirths there is in life.

	











Have you completed that yet or are you in the process of finding yourself?I feel like I just completed it, and I'm very happy right now. I'm going to get back into the studio, and I'm also going to share a lot of news on what I'm working on on the side.


Give me a tease.I can say it has to do with the movies.


One thing I wanted to bring up before we end: I think one of your fans' struggles has been figuring out your identity: Like, who is Ava Max? What sets her apart? What's her story? I'm really happy you asked this. Ever since “Sweet but Psycho” came out, I just jumped into interviews and performances, and I got lost in just the art, that I almost lost me. I didn't know how to even identify myself in the beginning of my career. It was all so fast, and I was working constantly. I was so young, and it was a whirlwind, to be honest. Having this delay made me realize that I want to open up to my fans finally. And I think it's time to let them know who Ava Max really is. So, yes, in the next six months you'll be seeing a different me.


I'm happy to hear that.That made me emotional, actually. Oh, my God. [Wipes tear.] I feel like I owe it to them to finally open up 100 percent. I'm no longer afraid. And I don't care what anyone thinks about me anymore. I've let my hair down. Officially.

	Erik Menendez, the younger of the two Beverly Hills brothers who infamously gunned down their parents in 1989 after years of alleged sexual abuse, was denied parole at a highly anticipated hearing Thursday. 


	The three-year denial, while minimal, dashed many supporters' hopes that Erik, 54, might be home with his family in time for the holidays. It also dampened expectations ahead of the separate parole board hearing for Erik's older brother and co-defendant, Lyle Menendez, 57, set for Friday.


	“I believe in redemption, or I wouldn't be doing this job,” Commissioner Robert Barton said as he delivered the decision. “But based on the legal standards, we find that you continue to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.”


	Barton said Erik's history of rule violations while in custody factored heavily in the ruling, especially his use of contraband cell phones as recently as last year. He further noted Erik was “not in imminent fear” of death when he opened fire on his parents.

	











	Appearing over a video link from his prison in San Diego, Erik nodded along but appeared visibly shaken by the denial. Barton was blunt, saying he found the execution of Erik's mom, Kitty Menendez, “devoid of human compassion.” He noted that Kitty suffered at the hands of Erik's father as well.

	“I can't put myself in your place. I don't know that I've ever had rage to that level, ever. But that is still concerning, especially since it seems she was also a victim herself of the domestic violence,” Barton said. “The truest thing you said [today] in terms of accountability is there is no justification for your actions. … Doing what you did, when you did, how you did it, there is no justification.”

	











	In his comments leading up to the decision, Erik said he deeply regretted murdering his parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in the den of their $4 million Mediterranean-style mansion 36 years ago. He recalled believing his own life was in danger, but he admitted the shooting was not in self-defense.

	“Dad was going to come to my room and rape me that night. That was going to happen. One way or another. If he was alive, that was going to happen,” Erik told the parole board Thursday. Asked why he fatally shot his mother as well, Erik said he was blinded by the belief she supported José unconditionally. “On that night, I saw them as one person. Had she not been in the room, maybe it would have been different,” he said.


	“I wish to God I did not do that,” he told the board. “I cannot express sorrow and remorse enough. Doing it for the rest of my life will not be enough.”


	Turning emotional at times, he noted that Wednesday was another anniversary of the Aug. 20, 1989, murders. “Today is Aug. 21st. Today is the day that all of my [relatives] learned my parents were dead. So today is the anniversary of their trauma journey,” he told the panel. “I just want my family to understand that I am so unimaginably sorry for what I have put them through.”


	Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian argued against Erik's release on parole, telling the board that while it's true Erik earned a degree from UCLA while incarcerated and started programs to help other inmates, it's not clear he understands “the full severity and depravity of his conduct.” He suggested Erik's behavior was “calculated.”


	“When what you've done is shotgun your parents to death, deleted any competing wills, taken their money, spent their money, you're a violent person,” Balian argued. “When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they've made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents.”

	Thursday's denial is not the end of the road for Erik's bid to be released. He'll be eligible for another parole hearing in three years, and he has the right to petition to advance, meaning he could end up before the board earlier. Both brothers also have a motion for a new trial still pending in the courts. And a separate clemency bid is on the desk of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Even so, the parole board process is widely considered the brothers' most likely path to freedom.

	











	In a July episode of his podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, the governor said he planned to make any decision in front of him regarding the brothers' fate by Labor Day. He told his guest, Ryan Murphy, creator of the Netflix series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, that he refrained from watching the show because he didn't want to be “persuaded” by anything “not in the files.” He did not hint which way he might rule.


	The brothers won the right to parole last May when a Los Angeles County judge resentenced them to 50 years to life for their first-degree murder convictions. (They previously were sentenced to life without parole.) Because both brothers were younger than 26 at the time of the murders, the reduced sentences made them immediately eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law.


	“While we respect the decision, today's outcome was of course disappointing and not what we hoped for,” Erik's family members said in a joint statement. “Our belief in Erik remains unwavering, and we know he will take the board's recommendation in stride. His remorse, growth, and the positive impact he's had on others speak for themselves.” The relatives said they remained “cautiously optimistic and hopeful” heading into Lyle's hearing on Friday.


	“This ruling does justice for Jose and Kitty Menendez,” Hochman said in a statement Thursday evening. “The board correctly determined that Erik Menendez's actions speak louder than words, and that his conduct in prison and current mentality demonstrate that he still poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.”


	At the start of Thursday's nearly 10-hour hearing, Barton asked Erik about the two residential burglaries he committed before the murders. Erik said he was trying to impress older kids. He also claimed his parents failed to instill in him a strong “moral foundation.”


	“I was raised to lie, to cheat, to steal,” he said. “When I was playing tennis, my father would make sure that I cheated at certain times if he told me to.” Erik admitted he was impulsive and “entitled” as a teenager.


	“I would violate the rules if I believed that it would benefit me. I did not trust authority. I didn't trust my relatives. I lived in an isolated household. We were trained not to go outside the household. I had deep character failings,” he told the board. Erik said the second burglary was a way of “sticking it” to his dad because it could hurt José's reputation. 

	











	“But you murdered him because you thought there was something he was going to do to you?” Barton asked. Erik replied yes. He said the murders were a little over a year after the second burglary.


	Recounting the 1989 Sunday-night slayings, Erik said that on the Tuesday before, he confided in Lyle that the “sexual violence was still going on.” Two days later, they first discussed buying guns after Lyle had a “very bad” confrontation with their dad, he said.


	“When we talked about getting the guns, I had made the decision that I was never going to let Dad come in my room and do that again,” Erik said. “In my mind, leaving meant death. There was no consideration. I was totally convinced there was no place I could go.”


	Erik admitted he “fantasized” about his father “not being alive.” But he said “pulling the trigger” was not premeditated, adding that his dad “was the most terrifying human being” he knew.


	“Is there any part of this which you believe was self-defense?” Barton asked. Erik said no.


	“My purpose in getting the guns was to protect myself in case my father or my mother came at me to kill me. Or my father came in the room to rape me. That is why I bought the guns,” he said. He recalled feeling his life was in “extreme danger immediately” after he and Lyle confronted their parents over the alleged sexual abuse.


	Asked who acted first “in terms of the violence,” Erik said Lyle came to the top of the stairs once their father ordered Erik to his room. “It's happening now,” Lyle purportedly told him, he said. “All I knew as I had to get to that den. Fear was driving me to that den,” he said.


	Erik recalled grabbing his gun and taking it out to his car to load it. Barton asked if he recognizes now that he had “other choices at that point.”


	“When I look back at the person I was then, and what I believed about the world and my parents, running away was inconceivable. Running away meant death,” Erik said. He claimed his father “had trained me to believe that running away meant death.”


	“Why kill Mom?” Barton asked. Erik said that when his mother told him she knew about the alleged abuse, he was stunned. “It was the most devastating moment in my entire life. It changed everything for me. I had been protecting her by not telling her,” he said. Erik said his mom told him she considered José a “great man” and would never leave him.


	“I saw my mother and my father as one person after I learned that she knew, so when I was running into the den, I was in a state of terror, of panic, of rage,” he said. “I didn't parse out in my mind my mother or my father. I ran in because fear was compelling me to run to the den.”

	











	Erik said he did his best to testify truthfully after he confessed. “I testified about the reloading, which I did not have to,” he said, referring to the fact that his brother reloaded his weapon during the shooting. “There was no evidence.”


	Asked about his rule violations behind bars, Erik identified his risk areas as “criminal thinking, substance abuse, violence, anger, impulsivity, [and] cell phone use.” Barton said the conduct in custody was important because it was an indicator of his current risk to public safety.


	Barton said Erik got in trouble for writing letters on a work device in 1997, physical fights with other inmates, and for having contraband, including cell phones, art supplies, tobacco and alcohol. He also engaged in excessive physical contact with visitors, according to his prison files. One incident involved a visit from his current wife in 2006. The woman's nine-year-old daughter was in the room. He said the girl was across the room reading a book while he and his wife were “snuggling.”


	“I was pushing the line occasionally in the visiting room with my wife because I was attracted to her and we had sexual feelings for one another,” he said. “It's difficult to be next to a woman that I love and am attracted to and want to be with and I can only hold her hand. It was a lapse in judgment. This was not something I did every day.”


	Erik said he tried heroin in custody but didn't like it. The hearing then touched on a sensitive topic with his brother.


	Barton accused Erik of covering up an aspect of his relationship with his brother when he requested a transfer to Lyle's prison. Erik told staff he and Lyle never had any problems. Barton said that was a “lie.”


	At that point, Erik said the allegation Lyle was “molesting [me] as a kid” was something he withheld from corrections department staff. He said he simply wanted to be closer to family. Erik's lawyer for the hearing, Heidi Rummel, said her client wasn't required to tell CDCR about every detail of his relationship with his brother.


	Erik admitted he participated in a tax fraud scheme in 2013 but said he did it for protection after his closest prison friends had been stabbed and raped. While details of the scheme were not explained, Erik said a violent prison gang recruited him to fill out the forms, and he jumped at the chance to “align myself with them” and “survive.”


	He said the risk of getting caught with phones was outweighed by the “connection with the outside world” they afforded. He claimed his thinking changed last year when, for the first time, he was given a shot at possible resentencing and parole. “Now the consequences mattered. Now the consequences meant I was destroying my life,” he said. Erik said he was using the phones for “connection with my wife, watching YouTube, listening to music, watching movies, porn. Anything you could do on a phone, I did.”

	











	Erik said he faced a turning point in 2013 and decided his purpose was to be a “good person” and leave a legacy. “I did not like who I was in 2013. I did not like using drugs. I did not like helping the [gang],” he said. “It just made me feel ugly and dirty.”


	Unfortunately, he said, he became “addicted” to the phones and convinced himself they weren't harming anyone. He now understands they're destructive to the prison environment because they involve the corruption of prison staff and involve “taxing” the benefit prison gangs, he said.


	“I justified it by saying if I don't buy it, someone else is going to buy it,” he said. “The phones were going to be sold, and I longed for that connection.” Asked if Lyle was the one who introduced him to cell phone use, he said no. He claimed Lyle has been a good influence, saying they're “serious accountability partners.” 


	At their resentencing hearing, both brothers expressed regret for the double slaying of their parents. Appearing by video, Erik called his actions “selfish, cruel, and cowardly.” He admitted he concocted an alibi about having been at a movie theater and did everything he could “to get away with my crimes.” He apologized to his family members for having “stolen” José and Kitty and said he planned to spend the rest of his life helping others.


	“I make no excuses and offer no justification,” Lyle said in his separate statement. “I take full responsibility for my choices. The choice to confront my dad about the abuse. The choice to keep the family secret instead of asking for help. The choice to stay instead of leave. The choice to buy guns and ammunition. The choice to point a gun at my mom and dad and shoot them. The choice to reload … and run up to my mom on the floor and shoot her again.”


	Lyle said he regretted his choice, after his arrest, “to make a mockery of the criminal justice system by soliciting perjury.” It was a notable admission considering prosecutors stated over and over during the resentencing hearing that the brothers never admitted they asked people to lie for them to cover their tracks. Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian specifically accused Lyle of having attempted to recruit a former girlfriend, Jamie Pisarcik, to falsely testify that José had drugged and violently raped her.


	Lyle said he was “immature, impulsive, emotionally isolated” and “in a co-dependent relationship” with Erik. He said his father molested him as well, when he was younger, so the brothers shared the “traumatic bond” of suffering that sexual abuse.

	











	“My choice to buy guns did not come from logic or reason. I was scared but also filled with rage. I'm so sorry I didn't ask for help. I should have trusted someone: a relative, the police, a priest,” he said.


	The brothers have spent the last 35 years behind bars for the grisly killings that became a media sensation. After their initial televised trial ended with two hung juries — one for each brother — Lyle and Erik were convicted of first-degree murder at a follow-up trial and sentenced in 1996.


	At trial, the brothers told jurors they suffered years of sexual abuse and believed their parents had plans to kill them to keep a lid on the family's dark secret. Prosecutors argued the brothers acted out of greed, resorting to the gruesome murders to get their multimillion-dollar inheritances before being cut out of their parents' will.


	In testimony to the court last May, cousin Diane VanderMolen recounted some of what she told jurors during the brothers' first trial. She said Lyle shared with her when he was a child that his father had been molesting him. She also described the “hallway rule” inside the Menendez family's home. (Her testimony about the alleged sexual abuse was not allowed at the second trial.)


	“When José was with one of the boys, you weren't allowed to go down the hall,” she testified Tuesday. She said no one dared challenge José because he was incredibly “intimidating.” She explained that while Kitty once had been like a second mother and mentor to her, Kitty's personality “greatly changed” after she allegedly discovered José “was having an affair.”


	“José was so powerful. And Kitty became the enforcer,” VanderMolen testified in a soft voice. She testified that Erik and Lyle were understandably terrified of their parents when they carried out the murders. “They did not see a way out,” she testified. “Afterward, after getting older, they realize now that they would have had other opportunities.”


	The judge granted the resentencing after L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman tried to derail it. The process was initiated by Hochman's more liberal predecessor, George Gascón, last October. Gascón said he considered the brothers' young ages at the time of the killings — Erik was 18 and Lyle was 21 — and the brothers' exemplary behavior behind bars. He said they had paid their “debt” to society and should be eligible for parole immediately.

	











	Another cousin, Tamara Lucera Goodell, testified in May that the brothers were rehabilitated. She pointed to the green space, hospice, and meditation programs for other inmates that they've started behind bars. She asked the judge to strike down their life sentences so her bedridden 93-year-old grandmother, Joan VanderMolen, Kitty's sister, would have a chance to see them in person before she dies.


	“For 35 years, I have watched my entire family spiral during different conversations about what happened,” she testified. “I watched my grandmother and my aunts traumatized.” She said her grandmother's family had “a long history of abuse in multiple forms,” and having a chance to reunite with the brothers would help the family heal from the tragedy.


	José's older sister, Teresita Menendez-Baralt, 85, and Joan, Kitty's sister, both testified at a different hearing last November, saying they supported release. “No child should have to endure what Erik and Lyle lived through at the hands of their father,” Joan said on the witness stand. “It breaks my heart that my sister Kitty knew what was happening and did nothing about it, that we knew of,” she said under questioning by Mark Geragos, the lawyer representing the brothers.


	Testifying again Thursday, Teresita broke down in tears. “I want to make clear that although I love my brother, I have fully forgiven Erik,” she said, calling her nephew a “sweet, gentle soul.” She told the panel she's dying from Stage 4 cancer. “The truth is, I do not know how much time I have left. If Erik is granted parole, it would be a blessing to help him in any way I can,” she said. “More than anything, I hope I live long enough to welcome him into my home. To sit at the same table. To wrap my arms around him. That would bring me immeasurable peace and joy.”


	Kitty's grandniece, Natascha Leonardo, told the board she was willing to house Erik in Colorado with her family. She said Erik is close with her kids. “We're not asking you to release Erik into uncertainty. We're asking you to release him into a network of love and support,” she said.


	Lyle and Erik's story drew outsized national attention in 1989 due to the family's wealth and the brothers' claim that their parents were murdered in a Mafia-style hit. Police initially treated them as grieving orphans, but they were eventually arrested and charged with first-degree murder in 1990.


	The story remained a staple for true crime aficionados, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, CourtTV, the channel that originally broadcast their trial, released the entire recording of the proceeding online. This caused a major resurgence of interest in the Menendez case, especially for younger viewers who weren't even alive during the original televised trial.

	











	Later, in the 2023 Peacock docuseries, Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, Roy Rossello, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, stepped forward with new allegations. Rossello claimed that José Menendez, a prominent music industry executive, had sexually abused him, too. In October 2024, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story debuted on Netflix, with Murphy's dramatic retelling of the murders placing the brothers in a sympathetic light. The show ignited a new round of public and celebrity support for the brothers' release.

	“For more than 35 years, they have shown sustained growth. They've taken full accountability. They express sincere remorse to our family to this day and have built a meaningful life defined by purpose and service,” the Menendez family said in a statement leading up to the parole board hearings. “We know that Erik and Lyle will come home, that is no longer a doubt. We just hope that they are granted this second chance in time to hug their Aunt Joan and Aunt Terry.”

	Before he was an outspoken critic of Trump, before he was even a musician, Jack White was an upholsterer. Growing up in Detroit, he began as an apprentice at just 15 years old, then opened his own shop, Third Man Upholstery, when he was 21. His music career took off a year later, when he formed the White Stripes with his then-wife, Meg White. But he never stopped working on furniture, even teaching us how to reupholster a stool in his 2014 Rolling Stone cover story. You know, normal rock star stuff. 


	There's an obvious overlap between White's music and his interior design business that goes well beyond sharing the same name. (His label is called Third Man Records, but getting into his lifelong love of the number three requires a separate essay). You'll never come across a better-dressed indie rocker, and he famously follows a strict color scheme — red for White Stripes, yellow for Third Man, and blue for his solo work, with black appearing across all. He's as serious about vintage and historical artifacts as he is about reissuing and preserving music. In every aspect of his life, Jack White brings unapologetic intentionality.

	











	“In carpentry and interior design, being in Jack's presence during the ideation process, the hypotheticals and head tilting, can be both inspiring and maddening,” his nephew and business partner, Ben Blackwell, writes on White's art and design website. “There's no reason a building needs to have acoustical tiles, tin ceilings or shiny yellow floors. But that's not the point. The point is to make something beautiful.”

	So it makes sense that Donald Trump's redecoration of the White House, in a style that is far from beautiful, irked White this month. The musician posted a photo of Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, comparing the makeover to “a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.” He took a moment to shout out “REAL leader of a nation” Zelensky and his sleek black suit, but otherwise said the entire thing was surely “an embarrassment to American history.” The lengthy, merciless caption is basically the rock equivalent of Miranda Priestly's cerulean sweater takedown. Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

	But it gets even better. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung actually responded to White, attempting to dismiss him as “a washed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career. It's apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of ‘The People's House.'” Ouch.


	White doubled down and then some, replying with a fiery 750-word roast that immediately pointed out the dark humor of it all: The fact White has been publicly condemning Trump for years, yet the one time the president responds, it's because White called him tacky. In the past, White has lambasted celebrities who've “normalized” Trump. He quit Twitter, and, alongside Meg, even sued Trump for using “Seven Nation Army” in a campaign video (they dropped the lawsuit last fall). 


	He detailed his many previous attacks on Trump's awful policies — his “blatant fascist manipulation of government,” his “gestapo ICE tactics,” his “disparaging sexist and pedophilic remarks about women,” his “ignorance of the dying children in Sudan, Gaza, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” his “constant, constant, constant lying to the American people,” and much more. 


	“It wasn't me calling out any of that,” White said. “It was the fucking DECOR OF THE OVAL OFFICE remarks I made that got them to respond with insults. How petty and pathetic and thin-skinned could this administration get? ‘Masquerading as a real artist'? Thank you for giving me my tombstone engraving!”

	It's important to take Cheung's statement with a grain of salt. After all, it's on behalf of a politician who recently described Bruce Springsteen as a “dried out prune of a rocker” and proclaimed to the world that Taylor Swift is no longer hot. But his other kind words for White and his “stalled career” aren't just comical, they're plain wrong. This is a guy who's been in the music industry for nearly 30 years, with 12 Grammys under his belt, and the author of a riff that's become a stadium chant in sporting events across the world. He's about to get inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this fall. Olivia Rodrigo cried when she met him. Bob Dylan taught him how to weld. Beyoncé sent him flowers. His most recent release, 2024's killer No Name LP, got some of his best reviews ever. Most musicians would kill for a career that stalled.

	White has rarely been known as an overtly political artist — his first time publicly endorsing a presidential candidate was Bernie Sanders in 2020 — and he says in his post that he's not a registered Democrat. But he's never been one to stay quiet, either, especially early in his career, when he famously feuded with fellow musicians, particularly the Black Keys. “I think a lot of emotions have been demonized over the years,” he told us in 2018, “As if they should never exist on planet Earth. Absolutely not. Without revenge and anger and these quote-unquote negative emotions, how would we have won World War II?”


	Right now, White's “negative emotions” are winning. He's speaking truth to power and getting under the president's skin, and his punches are landing. He just turned 50 last month (and was possibly the only human ever to be gifted both a 1991 Suzuki Samurai and his first-ever cell phone). He's no longer worried about watered-down versions of the White Stripes. He's got bigger issues on his mind. And we should listen to him now, more than ever.

Lil Nas X was arrested Thursday morning in Los Angeles, according L.A. County Sheriff inmate records. He is being held at the L.A. Police Department's Valley Jail section in Van Nuys.


	The Grammy-winning rapper, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, was hospitalized for a possible overdose after charging at officers in Studio City on Thursday morning. Hill was handcuffed before being transported to a local hospital.


	In a video shared by TMZ, the 26-year-old was filmed walking on Ventura Boulevard in his underwear and a pair of white cowboy boots, incoherently speaking to the person taping him.


	“Upon arrival, the suspect charged at officers and was taken into custody,” the LAPD told USA Today, although they did not identify the suspect at the time. “He was transported to a local hospital for a possible overdose and placed under arrest for Battery on a Police Officer.” Officer Drake Madison later confirmed to the outlet that the incident was related to Hill's arrest.

	











	A rep for Lil Nas X did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.


	Prior to the arrest, Lil Nas X had dropped a series of bizarre posts on his Instagram page, after deleting all earlier posts two days before. On Wednesday, he shared unreleased music alongside mirror selfies, his art, and piles of junk in what appears to be his home. His display name had been updated to “QUEEN MADELINE.”

	Somewhere in Tallahassee, at the turn of the millennia, a young Byron Donalds stood in the parking lot of his local Cracker Barrel — then his place of employment — and contemplated the man atop the wood-and-whimsy pancake palace. It was in that moment, staring into the gold and brown face helming the performatively old-timey interstate eatery, that a future congressman decided to give himself to Christ. 


	That may not be exactly how it happened, but Donalds came forward with his story of religious epiphany in a Cracker Barrel parking lot amid MAGA outrage over the chain restaurant's decision to change its logo, removing the image of “Uncle Herschel” and his barrel. 


	“In college, I worked at @CrackerBarrel in Tallahassee. I even gave my life to Christ in their parking lot,” he wrote. “Their logo was iconic and their unique restaurants were a fixture of American culture. No one asked for this woke rebrand. It's time to Make Cracker Barrel Great Again 🇺🇸” 

	











	There is no indication that Cracker Barrel's decision to simplify its logo was motivated by politics or “wokeness.” If anything, the company has been struggling for years to market its perfectly mediocre food and boomer nostalgia-themed ambiance to anyone but the remaining population of baby boomers, or those in urgent need of a bathroom during their long drives. A rebrand was long overdue. But Republicans are reacting to the marketing decision as if old Uncle Herschel — the uncle of founder Dan Evins — had been taken out back and shot in the name of DEI. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X. MAGA country musician John Rich asked his followers if they would “go to Cracker Barrel now that it's going woke? This could be a ‘Bud Light' moment in the making.” 


	Right-wing actor James Woods posted that on cross-country drives, “Cracker Barrel was the only place I'd ever stop. No mob fights, a fun corny atmosphere, and delicious food when you're hungry and tired. I'll never stop foot in one again.”

	Professional anti-woke troll Christopher Rufo declared that “we must break the Barrel. It's not about this particular restaurant chain — who cares — but about creating massive pressure against companies that are considering any move that might appear to be ‘wokification.'”


	In effect, Rufo openly acknowledged that while there may be no actual indicator of the restaurant chain's motivation, the delusions of right-wingers triggered by the redrawing of a corporate logo or the redesign of a candy mascot are grounds for punishment. And, to that end, Cracker Barrel's already flailing stock took a dip on Thursday as conservatives fumed at the company. 


	For some reason, the Democratic National Committee got in on the act. “We think the Cracker Barrel rebrand sucks too,” wrote the DNC, amid the total collapse of its own brand.


	Even more bizarre, for some Republican influencers, the meltdown over Uncle Herschel's PR demise took a turn for the sexual. TPUSA Founder Charlie Kirk posted an image comparing the original logo to new MAGA favorite and universally-acknowledged-hot-actress Sydney Sweeney, and the redesign to a plus-sized woman.

	“Accurate” Kirk wrote. Is the implication that Kirk found the image of Herschel to be hotter? 


	Perhaps the appeal of Cracker Barrel was not the peg game, the rocking chairs on the front porch, or the subpar biscuits and gravy, but the coy gaze of Herschel — apparently a Christlike figure watching the MAGA cult from his perch above the freeway — inviting one inside.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Comet? UFO? Astronomers puzzle over fastest object in solar system","https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/comet-ufo-astronomers-puzzle-over-fastest-object-in-solar-system-q3xhcj88p","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:12:24 GMT","

Just after midnight in a part of Planet Earth known as Massachusetts, a team of scientists who track comets and minor planets in the solar system announced that they had spotted something new: a spark in the southern sky, visible in the data they were getting from a telescope in Chile.

The telescope, high in the Atacama Desert, is tasked with searching for objects that might collide with Earth. “We at the Minor Planet Center have the role to collect the information and also to post it quickly, almost in real time, on our website if the object is somehow interesting,” said Peter Veres, a Harvard astronomer sometimes described as an air-traffic controller for the solar system.

So at 1.15am local time on July 1, the discovery was announced. “Observers around the world quickly gathered their telescopes,” Veres said.

Soon, astronomers concluded that the object had come from interstellar space, that it would not come within 170 million miles of Earth and that it was, in all likelihood, a sort of cosmic iceberg billions of years old, ejected from the frosty outer limits of another star system and now zipping along at 118,000 miles an hour, the fastest object ever sighted in our solar system.

But there was also another theory that was soon being advanced by the Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb: that this object could be an alien probe, sent on a reconnaissance mission through our solar system on a course that kept it, deliberately, out of reach of our fastest rockets.

It is only the third interstellar object ever recorded passing through the solar system. The first, that was named Oumuamua, was sighted in 2017. A second, 2I/Borisov, was spotted in 2019 by a telescope maker in Crimea named Gennadiy Borisov. This latest visitor was sighted by a telescope run by Atlas, an early warning system funded by Nasathat is designed to detect asteroids heading towards Earth. It has been named 3I/Atlas, the 3I standing for “3 Interstellar”.

Loeb is recognised by fellow astronomers for his work on the evolution of the first stars, but he gained a global following in 2018 when he and a colleague published a paper suggesting that Oumuamua was a solar sail created by an alien civilisation, floating like driftwood through interstellar space, or perhaps even an alien probe dispatched on a scouting mission to our solar system.

On July 2, 24 hours after Harvard's Minor Planets Center announced the sighting of 3I/Atlas, Loeb woke at 2am to appear on a late-night radio show called Coast to Coast. After he got off air, “one of the listeners wrote to me and said: ‘There is a potential new object,'” he said.

Loeb began posting essays on the 3I/Atlas. “They have received a quarter of a million views,” he said. “Can you believe it? It's not a TikTok video. These are essays of 1,000 words or more.”

Several things about 3I/Atlas struck him as unusual. “There is no trail of dust,” he said. Its trajectory lines up, to within five degrees, to the ecliptic plane, the orbital plane on which the Earth and most of the other planets in the solar system track around the sun, he added. “The chance of it being on that plane is one in 500.” Its timing meant that it would come close to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. This, he said, “raises the question of whether this trajectory was designed”.

It would pass closest to the sun on October 29 but “we won't be able to observe it because the sun will be in the way”, he said. “It's an interesting coincidence.” Its speed is expected to increase, as it nears the sun, to about 152,000 miles per hour — and when you factor in the speed of the Earth, which is moving in the opposite direction around the sun, “that's three times faster than our fastest rockets”, he said.

On a scale of one to ten, where ten represents a definite piece of alien technology, he still only gives it “a four so far”, he said. But he recently posted an essay on the Medium platform, asking what humanity should do “if the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft, guided to send mini-probes that will arrive at Earth and other planets in the coming months”.

He has a 15-point plan.

One of his followers is already trading against the stock market, believing it will crash if the probe theory proves true, he said. Markets would crash “because of the uncertainty”, he said, adding: “We might feel like the Iranian air-defence system, when the B2 bombers were flying overhead and we can't do anything about it.”

Other astronomers think that the object is a comet: a fascinating thing to see but not proof, at last, that mankind is not alone in the universe. Loeb is “a super bright guy”, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He noted that Loeb had led Breakthrough Starshot, a project to send a probe to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. “Then when Oumuamua came in, he asked the very reasonable question: if one of my probes went through Alpha Centauri, wouldn't it look just like this? The answer turns out to be no.”

Oumuamua was long and flat. Veres, of the Minor Planets Center, said that it was “interesting because of its shape and its odd motion”. It did not have the fuzzy halo of gas and dust that comets usually give off as they near the sun and heat up, and it seemed to accelerate in a manner that could not be accounted for “purely by gravity”, Veres said. “That led to some, I would say speculative ideas by Professor Loeb … that it's a solar sail or probe.”

• Scientists challenge theory that mystery object was alien ship

The second interstellar object to be spotted, Borisov, behaved more like a comet, Veres said. This third object was spotted when it was about 418 million miles from the sun. Its size is still hotly debated, though it is thought to be somewhere between 200 and 5,000 metres across, he said.

Its trajectory, zipping through the solar system against the flow of the circling planets, is certainly interesting, but Veres notes that it is only the third such object ever spotted. “The previous two objects were on totally random angles,” he said. Once 30 or 100 have been tracked, it will be easier to see what is ordinary for an interstellar comet, he said.

But there are still unanswered questions. “Now it's like, [260 million] miles from the sun. It's getting warmer … but it's still not very active,” he said. “There is still no tail.” This, he said, was “fuel for those speculative ideas by Professor Loeb”.

Veres thinks that the lack of a halo of gas and dust might be because it has developed a hard crust as it crossed interstellar space and was “baked”, though not in a warming sense, by cosmic rays. Perhaps as it nears the sun, this crust “will peel off and suddenly we'll see a lot of activity”.

John Forbes, a computational astronomer at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, believes that 3I/Atlas does have a halo but that it is hard to see, because the comet is still travelling in our general direction. “The tail is pointing a little away from us,” he said. “For my money, it's a really interesting object but it looks an awful lot like a comet.”

It has come from nearer the centre of the Milky Way, where there are stars formed billions of years before our sun. These older stars are composed of lighter elements, and have fewer metals in them, “because metals themselves are produced by stars evolving and exploding”, said Forbes.

As stars form, a flat disc of dust and gas swirls around them and resolves into planets as well as lumps of ice and dust that get ejected into interstellar space. McDowell described 3I/Atlas as an interstellar iceberg with a composition unlike any ice on Earth, “wandering the galaxy for yonks” and now, as it nears us, “barrelling along in a cloud of its own steam”.

Loeb thinks that whatever it is, its passage through our solar system represents a huge opportunity to get the general public excited about science. “It entered the outskirts of our solar system, the edge of the so-called Oort Cloud, 8,000 years ago,” he said. “That was when humans started to document their history. It came within 1,000 times of the [distance between the Earth and the sun] 80 years ago.” Eight years ago, it passed through the Kuiper Belt, just beyond the orbit of Neptune, he said. Now it is a speck in the heavens, moving steadily north across the night sky.

Hey, a free parking spot!

We might not know whether aliens exist (no, they weren't at a Miami mall last year, although first contact would be far from the weirdest thing to happen in Florida), but that hasn't stopped people from preparing for their potential arrival to Earth. Some people might stockpile weapons, others might DIY welcome signs, but back in 1967, one Canadian town tackled arguably the most important preparation of all: a decent parking spot.

That's right – in the town of St Paul in Northern Alberta lies the world's first ever UFO landing pad. The idea came about as part of Canada's centennial celebrations, and once approved by the government, saw the construction of a large platform sat atop six 75-centimeter (30-inch)-tall concrete pylons. The platform is circular, of course, because all UFOs are flying saucer-shaped, right?

Some people might've rolled their eyes at the idea, but not the residents of St Paul – this was a community-led project, and it seems the whole town was more than willing to join in with the fun when it opened back in June 1967.

“To make the expected celestial visitors feel at home, flying saucers have started to sprout in backyards,” explained a news report at the time. “One businessman donated a bus called the ‘Martian Express' to take care of earthly transportation problems.” We're not quite sure that measures up to a machine capable of flying all the way from Mars, but we're here for the enthusiasm.

“So far, the only low-flying UFOs to be lured down are the paper variety popular with children, but the local citizens are sure that even the Martians won't be able to resist their western hospitality for long,” the report continued. Unfortunately for them, that doesn't seem to have been the case – we'd like to think we'd certainly know about it if a UFO had plonked down in a small Canadian town.

Of course, the whole thing is a little tongue-in-cheek. But look past all the flying saucer décor and “Little Green Men” memorabilia, and the true message at the heart of this parking spot is one that was apt at the time and remains so now. It's one of peace and unity – something very human indeed.

“The area under the world's first UFO landing pad was designated international by the town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife,” reads the sign next to the landing pad. “That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings. All visitors from Earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the town of St. Paul.”

Unless it's a Monday at the gift shop, that is – they're closed on Mondays.

Friday August 22, 2025 

The UMSAILS-UAP Spring School 2025 ended today at CCULB Resort & Convention Hall, Kaliganj, Gazipur. Hosted by UAP's Department of Law and Human Rights with SAILS and CELGAP, the five-day programme was sponsored by University Press Limited (UPL).

Under the theme ""The Rule of Law, Transparency, & Accountability"", the Spring School gathered around 50 students from universities across Bangladesh, as well as participants from India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Over the course of five days, organisers presented academic sessions, led legal research workshops, and facilitated interactive discussions with leading jurists and academics.

Dr Kamal Hossain, Senior Advocate and Chairperson of SAILS, emphasised that democracy relies on accountability and encouraged young lawyers to uphold justice, fairness, and integrity.

Architect Mahbuba Haque, Chairperson of the UAP Board of Trustees, stated that the programme enables students to think beyond the classroom, embrace diversity, and serve as agents of justice and transparency.

Professor Dr Qumrul Ahsan, Vice Chancellor of UAP, noted that the initiative reflects UAP's mission to build socially responsible graduates by fostering ethics, leadership, and teamwork.

The event opened on 17 August with Dr Sharif Bhuiyan, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, as Chief Guest, and concluded today in the presence of distinguished guests including Dr M Alauddin and Engineer M Abu Taher, Members of the UAP Board of Trustees; Barrister Mohammad Mashiur Rahman Sabuj, Chairman of CELGAP; Ms Mahrukh Mohiuddin, Managing Director of UPL; and Md Asaduzzaman, Associate Professor & Head of the Department of Law & Human Rights, UAP. The session was presided over by Prof. Dr Chowdhury Israk Ahmed Siddiky, Coordinator of the UMSAILS Programme and Deputy Director of SAILS.

Organisers hope that the cross-cultural collaboration and leadership development fostered through the Spring School will enable participants to return with enhanced research skills and a broader understanding of legal perspectives. They anticipate that the experience will empower students to initiate advocacy projects, contribute to discussions on legal reform, and engage in efforts promoting justice and good governance at both national and international levels.

The RMS Queen Mary is one of the most famous ocean liners in history, celebrated for its elegant design, wartime service, and enduring presence as a permanently docked landmark in Long Beach. Yet for many visitors, its fame lies not only in its legacy of luxury and engineering, but in its reputation as one of the most haunted ships in the world. The Queen Mary Paranormal Tour leans into this reputation, offering guests the chance to explore the darker, lesser-seen corners of the ship while learning about the tragic stories and ghostly legends that continue to capture the public imagination.

I joined the tour expecting a mix of history, ghost stories, and atmosphere—and in that regard, it did not disappoint. The guides (in my case, a skilled storyteller named David), weave together accounts of accidents, mysterious deaths, and documented sightings with ease. From crew members crushed by watertight doors to passengers who allegedly never left their cabins, the tales are delivered with a balance of theatrical flair and respect for the ship's history. Even without a direct encounter, the stories are gripping enough to make one glance over their shoulder more than once.



While my experience did not yield any personal paranormal encounters—no flickering lights, moving shadows, or disembodied voices—I found that the most memorable part of the evening was not what I saw, but what I felt. Several areas of the ship carry an undeniable heaviness, a sense of dread that is difficult to explain away. Walking through the lower decks, I noticed the air seemed thicker, the silence more oppressive. It wasn't fear in the traditional sense; rather, it was a weight that settled in the chest, a quiet reminder that history leaves traces even when the hallways are empty. A speakeasy in mid-renovation held an especially heavy air over myself and several other visitors.

The physical environment of the Queen Mary amplifies this sensation. The ship's age shows in the creaking floors, dim passageways, and steel bulkheads that echo every step. It is easy to imagine how, in low light and with stories of hauntings fresh in your mind, the boundaries between imagination and reality could blur. Even skeptics would be hard-pressed not to feel at least a momentary chill.



Another strength of the tour is how it balances education with atmosphere. Beyond the ghost stories, the guides provide meaningful historical context, painting a vivid picture of the Queen Mary's years of service, both as a luxury liner and as a troopship during World War II. This dual focus ensures that even those who come primarily for the history—rather than the hauntings—will leave satisfied.

Ultimately, the Queen Mary Paranormal Tour succeeds because it does not rely on jump scares or theatrics…although that is coming in September with the ship's new Dark Harbor experience.  Instead, it immerses guests in an environment that already feels alive with memory and mystery. The haunted history of the ship is entertaining, but it is the emotional weight of the past that lingers after the tour ends.



The Queen Mary Paranormal Tour is best suited for those who appreciate atmosphere and storytelling. Paranormal enthusiasts will enjoy the chance to explore famously haunted spaces, even if tangible experiences aren't guaranteed. History buffs will value the depth of information and the opportunity to stand in a vessel that played a significant role in the 20th century. Skeptics, too, may find themselves surprised—not necessarily by ghostly evidence, but by how convincing the environment itself can feel when paired with its dark history.

This is not a haunted house attraction designed for cheap thrills, but rather a thoughtful blend of history and legend, set in one of the most evocative locations imaginable. Whether you leave believing in ghosts or not, the Queen Mary makes a lasting impression.

Sky Documentaries has ordered Alien Autopsy (w.t.), a new original docuseries from director John Dower (My Scientology Movie, Lockerbie) and Mindhouse.

“The '90s were the golden age of UFO fever—before smartphones, before streaming—when grainy footage, The X-Files and Roswell ruled the headlines,” said Hayley Reynolds, acting director of documentaries and factual at Sky. “The alien autopsy remains one of the most debated mysteries of the 20th century, and with UFOs once again sparking debate in governments around the world, we're thrilled to reunite with John Dower, who helmed our BAFTA-winning documentary series Lockerbie and the talented team at Mindhouse as they set out to uncover the truth.”

In 1995, 18 minutes of grainy film shocked the world—so-called “alien autopsy” footage appeared to show three government officials in hazmat suits dissecting the corpse of an alien recovered from a crash site near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

 More info on ZDF Studios' Into the Universe.

This docuseries follows the members of an ambitious group of filmmakers who found themselves at the center of an unprecedented media storm after re-creating a landmark alien encounter in a North London apartment.

“Over a decade after the eerie black-and-white footage of an alien autopsy was released in the mid 90s and affected many in a similar way to The Blair Witch Project, the film was revealed to have been produced in a small flat in Camden, North London, and not in the New Mexico Desert of Roswell,” said Dower. “With its makers describing it as ‘a restoration,' it is still possible that it's based on original frames from an existing post-war film. I've directed some bonkers documentaries in my time, but never one in which it is so difficult to work out what is real and what isn't.”

Arron Fellows, creative director at Mindhouse, added, “It's incredible that the alien autopsy story has never been told in a premium documentary before, and we're thrilled to be working with John Dower at Mindhouse again, after his success with Lockerbie. We look forward to him bringing the same storytelling craft and journalistic rigor to a tale that is as provocative now as it was in the 90s—and taps into our timeless fascination with extraterrestrial life.”

Harry King Television has attached two new hosts to its new original series Curiosity—Izzie Balmer (Antiques Road Trip, The Travelling Auctioneers) and Bee Harford (The Travelling Auctioneers)—and signed Norse Key Studios as global distributor.

Confirmed by the scientific community—an extraterrestrial mineral found in a meteorite breaks known laws by expanding in an unusual way when heated

There is something that has the entire scientific community on edge because there is absolutely nothing like it on Earth. It is an extraterrestrial mineral, or at least that is what they believe in the article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and it all comes from a meteorite that fell in what is now Germany in 1724!!!

It is called silica tridymite, a very rare form of silicon dioxide that has nothing similar on our planet, and the most curious thing about this element is that it has the ability to maintain a constant thermal conductivity!! And now they believe new ways of working with this material could open up in industries where high temperatures are needed (such as steel production).

This mineral cannot be classified as crystal or as glass, it is something that intrigues the entire community, what is it?! Something that came from space, we suppose. But now it could help reduce carbon emissions on Earth, and seeing how fast the greenhouse effect is advancing, maybe it is our last bullet, don't you think?

Tridymite was found in a meteorite and, surprisingly, it has also been detected on Mars (everything takes us to Mars, why is that!!). What most puzzles experts is that it breaks the normal rules of heat conduction. While crystals tend to lose thermal conductivity when heated and glasses tend to increase it, this material maintains a constant level, and that is what makes it the perfect candidate for other applications, and the metallurgical industry is already thinking about how to include it!

According to the researchers, it has a point of order like that of crystals, but also a touch of disorder like that of glasses. That is, it does not fit entirely into any category, and that is exactly what gives it such peculiar properties.

Think about it, only in the United States, this sector emits about 7% of all the CO₂ in the country, and an important part of that impact comes from the extreme heat they need to handle. If materials like tridymite could be used in that context, energy expenditure and emissions could be greatly reduced.

If this material can be replicated or adapted, the possibility of reducing the environmental impact of one of the most polluting industries on the planet would open up. This makes it not only a scientific finding, but also a strategic one for the fight against climate change.

The study is called Temperature-invariant crystal–glass heat conduction: From meteorites to refractories and it is nothing more than the beginning!! From here, researchers believe new heat-resistant materials could be developed inspired by this mineral that came from space.

The most interesting thing is that, unintentionally, a piece of rock that fell from the sky centuries ago could help us build a more sustainable future on Earth. And although there is still much to investigate, this shows that looking at the universe not only serves to understand what is out there, but also to improve what we have here inside. Mars, get ready because soon we are coming for more!

Supernatural ran for 15 epic seasons, building one of the most loyal fandoms in TV history. The Winchester brothers, their angelic allies, and even their demonic frenemies, portrayed by the talented supernatural cast, left an undeniable mark — and plenty of swooning fans in their wake.

While the series may have ended, the cast's charisma, talent, and undeniable good looks are timeless. Here's our countdown of the 10 hottest cast members of Supernatural, ranked from “smokin' hot” to “absolutely irresistible.” This list showcases the best of the supernatural cast's appeal.



Bobby Singer might not be your typical “heartthrob,” but let's face it — rugged charm has its own appeal. Jim Beaver's gravelly voice, no-nonsense attitude, and fierce loyalty made him one of the most beloved members of the Supernatural cast. A man who can teach you how to hunt demons and whip up a decent breakfast? That's hot.

Related: Supernatural: Why We Love Bobby Singer



John Winchester may have been a controversial father figure, but Jeffrey Dean Morgan has been oozing charisma since his first appearance. Rugged, brooding, and magnetic, he set the tone for why the Winchester men would forever dominate TV crush lists.



As the snarky King of Hell, Mark Sheppard brought a sly, devilish kind of sex appeal. His mischievous grin, impeccable suits, and sharp wit gave “bad boy energy” a whole new meaning. Crowley proved that even demons can be dangerously charming, a testament to the show's exceptional cast of supernatural characters.



The nephilim son of Lucifer may have been born into chaos, but Alexander Calvert's boyish good looks and soulful performance made fans instantly protective of him. With his gentle demeanor and piercing eyes, Jack became one of the late-series highlights — and earned a spot on this list.



Before Katie Cassidy went on to Arrow, she turned heads as the first Ruby on Supernatural. Fierce, fiery, and impossible to ignore, Cassidy gave the demon a seductive edge that fans still talk about today as part of the captivating Supernatural cast.



Though Bela's time on the show was brief, Lauren Cohan's sly thief left a lasting impression. With her British accent, sharp style, and cunning charm, she brought dangerous elegance to the Winchester universe — and stole more than a few hearts along the way.



As the tough and determined Jo Harvelle, Alona Tal gave Supernatural one of its most relatable and crush-worthy hunters. Jo's bravery, loyalty, and natural beauty made her a fan favorite, even if her run was tragically short.



From the moment Castiel stepped onto the screen in his trench coat, he had fans falling — literally — for him. Misha Collins' piercing blue eyes, stoic presence, and dry humor made his portrayal of the angel unforgettable. To many, he was the most divine part of the beloved show's supernatural cast.



Sam Winchester's soulful eyes, shaggy hair, and tall frame made Jared Padalecki a natural heartthrob. He brought both vulnerability and strength to the role, turning “moose” into a fan obsession. Whether researching lore in the bunker or battling monsters, Sam's quiet intensity made him endlessly appealing.



Topping the list is none other than Jensen Ackles, the face of Dean Winchester. With his roguish smirk, leather jacket swagger, and husky voice, Jensen became the ultimate Supernatural crush. He's equal parts tough and tender, with enough charisma to carry an entire franchise. After 15 seasons, there's no doubt — the supernatural cast's Dean Winchester remains the hottest of them all.

Supernatural gave fans more than monster hunts and family drama — it gave us a Supernatural cast worth swooning over. From angels and demons to hunters and thieves, the show's lineup was stacked with stars who captured our hearts in unforgettable ways. Indeed, supernatural in every sense of the word.

If you find yourself missing the show, don't despair. You can still go back and watch all your favorite episodes on Netflix.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

Image: Supplied / NASA

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ""Independent Media"".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ""Beyond the Light Barrier"", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the ""Sunday Tribune"" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the ""lightning bird"" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

Anand Wilder's Psychic Lessons Influences Playlist

The Yeasayer co-founder shares how everyone from Bill Withers to Charlotte Adigéry inspired his latest solo album.

With 232 pages and an expanded 12″ by 12″ format, our biggest print issue yet celebrates the people, places, music, and art of our hometown, including cover features on David Lynch, Nipsey Hussle, Syd, and Phoebe Bridgers' Saddest Factory Records, plus Brian Wilson, Cuco, Ty Segall, Lord Huron, Remi Wolf, The Doors, the art of RISK, Taz, Estevan Oriol, Kii Arens, and Edward Colver, and so much more. 

Each member's strengths are on high alert, making the alt-metal band's thrashing and highly imaginative 10th album a thing of brutal beauty.

The songwriter's intimately recorded latest LP is a simple affair where humor and bluntness roam freely and his typical experimentation hardly obscures the beauty of his songwriting craft.

The YouTuber-turned-rapper's production style reaches a new zenith, with the LP's intensity perfectly complementing Benjamin Lasky's verses exploring obsession, alienation, and self-destruction.

If you were to grab a music dictionary (a thing that certainly exists) and thumb through until you get to the term “psych pop,” you might just see a photo of Anand Wilder in place of a definition. Since his early days as a co-founder of one of indie rock's great what-ifs, Yeasayer, Wilder has been a consistent purveyor of slightly off-center, deliriously catchy, crunchy, and wacky pop songs. Perhaps my dude is an expensive bottle of wine, because his ability to craft unimpeachably good rock songs is getting better with age. 

His 2025 solo LP Psychic Lessons is what lazier writers than myself might call a tour de force, but which I will refer to lovingly as a proper wall-to-wall slapper. Taking a look at some of the songs Wilder chose for his “influences” playlist helps illuminate some of the places he pulls from for Psychic Lessons—even beyond salvaging scrapped beats for a Heems album. Westerman and Porches seem like predictable enough choices, but electropop vocalist Charlotte Adigéry makes an appearance, as does soul icon Bill Withers, dance-punk revivalists Automatic, and a number of '80s-era blockbuster film scores. It's a real array of artists that write songs as electrifying as Wilder—good company for Psychic Lessons, indeed. 

Check out his full playlist below, and listen to Psychic Lessons here.

Westerman, “Easy Money”Got obsessed with his Bullion-produced album—great songs and production. I think I tried to emulate some of their production tricks on the bridge to “Give Us a Wink” on my album.

Roger Miller, “They Won't Get Me”[Co-writer] Walter Fancourt and I were on a Giorgio Moroder kick and were loving the synth-country thing. I think Moroder produced the whole Superman III soundtrack. I love the synth pedal steel sound on this song; I tried to copy it on “Get a Dog.”

Haruomi Hosono, ""Shimendōka"" (四面道歌)“Tech Job” was initially named Hosono Numan when Walter and I were recording it, since it had some Hosono and Gary Numan qualities. 

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, “Shamas-Ud-Doha, Badar-Ud-Doja”“Appointment in Samarra” was initially named “Nusrat Dundee” when Walter and I were recording it, since it had some Nusrat and Crocodile Dundee soundtrack qualities.

Paul Spring, “Money and Love”Paul Spring does this baroque Bach thing combined with really high-level songwriting, satirical and profound poetry. He's so prolific—I aspire to achieve this level of songcraft and guitar-picking prowess, but I think I missed my window.

Heems, “Damn, Girl”A lot of the songs on the album started out as me and Walter attempting to make beats for Hima to use on an album—it was a liberating exercise in just coming up with different rhythms without being too precious. I think “Bog People” started out as one of these beats. He'll use one of our beats someday.

Jachary, “Corner of La Isla”Met Jachary after an Animal Collective show when L'Rain was opening up (he plays bass in L'Rain). We hit it off, and he opened for me at National Sawdust. Then I asked him to help produce the new album. Great ear for production, great bass playing, and synthesizer tweaking expert—talented guy.

Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul, “Thank You”Mark Creegan, Yeasayer's old sound guy, put me on to Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul. Walter and I saw them at Elsewhere while we were recording—incredible show. This is the song Creegan first shared with me.

Automatic, “Skyscraper”Love the space in Automatic's music—so simple but so massive, spare bass and drums and thick synths, great arrangements, great hooks, classic band. Jachary told me about them. I love blasting this loud while driving around with the windows down. Makes me feel tough in my Subaru Outback.  

Porches, “Find Me”The late great promoter and Baby's All Right owner Billy Jones told me about Porches, and I've always loved this song. Fun to play during DJ sets; cool, distinctive voice; weird melodies; nice, skippy dance production.

El Michels Affair feat. Piya Malik, “Unathi”A muso friend of mine Zeshan Malik told me about this great album at one of my King Tai DJ sets. El Michels Affair is just an incredible sonic sculptor and arranger-producer, and Piya Malik's voice and melody are so fun and hooky and nostalgic. I don't understand any words, but maybe someday I'll learn 'em...

Mariangela Celeste & Vangelis, “My Dear Life”Love the early drum machine and synth sounds on this. Mariangela's voice kinda reminds me of ABBA but wider vocal vibrato. The cascading synths are kinda like what we were going for on “Molly's Song.”

Walter Fancourt, “Contractor”This is a great instrumental that Walter put on this year, also mixed by Eric Zeiler who mixed my record. Freaky free-form jazz stuff, but with fun electronic beats. This is a great showpiece for Walter's many musical sides. 

Aldous Harding, “Zoo Eyes”I probably already put this on another list, but whatever—I just love Aldous Harding's voice and weird lyrics and the silky production. I tripped on acid really late at night and we just listened to this album over and over again, and I truly believed she's tapped into the secrets of the universe. My spirit guide whispering in my ear.

Bill Withers, “We Could Be Sweet Lovers”This was another song Walter introduced me to and the song Social Exile started with Walter playing a similar chord progression. “'80s island vibes” was a continuous reference point for the album—glass marimba and steel drum sounds to make you feel like you're sitting on the beach.

Amadou & Mariam, “Sabali”I always liked the lo-fi to hi-fi trick on this song, which I tried to rip off for “Selkie Bride” using a thinly miked-up Vangoa keyboard at the start, which then bursts into full spectrum after one long verse. I think we got it to work pretty well.

      If companies like Boeing or Lockheed Martin really are sitting on non-human intelligence tech (NHI), the U.S. government would have a huge problem: how do you keep something that valuable secret when it's technically inside publicly traded corporations?
    


      Shareholders, analysts, quarterly reports waaay too many eyes. The easiest fix? Just buy them out. Privatize the whole thing. Turn them into black-budget R&D labs under direct government control, with total security over the workforce.
    


      And it wouldn't even be insanely expensive compared to other things the goverment waists money on. A few hundred billion dollars is basically pocket change in Washingtn  Boeing and Lockheed at 2x market value are still very cheap compared next to overinflated tech companies.
    


      If nhi tech was on the table, that would probably be the best deal in history. The Trump administration already has a lot of connections in the private equity and investments & business intelligence defence branche ie Palantir and Anduril.

            President Donald Trump said Friday that Chicago will be the next city that his administration targets for a federal crackdown on crime and suggested a longer and more intense campaign in the nation's capital.
    


            “We'll straighten that one out, probably next, that will be our next one after this,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I think Chicago will be our next and then we'll help with New York.”
    


            The president has credited his federal takeover of Washington, DC's police force and deployment of the National Guard there with driving down crime in the city — touting a weeklong stretch without any murders as a “miracle” despite the fact that such weeks have occurred in DC multiple times so far this year.
    


            He said he could keep National Guard members in the city “as long as I want” by declaring a national emergency, a prospect likely to unnerve city residents. More than 1,900 National Guard troops from multiple states — including DC, West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee guards — have been mobilized in DC as of Thursday, according to Joint Task Force-DC.
    


            Trump also took aim at DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and threatened to do more than just seize control of the police force if she didn't “get her act straight.”
    


            “I'm tired of listening to these people say how safe it was before we got here. It was unsafe. It was horrible. And Mayor Bowser better get her act straight, or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government running like it's supposed to be run,” Trump said.
    


            Trump dismissed polling that showed most city residents disapprove of the deployment of federal troops, calling it “fake news” and claiming that residents of Chicago and cities are clamoring for a similar law enforcement crackdown where they live.
    


            “They're wearing red hats, African American ladies, beautiful ladies, are saying, ‘Please, President Trump, come to Chicago,'” Trump said.
    


            He attacked Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson as “incompetent,” claiming the city has grown dangerous on his watch and vowing to use the federal government to intervene.
    


            “When we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago just like we did DC,” he said.
    


            It was not immediately clear how a federal crackdown in Chicago would work and how closely it would resemble what has happened in DC. The district is not a part of any state and has restrictions on its ability to govern its own affairs, so the president has the ability to effectively federalize its police force.
    


            In his comments Friday, Trump seemed to conflate keeping the National Guard deployed in DC with his takeover of the local police department. He said he could subvert a provision under the District of Columbia's Home Rule Act, which says the federal government can seize control of the city's police force for up to 30 days during emergencies. After that, he would need congressional approval to continue controlling the Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            In a hearing last week, Justice Department attorneys told a federal judge that unless Congress extended Trump's ability to effectively control Washington, DC's police department, Trump's order would expire.
    


            But Trump, who pledged to eliminate crime when he deployed federal law enforcement earlier this month, has now suggested on multiple occasions that he'll need to maintain his influence over the city's policing for far longer to cut down on crime long-term.
    


            “It's one thing to get them out, it's another thing to keep them out for a long period of time,” Trump said. “That's going to take more than 30 days.”
    


            The president also said he's already talked with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune about a planned request for $2 billion to funnel toward beautifying DC. He said that would be “very easy to get.”
    


            As CNN's Daniel Dale has reported, violent crime in DC declined in 2024 and 2025 after a spike in 2023. The Justice Department is investigating whether the DC Metropolitan Police Department manipulated crime dated.

“Our public health system is weaker than ever before,” said the union representing CDC workers.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Hundreds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees are losing their jobs after a federal judge ruled on August 12 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was barred from terminating employees at only six CDC divisions. The court's prior ruling had protected all CDC staff. 

The litigation stems from HHS Director Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s efforts to terminate thousands of HHS employees. In March, Kennedy announced that 10,000 of the department's workers would be laid off, including 2,400 staff from the CDC. Kennedy, who has long peddled health disinformation to the public, has made numerous false claims about vaccines, COVID-19, chronic diseases, and autism.

Shortly after the layoffs were announced, Kennedy said that some people were mistakenly terminated, like the team that worked on preventing lead poisoning, and would be asked back. Court orders prevented the remaining layoffs from taking effect, but the recent federal court's ruling cleared the way for at least 600 CDC employees to lose their jobs. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the union representing more than 2,000 CDC workers, said in a statement on Wednesday that, “Due to a staggering lack of transparency from HHS, AFGE Local 2883 has not received formal notice of which groups are being separated today so we can't even determine the full extent of everything being lost.”  

“However, we know that America is less safe, our public health system is weaker than ever before, and our workforce is less capable of responding to public health threats,” the union continued.

Of those being laid off, the union said: “Some of the offices and divisions now being separated include the very groups that have worked to keep everyone safe from violence and injuries; to track and respond to HIV outbreaks; to form and strengthen public health partnerships to promote immunization; to conduct research and control costly chronic diseases debilitating millions of Americans like Alzheimer's, Arthritis, oral health issues, and others.”

Among the CDC staff who lost their jobs were those who worked in violence prevention. The layoffs come after a gunman shot hundreds of rounds of bullets on the grounds of the CDC campus in Atlanta on August 8, killing DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose before he took his own life. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation found that the gunman “wanted to make the public aware of his public distrust of the vaccines.”

After the shooting, more than 750 former and current HHS staffers demanded that Kennedy stop spreading lies about vaccines. 

“The attack came amid growing mistrust in public institutions, driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization — and now, violence,” they wrote in a letter to Kennedy and members of Congress. “Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is complicit in dismantling America's public health infrastructure and endangering the nation's health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information[.]”

Kennedy's “dangerous and deceitful statements and actions have contributed to the harassment and violence experienced by CDC staff,” the staffers went on.

In another statement released after the shooting, former CDC staff, including those who worked in the department's Division of Violence Prevention, called on public health leaders to “protect the people who protect the public. The safety of our communities, our colleagues and our country depends on it.”

“As former scientists and public health professionals in CDC's Division of Violence Prevention, our mission was to prevent this exact kind of harm,” they wrote. “The irony is devastating: the very experts trained to understand, interrupt and prevent this kind of violence were among those whose jobs were eliminated in the April 1 federal government reduction-in-force.”

            Multiple fatalities and injuries, including children, were reported Friday after a tour bus with about 50 passengers headed back to New York City from Niagara Falls crashed into a ditch, state police said.
    


            The bus rolled over after losing control for “unknown reasons,” New York State Police spokesperson James O'Callaghan said at a news conference.
    


            Several people were entrapped and others were ejected from the bus, O'Callaghan said. Authorities are actively responding to the crash scene and “a lot” of rescues are still ongoing, noting some people who are entrapped may still be alive.
    


            “We believe there is a child that is a fatality,” he said.
    


            Translators are also coming to assist police as most of the people on the tour bus were Indian, Chinese and Filipino, O'Callaghan said.
    


            A list of the passengers provided by the bus company confirms there were 52 people on board, including the driver, police said in a statement.
    


            The accident took place along Interstate 90 eastbound near the town of Pembroke, east of Buffalo, New York, a state police spokesperson said in a statement. The state Thruway is currently closed in both directions near the crash site, state police say.
    


            Helicopters, ambulances and law enforcement swarmed the crash site, where the bus was seen on its side with many people gathered around it.
    


            The state's department of transportation is trying to help people get off the interstate as some remain stranded due to the incident, O'Callaghan said.
    


            “It's a very volatile scene. We have vehicles going the wrong way on the 90,” he said.
    


            Victims are being taken to the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, O'Callaghan said.
    


            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul described the crash as “tragic” and said first responders are “working to rescue and provide assistance to everyone involved” in a post on X.

            The job market is on such shaky ground that the Federal Reserve may soon need to cut interest rates to support the economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday at a key central banking forum.
    


            In one of his most consequential speeches, Powell suggested the labor market could benefit from lower rates, which the Fed has kept unchanged for eight straight months.
    


            “Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He said the possibility of Trump's tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.”
    


            “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he added.
    


            The Jackson Hole conference is typically a major event in the world of central banking in which the Fed chair sets the tone for the rest of the year, but it has a radically different backdrop this year.
    


            Powell's Jackson Hole remarks, his last such as Fed chair, come at an inflection point in the central bank's 111-year history. The Fed — and Powell in particular — has been subject to an unprecedented onslaught on attacks from the White House since Trump began his second term in January. But now, the Trump administration is expanding its assault on the central bank.
    


            The Justice Department has signaled it plans to investigate Fed Governor Lisa Cook after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her committing mortgage fraud.
    


Powell set to give key speech as Trump administration ramps up pressure for a Fed overhaul



            Trump continues to demand massive rate cuts as his administration actively searches for who will replace Powell once his term as chair ends in May 2026. At the same time, he is also slowly reshaping the Fed.
    


            Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, whom Trump elevated earlier this year to her current post, is actively reviewing banking regulation and is widely expected to ease rules on the largest banks. Some of the contenders for Fed chair have vowed to downsize the central bank's workforce if they're chosen.
    


            Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors after former Fed governor Adriana Kugler resigned earlier this month.
    


            And if Cook is pushed out and Miran is confirmed, that would tilt the make-up of the central bank's board in favor of Trump, with only two Fed governors appointed by a Democratic president. Powell has refused to reveal if he plans to stay on the Fed's board after his term as chair ends in May 2026. He has a separate concurrent term as Fed governor that runs through 2028.
    


            “The Fed board is comprised of seven governors, one of them the chairman. With a four-person majority, the Board can fire regional Fed bank presidents who play a key role in interest rate decisions,” Jon Hilsenrath, senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX, wrote in a statement on LinkedIn Thursday.
    


            “Each one of these board seats matters a great deal to a president who wants to reshape how the central bank works and what it decides. Getting rid of Cook would be a way for the President to build that four-person majority,” he added.
    


            Fed officials make their decisions on interest rates based solely on what economic figures show in striving for their dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices — not based on what politicians demand of them. Powell reiterated that point in his speech.
    


            “(Fed) members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks,” Powell said. “We will never deviate from that approach.”

MOSCOW, August 22. /TASS/. No meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky is planned, the Russian leader will be ready for it when an agenda takes shape, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on NBC News.

""No meeting is being planned,"" Lavrov said. ""Putin will be ready to meet with Zelensky, if the agenda for the summit is prepared. This agenda is not ready at all,"" he added.

On August 18, following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, US President Donald Trump received Zelensky, as well as Finnish and French Presidents Alexander Stubb and Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The meeting was attended by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. During the meeting, Trump called Putin, with whom, according to the US leader, he discussed, among other things, the prospects for a meeting between the Russian leader and Zelensky, and then trilateral negotiations.

Soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert and relatives of troops killed in action were among those to attend a banquet

Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday.

The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said.

“The combat activities of overseas operational forces … proved without regret the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,” Kim said.

Kim laid a flower at a memorial for North Korean soldiers who had died overseas, while soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert, KCNA said, adding that relatives of troops killed in action had been among those attending a banquet.

The events were the latest public show of gratitude by the regime in Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that surrounded North Korea's role in the war when its troops were first sent to Russia last autumn.

Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said.

The ceremony comes days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay tribute to North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

In a letter to Kim to mark the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in August 1945, Putin described North Korean troops as “heroic” and recalled how Soviet units and North Korean forces had also fought together to end Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula.

“The bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,” Putin said.

Russia and North Korea forged increasingly close military and diplomatic ties, triggering international concern that the North's troops are acquiring valuable combat experience that could one day be used against the country's neighbour, South Korea.

Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and in April this year, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed a contingent of soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops.

Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South's intelligence agency.

This week's official tributes appeared to be intended to “justify the deployment and boost morale”, the South's Yonhap news agency quoted a unification ministry official as saying.

Ukrainian President Zelensky is pushing a massive deal for U.S. weapons funded by Europe in what observers call a bid to buy the flighty U.S. President Donald Trump's dedication.

Zelensky wants Europe to pay the U.S. $90 billion for weapons to Ukraine, ""that we don't have ourselves: above all, planes and air defense, etc. — we'll leave it at 'etc.' for now,"" as he said in a briefing after the meeting earlier this week. Kyiv is also proposing a $50 billion drone deal with the U.S. as part of the offer.

There are specific pieces of American military kit that have no European analogs at the moment. But the biggest item on the Ukrainian wish list is the exceedingly rare commodity of Trump's attention. The proposed deal's main purpose is ""to entice Trump into political commitment,"" said John Foreman, a former defense attaché for the U.K. who served in both Moscow and Kyiv.

""Now, fortunately or unfortunately, America still provides those more exquisite capabilities: fast jets — despite capacity issues — missiles, air defenses, sensors, radars, highly protected armored vehicles, those sort of things,” Foreman told the Kyiv Independent.

""But it isn't just about having tanks, it's about signing on to a long-term political rhythm from Trump.""

Trump has gone back and forth in public rhetoric regarding Ukraine. His administration has periodically frozen weapons deliveries that had already been approved. Just in the past week of negotiations, he has floated and retracted the prospect of giving Russia more Ukrainian territory.

""How can anybody possibly do diplomacy when the leader of the free world is changing his mind every time he gets out of bed?"" Foreman quipped.

The appearance of European political royalty like France's Emmanuel Macron and the U.K.'s Keir Starmer at the White House alongside Zelensky was ""about the purity of the relationship with the Americans for Europe and for Ukraine,"" according to Chatham House associate fellow Timothy Ash.

""I'm sure if you got all those leaders and met them privately and they could say what they actually think, they would say 'we can't trust the Americans and we need to build our own autonomous defense capability,'"" Ash told the Kyiv Independent. 

""But that's going to take five to ten years in the interim. We'll still be dependent on U.S. arms supplies, so we hope the Americans continue to supply that kit until we're self-sufficient. That's the game plan.""

Massive arms deals are among Trump's favorite tools of foreign policy. The Pentagon in May touted a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia as the largest in history. If completed, it might be true, though the ultimate rollout of a similarly massive $110 billion set of memoranda of intent with Saudi Arabia in 2017 remains in question.

Beyond political concerns, the top item on Ukraine's wishlist is Patriot air defense systems, said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile specialist at the Oslo Nuclear Program.

""As a European, I'd rather keep that money in Europe, but there are just some products that are really difficult to get elsewhere,"" Hoffmann told the Kyiv Independent. ""Patriot batteries and interceptors are probably the number-one product that they're looking to buy because that's just something where the SAMP/T is falling short and there's not really an alternative.""

Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted a massive glut in weapons buying. The U.S. State Department tallied a record $117.9 billion in foreign arms transfers in 2024, compared to $47 billion in 2021, the year before. That has left the world's arms producers on backorder.

""The waiting time for a newly produced Patriot Missile right now is something like 4-5 years,” said Hoffmann.

Zelensky's newly proposed drone deal is an expanded version of an earlier ""mega deal"" to sell Ukrainian drones to the U.S. The $50 billion figure is more than the total amount of cash publicly known to have gone into the Ukrainian drone industry. Ukrainian drone experts are cheering.

""It will bring engineering design to a level even higher than programming solutions from the IT sphere,"" Vitaliy Zaytsev, an aerospace engineer who runs unmanned aerial vehicle programs at three of Ukraine's top universities, told the Kyiv Independent. 

""It will make the country different, making us exporters of technology and not just raw materials.""

Despite EU leaders rallying around Zelensky at this White House appearance, none have publicly signed on to funding the prospective new weapons deals.

""Europe is a $27 trillion economy, $100 billion is small change for Europe,"" said Ash, using the $100 billion number first reported by the Financial Times before Zelensky's public statement about the deal.

""The question is whether Europe and Ukraine can trust the Americans to honor defense supply agreements when Trump has proved not particularly reliable.""

For the first time in decades, Syria and Israel have discussed the Golan Heights, Israeli troops in Syria and humanitarian aid for Syria's Druze community. Is this the beginning of establishing diplomatic ties?  

For the first time in decades, Syrian and Israeli officials held high-level face-to-face talks. Earlier this week, the US-brokered summit in Paris was attended behind closed doors by Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and the US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack.

Key points on the agenda were the de-escalation of tensions between Syria and Israel, non-interference in Syrian domestic affairs and reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria. A further issue was humanitarian assistance for Syria's Druze minority.

On Wednesday, an Israeli government spokesperson told DW that Israel refrained from commenting on the Paris meeting. But Syria's national SANA news agency reported that the meeting concluded with the commitment to further talks. A previous round of talks with supporting officials in late July had ended without an official agreement. 

These direct talks mark a diplomatic shift after 25 years of virtually no communication at all.

The two countries have technically been at war since 1967. That year, Israel occupied Syria's Golan Heights — a strategic plateau along their shared border — and later annexed it in 1981. The international community continues to regard the Golan Heights as Syrian territory under Israeli military occupation. To date, only the United States and Israel officially recognize it as part of Israel.

A ceasefire deal in 1974 set up a demilitarized UN buffer zone in the Golan Heights along the Israel-Syria border.

However, tensions between the countries have been soaring since the fall of Syria's long-term dictator Bashar Assad in December 2024. Israel deployed troops beyond the demilitarized zone and carried out around 1,000 strikes on Syria — which has not retaliated.

Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa condemned the attacks but repeatedly said that he doesn't want to go to war with Israel.

""Under current circumstances, it is difficult to envision that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government would be considering concessions beyond reciprocal offers to refrain from interfering in the efforts of Syria's new rulers to consolidate power,"" Shalom Lipner, a veteran diplomat and former advisor to seven Israeli prime ministers, including Benjamin Netanyahu, told DW.

""Immediate Israeli goals are to guarantee security along the border region with Syria, prevent any entrenchment of hostile interlopers who might compromise an accommodation with Damascus, and additionally, ensure the protection of Syria's Druze population."" 

A Syrian source, quoted by SANA, confirmed that during the meeting in Paris, Israel had also insisted on establishing a humanitarian corridor into Sweida, where many of Syria's Druze minority live. In Israel, the Druze are a community of around 150,000 people. It is the only minority that are conscripted into Israel's military. In Syria, around 700,000 Druze make up one of Syria's largest minority communities.

In mid-July, a week of sectarian violence had led to more than 1,700 deaths, including civilians, in fighting between the Druze community and Arab Bedouins.

While a US-brokered ceasefire largely ended the clashes, locals have been reporting that Damascus keeps throttling access of humanitarian aid into Sweida. Syrian officials dismiss such claims. According to the news platform Axios, however, government officials expressed concern that Druze militias could use a humanitarian corridor to smuggle weapons. The Druze have meanwhile repeatedly taken to the streets to call for self-determination. 

This week, Action For Humanity, the parent NGO of Syria Relief, published an alarming report.

""The humanitarian situation is deteriorating amid reported shortages in essential services and restrictions on freedom of movement,"" the NGO said, adding that ""displaced civilians are largely dependent on informal shelter arrangements with relatives and friends, and severe food insecurity persists.""

In turn, Yossi Mekelberg, senior consulting fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House, views the current talks as Damascus' chance for gaining trust within the country and abroad.

""Improving the way in which minorities are treated could serve Syria to create the space for the government to unite the country, improve its image vis-a-vis the United States and the rest of the world,"" he told DW. ""It could also deescalate tensions with Israel as for them, the issue of the Druze is the most pertinent.""

In his view, this could eventually lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from beyond the 1974 buffer zone in Syria's south.

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, an independent organization working to prevent wars, agrees that the talks could help Damascus ""regaining trust not only of the Druze community, but also of different communities that are not aligned with the state,"" he told DW.

Observers widely agree that Washington continues to be set on enhancing security and stability in the region by fostering a ""prosperous Middle East"" as envisioned by US President Donald Trump.

Part and parcel of this vision is normalizing ties between Syria and Israel.

""From Israel's perspective, normalization would be a longer-term, aspirational objective,"" Shalom Lipner believes.

Yossi Mekelberg doesn't see a prospect of normalization yet, ""given that the war in Gaza continues.""

But should that war end, and if progress between Israel and Syria continued ""it might lead to a normalization process,"" he said, stressing though that ""it is unknown which direction Syria is taking, and it is also unknown what direction Israel is taking at the moment.""

			Court upholds cull order at Canadian farm infected with avian flu despite protesters pleading for birds to be spared

Robert F Kennedy Jr and Mehmet Oz have failed in their efforts to spare the lives of 400 ostriches at a farm infected with avian flu.

A panel of three judges in Canada dismissed the appeal of Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski, the owners of Universal Ostrich Farms, 55 miles north of the US border.

Mr Kennedy, the US health secretary and Dr Oz, director of the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), joined a raft of activists fighting for the cull to be stopped.

The mass slaughter had been ordered by the Canadian authorities after the highly contagious disease was detected in two bird carcases at the 65-acre farm in Edgewood, British Columbia.

A federal court upheld the ruling despite hundreds of protesters descending on the farm to plead for the birds to be spared.

The farm's owners resisted the demands for a cull, saying the remainder of the flock was healthy.

While Dr Oz offered sanctuary to the remainder of the flock at his 900-acre ranch in Okeechobee, Florida, Mr Kennedy made a personal appeal to Paul McKinnon, the president of the Canadian food inspection agency.

“We believe the decision to cull the entire flock of approximately 400 ostriches – made nearly six months after the positive test results – will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds,” Mr Kennedy wrote.

“Further, because Avian influenza has been around for thousands of years and is endemic in wild bird populations in the United States and Canada, efforts to extirpate it by culling birds will be fruitless unless we are willing to exterminate every wild bird in North America.”

Mr Kennedy added: “The indiscriminate destruction of entire flocks without up-to-date testing and evaluation can have significant consequences, including the loss of valuable genetic stock that may help explain risk factors for HN51 mortality.

“This may be important for agricultural resilience.”

The farm said it was not giving up the fight to save the birds and urged supporters to gather at the farm this weekend.

It appealed to them to “stand against destruction and shine a light of love”.

Katie Pasitney, speaking on behalf of the farm, described the ruling as “devastating”, adding that everything “was on the table” in the campaign to save the ostriches.

Writing on Facebook, she added: “For 219 days, our flock has remained strong, vibrant, and healthy. The CFIA has not set foot on our farm in over five months, but still claims there is a threat here.”

In a brief statement, the Canadian agency said its responsibility was to minimise the impact on the Canadian poultry industry. It also declined to give details on when the cull will take place.

Residents of steel communities say fence-line monitoring for dangerous air pollution must be mandatory.

A deadly explosion at a U.S. Steel coke plant near Pittsburgh has brought renewed attention to the steel industry's aging facilities. Steelworkers and community activists say the Trump administration has put their health at risk by delaying and potentially scrapping pollution monitoring rules meant to protect nearby neighborhoods from dangerous toxins released into the air by the nation's steel and coke plants.

On August 11, a massive explosion at U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works in Clairton, Pennsylvania, left two workers dead and sent at least 10 others to the hospital. It took rescuers hours to find workers still alive in the wreckage after the blast, which shook homes across a tight-knit steel mill community nestled along the Monongahela River valley. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, but officials suspect a faulty valve and a fatal buildup of gas.

“I could physically feel my body shake. That's how loud it was and that's how alarming it was,” nearby resident Germaine Patterson told reporters on August 21.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works is considered the largest coke-producing operation in North America. Workers at the plant bake coal in massive ovens into coke, a hard, grey, porous, carbon-rich substance that is shipped on the river for use in the blast furnaces of plants that make iron and then steel. The facility has a long history of clean air violations and accidents, including an explosion in February that injured two workers, according to the Associated Press.  

Along with postponing the hazardous are toxin rules, President Donald Trump also recently approved the nearly $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, raising hopes that new ownership could bring investments in new, cleaner steel-making technology that could reduce pollution in communities such as Clairton while preserving jobs residents have depended on for generations. However, the recent explosion is raising questions about whether Nippon Steel is willing to spend the money necessary to retrofit U.S. Steel's aging infrastructure.

Clairton Coke Works and other coke and steel facilities have a long record of violating the Clean Air Act, according to a report released this week by the Environmental Integrity Project. Over the past five years, the plant racked up $10.7 million in fines while state and federal regulators took 14 enforcement actions to hold the facility accountable to clean air laws.

A top pollutant of concern near coke facilities is benzene, a known carcinogen linked to cancer, anemia, and other health issues. At Clairton Coke Works, the highest six-month average concentration of benzene detected by a series of air monitors at the facility's fence line was nearly 26 micrograms per cubic meter — about eight times higher than is considered safe for public health.

Clairton Coke Works is not alone. One monitor at the ABC Coke plant in Alabama registered six-month average levels of benzene at the facility perimeter from 2022 to 2023 more than four times the recognized limit for protecting human health over the long term, according to the report. In 2023, the 20 steel mills and coke operations investigated in the report released as much carbon dioxide as 10.1 million cars driving for a year, along with nearly 2.4 million pounds of benzene, chromium, and other hazardous pollutants.

Jen Duggan, the executive director at the Environmental Integrity Project, said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data on emissions included in the report is self-reported by the industry, and people living near these facilities are likely exposed to much more pollution on a daily basis.

“These emissions are often the results of leaks in valves and other equipment and flaring … that are impossible to detect all of the time and often go underreported,” Duggan said at a press conference on August 21. “There is a significant difference between reported and actual emissions that communities downwind are breathing in.”

In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration finalized regulations requiring coke facilities to install air monitors at the fence line to test for benzene blowing in the wind, and requiring steel mills to monitor for chromium, a toxic heavy metal linked to an array of health problems. If the levels of the toxins exceeded certain limits set by the EPA, the regulations would require operators to identify and fix the problem.

The regulations were a massive win for environmental justice activists and residents living near steel and coke facilities and were supposed to go into effect this year, but like a long list of other environmental, climate, and public health protections, the Trump administration recently delayed implementation of the rules on behalf of the industry and may scrap them altogether.

Qiyam Ansari, executive director of Valley Clean Air Now in Pennsylvania, said people living in Clairton and the heavily industrialized Mon Valley already live with some of the worst air quality in the nation. The benzene and chromium from the steel industry are major contributors to the “toxic burden our bodies carry,” he said. 

“It is absolutely having an effect on people, and that's why the fence-line monitoring is a bare minimum, so it will at least tell us what is out there and what we are suffering from and how to take precautions,” Ansari told Truthout.

Mandatory fence-line monitoring would also help environmental justice groups hold the industry and regulators accountable when aging facilities such as Clairton Coke Works consistently have problems. However, beyond rolling back environmental protections, the Trump administration is also slashing funding for government agencies that oversee polluting industries, including the EPA and U.S. Chemical Safety Board.

“Our elders deserve to breathe without fear that every day it shortens their lives,” Ansari said. “Fence-line monitoring is not optional. It is the bare minimum for justice.”

On August 6, just days before the Clairton Coke Works explosion, a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging its decision to delay compliance with the 2024 fence-line monitoring requirements. Duggan said similar requirements were successful in reducing toxic emissions from oil refineries. However, in 2023 Truthout reported that some older oil refineries in states with little oversight are still spewing pollution into nearby communities.

“The explosion last week is a warning that the cost of delay is too high, and I stand here to say that the community in Clairton valley is not disposable.” Duggan said.

President Donald Trump on Thursday visited law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington Thursday evening, praising them for their role in his crime crackdown and saying he'll seek congressional funding for his DC intervention and beautification plans.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops to start carrying firearms while patrolling the streets of Washington for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed. Hegseth referred to it as “common sense” on social media.

No troops have been spotted yet with firearms around the city in the hours after the announcement. The decision is an escalation in the Republican administration's intervention in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members have been stationed in the heavily Democratic city.

Some local officials were harshly critical, with D.C. Council Member Charles Allen saying Trump's actions are “not of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover.”

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, six Republican-led states have sent troops to the city, growing the military presence.

It's unclear how long the deployment will last.

“If I have to, I'll declare a national emergency, which I don't think I'll have to do,” Trump said. 

He suggested that he could take a similar approach in other cities, such as Chicago and maybe New York. 




“After we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe also,” Trump said in the Oval Office. Referring to Chicago as “a mess,” he said, “that will be our next one after this.”

There were no signs that the National Guard's role in D.C. would be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control. 

Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications that they have faced threats that would require weapons. 

Trump has boasted that the city is safer than ever because of his intervention. He told reporters Friday that “it's a miracle what's happened.”

“D.C. was a hellhole,” he said. “But now it's safe.”

He suggested that he could prolong the deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.

“The big question is how long do we stay?” he said. “Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.”

Trump noted that he would ask Congress for $2 billion to improve the appearance of the city, including resurfacing roads and replacing streetlights. He's previously pledged to improve the grass to look like one of his golf courses.

“It's going to be safe, and it's going to be beautified,” he said.

Trump's decision to seek more money for sprucing up Washington comes months after the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that essentially forced a $1.1 billion budget cut on the city. Local leaders have pleaded for a fix, but to no avail. 

The Pentagon and the Army had said last week that troops would not carry guns. The new guidance is that they will carry their service-issued weapons.

Alex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary and assistant secretary for the Air Force during Democratic administrations, said asking troops to carry firearms is a “recipe for disaster.”

He said most National Guard members don't have the right training for Trump's law enforcement crackdown and are being put in a “no-win situation.”

“Do they have any role that would require them to have firearms? No,” he said. 

However, Wagner said, if there are confrontations, “the White House can spin that to their political advantage.”

The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As a federal district, the city government's powers are broadly delegated to it by Congress, providing few avenues to formally resist Trump's plans. Local officials have been walking a tightrope between acknowledging constituents' concerns and antagonizing Trump, who has threatened even more aggressive action toward D.C.

City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he had discussed the effects of “the so-called crime emergency” and other topics at a town hall Thursday night, while Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Spokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.

The disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release.

Other news we're following today:








Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official.

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The firing comes a few months after details of the preliminary assessment leaked to the media. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump says Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.

Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.

“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.”

The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.

After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. 

Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.

The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before.

The first batch of Epstein-related files from the department includes 33,000 pages of documents, according to committee staff. 

“The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said. “The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”

The committee subpoenaed files related to the late sexual predator following a public outcry over the administration's handling of its promises to release more information related to Epstein conduct and demise. House Democrats seized on the issue and ultimately helped push Comer to subpoena the DOJ for documents along with every living U.S. attorney general as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. 

“The Trump DOJ is providing records at a far quicker pace than anything the Biden DOJ ever provided,” the committee spokesperson continued.

Maxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.

“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript.

Maxwell said her father was fond of Trump's then-wife, Ivana, “because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.



The Salvadoran national's case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on criminal charges.



Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a challenge to any deportation order.

Trump is filing an appeal after a judge said his executive order targeting a prominent law firm violated the firm's First Amendment rights.

The executive order forbid the federal government from doing business with anyone who hires the law firm Susman Godfrey, citing the firm's election-related work performed after Trump's 2020 loss. Susman Godfrey was one of several law firms targeted by Trump's executive orders, and the firm sued in April.

In late June, District Court Judge Loren AliKhan granted summary judgment in Susman Godfrey's favor, noting that noting that by that point every court to have considered a challenge to the law-firm-related orders had found “grave constitutional violations.”

Department of Justice attorney Richard Lawson filed the notice of appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court on Friday. The President is also appealing rulings in other cases brought by law firms.

Acknowledging the change announced earlier Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted a news story about his order for troops to carry guns and said, “Common Sense.”

The Pentagon has released few details about the shift or why it was necessary that about 2,000 troops in the nation's capital for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown needed to be armed.

“We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters. “It'll be interesting to see. If they don't, why didn't they have a meeting, because I told them to have a meeting. But I'll know what I am going to do in two weeks.”

Trump said he had begun making arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting on Monday soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders and speaking by phone with Putin.

Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made clear on Friday that Putin won't sit-down with Zelenskyy until Ukraine agrees to certain concessions.

The president said he called earlier this month for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign after reading something written by Arkansas Republican senator.

Trump didn't clarify what he was referring to but said that after he met with Tan, he liked him and felt he was “somewhat a victim.”

He backed off his calls for his resignation after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter and met with Trump.

Muriel Bowser generally avoids directly criticizing President Donald Trump. Even when she is being harshly critical of Trump's decisions — publicly stating that his declaration of a federal crime emergency in Washington “makes no sense” — Bowser sometimes seems to structure her statements so as to avoid actually saying Trump's name.

Trump, meanwhile, seems to be escalating his attacks on Bowser. 

In a 2 a.m. Friday social media post, Trump wrote, “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

Hours later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, “Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor for long.”

Some members of local government have bristled at the Defense Department's order to arm National Members. 

“Trump is once again putting armed military onto the streets of an American city. These are the actions not of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover,” District of Columbia Council Member Charles Allen said in a statement. 

As a federal district, the local government's powers are broadly delegated to it Congress, leaving local officials few avenues to formally block or protest Trump's plan.

Members of local government have been walking a tightrope of engaging with constituents' concerns without further antagonizing the administration.

City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he'd discussed “the affects of the so-called crime emergency,” among other topics, with Washington residents at a town hall last night. Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials shortly after the Pentagon's announcement.

During his event about FIFA, Trump unexpectedly pulled out a photo of him standing next to Putin during their meeting in Alaska.

Trump said Putin sent the picture and “I'm going to sign this for him.” He added that Putin has “very respectful of me and my country, and not so respectful of others.”

Putin invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, and Trump has been frustrated by his inability to resolve the war. 

Speaking of FIFA, Trump suggested that the Russian leader wants to attend the soccer competition in the U.S.

“He may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens,” he said.

Referring to the photo, Trump said, “I thought it was a nice picture of him. OK, of me, but nice of him.”

After Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in providing U.S. visas to commercial truck drivers, the Trump administration says it applies to certain foreign applicants.

The State Department said Friday that the pause affects those seeking permission to drive a truck under visas for H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers, E-2 investors in U.S. businesses or EB-3 skilled workers.

It said the government is launching a review of the way it screens foreign drivers and that “enhanced vetting” will apply to those who don't now hold valid visas.

“Applicants must demonstrate the necessary skills, experience, and English language proficiency required to safely operate these vehicles on America's roads,” the department said.

Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.”

The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.”

He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor.

Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament.

Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit.

But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either.

Bare collars were also sported by Vice President JD Vance, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Kennedy Center interim head Richard Grenell and Andrew Giuliani, who is heading up the president's FIFA task force.

It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look.

The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C.

“I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. “And then we'll help with New York.”

Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.”

Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

The FBI on Friday searched the home and office of Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration, as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information.

Vance said in an interview with NBC News's “Meet the Press” that the investigation was in its early stages. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.”

He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.”

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA head Gianni Infantino, the president said the FIFA draw would take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

Trump has made the Kennedy Center a focal point for his efforts to remake Washington, visiting it earlier in the day and talking extensively about renovations to the building. He referred to it as the “Trump-Kennedy Center.”

ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights issued the finding against the public university in Virginia.

The department says the university must review its policies, conduct annual trainings and issue a statement that includes a personal apology from the president. It directs the university to comply within 10 days.University officials did not respond immediately to an email request for comment on Friday.

The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials.

President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress.

An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.

The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district's budget whole again. That bill has languished in the House of Representatives for months while Bowser was forced to make drastic moves to avoid layoffs. The hard feelings over the issue remain intense.

Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

“We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. Fixing floors that are cracked up and not good anymore, and in many cases, they were done in the 50s and 60s and 70s,” Trump told reporters Friday. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.”

He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.”

According to the White House, the refurbishing of the Lincoln Bedroom and the adjoining sitting room — which featured strong period decor derived and adapted from the historical evidence of the Lincoln era — was completed in November 2005.

Trump suggested the Lincoln Bathroom work could “be done in about a week, two weeks” and said he was considering “doing something on the Executive Office Building” across the street from the White House saying it'd be “all cosmetic.”

Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom.

“We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. “Congress is happy to do it.”

Trump has talked about refinishing the roads and sprucing up light poles around the capital.

“It hasn't been clean,” he said. “Now it's going to be clean.”

The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone.

A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. He had no opposition.

“Mr. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote.

Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president.

Trump has tightened his grip on the RNC since his first presidential term. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina.

The Texas Senate has gaveled in for a expected vote on new congressional voting maps for the 2026 midterm elections.

Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Senate approval would send the maps to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. California on Thursday passed a bill to put new Democratic-leaning districts to voters in November.

Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and legal adviser to Democrats during the president's first impeachment, says the search of Bolton's home and office is “an obvious act of intimidation.”

“Raiding the home of a high-profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government,” Eisen said in a joint statement with Susan Corke, executive director of the group Democracy Defenders Fund.

He contrasted the operation with the 2022 search on Trump's Florida estate when the president was investigated for keeping classified documents, saying the FBI unsuccessfully negotiated with Trump for a year before executing it.

The president said his crackdown was keeping people safe, claiming it's “the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week” in the nation's capital.

That's not true, however. There were no killings for one week in July and for another week in May, according to local police statistics.

And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The president called national security and privacy concerns related to TikTok and its Chinese parent company “highly overrated.”

“I used TikTok in the campaign,” Trump told reporters.

“I'm a fan of TikTok,” he said. “My kids like TikTok. Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.”

His comments follow the White House's decision to start a TikTok account this week.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has extended the platform's shutdown deadline repeatedly since taking office for his second term.

“We're gonna watch the security concerns,” Trump said, but added, “We have buyers, American-buyers,” and “until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.”

And, speaking about the Bolton raids, said he “could be the one starting it” if he chose.

The president, in his comments to reporters at the White House Historical Association, said he's told Attorney General Pam Bondi to “do what you have to do” and that he doesn't want to know about their work, but suggested he could be much more involved if he chose, saying, “I could know about it. I could be the one starting it.”

“I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer,” he said. “But I feel that it's better this way.”

“We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. It's like oil and vinegar a little bit. They don't get along too well for obvious reasons. But we'll see,” Trump told reporters. “And we'll see whether or not I would have to be there. I'd rather not, I'd rather them have a meeting and see how they can do.”

Trump has previously suggested that the White House is working to facilitate a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in the short term, and that a subsequent, trilateral meeting involving those two leaders and Trump would likely come next.

Fed Governor Lisa Cook is under fire from Trump after an administration official alleged Wednesday that she'd falsely claimed two homes as primary residences in 2021. Primary residences often receive lower mortgage rates than homes purchased for rent or as second homes.

“I'll fire her if she doesn't resign.” Trump said Friday. His comment came as Cook is attending the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with Chair Jerome Powell.

Trump has relentlessly demanded that the Fed cut its key interest rate, which he's said would reduce interest rate costs on the government's massive $37 trillion debt pile as well as boost the housing market.

If Trump is able to oust Cook, he could install a loyalist and extend greater control over the Fed, traditionally independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over a disagreement on rates, but can “for cause,” which typically means malfeasance or neglect of duty.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's crackdown will be armed, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't immediately offer any other details about the new development.

The president, making a stop that wasn't on his public schedule, arrived at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He told reporters at an earlier stop that he planned to show them marble that would be used in sprucing up the center, along with other planned renovations such as painting the columns from gold to white.

Trump has taken over the center by installing himself as chair and replacing the board of trustees with loyalists. He has also hinted he'd like to see the venue renamed the Trump/Kennedy Center.

President Donald Trump blasted his former national security adviser John Bolton, calling him “a lowlife” and “not a smart guy” but insisted he knows “nothing about” the FBI raids Friday morning of Bolton's home and office

The president, speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, said he saw the raid of Bolton's home on television Friday morning but he didn't know anything about it.

“He is a, not a smart guy. But he could be very a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”

He said he expected to be briefed later in the day about the search of Bolton's home and office.

“I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real, sort of, a lowlife,” he said.

The president made a surprise visit Friday morning to the White House Historical Association, which sits less than a block away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.

It wasn't clear what he was doing there and the visit wasn't on his official schedule.

Trump could be spotted on video posted on social media walking into the building with his chief of staff Susie Wiles.

The association has a gift shop and a replica of the Oval Office as part of its educational center about the White House.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.

In a high-profile speech that will be closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. That puts the Fed in a tough spot, because it would typically cut its short-term rate to boost hiring, while keeping it high — or raising it — to fight inflation.

“The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared remarks. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates, including at its next meeting Sept. 16-17.

Powell has come under relentless criticism from President Trump for not rapidly cutting rates sooner.

In an overnight social media post, Trump said he was considering “a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

He's already seized control of the local police department for 30 days, which could be extended with congressional approval.

Trump has claimed the city is in the midst of a crime crisis despite statistics showing a declining problem. The U.S. attorney in Washington has opened an investigation into the numbers, the latest pressure point in a tug of war between the administration and D.C. government.

“Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” the president wrote.

A person familiar with the matter says the FBI is searching the Maryland home of John Bolton, who served in President Donald Trump's first administration as national security adviser but later became critical of the president.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI on Friday searched the Maryland home and Washington office of former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said.

Bolton, who emerged as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump after being fired in 2019 and fought with the first Trump administration over a scathing book he wrote documenting his time in the White House, was not in custody Friday and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

The searches, seemingly the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, are likely to elicit fresh concerns that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to target the Republican's foes. They come as the Trump administration has moved to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorizing a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term, and as FBI and Justice Department leaders signal their loyalty to the president.

Speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, Trump said he had seen news coverage of Friday's searches and expected to be briefed about it by the Justice Department but also insisted he didn't “want to know about it.”

“I could know about it. I could be the one starting it. I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump said.




Bolton had said in interviews this year that he was mindful that he could be scrutinized, telling the AP in January shortly before Trump took office, “Anybody who ever disagrees with Trump has to worry about retribution. It's a pretty long list.” 

An FBI search like the one at Bolton's properties requires authorization from a federal magistrate judge. It wasn't immediately clear what information authorities submitted to demonstrate that they had probable cause of a crime, though the Justice Department years ago launched an investigation into whether Bolton improperly disclosed classified information in a book manuscript he had written. The inquiry was later closed.

Vice President JD Vance denied in an NBC News interview on Friday that Bolton was being targeted because of his criticism of Trump, “If there's no crime here, we're not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court. That's how it should be.”

Bolton was not home for the search of his home, but after it started, he was spotted Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. 

Messages left with a spokesperson for Bolton were not immediately returned, and a lawyer who has represented Bolton had no immediate comment.

The FBI reportedly is investigating an ex-Trump national security adviser. AP correspondent Mike Hempen reports.

The Justice Department had no comment, but leaders appeared to cryptically refer to the searches in a series of social media posts Friday morning.

FBI Director Kash Patel, who included Bolton on a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State” in a 2023 book he wrote, posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

The Justice Department is separately conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his company, and ex-Trump prosecutor Jack Smith faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office. Schiff and James have vigorously denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers.

The Bolton searches also unfolded against the backdrop of a 2022 search for classified documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, an action that produced since-dismissed criminal charges but remains the source of outrage for the president and supporters who insist he was unjustly targeted despite the retrieval of top-secret records. 

Patel said in a Fox Business Channel interview this week that the Mar-a-Lago search represented a “total weaponization and politicization” of the bureau, and Trump himself referenced it on Friday, telling reporters: “I guess his house was raided today, but my house was raided, also.”

Bolton served as Trump's third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. 

He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government that officials argued disclosed classified information. To make its case, the Justice Department in 2020 submitted sworn statements from senior White House officials, including then-National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, asserting that Bolton's manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed.

Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

The Biden administration Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation, with Bolton's lawyer calling the effort to block the book “politically motivated” and illegitimate. 

Bolton's harshly critical book, “The Room Where It Happened,” portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” warmonger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush and also held positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration. He considered running for president in 2012 and 2016.

Trump, on his first day back in office this year, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a group of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.

In 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to kill Bolton in presumed retaliation for a 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed the country's most powerful general.

The handling of classified information by top government officials has been a politically loaded topic in recent years. Besides Trump, the Justice Department also investigated whether then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, mishandled classified information after serving as vice president in the Obama administration, and the FBI also recovered what it said were classified documents from the home of former Trump Vice President Mike Pence. Neither man was charged.

The teen suspect accused of killing Austin Metcalf at a Frisco, Texas, track meet in April is facing a first-degree murder charge.

The judge in the murder trial of Karmelo Anthony, accused of stabbing Frisco, Texas, teen track star Austin Metcalf to death in April, has issued a gag order in the case. 

Collin County Judge John Roach issued the order, citing pre-trial publicity that could affect the outcome of the case, according to FOX 4. 

The public will not hear from attorneys, witnesses, law enforcement or any other entities related to the case until after the trial, scheduled for June 2026, is over.

The alleged murder and the events thereafter set off a firestorm nationwide, sparking outrage over Metcalf's death. 

Metcalf, 17, a student at Memorial High School, was participating in a track championship event at Kuykendall Stadium in Frisco when he was stabbed to death. 

Anthony, then 17, was taken into custody almost immediately and charged with murder. His bond was set at $1 million, and he was initially held in the Collin County Jail.

Anthony was a student at Centennial High School but did not participate in the track meet that day. 

The stabbing was allegedly preceded by a dispute inside the Memorial High School tent. Metcalf died in the arms of his brother, Hunter. 

""My son is gone, and he'll never come home again,"" Jeff Metcalf said on the program. ""Austin was the light of my life.""

Metcalf discussed the bond between Austin and his twin brother, Hunter. 

""They were so tight. They had the best bond. They were best friends,"" Metcalf said of the pair. ""And now, I have to focus on taking care of Hunter.""

Fox News Digital obtained Anthony's arrest report, which detailed the circumstances under which he was detained. 

A school resource officer was the first on scene and detained him without incident. 

""I gave the suspect instructions to keep his hands up in the air. During this time, the suspect said verbally out loud, ‘I was protecting myself,'"" the report from the responding resource officer said. ""It should be noted that I had not questioned him about the incident when he made that comment.""

Anthony said Metcalf ""put his hands on him.""

When Anthony overheard a group of officers saying he ""allegedly"" killed Metcalf, he said, ""I'm not alleged; I did it,"" according to the report. 

He asked officers if Metcalf would be OK and whether what he did could be considered self-defense. 

In the wake of the stabbing, Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, established a GiveSendGo campaign for her son's defense. 

Less than a week after the stabbing, the fund had reached about $150,000. The crowdfunding campaign has been a source of contention since it was created as tensions have flared in the case.

""As a family of faith, we are deeply grateful for all of your support during this trying period,"" the Anthony family said in a statement on GiveSendGo. ""Your prayers and assistance mean more to us now more than ever.""

The fund has garnered just shy of $550,000. Its goal is more than $1.3 million.

Fox News Digital obtained an arrest report describing a heated seating dispute in the Memorial High School track tent. 

A witness told police that Metcalf ordered Anthony to leave the team's tent before Anthony said he ""grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it"" and said, ""Touch me and see what happens.""

""Austin stood up and pushed the male to get him out of the tent,"" the arrest report said.

That's when police allege Anthony pulled out a knife and stabbed Metcalf to death.

AUSTIN METCALF'S SUSPECTED KILLER INDICTED ON FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CHARGE IN TRACK MEET STABBING

Anthony's then-attorneys, Bill Clark of the Clark Law Firm and Kim Cole of K Cole Law, asked for a reduction of the $1 million bond, calling it ""excessive.""

Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis announced that Anthony could not face the death penalty or life without parole under Texas state law because he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged crime.

Anthony's family hired his current attorney, Mike Howard, who successfully argued for Anthony's bond to be reduced to $250,000. 

Anthony was released on bond and required to wear an ankle monitor and remain on house arrest unless granted permission to leave by a judge. 

""Every Texan has the right to defend themselves when they reasonably fear for their life,"" Howard said. ""Self-defense is a protection that applies to each and every one of us. There are two sides to every story.

""This is a tragedy all the way around for both families,"" he added. ""Rushing to judgment, trial by public perception, and trial by media is not how we ensure justice is done. We are confident that, after a full investigation, that the truth will come out.""

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS FATAL STABBING OF AUSTIN METCALF AT TEXAS TRACK MEET, OFFICIALS SAY

The Anthony family retained the New Generation Action Network (NGAN) to speak on their behalf. The group is headed by Dominique Alexander, a stalwart Black Lives Matter and defund the police activist with a prior criminal history.

NGAN largely injected race into the conversation about Anthony's arrest. 

At the April 17 news conference, Jeff Metcalf showed up. The event was open to the public. 

However, he was removed by Dallas Police under the threat of criminal trespass charges. 

Alexander blasted the elder Metcalf during the conference.

""What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words — don't quote anybody — is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,"" Alexander said. 

SUSPECT IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING MOVED TO 'UNDISCLOSED LOCATION' FOR PROTECTION: FAMILY SPOKESMAN

""Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close,"" he said. ""We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.

""That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character,"" Alexander said. ""He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.

""What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism,"" he said. ""We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case."" 

Citing people loitering near the Anthony home, mailing them flyers and unwanted pizza deliveries, the Anthony family moved to a new location. 

""We are sharing images and documentation of the threats the family has faced this past weekend to make the public aware of the dangerous atmosphere that has been created — an atmosphere fueled by organized hate, systemic racism and intentional misinformation,"" NGAN said.

Collin County Judge Angela Tucker, who lowered Anthony's bail, was doxxed, with people posting personal information about her.

""Due to the nature of the situation, we are coordinating with the FBI and our Fusion Center to monitor for any concerning rhetoric or propaganda that could incite violence,"" the Collin County Sheriff's Office said at the time.

After Alexander and NGAN verbally attacked Jeff Metcalf for a second time, Austin's father responded.

""I don't allow [Alexander] to live rent free in my mind,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""It really doesn't matter about the lies this man spreads. He just wants more attention. Don't give it to him. Justicer [sic] will prevail."" 

Alexander returned to discussing the April 17 news conference via a video posted to his social media account.

""This press conference wasn't organized by him,"" Alexander said. ""This press conference wasn't about him. This press conference didn't invite him. Yet at the end of the day, it's a criminal case y'all.""

SELF-DEFENSE CLAIM IN AUSTIN METCALF SLAYING IS 'UPHILL BATTLE': EXPERT

Alexander then launched into a tirade about those online who have criticized him for his past criminal behavior and posted his past mugshots.

""I really don't care what no one says about me, I really don't,"" he said. ""I don't care about the racist p----- who want to say something about Dominique and say something about my past. I really, quite frankly, don't. If you know me, you know your attacks towards me only do one thing: boost my ego. The reality is, I really don't, quite frankly, give a damn.""

Frisco ISD said that despite first-degree murder charges, Anthony would be allowed to graduate on May 22, though he would not be allowed to attend the ceremony. 

He was not expelled from school despite allegedly stabbing another Frisco ISD student to death. 

Superintendent Mike Waldrip took offense to social media rumors that Anthony would be able to attend the graduation ceremony. 

""Frisco ISD has learned that misinformation is being shared regarding Centennial High School's graduation via several media outlets and perpetuated through social media,"" he told WFAA. ""It is disheartening that the incredible accomplishments and achievements of our Centennial seniors may be dampened by needless fearmongering, attention-seeking and media vitriol. Our students, staff and community deserve better.""

NGAN also weighed in. 

""We are proud to share that Karmelo Anthony will graduate and receive his high school diploma and that his academic achievements will not be disrupted,"" Alexander said.

Anthony was indicted for his alleged murder of Metcalf.

""For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the Grand Jury to return a first-degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony — which they did,"" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said. 

Jeff Metcalf told Fox News Digital that though he was pleased with the indictment, nothing will bring his son back.

""I am pleased that we are moving forward,"" he said. ""With the first-degree murder indictment, it now goes into the court system. I fully believe that justice will be served for Austin Metcalf. I look forward to the forthcoming trial. But it will never bring my son back.""

Howard, Anthony's attorney, downplayed the indictment. 

TEXAS PRESS CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS OVER TRACK MEET STABBING

""Today's indictment is an expected and routine step in the legal process,"" he said, adding that there is an indictment in nearly every felony case. 

""To the racists, the bigots, and those filled with hate who've targeted Karmelo, his family, and even myself – you do not intimidate us. We are not backing down,"" Alexander said. 

""This case is yet another example of what it means to be Black in America, where even our self-defense is questioned, scrutinized and politicized. My involvement – like many others – came as a direct response to the overwhelming hate, threats and outside influence that have surrounded this case since day one.""

He then asked Anthony's supporters for prayers, to support due process, and to ""[s]tand with us in the fight against White supremacy.""

Roach, the Collin County judge on the case, issued a gag order amid concerns that continued press coverage might jeopardize a fair trial.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Colorado Republican state Rep. Ryan Armagost abruptly resigns ahead of censure vote","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3778610/colorado-republican-ryan-armagost-resigns-censure/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:39:01 GMT","

A Colorado state lawmaker resigned Thursday ahead of a vote to censure him for taking a picture of a Democratic lawmaker without her knowledge during floor proceedings.

Republican state Rep. Ryan Armagost, the former House minority whip, had been facing a vote to censure him as the photo became the center of a social media harassment campaign.

“Rep. Armagost chose to walk away rather than face accountability for his actions,” said Democratic state Rep. Yara Zokaie, the subject of the picture in question.

He was already expected to resign from his role effective Sept. 1 to pursue a new job and relationship in Arizona. Democrats indicated that they are exploring steps for the censure resolution.

“Resigning may remove him from this chamber, but it does not erase the harm he caused or the responsibility he bears for perpetuating a culture of violence against women,” Zokaie continued.

Armagost shared the picture in a private group chat with fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers compared her outfit to that of a stripper and a prostitute. 

“That's awful,” Republican state Rep. Brandi Bradley wrote in the group chat. “I didn't know it was dress like a stripper day.”

The image was then posted online on an anonymous, conservative social media account. The initial social media post on X was captioned, “Thoughts?” and was followed by a second post reading “Smash or Pass Yara Zokaie.”

The “photograph was subsequently disseminated on social media by anonymous accounts, accompanied by vulgar commentary, and comments to the social media posts quickly escalated into racist and misogynistic attacks, rape threats, and violent threats directed against the colleague and her young children,” according to the resolution to censure.

Democratic leadership in Colorado condemned Armagost's actions ahead of the vote. Assistant House Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon called it “unbecoming” of an elected official.

“It's unbecoming of a legislator to the extent that it harms somebody, it harms somebody in the workplace, and it is not the example that we want to set on behalf of the people who we are elected to represent,” she said.

DEMOCRATIC 2028 CONTENDERS FILL THEIR CALENDARS WITH HIGH-PROFILE EVENTS

Armagost has declined to comment on why he took the picture. At the time he took it, he chaired the House Workplace Harassment Committee.

Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Virginia are condemning a sign that was shown at a protest in Arlington County that targeted Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.

The Arlington school board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its transgender bathroom policy in the face of threats of federal funding cuts, and transgender rights protesters were outside. One person at the protest was holding a sign that is being condemned as racist.

“Hey Winsome, you have a gender neutral bathroom in your house,” one side of the sign read, with the other side reading, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then Blacks can't share my water fountain.”

Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor in the 2025 election, said on social media that she was “disgusted, but not surprised.”

“I'm an immigrant, a Marine, and above all, a human being. There is no place for this disgusting hatred in our Commonwealth. Anyone who doesn't condemn this sign is complicit in approving it,” she continued.

Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the sign in a statement, calling it “racist, abhorrent, and unacceptable.” 

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) said in a social media post, ​​“The hypocrisy of the liberal left on display again. Winsome is so much bigger than this idiocy.”

Republican groups are using the sign to target Democrats on social issues, on which they poll poorly.

“The sign was the least of the obscenities from the trans activists' display,” Virginia Project, a conservative PAC, wrote on social media.

The Arlington GOP posted a letter from Chairman Matthew Hurtt supposedly sent to the protester, thanking her.

“I couldn't have ever dreamed that someone would boost our efforts quite like you have,” the note read.

The woman behind the sign, who was not identified, told Fox 5 her message was meant to be satirical.

“It was satire meant to provoke conversation around the absurdity of prejudice. If anyone thinks we are actually supporting separate drinking fountains based on race, they are mistaken,” she said. “In the same way that drinking fountains should be usable by all races, bathrooms should be non-discriminatory.”

Other elected officials in Virginia have condemned the language. 

“This is wrong. @winwithwinsome — and Virginia — deserve better,” Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said on social media.

“Two wrongs don't make a right. Been teaching my kids – and students – that for years. In the age of Trump it's easy to get in the gutter. We should insist on betting the better angels of our nature,” Democratic state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg said in a social media statement.

In the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, Spanberger is polling well ahead of Earle-Sears. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The sensitive tween of King of the Hill has now grown up—and captures the anxieties of a generation.

In its original televised run, from 1997 to 2009, the animated show King of the Hill aired 259 good-to-great episodes about the Hills, a folksy and well-intentioned family living in small-town Texas. That's a lot of TV, and those looking for a representative moment—one that summarizes the entire show, more or less—might pick an exchange from the third-season episode “Three Coaches and a Bobby,” in which the stodgy patriarch, Hank, attempts to explain to his son, Bobby, why soccer is a stupid sport. Hank is a Dallas Cowboys diehard; the idea of Bobby getting into the Premier League sends him into full-body shivers. But rather than take offense or rise to his father's provocation, Bobby fixes his old man with a placid look and asks: “Why do you have to hate what you don't understand?”

During those initial seasons, King of the Hill drew much of its humor from how Hank's values clashed with modern society—for example, his inability to understand why anyone would enjoy, as he put it, a sport “invented by European ladies to keep them busy while their husbands did the cooking.” But the living personification of the changing times was Bobby. The younger Hill was a sensitive and proudly chubby tween boy—not good at fighting or football, but handy with a sewing machine and a master of prop comedy. Hank, who was born in the 1950s or '60s—cartooons tend to be vague with ages—grew up in an era with a very fixed view of how men should think and behave. To paraphrase Tony Soprano, he was the Gary Cooper type, strong and silent. Bobby, whose age hovered between 11 and 13, was by contrast a Millennial—part of a generation that had more freedom to do things differently, and that would come to be consistently misunderstood by its elders.

Read: The strength of the ‘soft daddy'

The new season continues probing that tension between father and son—not by picking up where the original show left off, but by vaulting forward into the future (a rarity for animated programs, whose characters often remain fixed in time). Hank and his wife, Peggy, are now retired in present-day Texas; Bobby is 21 years old and living on his own. Although this age technically categorizes him as a Zoomer—the show has been off the air for 16 years, but it has chosen to age its characters less than a decade—Bobby still behaves like a Millennial. At one point, he describes himself as “hashtag thick,” slang ripped right out of an old BuzzFeed post. And his anxieties seem propelled by a fear of winnowing potential, the feeling that he might be left behind. Watching him, I was struck by how aptly he channeled the unease of a generation reaching middle age while still lacking many traditional signposts of adult life. Yet he's also inimitably Bobby—sweet, congenial, a little goofy—which makes his trajectory in these episodes all the more endearing, because it's rooted in believable growth.

In earlier seasons, Bobby was sometimes the centerpiece of a plot, but he was just as often relegated to delivering a well-timed quip in service of another character's storyline. Now he's become a co-headliner, appearing substantively in each episode of the new season. The shift may partly be logistical: Luanne, Hank's angelic and naive niece who filled out the Hill family, was voiced by Brittany Murphy, who died in 2009, and her role was not recast out of respect. But the refocus on Bobby allows the show to use father and son as foils for each other. Just as Hank remains confused by the things he doesn't understand—such as the expected courtesy of rating your ride-share driver five stars, when he's really done more of a four-star job—so is Bobby lightly out of step with his own peers, forcing a similar confrontation with his own principles.

Right away, we get a sense of how his experience differs from others in his age cohort. Whereas many of them are off at college, Bobby is instead the executive chef and a co-owner of Robata Chane, a Japanese-German restaurant; he works long hours for not much money. In the first episode, a flirtatious customer invites Bobby to a frat party, and they end up going home together. The next morning, when he tries to set up a future date, she makes it clear that their hookup was a onetime, rhythm-of-the-night type of thing. Here was a moment that could indicate how the show meant to portray Bobby: If he should project hurt, perhaps the show would tilt toward a judgmental “kids these days” perspective on evolving sexual mores. Instead, pleasant surprise dawns on Bobby's face—this is not such a bad outcome, even if he might have liked a second date. He is still the boy who is open to new experiences, not someone who has been hardened by adulthood.

King of the Hill now looks like a fantasy

Yet he is not unconditionally tolerant; like his father, he draws some lines in the sand. Early on in the season, he reconnects with Connie, a middle-school sweetheart who is now going out with Chane, his business partner. At one point, he obtains evidence that Chane may be cheating on Connie—which, he then learns, is a moot discovery, because the two of them are practicing ethical nonmonogamy. Connie explains how it works, in a dutiful and credulous way, and to Bobby it sounds like nonsense. Because he cares for her, he can't help but express his distaste for the arrangement, edging uncomfortably close to slut-shaming—“the worst thing” a person can do, Connie tells him, aghast at his response even as it seems to leave her less assured about her own behavior.

This is subtle character work that, as described on the page, might seem hectoring or prescriptive. But King of the Hill has always been more of a good hang, rooted in the organic interplay of recognizable personalities, than a laugh factory. Back in the day, its sister shows on Fox were The Simpsons and Family Guy, two punch-line-heavy shows with lots of cutaway gags and surreal touches. Both of those shows starred young boys, Bart Simpson and Chris Griffin, who never got older, and whose immaturity was a pointed feature; you could, and can, count on them to behave and react the way they usually do. Watching Bobby mature into a young adult—as many viewers have since the show first premiered—is a different experience, and perhaps the best reason to tap in.

These scenes aren't funny, per se. What is funny—has always been funny, will always be funny—is the texture of Bobby's voice. None of this would land without the heroic voice acting of Pamela Adlon, who subtly dials up his boyish vocal fry into the rasp of a grown man. Bobby sounds like a born sweetheart, someone whose heart is pure and whose frailties are relatable—not a smart aleck or a dullard or an agent of chaos. Another plot point this season concerns Hank's teenage half brother, Good Hank (it's a long story), who gets swept up in the manosphere. Bobby would never, I thought while watching this subplot play out. He's too old-fashioned to completely get with the times, and too attuned to his own sense of right and wrong to give into peer pressure. In this, like countless sons before him, he walks the path toward becoming a fresh iteration of his father, bringing the show full circle.

The new season knowingly acknowledges that it is asking viewers to sit with the years that have passed for the Hills. Television revivals are always good for a healthy whiff of nostalgia, but the routine may quickly become tired. In the season's finale, Bobby wonders if Connie might “only like the 12-year-old husky version of me,” rather than the man he's become. Connie, thankfully, brushes off this fear—Bobby is the bravest person she knows, she says, because he's doing exactly what he wants. He still has plenty of road to burn: Financial stability would help, as would the time to do his laundry. (He still drops off his dirty clothes at his mom's.) But this self-awareness is meaningful, as it was for his younger self. You believe that he'll keep growing, and that he'll weather whatever storms may come, because he understands who he is.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The early morning FBI search of John Bolton's house shows the retribution agenda is moving forward.

President Donald Trump's effort to prosecute his political enemies heated up Friday, as the FBI conducted an early morning search at the home of John Bolton, a one-time adviser who Trump has bitterly feuded with for years.

The search, which an administration official said was “court authorized,” reportedly pertains to an investigation into Bolton for leaking classified information. Trump has insisted that Bolton should be prosecuted since 2020.

Unusually, several top DOJ and FBI officials posted (in vague terms) about the search on social media as it was happening. “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission,” FBI director Kash Patel posted at 7:03 am.

“Public corruption will not be tolerated,” Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino responded. “Justice will be pursued. Always,” Attorney General Pam Bondi chimed in.

Coming after the Epstein files debacle that made these officials look incompetent and disingenuous, this messaging is their effort to prove that they are, in fact, delivering the retribution the MAGA base and the president crave.

The Bolton investigation is one of several that are reportedly underway against top Democrats and former Trump aides. But the early morning search is the most visible sign of investigative activity in any of these probes yet. Whether any of these will result in charges, though, remains to be seen.

Trump himself was indicted for mishandling classified documents that he'd taken to Mar-a-Lago after he left office in 2021. (A right-wing judge slow-walked the prosecution, preventing it from going to trial.)

But Trump's effort to have Bolton sent to prison — and his broader desire to prosecute Democrats, officials who investigated him, and former aides who turned against him — goes back further, to his first term. And so far, it seems significantly more effective this time.

Bolton, a hawkish hardliner who served in foreign policy roles in several GOP administrations, was Trump's national security adviser for about a year and a half during Trump's first term, until his tenure ended in acrimony in September 2019.

After departing the White House, Bolton immediately began writing a book about his experience, with many unflattering accounts of Trump's conduct. (He called it The Room Where It Happened, after a song in the musical Hamilton.) Word of the book's contents related to Trump's first impeachment proceedings leaked, and the president was furious.

To try to stop the book's publication, Trump claimed that it contained classified information, and he insisted that he would “consider every conversation with me, as president, highly classified.” He went on: “So that would mean that if he wrote a book and if the book gets out, he's broken the law. And I would think that he would have criminal problems.”

Or, in tweet form: “Washed up Creepster John Bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail, money seized, for disseminating, for profit, highly Classified information.”

Trump's assertion that “every conversation” with him was classified is preposterous, but the question of what counts as classified information has long been thorny for former officials trying to disclose national security policymaking details. Bolton at first followed the typical process for such disclosures by submitting his manuscript to National Security Council officials for “pre-publication review,” so they could suggest striking anything classified. But Trump appointees eventually pushed out the official conducting the review, and essentially brought the process to a halt.

Wanting to get the book out before Trump's reelection, Bolton then decided to go ahead and publish in June 2020 without the government's okay. The administration sued to try to block it, and though a judge had some very harsh words for Bolton, he let the publication proceed, saying, “the damage is done.”

By September 2020, prosecutors had convened a grand jury looking into the matter. But in 2021, after Trump lost reelection and DOJ leadership changed hands, the case was reportedly closed.

With Trump back in office, the prosecution has evidently been revived. An official involved in the investigation told the New York Times that the investigation was about Bolton leaking classified information to damage Trump — it wasn't just about the book and included actions Bolton took in the past few years.

During Trump's first term, he repeatedly demanded prosecutions of his political enemies, but these prosecutions kept not happening.

As I wrote at the time, DOJ officials who understood and cared about the law kept slow-walking or bottling up investigations they thought were bogus. Trump often fumed about this, but couldn't manage to do anything about it.

His second term is a different story. He's staffed the top ranks of the DOJ and the FBI with personal loyalists who are not only willing to do his bidding, but they're eager to be seen as doing his bidding. That's evident in Bondi, Patel, and Bongino taking credit for the Bolton search. All three care about their “cred” among the MAGA base, and want to take a victory lap, even if it makes the investigation look more political.

Then there's “Eagle” Ed Martin, who earlier this year did a stint as US attorney for the District of Columbia, but now is heading the Justice Department's “Weaponization Working Group.” This group is purportedly targeting people who weaponized law enforcement against Trump and his allies, but in practice seems to be doing their own weaponization against targets like Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

In practice, we're still a long way away from Trump's political enemies being locked up. To bring charges, prosecutors will have to convince grand juries to indict. To sustain charges, they'll have to convince judges that they're appropriate. To convict, they'll have to convince juries. And even after conviction, there's the appeal process.

But it's clear that any internal hesitations the DOJ once had about being seen as targeting Trump's enemies are gone. Now, that's exactly how it wants to be seen.

In this article

Intel shares rose about 6% on Friday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is poised to announce that the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker.

Following the report, President Donald Trump said the government should get about 10% of the company, which has a market cap of just over $100 billion.  

""They've agreed to do it and I think it's a great deal for them,"" Trump told reporters Friday at the White House

White House official told CNBC that there will be ""ongoing discussions"" with Intel, adding that nothing has been decided yet and that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hasn't explicitly agreed to a deal. President Trump and Tan will be meeting later this afternoon.

A representative for Intel declined to comment.

The move would mark the latest example of a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking an active role in the corporate America. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC this week that the U.S. government was seeking an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds.

""We should get an equity stake for our money,"" Lutnick said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.""

Lutnick said that the government's stake would be ""nonvoting.""

Earlier this week, Intel announced another major backer, when SoftBank said it would make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker, equal to about 2% of the company.

Intel is the only American company capable of making the most advanced chips on U.S. shores, although its technology is seen as lagging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and even Intel.

Intel has been spending billions of dollars to build a series of chip factories in Ohio, an area the company previously called the ""Silicon Heartland,"" where Intel would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including for AI.

But in July, Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be ""no more blank checks,"" and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. Intel's Ohio factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030.

Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant under the CHIPS and Science Act to fund its factory-building plans. The CHIPS Act was passed in 2022, under the Biden administration.

— CNBC's David Sucherman contributed to this report.

The law enforcement investigation of former Trump national security advisor John Bolton is ""in the very early stages,"" Vice President JD Vance said on the heels of the FBI's raid of Bolton's Maryland home on Friday morning. 

Vance, in a new interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, said that classified documents are ""certainly part of"" that probe, but that ""there's a broad concern about Ambassador Bolton.""

Bolton is not being targeted because of his criticism of President Donald Trump, Vance told Welker in the interview, set to air Sunday on ""Meet the Press.""

""If we were trying to do that, we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly, like the Biden administration [Department of Justice] did,"" he said.

Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.

FBI agents searched his office in Washington, D.C., in addition to his Bethesda home, on Friday.

""I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed,"" Vance said.

""What I can tell you is that, unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going to be driven by law and not by politics,"" Vance said.

""And so, if we think that Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions will come,"" the vice president said.

""This is all part of gathering evidence, trying to understand something that we're worried about.""

Trump told reporters Friday morning that he was unaware of the raid on Bolton's home until he saw it reported on television.

Trump also called Bolton a ""lowlife.""

NBC News reported earlier Friday that the investigation of Bolton is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. 

The investigation began during the Biden administration but was dropped by the Justice Department at some point before President Joe Biden left office in January, NBC reported.

U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender is leaving the Trump administration less than five months after being confirmed by the Senate, the Treasury Department said.

Faulkender is the second Senate-confirmed official to leave the Treasury Department this month, following the departure of IRS Commissioner Billy Long, who said he was being tapped as ambassador to Iceland.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thanked Faulkender for his work at the department but gave no reason for his departure.

""Since January, he has played a critical role in overseeing the U.S. Department of the Treasury's operations and executing on President Trump's bold economic agenda,"" Bessent said in a statement. ""His important work has supported the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill and GENIUS Act, and the leveling of sanctions against our adversaries.""

Trump nominated Faulkender, a University of Maryland finance professor, in December to serve as the No. 2 official at Treasury, where he had been assistant secretary of economic policy during Trump's first term. He was confirmed by the Senate for the role on March 26.

At the end of the first Trump administration, Faulkender had returned to the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, where he has been a finance professor since 2008.

He had also served as the chief economist for two years at the America First Policy Institute, conservative think tank that has helped shape Trump's policy agenda.

FBI agents on Friday morning raided the Maryland home and Washington, D.C. office of John Bolton, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump and a staunch critic of the president.

The raids are part of a ""national security investigation in search of classified records,"" a person familiar with the matter told NBC.

The probe is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. The investigation began during the Biden administration, but did not go further before President Joe Biden left office in January.

Ten FBI agents were seen exiting Bolton's office on M Street, with boxes in hand, around 1:40 p.m. ET.

A person close to Bolton told NBC News they believe the raids are in response to Bolton's frequent criticism of the Trump administration, which includes his book ""The Room Where it Happened.""

""It's retribution, pure and simple,"" that person told NBC.

Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.

An FBI official told NBC on Friday, ""The FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area. There is no threat to public safety.""

That statement indicates a judge signed a search warrant for Bolton's residence in Bethesda, just outside of Washington.

It was not known if Bolton was home at the time of the raid there, which began at around 7 a.m. ET. A woman who appeared to be Bolton's wife was at the residence. He showed up at the home mid-afternoon Friday.

About a half hour after the raid began, Bolton tweeted about Russia and its war on Ukraine, writing that Trump will continue pushing for meetings on the conflict ""because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress.""

FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted, ""NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission"" at the same time his agents were raiding Bolton's home.

Attorney General Pam Bondi retweeted Patel's tweet, writing, ""America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.""

And Patel's deputy director at the FBI, Dan Bongino, in his own post on X wrote, ""Public corruption will not be tolerated.""

Trump later told reporters that he did not know about the raid, but that he expected to be briefed about it later Friday.

The president also said he is ""not a fan of John Bolton,"" and called him a ""lowlife.""

The New York Post first reported the raid.

Patel ordered the investigation into Bolton, according to the Post, which cited a Trump administration official.

Trump lashed out against Bolton on Aug. 13 after his former advisor criticized the president for agreeing to host a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

""Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, 'Putin has already won,'"" Trump wrote on Truth Social that day. ""What's that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING.""

On Aug. 17, after he met with Putin, Trump wrote, ""This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like [Sen.] Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so.""

Trump canceled Bolton's protective detail from the U.S. Secret Service after he was sworn in for his second term in the White House in January. Bolton had been under Secret Service protection because of plots by Iran to kill him.

Trump was previously indicted in federal court in Florida on charges related to his retention of classified government records at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach after leaving the White House in January 2021, and with his efforts to thwart their recovery by government officials.

Trump said on Sept. 10, 2019, that he had effectively fired Bolton the prior evening.

""I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,"" Trump wrote in a tweet that day. ""Therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.""

The Justice Department dropped that case in late 2024, shortly after Trump was elected president, because of a department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

The Justice Department sued Bolton in 2020 in an effort to block the publication and sale of his book ""The Room Where it Happened,"" which was a damning account of his time as Trump's national security advisor. The lawsuit was filed during Trump's last year of his first term.

A Justice Department lawyer told a judge that year that the book was ""a flagrant breach of"" Bolton's agreement not to write about classified matters.

The department dropped the lawsuit in June 2021, five months after Biden took office.

Bolton served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the administration of President George W. Bush.

The EU is weighing Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro, a move that could redefine how central banks approach blockchain.

The European Union is weighing a surprising move regarding its long-discussed digital euro. Officials are now exploring whether to run it on public blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) or Solana (SOL-USD). That means shifting away from private, closed systems and opening the door to networks that anyone can access.





This is a big change in tone. Until now, most central banks, including China, have favored private blockchains that restrict access to authorized players. If Europe breaks from that approach, the digital euro could resemble U.S. stablecoins rather than China's tightly controlled digital yuan.

The pressure is not only about technology. U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins now dominate with more than 98 percent of the market. European policymakers worry that such heavy reliance on American products could erode Europe's financial independence. In April, ECB board member Piero Cipollone argued that cutting down the use of stablecoins might require a digital euro that people can trust and adopt.

Choosing Ethereum or Solana would be a strategic signal that Europe intends to compete directly with U.S. private sector innovation instead of playing catch-up.

Public blockchains bring clear benefits. A digital euro built on Ethereum or Solana could connect instantly with existing crypto infrastructure such as DeFi platforms, wallets, and global payment rails. This would make adoption smoother and reduce the friction that usually slows central bank digital currencies.

The risks are equally clear. A public blockchain could give governments a stronger role in how these networks are governed. Juan Ignacio Ibañez of MiCA Crypto Alliance put it bluntly when he said, the upside is better integration, while the downside is a stronger state interest in influencing blockchain governance.

For now, nothing is final. An ECB spokesperson declined to confirm whether Ethereum or Solana are officially under review and instead pointed to the central bank's FAQ page. The ECB maintains that no model has been chosen. The Governing Council is expected to decide by the end of 2025 whether a digital euro will even be issued.

That means the project is still in the exploratory phase. What has changed is the nature of the debate. Europe is no longer asking if it should launch a digital euro. The question is what kind of system will power it, private and controlled or public and interoperable.

European Union policymakers are discussing ramping up efforts to introduce a digital euro as the U.S.' new stablecoin law intensifies pressure on the bloc to keep up the pace in the fast-moving world of digital money, the Financial Times reported, 

The U.S. Congress last month approved the GENIUS Act, a framework for the $288 billion stablecoin sector dominated by dollar-pegged tokens like Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC. The move caught many in Europe off guard, according to people familiar with the talks, and sparked concerns that dollar-pegged tokens could tighten America's grip on cross-border payments if the EU doesn't accelerate its own plans.

In a notable shift, officials are now weighing whether to launch the central bank digital currency (CBDC) on public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana rather than the private infrastructure previously envisioned.

Until recently, the European Central Bank (ECB) had been leaning toward a private, centrally controlled system, citing privacy and security. But sources say the U.S. legislation has shifted the conversation, with some policymakers now open to decentralized networks that could help the euro circulate more freely and compete with dollar-based digital assets globally, according to the FT.

The ECB has been studying a digital euro for several years, pitching it as a public alternative to privately issued payment systems as cash use dwindles. Yet U.S. momentum is raising concerns that euro deposits could increasingly flow into dollar-denominated assets abroad.

With China piloting its digital yuan and the U.K. considering a digital pound, Europe faces mounting pressure to deliver. A handful of euro-backed stablecoins already exist,  Circle's EURC among them, but a central bank-issued token would carry far more weight.

The ECB confirmed to the Financial Times it is still evaluating both centralized and decentralized technologies, leaving open the possibility of a blockchain-powered euro as officials race to protect the single currency's relevance in a digitizing world.

Your AI policy sleuth, connecting dots between economic decisions and your portfolio's pulse—with a side of snark.

- 2025 crypto market splits into two ecosystems: tech-driven innovation and retail speculation.

- Projects like BlockDAG and Cold Wallet focus on scalable infrastructure with institutional backing.

- Meme coins like Maxi Doge offer 300%+ APY but rely on social trends and lack technical depth.

- Investors must balance exposure to foundational blockchain projects versus high-risk speculative assets.

- Long-term value lies in infrastructure innovation, not short-term social media-driven hype cycles.

The 2025 cryptocurrency market is no longer a monolith. It has fractured into two distinct ecosystems: one anchored in technological innovation and institutional credibility, and the other driven by retail speculation and meme-driven hype. This divide is not merely a reflection of market sentiment but a structural shift in how value is created—and extracted—within the crypto space. For investors, understanding this duality is critical to navigating a landscape where the line between transformative infrastructure and fleeting trends grows increasingly blurred.  

At the core of the innovation-led segment are projects like BlockDAG, Snorter Bot, and Cold Wallet (CWT). These initiatives are redefining blockchain's utility by addressing scalability, security, and real-world adoption.  

BlockDAG, for instance, combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to achieve 10 transactions per second (TPS), a leap forward from legacy blockchains. Its $377 million presale capital and institutional partnerships underscore its potential to become a foundational layer for decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Snorter Bot (SNORT) is automating trading with sub-second execution times and MEV resistance, targeting both retail and institutional traders. With a 137% staking APY and cross-chain expansion plans, it exemplifies how technical depth can attract diverse capital.  

Cold Wallet (CWT) further illustrates this trend by integrating Layer 2 (L2) solutions to reduce transaction costs and introduce gasless rewards. Its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet and 2 million active users highlight its role as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. These projects are not just chasing token price appreciation; they are building infrastructure that could redefine financial transactions, security protocols, and remittance systems.  

In contrast, the speculative segment thrives on viral branding, high-yield staking, and gamified mechanics. Meme coins like Maxi Doge (MAXI) and PepeNode (PEPENODE) have captured retail attention with APYs exceeding 300% and social media-driven narratives. Maxi Doge's 383% staking reward and PepeNode's 4,700% APY—though unsustainable in the long term—have attracted millions of users seeking quick gains.  

 

These projects rely on community momentum rather than technical execution. For example, PepeNode's virtual mining simulation leverages Ethereum block activity to reward users, but its value proposition hinges on sustained social traction. Similarly, Maxi Doge's roadmap includes a gamified futures platform, yet its lack of institutional backing raises questions about scalability. While these assets may generate short-term returns, their volatility and dependence on sentiment make them high-risk bets.  

The 2025 crypto market's duality demands a nuanced investment strategy. Technology-driven projects, though often less flashy, offer tangible utility and long-term value. BlockDAG's hybrid DAG-PoW model, for instance, addresses blockchain's scalability trilemma—a problem that has plagued the industry for over a decade. Similarly, Cold Wallet's integration of L2 solutions aligns with broader trends in decentralized finance (DeFi), where user experience and cost efficiency are paramount.  

Conversely, speculative projects like Maxi Doge and PepeNode cater to a different demographic: retail investors seeking liquidity and social validation. While these assets can deliver outsized returns during bull cycles, their lack of foundational innovation makes them vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny and market corrections. The $4.11 trillion crypto market capitalization as of August 2025 is driven largely by institutional adoption and ETF accumulation, not retail speculation. This suggests that the speculative segment, though vibrant, is unlikely to sustain long-term growth without a shift toward utility.  

For investors seeking sustainable alpha, the path forward lies in projects that combine technical innovation with real-world use cases. BlockDAG's institutional partnerships and EVM compatibility position it as a scalable infrastructure layer, while Snorter Bot's MEV-resistant trading tools address a critical gap in automated finance. Cold Wallet's gasless rewards and cross-chain integration further demonstrate how blockchain can democratize access to financial services.  

In contrast, speculative projects require a high-risk, high-reward mindset. Investors in this space must monitor social sentiment, liquidity pools, and regulatory developments closely. However, allocating a significant portion of a portfolio to these assets without a clear exit strategy could expose investors to sharp drawdowns during market downturns.  

The 2025 crypto market's deepening divide between innovation and speculation is not a temporary phenomenon—it is a structural evolution. As institutional capital continues to flow into projects with verifiable utility, the speculative segment will likely remain a volatile but necessary component of the ecosystem. For investors, the key is to balance exposure to both categories while prioritizing projects that align with long-term technological progress.  

In the end, the next wave of crypto alpha will belong to those who recognize that blockchain's true potential lies not in the noise of social media, but in the quiet revolution of code and infrastructure.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Kraken said it has fully deployed distributed validator technology (DVT) for its Ethereum staking service using SSV Network, becoming the first major crypto exchange to put the fault-tolerance setup into production at scale.

DVT lets a single Ethereum validator key be split into secure “shares” and run by several operators who must jointly sign duties. The design aims to improve resilience to outages and correlated failures.

Meanwhile, SSV Network operates as an open protocol purpose-built for DVT. It's designed to enhance validator liveness and safety by adding geographic and client diversity. In that way, no single operator holds the whole key, and multiple independent nodes must participate to validate blocks.

In a Thursday statement, Jonathan Marcus, Kraken's head of strategy, custody, and staking, said the rollout “has fundamentally improved the performance reliability of our ETH validators.”

A major positive touted by the deployment is focused on reducing correlated slashing risk. Validator slashing penalties can occur if nodes go offline or behave inconsistently. By distributing responsibilities across distinct operators, DVT can mitigate single points of failure and help exchanges and custodians meet uptime and risk-management requirements. Kraken's move is expected to encourage secure staking participation and harden Ethereum's network security, according to SSV Labs Founder Alon Muroch. His firm claims to secure over $18 billion in staked assets across more than 126,000 validators.

Kraken has been expanding its product set alongside its staking business. The exchange is rolling out “xStocks,” tokenized representations of equities for select non-U.S. markets, and plans to support issuance on additional chains such as Tron, part of a broader industry push toward tokenized traditional assets.

Ether treasury firm SharpLink Gaming (SBET) has authorized a stock purchase program of up to $1.5 billion.

SharpLink, which is helmed by Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin, said it will make the repurchases at a time and in amounts that depend on market conditions and share price in an announcement on Friday.

""Should there exist periods where our stock trades at or below the net asset value of our ETH holdings, it would be dilutive on an ETH per share basis to issue new equity through our capital raising efforts,"" co-CEO Joseph Chalom said in the announcement.

""In this scenario, the accretive course of action may be to repurchase our common stock.""

The Minneapolis-based company holds 740,760 ETH, worth $3.19 billion at current prices. Numerous companies have unveiled ether treasury strategies in recent months to capture the upside from generating passive yield through ETH staking. 

SharpLink shares traded over 10% higher at $19.85 on Friday morning following the buyback program announcement and as bitcoin surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments opened the door to a September rate cut.

 The latest episode of the long-running comedy series “South Park” depicts US President Donald Trump taking gifts of Bitcoin from state officials and tech leaders. 

The animated comedy series “South Park” mocked US President Donald Trump in its latest episode aired on Wednesday, satirizing his ties to crypto.

The episode titled “Sickofancy” depicted scenes showing parodied versions of tech executives wanting to curry favour with Trump by lining up to give him gifts and shower him with praise.

In two scenes, what appeared to be depictions of Microsoft CEO Sundar Pichai and venture capitalist-turned White House crypto and artificial intelligence czar David Sacks were lining up to gift Bitcoin (BTC) to Trump.

Trump's critics have raised concerns over the president's pro-crypto policy positions while he and his family have deepened ties to crypto with a trading platform, stablecoin, tokens and a crypto mining business.

The latest “South Park” episode mainly satirizes overreliance on AI, with a character pivoting his cannabis farm into an AI startup after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid arrests his workers.

The character eventually gets advice from a sycophantic ChatGPT to butter up Trump and have him re-classify cannabis to save his business. The show depicts officials and tech executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, lining up at the Oval Office to flatter Trump and give him gifts.

The episode also parodied Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard in the nation's capital, depicting Washington, D.C., as overrun with military at major landmarks and continued its gag of depicting Trump with a small penis and sleeping with Satan, along with portraying Vice President JD Vance as a chubby-faced toddler.

The show's 27th season debuted in late July, and its first two episodes ripped on Trump and his administration, which caught the ire of the White House.

The season's debut focused on Paramount's $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount recently paid $1.5 billion for the streaming rights to “South Park.”

The debut episode included an AI-generated deepfake of Trump, who stripped naked in a desert, which prompted a White House spokesperson to call “South Park” a “fourth-rate show” that “hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.”

“South Park” has been on air for almost 28 years and has offered comedic parodies of crypto a handful of times.

An episode in 2022 ridiculed Matt Damon's then-recent promotion for Crypto.com, and an earlier episode that aired in 2021 joked that a character had the power to convince people that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were a “viable investment.”

Another episode in 2021 showed Bitcoin being used as the mainstream means of payment in the future, with a character saying, “We've all decided centralized banking is rigged, so we trust more in fly-by-night Ponzi schemes.”

Can SpaceX Solve Its ‘Exploding Starships' Problem?

After a string of fiery failures, SpaceX's biggest rocket faces another test flight with sky-high stakes for U.S. space ambitions

By Adam Rogers edited by Lee Billings

SpaceX's Starship soars through the sky during the rocket's ninth test flight on May 27, 2025. Both the “Super Heavy” booster and the Starship upper stage suffered spectacular failures before the flight's completion, marking the rocket's third unsuccessful test in a row.

Joe Marino/UPI/Alamy Live News

“Kaboom” is not the sound you want a rocket ship to make, as a rule. Yet that's the problem facing the private aerospace company SpaceX and its leader, Elon Musk. Instead of going to space, their newest rocket ship keeps going kaboom.

The last three flights of Starship, a two-stage, 400-foot tall behemoth, ended in fiery disaster—what Musk has sometimes jokingly called a “rapid unplanned disassembly.” In January and again in March the launch vehicle's Super Heavy booster stage made it back to a massive, pincer-equipped gantry, but Starship's upper stage didn't. In May the booster exploded just before splashdown, and Starship broke up spectacularly in the atmosphere, raining debris that commercial aircraft had to dodge. As a bonus, in June the upper stage detonated on the launchpad while Starship was getting fueled for a test firing of its engines. The tally for 2025 thus far is: explosions, four; SpaceX, zero.

Today Starship's Super Heavy booster and upper stage are on the launchpad yet again. The 10th test flight is scheduled for liftoff on Sunday, circa 7:30 P.M. EDT, from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas. If all goes to plan, the booster will use its 33 rocket engines to push the whole shebang to the edge of space, then drop off, somersault, execute a “boost-back burn” and descend to a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile Starship's upper stage should be firing its rockets to reach orbit, where it will deploy some cargo before flying itself back down through the atmosphere to its own splashdown about an hour and 15 minutes after launch. “Excitement guaranteed,” a SpaceX announcement promises.

But there's excitement and there's excitement. Look, going to space is hard. It's even harder to do in the way SpaceX is attempting. “It's one of the biggest rockets ever. It's, for sure, the biggest rocket that has attempted reuse,” says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, who tracks space launches in his spare time. “Developing a vehicle this big and launching it repeatedly ain't easy.”

Starship isn't just an oligarch's folly. It's a launch system meant to revolutionize spaceflight by flying cargo and crews to orbit at a cost that's almost too cheap to meter. It's supposed to take NASA astronauts back to the moon and human settlers to Mars. And it represents the kind of gleaming, hardware-forward future that Silicon Valley's techno-optimists are always promising. Starship is the linchpin of a lot of plans and schemes.

Over the past few months, SpaceX has acknowledged which pieces of the ship broke with each flight but hasn't gone into any great detail about why. The company didn't return requests for comment from Scientific American. But SpaceX's very online rocket-spotting fans—and the half-dozen aerospace engineers I talked to—have been willing to speculate what the problems might be. Mostly, they believe the company has some brilliant people who stand every chance of solving them. But they also wonder what will happen if SpaceX can't figure out what's wrong—or, even worse, if some fundamental engineering issue means the idea of a reusable, reliable, workhorse spaceship stays confined to science fiction.

Though SpaceX characterizes this differently, Starship had essentially the same types of mishap in all three of the most recent flights—leaks, fires and explosions in the fuel system. On flight seven, there was a flash and then a fire in the unpressurized “attic” below the bottom of Starship's liquid oxygen tank. On flight eight, that happened near one of the rocket engines. On flight nine, fuel leaked into the nose cone.

That fuel, and the plumbing to move it around, might be the problem. It's a mix of liquid methane and liquid oxygen—a volatile cryogenic cocktail that's still, by rocket science standards, experimental. To stay liquid, methane has to be below –259 degrees Fahrenheit (–162 degrees Celsius), and oxygen has to be even colder—below –297 degrees F (–183 degrees C). That means a lot of mechanical effort to keep it cold, to move it around on the ground and on the vehicle and to accommodate it as it shifts from liquid to gas and gets lit on fire. Going back and forth from supercold to hot is called thermal cycling; without careful design and maintenance, almost anything under those conditions will break.

In a Muskian science-fiction future, that's all worth it. Cryogenic fuel is a pain in the asteroid, but it has more oomph per pound as go juice—what engineers call “specific impulse.” And fuels like methane offer the tantalizing possibility that they could be harvested “in situ” on another world—that they could be synthesized from carbon dioxide and frozen water in Martian regolith or, say, slurped up from the roiling methane seas of Titan. That makes “living off the land” in space seem feasible, even though nobody really knows how to do it yet. “Methane is a new rocket propellant for space launch, so we're still learning how to do the methane plumbing. The fact that they've had leaks, the fact that they've had overheating, doesn't really surprise me,” McDowell says. “It's a different-sized molecule, bigger than liquid hydrogen but smaller than kerosene, so it leaks differently in different circumstances. Its chemistry is different.”

But the cryogenic chemistry here might be less relevant than cold mathematics. Anything going to space has to carry its own fuel, but that fuel itself has mass. “That's the tyranny of the rocket equation,” says Hassan Saad Ifti, an aerospace engineer at Texas A&M University, referring to the calculation that vexes every would-be space jockey. “You need to carry more to deliver what you want, but more fuel means more fuel for the fuel.”

That's why rockets often have stages or external boosters: when they run out of fuel, you drop those components so that the rockets will have less mass to lift. Musk's ambitious goal is for Starship to carry between 110 and 165 tons of payload to orbit—five times what a NASA space shuttle could handle, by way of comparison. But to make that work, the vehicle itself—the “dry mass,” without propellant, rocket engines and all the plumbing—has to be extraordinarily light. SpaceX is aiming for a structural ratio—the dry mass divided by the sum of the dry mass and the propellant—of 0.05 for both stages. “Most typical rocket designs, that ratio is around 0.1,” says John Dec, an aerospace engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In other words, Starship is on a pretty extreme weight-loss regime.

Some observers and engineers speculate that diet might be the problem. After the failure on flight seven, SpaceX's official blog reported that the cause of the leaks and fire was a “harmonic response several times stronger than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.” That is, some of Starship's hardware shook itself apart.

Dec was previously at NASA, and his specialty there was entry descent—bringing space probes down to the surface of Mars. It's one of aerospace engineering's hardest challenges. For one thing, the atmosphere gets thicker as you get closer to a planet's surface. So the force of drag on a descending vehicle changes depending on both the density of the air and the speed of the vehicle; drag becomes, in the language of engineering, a dynamic load. “If dynamic loads are changing fast enough, they can cause the vehicle to start to vibrate,” Dec says.

Vibrate all that complicated cryogenic plumbing too much, and very bad things happen. After flight seven, SpaceX hardened fuel lines to the engines and added vents and a nitrogen-gas purge system to the attic where the leaks happened to deal with the possibility of fires. After flight eight, SpaceX insisted that the problems that Starship faced were completely different—but bloggers and Redditors passed around a purported leak from an insider saying that the root issue hadn't changed. It was “harmonic oscillations”—vibrations, again, this time busting methane lines running through the liquid oxygen tank again: When the tank was full of liquid oxygen, it dampened the vibrations. But as the tank emptied, the shaking got worse.

Starship's two stages have to structurally support nearly 11 million pounds of fuel; the upper stage is meant to carry as much as 330,000 pounds of payload. So the vessel itself has to be as light as possible—yet still withstand the buffeting forces of launch and reentry. So far, it has not. “They've designed their structure light enough to perform when the rocket ignites and wants to fly, but maybe—and this is speculation—when they're loading the fuel, that's causing cracking,” Dec says. “When a structure is cooled, it shrinks. If it's rigid and can't move, that's going to cause a stress, and it's going to break.”

A couple other pieces of evidence fit this theory. One reason the booster may have survived flights that the upper stage did not is that the booster doesn't go all the way to space, and it comes back to the ground at only about 4,600 miles per hour. Starship's upper stage goes all the way to orbit and reaches 17,500 mph. That's a lot of kinetic energy to get rid of on reentry—usually as heat. “This is the physical constraint,” Ifti says. “We can't get away from it. We have to manage this energy being generated through heating.”

An early version of Starship tried to bleed off that kinetic energy with a kind of aerodynamic belly flop that ended in a catastrophic loss of control. Now the vehicle uses its control surfaces and rockets to slow its descent and relies on heat-resistant tiles (which, of course, add weight). One persistent critic of SpaceX, Will Lockett, has argued that Starship simply must use more propellant than its builders expected for its return flights, adding even more weight. “This puts incredible pressure on SpaceX to save weight anywhere they possibly can,” Lockett wrote in his newsletter in March. “SpaceX is having to make the rockets too light, resulting in them being fragile, meaning that just the vibrations from operation with a fraction of its expected payload would be enough to destroy the rocket.”

Kaboom.



Maybe this build-test-destroy-rebuild cycle is what you'd expect from a cutting-edge company like SpaceX, which owes much of its astonishing success to iterating like a software start-up. The version of Super Heavy that's set to launch on Sunday has some major design changes, increasing the size and strength of the winglets called “grid fins” but reducing their number from four to three and aiming for a more controlled, higher angle-of-attack descent. Starship's upper stage will also test several new kinds of tiles to protect against the ferocious heat of reentry. This is what coders call “agile.”

In practice, though, this Silicon Valley–style approach forces SpaceX to play a very expensive game of Whac-A-Mole. “The way I read what Elon's trying to do, wow, is it complicated. And when you deal with a very complicated device, there's multiple modes of failure,” says Joseph Powers, an aerospace engineer at the University of Notre Dame and editor in chief of the Journal of Propulsion and Power. “With a rocket, that almost always results in detonation.”

Each failure is supposed to be an opportunity to learn to avoid disaster the next time. “They're facing challenges, but I don't see any showstoppers,” McDowell says. “I don't want to minimize the problems they're having. It is embarrassing for SpaceX, and they do have to fix these things, but they are making progress.”

So there's an easy solution: reduce the weight of the payload Starship can carry and charge more per pound. But even if SpaceX and its customers can absorb the higher price, not all of Starship's planned missions can necessarily wait for a more reliable spacecraft. NASA's Artemis III is supposed to use Starship to land astronauts on the moon's south pole in 2027. That's practically tomorrow, in aerospace time. Plus, even if you didn't already think that ionizing radiation and toxic regolith make Musk's dreams for Mars settlement about as likely as finding canals there, a reduction in Starship's cargo capacity and rapid reusability would seem to doom the plan. One model for making the trip in three months instead of the usual six or nine requires four cargo Starships and two crew Starships and assumes a total of 45 launches—a mere fraction of the 1,000 Starship launches per year SpaceX foresees.

Even McDowell, who's more sanguine about the tech, acknowledges the possibility that there's something more existential at play. “Every time you add a widget to fix something, you increase the mass and decrease the payload capacity,” he says. “That's the key question we don't know in the public domain: To what extent are the fixes causing performance losses?” Musk and SpaceX share a reputation for bold technological wins—they blew up a lot of Falcon 9 rockets before that vehicle became the ultrareliable, game-changing satellite launcher it is today. But investors and customers won't wait for Starship forever. For a would-be rocket builder, the only thing worse than a kaboom is silence.

John Gilpatrick and Jackie Appel discuss how the James Webb Telescope picked up a strange chemical on a distant world—one that only living things make.

Could we really be on the verge of discovering life on other planets? Maybe. And the case is growing stronger by the day.

It's not just a hunch—there's hard data to back up the claim that we may not be alone in the universe after all, thanks to what's being beamed across space by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

One of the most mind-blowing recent scientific developments is the repeated detection of something called dimethyl sulfide (DMS) on a faraway exoplanet called K2-18b. DMS is a gas that, on Earth, is only produced by living organisms. In 2023, JWST's instruments picked up hints of DMS alongside methane and carbon dioxide. 

Then, earlier this year, JWST's follow-up observations provided updated evidence for DMS and/or its cousin, DMDS. When we reported on the finding, we literally said, “This Is Not a Drill,” because even though no one is using the “aliens” word just yet, this biosignature might be our first solid clue that something—something!—is alive on another world.

Ever since that news broke, we haven't been able to stop thinking about what it could mean. Watch Pop Mech editors John Gilpatrick and Jackie Appel geek out over the mysterious DMS and K2-18b, and how this signal—if confirmed—would change everything we thought we knew about life elsewhere in the universe.

John and Jackie discuss how Webb was able to detect such faint traces of gas across billions of miles, and why scientists are proceeding with cautious excitement. 

Plus, Jackie talks about her series, “Pop Mech Explains the Universe,” in which she highlights the wildest findings across the cosmos every week. Watch the full episode above now, and find more installments of “The Astounding Pop Mech Show” on PopularMechanics.com.

Kainate receptors (KARs) are tetrameric, ligand-gated ion channels of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family that mediate excitatory neurotransmission and modulate neuronal circuits and synaptic plasticity during development of the central nervous system. KARs are implicated in psychiatric and neurological diseases and represent a target of therapeutic intervention. Native KARs form complexes with neuropilin and tolloid-like auxiliary subunits (Neto1 and Neto2), which modulate their function, trafficking and synaptic localization. Here we present structures of rat GluK2 KAR in the apo closed state and in the open states activated by agonist kainate and positive allosteric modulator BPAM344, solved in the presence and absence of Neto2 using time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy. While the binding of Neto2 does not change the behavior of individual or dimeric ligand-binding domains (LBDs) or the ion channel, it prevents tightening of the interface between two LBD dimers during activation and slows the kinetics of deactivation. Our structures illuminate the mechanism of KAR activation and its modulation by Neto2.

Fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated primarily by glutamate, a neurotransmitter released from presynaptic terminals to activate three major postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subtypes: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and kainate receptors (KARs)1,2,3,4,5,6. Presynaptic KARs modulate neurotransmitter release at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and tune neuronal excitability7,8. KARs are implicated in excitotoxicity and stroke, as well as neurological and psychiatric diseases9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.

Functional KARs are tetrameric, cation-selective ion channels assembled from five different subunits, GluK1–GluK5 (refs. 1,5,18). The subunits GluK1–GluK3 exhibit low affinity to glutamate and can form homomeric channels, whereas GluK4 and GluK5 are characterized by higher affinity to glutamate and require the low-affinity subunits to coassemble into functional heteromeric channels19,20,21. The overwhelming majority of KARs in the CNS form macromolecular complexes with two auxiliary subunits, neuropilin- and tolloid-like proteins7,22,23,24,25,26 Neto1 and Neto2. These auxiliary subunits share the same type I transmembrane protein domain architecture, including extracellular C1r/C1s–Uegf–bone morphogenic protein domains, CUB1 and CUB2, a low-density lipoprotein class A domain, LDLa, and a single-pass transmembrane domain (TMD). Neto1 and Neto2 slow the deactivation and desensitization kinetics of KARs, accelerate their recovery from desensitization and increase the channel open probability7,27.

A molecular view of the GluK2–Neto2 assembly was provided by structures of the corresponding complex in the competitive antagonist-bound and agonist-bound nonconducting states28. While these structures uncovered the stoichiometry and approximate arrangement of domains in the GluK2–Neto2 complex, the structural basis of its activation has remained elusive. Recently, we explored the mechanism of KAR activation by solving the open-state structure of homomeric GluK2 in the presence of agonist glutamate and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), lectin concanavalin A (ConA) and small molecule BPAM344 (BPAM), which worked synergistically to slow receptor desensitization29. As ConA and Neto2 bind to overlapping sites28,29, we endeavored to investigate alternative conditions to capture the open state of GluK2 in the absence of ConA. Surprisingly, we observed that the high-affinity KAR agonist kainic acid (KA) remarkably slows the kinetics of desensitization for GluK2 KARs in the presence of BPAM, facilitating the capture of open-state structures of GluK2 in the presence and absence of Neto2. We also determined the structures of GluK2 and the GluK2–Neto2 complex in the apo closed state. A comparison of the open-state and apo closed-state structures of GluK2 provides insight into the mechanisms underlying KAR activation and deactivation, as well as modulation of these gating functions by the auxiliary subunit Neto2.

We monitored GluK2 function using patch-clamp current recordings at −60 mV membrane potential from HEK 293F cells expressing rat GluK2. Prolonged application of 3 mM glutamate elicited a rapidly activating inward current that decayed quickly (time constant, τdes = 3.89 ± 0.27 ms, n = 10) to nearly zero value (current reduction after 3-s glutamate exposure, I3s/Imax = 0.0022 ± 0.0011, n = 10) because of receptor desensitization29 (Fig. 1a, left trace). Strikingly, desensitization became 270 times slower in the presence of 50 μM BPAM (τdes = 1.05 ± 0.13 s, n = 10). Nevertheless, 3 s after the beginning of glutamate application, the current amplitude became substantially reduced compared to its maximal value (I3s/Imax = 0.074 ± 0.021, n = 10)29 (Fig. 1a, right trace).

The green arrow indicates a 3-s mark since the beginning of KA application. c,d, Cryo-EM reconstructions of GluK2 in the apo condition viewed parallel to the membrane (c) and their LBD layers viewed extracellularly (d), with protein subunits colored orange and light blue, lipids in purple and carbohydrates in light green. The red arrow illustrates rotation of the subunit B LBD in GluK2Apo-asym compared to GluK2Apo-2fold. e,f, Time-resolved cryo-EM reconstruction of GluK2 captured within 3 s of KA application in the continuous presence of BPAM viewed parallel to membrane (e) and its LBD layer viewed extracellularly (f). The density for KA is colored pink.

As an alternative to glutamate, we tested the agonist KA, which has higher potency and is, therefore, expected to exhibit slower kinetics2,27,30,31,32,33. Prolonged application of 100 μM KA alone elicited currents with a smaller amplitude and slightly slower decay (τdes = 5.00 ± 0.49 ms, n = 11) when compared to glutamate (Fig. 1b, left trace). However, a striking slowdown of desensitization was observed in the presence of 50 µM BPAM (τ = 8.96 ± 0.47 s, n = 5), retaining the substantially high current amplitude even after 3-s exposure to KA (I3s/Imax = 0.79 ± 0.04, n = 6) (Fig. 1b, right trace). On the basis of the dramatic deceleration of desensitization kinetics, we hypothesized that more than 80% of GluK2 receptors remained in the open state within 3 s of KA application in the continuous presence of BPAM.

For our structural experiments, we first purified GluK2 in the apo condition. To exclude possible traces of endogenous glutamate during purification, we supplemented the purified protein with 500 μM BPAM and subjected it to an additional step of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the absence of ligands. We hypothesized that BPAM would stabilize the LBD clamshells in the fully open conformation, specifically the agonist-free state, as previously revealed by the GluK2BPAM structure34, and that BPAM itself would dissociate from the receptor during the SEC step. Indeed, our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments resolved GluK2 in the BPAM-free apo state. During cryo-EM data processing, we observed two distinct particle populations (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1).

The first subset of particles yielded a two-fold symmetrical 3D reconstruction, GluK2Apo-2fold, with LBD densities demonstrating fully open clamshells without agonist bound. Moreover, the BPAM-binding pockets showed no BPAM density, confirming that GluK2Apo-2fold represents a true apo state. The second subset of particles yielded an asymmetric structure, GluK2Apo-asym, where one of two LBD dimers appeared to fall apart (Fig. 1d), similar to previously published KAR structures35,36,37,38,39. Interestingly, the LBD clamshells in the intact A/D dimer and subunit C are fully open, while that in subunit B is completely closed. Although no apparent agonist density inside the LBD of subunit B has been resolved, we cannot exclude the possibility of trace amounts of glutamate causing the clamshell closure and broken, asymmetrical conformation. Thus, only the GluK2Apo-2fold structure is further used as an apo state reference.

To elucidate the mechanism of GluK2 activation, we used an in-house time-resolved cryo-EM device, a solenoid-driven plunger40,41, which we built previously to solve the open-state structure of GluK2 in the presence of ConA29. This plunger allowed freezing of the GluK2 protein sample in the presence of BPAM within 2–3 s of applying KA. Cryo-EM data collected from this sample showed that the majority of particles were in the open state (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2), consistent with our functional data (Fig. 1b). The corresponding 3D reconstruction, GluK2KA-BPAM, revealed densities for KA in the LBD clamshells and BPAM at the LBD dimer interfaces (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Importantly, GluK2KA-BPAM shows two-fold rotational symmetry and a dimer-of-dimers arrangement of LBDs (Fig. 1f), similar to the previously solved open-state structure of GluK2Glu-ConA-BPAM bound to glutamate, ConA and BPAM29.

Using the high-resolution 3D reconstructions as a guide, we built structural models of GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM (Fig. 2a,b). Similar to AMPARs42,43,44, the GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM structures showed the amino-terminal domain (ATD) and LBD layers assembled as dimers of dimers, where A/B and C/D dimers of the ATD and A/D and B/C dimers of the LBD are arranged symmetrically around the overall two-fold symmetry axis, with domain swapping between layers. The ATD and LBD dimers have individual local two-fold symmetry axes that do not coincide with each other or the overall two-fold symmetry axis. The ATD and LBD layers in GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM are slightly less separated (72.8 Å and 70.5 Å, respectively) compared to GluK2Glu-ConA-BPAM (74.5 Å)29 but are considerably farther away from each other compared to closed-state GluK2BPAM (61.3 Å)34 and putative desensitized-state structures (59 Å)29,35. The TMDs from four individual subunits, each containing three transmembrane helices (M1, M3 and M4) and a re-entrant loop M2 between M1 and M3, assemble into a pseudo-four-fold symmetrical ion channel, apparently closed in GluK2Apo-2fold (Fig. 2c) and open in GluK2KA-BPAM (Fig. 2d). In addition, three sets of linkers (S1–M1, M3–S2 and S2–M4) connect the TMDs to LBDs, the latter built of two polypeptide stretches, S1 and S2.

Molecules of KA (green) and BPAM (dark blue) are shown as space-filling models. Carbohydrates (light green) and lipids (purple) are shown as sticks. The axes of the two-fold overall symmetry and local symmetry of the ATD and LBD dimers are shown as thin dashed and solid black lines, respectively.

A 19.6° rotation of lobe D2 toward D1 in GluK2KA-BPAM upon KA binding is illustrated by the pink arrow. g,h, LBD dimers in GluK2Apo-2fold (g) and GluK2KA-BPAM (h). Distances between Cα atoms of S670 and P773 are indicated. i,j, LBD tetramers in GluK2Apo-2fold (i) and GluK2KA-BPAM (j) viewed intracellularly, with the Cα atoms of S670 connected and pink arrows illustrating expansion forces applied to the M3–S2 linkers that induce channel opening.

Channel opening in GluK2KA-BPAM is triggered by KA binding to the clamshells of individual LBDs, which are empty and completely open in GluK2Apo-2fold (Fig. 2e,f). Upon KA binding, the GluK2KA-BPAM LBD clamshells undergo closure, with the lower lobe D2 rotating toward the upper lobe D1 by 19.6° in subunits A and C and 18.4° in subunits B and D. In back-to-back LBD dimers, which maintain their two-fold rotational symmetry and intact D1–D1 interfaces in both GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM, the individual LBD closures result in a notable separation of D2 lobes, illustrated by the increased distance between Cα atoms of S670 from 18 Å in GluK2Apo-2fold to 29 Å in GluK2KA-BPAM (Fig. 2g,h). In turn, this separation of D2 lobes in individual LBD dimers results in an expansion of the LBD layer (Fig. 2i,j). A similar expansion of the LBD tetramer was previously shown to trigger channel opening in KARs in the presence of ConA29, AMPARs45,46,47,48 and NMDARs49, highlighting it as a common feature of iGluR activation.

The ability of Neto2 to slow desensitization and deactivation of KARs has been previously characterized using glutamate as an agonist7,26,27. In this study, we investigated whether Neto2 produces similar effects on GluK2 kinetics when KA is used instead of glutamate. We observed that the rapidly activating inward current elicited by prolonged application of 100 μM KA at −60 mV membrane potential from HEK 293F cells expressing GluK2 alone quickly decayed back to nearly zero because of receptor desensitization (Fig. 3a, left). The desensitization decay followed a single exponential time course with the time constant, τdes = 5.00 ± 0.49 ms (n = 11). When Neto2 was coexpressed with GluK2, the desensitization decay became slower and was better described by a sum of two exponential functions, with τdes-fast = 13.6 ± 0.9 ms and τdes-slow = 182 ± 15 ms, and the fraction of the slow component, Ades-slow = 0.064 ± 0.022 (n = 10). This behavior was similar to that observed in experiments with glutamate7,27. Likewise, for comparison, we calculated the value of weighted τdes (24.5 ± 4.7 ms, n = 10), which was fivefold higher than the value of τdes calculated in the absence of Neto2 (Fig. 3a, right).

a–d, Whole-cell patch-clamp currents recorded at −60 mV membrane potential from HEK 293F cells expressing GluK2 alone (black traces) or GluK2 and Neto2 (red traces) in response to 10-s (a,c) or 2-ms (b,d) application of 100 μM KA alone (a,b) or in the continuous presence of 50 µM BPAM (c,d). Right: weighted time constants of desensitization (a,c) and deactivation (b,d) are shown as bar graphs. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (two-sided two-sample t-test; significant if P < 0.05). Biological replicates: n = 11 for GluK2 τdes in the absence of BPAM, n = 10 for GluK2–Neto2 τdes in the absence of BPAM, n = 11 for GluK2 τdeact in the absence of BPAM, n = 10 for GluK2–Neto2 τdeact in the absence of BPAM, n = 5 for GluK2 τdes in the presence of BPAM, n = 6 for GluK2–Neto2 τdes in the presence of BPAM, n = 6 for GluK2 τdeact in the presence of BPAM and n = 6 for GluK2–Neto2 τdeact in the presence of BPAM. Probabilities for the two-sided two-sample t-test: P = 0.0025 for GluK2 versus GluK2–Neto2 τdes in the absence of BPAM, P = 0.0015 for GluK2 versus GluK2–Neto2 τdeact in the absence of BPAM, P = 0.717 for GluK2 versus GluK2–Neto2 τdes in the presence of BPAM and P = 0.026 for GluK2 versus GluK2–Neto2 τdeact in the presence of BPAM. Data are the mean ± s.e.m. e,f, Cryo-EM reconstructions of GluK2–Neto2 in the apo condition (e) or in the presence of KA and BPAM (f) viewed parallel to membrane (top) and their LBD layers viewed extracellularly (bottom), with protein subunits colored orange and light blue, lipids in purple, carbohydrates in light green and Neto2 in red. Density for KA is colored pink. The red arrow in e illustrates rotation of the subunit B LBD in GluK2–0×Neto2Apo compared to GluK2–1×Neto2Apo.

Source data

Similarly, a strong slowdown of deactivation was observed in response to the short (2-ms) application of 100 μM KA in the presence of Neto2 (weighted τdeact = 14.2 ± 2.3 ms, n = 10) when compared to its absence (4.11 ± 0.59 ms, n = 11). In the presence of BPAM, both desensitization and deactivation kinetics were drastically slower. While the desensitization rate was not significantly different in the presence (9.57 ± 1.53 s, n = 6) versus absence (8.96 ± 0.47 s, n = 5) of Neto2, deactivation in the presence of Neto2 was significantly slower (weighted τdeact = 185 ± 25 ms, n = 6) than in its absence (108 ± 10 ms, n = 6).

To uncover the structural basis of GluK2 regulation by Neto2, we coexpressed GluK2 and Neto2 in HEK 293S cells and subjected the purified protein to cryo-EM. In the absence of ligands, we identified three distinct populations of particles representing the apo closed states with zero (GluK2–0×Neto2Apo), one (GluK2–1×Neto2Apo) or two (GluK2–2×Neto2Apo) molecules of Neto2 bound to the GluK2 tetramer (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4). Interestingly, one LBD dimer in the GluK2–0×Neto2Apo structure was intact, while the other one fell apart, like that of GluK2Apo-asym (Fig. 1c,d). Unlike GluK2Apo-asym, however, the LBD clamshell in GluK2–0×Neto2Apo subunit B remains open, without any density for bound agonist, as observed in the other three subunits, confirming the true apo state of this structure. Importantly, the LBD layers in GluK2–1×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2Apo show the dimer-of-dimers LBD arrangements, similar to the two-fold symmetrical apo structure, GluK2Apo-2fold, solved in the absence of Neto2 (Fig. 1c,d).

To resolve the open-state structures of the GluK2–Neto2 complex, we used time-resolved cryo-EM to prepare grids of the purified protein after exposure to KA for less than 3 s in the continuous presence of BPAM. During cryo-EM data processing, we identified three distinct populations of particles that yielded 3D reconstructions of GluK2 tetramer with zero (GluK2–0×Neto2KA-BPAM), one (GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM), or two (GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM) Neto2 molecules bound (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). The resulting GluK2–0×Neto2KA-BPAM structure was nearly identical to GluK2KA-BPAM (Extended Data Fig. 7). GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM were characterized by a dimer-of-dimers LBD arrangement and the same approximate location of one or two bound Neto2 molecules like the Neto2-bound structures obtained in the apo condition (Fig. 3e).

Neto2-bound structures determined in the absence of ligands (GluK2–1×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2Apo) and in the presence of KA and BPAM (GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM) reveal the GluK2–Neto2 contact interfaces at improved resolution compared to the previous structures of GluK2–Neto2 in the competitive antagonist-bound and putative desensitized states28. The four major structural domains of Neto2, CUB1, CUB2, LDLa and the C-terminal TMD (Fig. 4a,b), follow each other along the surface of the receptor in the extracellular to intracellular direction. The improved resolution of our structures allows visualization of previously unresolved flexible linkers connecting CUB1 to CUB2 (residues 160–176) and LDLa to the TMD (residues 333–338), the C terminus (residues 377–383), which interacts with the M1–M2 loop of GluK2, and glycosylation of Neto2 at N311. Our structures also reveal the unique interfaces that the four major structural domains of Neto2 make with all three structured GluK2 domain layers.

Molecules of KA (green) and BPAM (dark blue) are shown as space-filling models. Carbohydrates (light green) and lipids (purple) are shown as sticks. The axes of the two-fold overall symmetry and local symmetry of the ATD and LBD dimers are shown as thin dashed and solid black lines, respectively. Thick black lines connect the ATD, LBD and Q/R site centers of mass (black spheres) and the distances between them are indicated. Boxed regions are expanded in c–f. c–f, Close-up views of the GluK2–Neto2 contact interfaces between the lower lobe of GluK2 subunit A(C) ATD and CUB1 domain of Neto2 (c), loop 1 of GluK2 subunit B(D) LBD and CUB2 domain of Neto2 (d), lower lobe of GluK2 subunit A(C) LBD and Neto2 domains CUB2 and LDLa (e) and M1 and M1–M2 loop of GluK2 TMD and α1, TM1 and C terminus of Neto2 (f).

The extracellular region of Neto2 makes extensive contacts with the ATD and LBD layers of the receptor. The CUB1 domain shares a 316-Å2 interface with the ATD of GluK2 subunits A and C, mediated mainly by electrostatic interactions between K216, K219, and R220 of the GluK2 ATD and E95, D144, E145 and E146 of CUB1 (Fig. 4c). Confirming the importance of these interactions, regulation of GluK2 function by Neto2 was largely impaired by D144A, E145A, E146A and E148A substitutions in the CUB1 domain50 or abolished by the K216A and R220A substitutions in the GluK2 ATD28. The CUB2 domain contacts loop 1 in the upper lobe of the GluK2 subunit B and D LBDs, sharing a 355-Å2 GluK2–Neto2 interface involving polar and hydrophobic interactions between K448, S449, D450, K451, P452 and L453 of GluK2 and N232, S257, T258, V259 and N261 of CUB2 (Fig. 4d). Confirming the importance of the second interface for Neto2 function, the K448A, D450A and K451A substitutions in GluK2 accelerated desensitization of the GluK2–Neto2 complex28. However, the membrane-facing side of the CUB2 domain, mainly involving Y220, together with the LDLa domain of Neto2, forms the third, 357-Å2 GluK2–Neto2 interface, which connects Neto2 to the lower lobe of the GluK2 LBD belonging to the second LBD dimer (Fig. 4e). Therefore, the CUB2 and LDLa domains of Neto2 cross-interact with protomers of two different LBD dimers and are, thus, poised to regulate their relative positioning during gating. Necessity of the LDLa domain for modulation of KAR activity by Neto2 was demonstrated by a dramatic reduction in GluK2-mediated current amplitude in response to the substitution of two cysteines in LDLa to serine residues7.

The fourth GluK2–Neto2 interface has the largest surface area (1,022 Å2) and mostly involves hydrophobic interactions between TMDs. On the Neto2 side, it is contributed by (1) helix α1, a short region that precedes the transmembrane helix TM1 and runs nearly parallel to the membrane along its extracellular side; (2) TM1 itself; and (3) the C terminus, which follows TM1 (Fig. 4f). On the GluK2 side, the fourth interface involves the transmembrane helix M1, which contacts α1 and TM1 of Neto2, as well as the M1–M2 loop, which forms the GluK2 bottom cap and intracellular portals and mainly contacts the C terminus of Neto2 (Fig. 4f). Highlighting the importance of the M1–M2 loop for Neto2 function, its replacement with the M1–M2 loop of the AMPAR subunit GluA2 accelerated desensitization of the GluK2–Neto2 complex28.

To reveal structural changes responsible for modulation of GluK2 function by Neto2 (Fig. 3a–d), we first compared the ion channel pore in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo (Fig. 5a) and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (Fig. 5b). Typical for the closed-pore conformations, the gate region in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo is narrow, with the side chains of T652, A656, T660 and M664 forming a hydrophobic constriction, very similar to that in GluK2BPAM (Extended Data Fig. 8a) and, therefore, impermeable to both water and ions29. In contrast, the gate region of the GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM pore becomes much wider, with kinking of the pore-lining M3 helices at the gating hinge in all four GluK2 subunits, a representative structural change accompanying channel pore opening in the ConA-bound GluK2KA-ConA-BPAM structure29 (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Measurements of the pore radius in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo, as well as in all apo structures, showed that it is nearly identical to that in GluK2BPAM (Fig. 5c), indicating that all apo structures are indeed in the closed conformation and are impermeable to water and ions29. On the other hand, the pore geometry in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM, as well as in all other structures solved in the presence of KA and BPAM, was nearly identical to the pore geometry in GluK2KA-ConA-BPAM (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 8b), suggesting that all these structures represent open states, with their pores permeable to water and ions29.

Only two (B and D) of four subunits are shown, with the front and back subunits (A and C) omitted for clarity. The pore profiles are shown as space-filling models (gray). The red arrow indicates the gating hinge where M3 bends during channel opening. c, Pore radius for GluK2Apo-2fold (blue), GluK2Apo-asym (cyan), GluK2–0×Neto2Apo (chartreuse), GluK2–1×Neto2Apo (dark blue), GluK2–2×Neto2Apo (green), GluK2BPAM (dark purple; PDB 8FWS), GluK2KA-BPAM (red), GluK2–0×Neto2KA-BPAM (light orange), GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM (dark orange), GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (purple) and GluK2Glu-ConA-BPAM (pink; PDB 9B36) calculated using HOLE. The vertical dashed line denotes the radius of a water molecule, 1.4 Å.

We next compared the LBD layers in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM structures (Fig. 6). We observed that LBD clamshells in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo are fully open, similar to GluK2Apo-2fold, without any signs of agonist bound. However, the LBD clamshells in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM undergo closure exemplified by rotation of the D2 lobe toward D1 (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, the extent of the clamshell closure in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (20.6° D2 rotation in subunits A and C and 20.7° in subunits B and D; Fig. 6a,b) is slightly larger than that in GluK2KA-BPAM (19.6° D2 rotation in subunits A and C and 18.4° in subunits B and D; Fig. 6c,d). Nevertheless, the dramatic separation of the D2 lobes upon the individual LBD clamshell closures in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (signified by the increase in distance between Cα atoms of S670 from 19 Å in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo to 29 Å in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM; Fig. 6b) is nearly identical to that observed in the absence of Neto2 (18 Å in GluK2Apo-2fold versus 29 Å in GluK2KA-BPAM; Fig. 6d). The slightly enhanced closure of the individual LBD clamshells in the presence of Neto2, therefore, compensates for the loosening of the D1–D1 interface during activation, which happens in the absence (the distance between Cα atoms of P773 increases from 13 Å in GluK2Apo-2fold to 15 Å in GluK2KA-BPAM; Fig. 6d) but not in the presence of Neto2 (the distance between Cα atoms of P773 remains 15 Å in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM; Fig. 6b).

Cα atoms of S670 and P773 are shown as spheres. d, Superposition of LBD dimers from GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM. Distances between Cα atoms of S670 and P773 are indicated. e–h, Extracellular view of the LBD layer surface in GluK2–2×Neto2Apo (e), GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (f), GluK2Apo-2fold (g) and GluK2KA-BPAM (h). Purple and pink arrows indicate relative motions of LBD dimers as a result of GluK2 activation by KA + BPAM in the presence and absence of Neto2, respectively. The surface area of the contact interface between two LBD dimers is indicated.

While the individual LBD clamshells, LBD dimers and ion channel pores in Neto2-bound structures appear to behave in the same way as in the absence of Neto2, the relative positioning of the LBD dimers with respect to each other appears to be dramatically different. Indeed, in the presence of Neto2, the interaction of two LBD dimers upon GluK2 activation becomes less pronounced, as characterized by the reduced surface area of the dimer–dimer interface in GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM (129 Å2) compared to GluK2–2×Neto2Apo (139 Å2) (Fig. 6f,g and Supplementary Video 1). In contrast, channel opening in the absence of Neto2 is accompanied by substantial strengthening of the interaction between two GluK2 LBD dimers, as evidenced by a fourfold increased interdimer interface in GluK2KA-BPAM (852 Å2) compared to GluK2Apo-2fold (219 Å2) (Fig. 6h–i and Supplementary Video 1).

In this study, we present the apo structures of the KAR GluK2 in the absence and presence of the auxiliary subunit Neto2. The apo structures of GluK2 with (GluK2–2×Neto2Apo) and without (GluK2Apo-2fold) Neto2 are very similar, characterized by fully open LBD clamshells without any signs of bound agonist. Further, the dimer-of-dimers arrangement of the LBD layer with intact D1–D1 interfaces in individual dimers and closed ion channel pores suggest that we solved the true apo state of GluK2 (Figs. 2, 5 and 6). These features of the apo GluK2 structures are grossly similar to the apo51 and competitive antagonist-bound42 AMPAR, or BPAM-bound KAR34,52 structures. Interestingly, a recently reported apo structure of GluK2 had different features, including closed LBD clamshells and a fourfold symmetrical LBD layer, where both LBD dimers dissociated into individual monomers39, similar to the putative desensitized-state structure35. One possible explanation for this structural disparity is the presence of residual glutamate in the protein preparation for the previously published structure, sufficient to transform the channel into the putative desensitized state.

We also successfully captured open-state GluK2 structures in near-physiological conditions. By using the high-affinity agonist KA together with the PAM BPAM, we were able to slow the desensitization kinetics of GluK2. Subsequently, we used time-resolved cryo-EM to trap most channels in the open state before they could transition to the desensitized state. We found that the dramatic slowdown of desensitization kinetics in the presence of KA and BPAM (Fig. 1b) correlates with tightening of the dimer–dimer interface in GluK2KA-BPAM compared to GluK2Apo-2fold (Fig. 6g,h). Such a correlation is consistent with the vision of desensitization as a KAR gating process that occurs in two steps: shallow desensitization associated with rupture of the LBD dimer interfaces29,53 and deep desensitization linked to the dissociation of LBD dimers29,35,53. Indeed, the second step, which is missing in closely related AMPARs46,54,55,56 and determines the slow component of KAR desensitization, assumes complete breakage of the LBD dimer–dimer interface. Accordingly, tightening of this interface should slow or prevent deep desensitization of KARs. Because the binding sites for Neto2 and ConA overlap, the identified condition of joint KA and BPAM application allowed us to solve the open-state structure of GluK2 not only in the absence of ConA but also in the presence of Neto2.

Previously, ConA was suggested to act as a spacer between the ATD and LBD layers in GluK2KA-ConA-BPAM structures29, increasing their separation when compared to GluK2BPAM34 and desensitized-state structures29,35,38. However, it turns out that the GluK2KA-ConA-BPAM structure is only 3 Å taller than GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM (Fig. 7a). Even the GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM structure, which is 4 Å shorter than GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2KA-BPAM, is taller than GluK2BPAM and the desensitized-state structures. Thus, the separation of the ATD and LBD layers does not appear to be a requisite for the open state. On the other hand, all apo and open-state structures show much stronger separation of these layers than in GluK2BPAM or the desensitized-state structures, suggesting that their separation might be important for the process of activation. Interestingly, depending on the presence of a combination of PAMs or the auxiliary subunit Neto2, the activation process can be accompanied by different rotations of the ATD layer (Fig. 7a). While such rotation might be relevant to the interaction of KARs with presynaptic or transsynaptic proteins, it does not appear to be relevant to the conformations of individual LBDs, LBD dimers or the ion channel pore in the open state. On the other hand, the distance between the ATD layer and the LBDs, as well as its relative rotation, depends on bound ligand, which in turn can affect KAR gating kinetics by altering the relative positioning or dynamics of the main structural domains. Therefore, Neto2 binding eliminates the substantial tightening of the LBD dimer–dimer interface, which occurs in its absence (Fig. 6f,h). We propose that the loss of interdimer contacts because of restraints put on the receptor by Neto2 slows the open-to-closed state transition and results in deceleration of deactivation and desensitization kinetics (Figs. 3a,b,d and 7b,c). Further insights into the molecular mechanism by which the auxiliary subunit Neto2 regulates KAR function will emerge once KAR structures are solved in the preactive state, an intermediate or transitional state among the closed, open and desensitized57.

Black lines connect the ATD and Q/R site centers of mass, with the distances between them indicated (top). Movement of the ATD layer upon channel opening is illustrated by blue arrows, with the rotation angle indicated (bottom). b,c, Cartoons illustrating the closed-to-open transition of KAR in the absence (b) and presence (c) of Neto2. Neto2 prevents tightening of the LBD dimer–dimer interface during channel opening and decelerates receptor deactivation.

DNA for the full-length rat GluK2 (GenBank CAA77778.1), with V at position 567, C at position 571 and Q at position 621 (the Q/R site), was amplified using PCR and inserted into the pEG BacMam vector with a thrombin cleavage site, eGFP and streptavidin affinity tag at the C terminus. Similarly, DNA for rat Neto2 (GenBank ACS44815.1) was cloned into the pEG BacMam vector with a thrombin cleavage site, mCherry and 8×His affinity tag at the C terminus. The bacmid and baculoviruses were produced in Sf9 cells (Gibco, 12659017) cultured in Sf-900 III SFM medium (Gibco) at 27 °C using standard methods. The recombinant complex of GluK2–Neto2 was expressed in HEK 293S cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-3022) cultured in Freestyle 293 expression medium (Gibco) at 30 °C and 6% CO2. For patch-clamp experiments, HEK 293F cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) were maintained at 37 °C and 6% CO2 in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS.

Purification of recombinant complex GluK2–Neto2 was carried out as described previously for GluK2 alone, with slight modifications29. In brief, P2 viruses of GluK2 and Neto2 were made separately and stored as 20× stocks. The virus stocks at the ratio of 4:1 (GluK2 to Neto2) were added to HEK 293S cells at a density of ~3.0 × 106 cells per ml and incubated at 37 °C and 6% CO2. The cell culture was induced by 10 mM sodium butyrate at 12–15 h after transduction and the temperature was changed to 30 °C. The cells were harvested at 72 h after transduction by low-speed centrifugation (5,500g, 10 min), followed by a wash with 1× PBS pH 7.4 and another centrifugation (5,500g, 15 min). The cell pellet from 2 L of culture was resuspended in 100 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer composed of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 2 μM pepstatin A and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed by sonication for 3 min (three cycles of 15 s on and 15 s off). The cell lysate was centrifuged (5,500g, 15 min) to remove cell debris and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (186,000g, 1 h) to isolate cell membranes. The cell membranes were mechanically homogenized and solubilized for 2 h in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% digitonin (Cayman Chemical Company, 14952) and the protease inhibitors mentioned above. The insoluble material was removed using ultracentrifugation (186,000g, 1 h). The supernatant was mixed with pre-equilibrated streptavidin-linked resin (2 ml) and rotated for 10–14 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the protein-bound resin was washed with 30–35 ml of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% digitonin. The protein was eluted in 12–15 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin. The eluted protein was concentrated and subjected to thrombin digestion (1:200 w/w) at 22 °C for 90 min to remove eGFP, mCherry and affinity tags. The digest reaction was then injected into a Superose 6 10/300 GL SEC column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% digitonin. The peak fractions corresponding to tetrameric GluK2–Neto2 complex were pooled and concentrated to 5–6 mg ml−1.

To purify GluK2 and GluK2–Neto2 in the apo state, the concentrated protein was mixed with 500 μM BPAM344, incubated for 25–30 min on ice and injected again into the SEC column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% digitonin. All procedures, unless otherwise specified, were carried out at 4 °C.

We used our in-house vitrification system developed for rapid grid preparation as described previously29. For cryo-EM grid preparation, we used UltrAuFoil R 1.2/1.3, 300-mesh gold grids (EMS). Before the sample application, the grids were treated in a PELCO easyGlow cleaning system (Ted Pella, 25 s, 15 mA) to render their surface hydrophilic. For the open state, purified GluK2–Neto2 or GluK2 protein at the concentration of 5–6 mg ml−1 was incubated with 500 µM BPAM344 for 20–30 min on ice. Subsequently, 1.5 µl of protein sample was applied to both sides of the grid and 0.5 µl of KA at 20 mM was applied to one side of the grid, blotted for 1.5 s from the other side and immediately vitrified in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The total time between KA application and plunge-freezing was shorter than 3 s. For the apo state, we prepared grids of GluK2–Neto2 and GluK2 using FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) set at 4 °C and 100% humidity. For this, 3 µl of protein solution was applied to each grid, which was then vitrified using blot time of 3 s, wait time of 30 s and blot force of 2. The grids were imaged on Titan Krios transmission EM instruments (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV, equipped with a postcolumn GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width set to 20 eV) and a Gatan K3 direct electron detection camera, using Leginon 3.5, Serial EM 4.0 or EPU 2.0 software. We collected 22,262 images for GluK2apo, 16,261 images for GluK2–Neto2apo, 5,677 images for GluK2KA-BPAM and 14,794 images for GluK2–Neto2KA-BPAM in the counting mode across the defocus range of −1.0 to −2.0 µm. The data collection details are given in Supplementary Table 1.

For all datasets, cryo-EM data processing followed a similar protocol. Briefly, the data processing was performed using cryoSPARC (version 4.4.1)58 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Video frames were aligned using patch motion correction. Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed using the patch CTF estimation. Following CTF estimation, micrographs were manually inspected and those with outliers in defocus values, ice thickness and astigmatism and micrographs with lower predicted CTF-correlated resolution were excluded from further processing (individually assessed for each parameter relative to the overall distribution). Initially, particles were picked using blob picker, followed by multiple rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classification to create templates for template picking and then Topaz training. After removal of duplicates, picked particles were extracted with binning. After several rounds of reference-free 2D classification and heterogenous classification, cleaned particles were extracted without binning. At this stage, the GluK2KA-BPAM dataset revealed only one population of particles, while the GluK2apo, GluK2–Neto2apo and GluK2–Neto2KA-BPAM datasets revealed multiple conformations. Correspondingly, particles in the last three datasets were classified into GluK2Apo-asym and GluK2Apo-2fold, GluK2–0×Neto2Apo, GluK2–1×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2Apo and GluK2–0×Neto2KA-BPAM, GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM and each subset was subjected to reference-based motion correction individually. To improve resolution, ATD and LBD–TMD were subjected to local refinement with a mask or particle subtraction followed by cleanup and nonuniform refinement. The processing of individual datasets is shown in Extended Data Figs. 1,2 and 5.

The models of GluK2Apo-asym, GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2–0×Neto2Apo were built in Coot (version 0.9.8.1)59 using cryo-EM density and the GluK2BPAM structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 8FWQ) as a guide. The GluK2KA-BPAM and GluK2–0×Neto2KA-BPAM models were built in Coot using cryo-EM density and the GluK2Glu-ConA-BPAM structure (PDB 9B36) as a guide. The GluK2–1×Neto2Apo and GluK2–2×Neto2Apo models were built in Coot using cryo-EM density and GluK2Apo-2fold and GluK2–1×Neto2des (PDB 7F57) structures as guides. The GluK2–1×Neto2KA-BPAM and GluK2–2×Neto2KA-BPAM) models were built in Coot using cryo-EM density and the GluK2KA-BPAM and GluK2–2×Neto2Apo structures as guides. The resulting models were subjected to the real-space refinement in PHENIX (version 1.18)60 and visualized in Chimera (version 1.13.1)61 or Pymol (version 2.5.2, Schrödinger). Validation statistics for the models are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Domain rotations were determined using DynDom 1.5 (http://dyndom.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/). The pore radius was calculated using HOLE (version 2.1)62.

DNA encoding GluK2 and Neto2 (described above) was introduced into a pIRES plasmid for expression in eukaryotic cells that were engineered to produce GFP through a downstream internal ribosome entry site. HEK 293F cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 1–5 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). Recordings were made 24 to 48 h after transfection at room temperature. Currents from whole cells, typically held at −60 mV potential, were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using low-noise data acquisition system Digidata 1440A and pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). The external solution contained 150 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3; 7 mM NaCl was added to the extracellular activating solution containing 3 mM glutamate to improve visualization of the border between two solutions coming out of a two-barrel theta glass pipette, which allowed its more precise positional adjustment for faster solution exchange. The internal solution contained 150 mM CsF, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3. Rapid solution exchange was achieved with a two-barrel theta glass pipette controlled by a piezoelectric translator. Typical 10–90% rise times were 200–300 µs, as measured from junction potentials at the open tip of the patch pipette after recordings. Data analysis was performed using the Clampfit 10.3 and Origin 2023 software (OriginLab).

Statistical analysis was performed using Origin 2023. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-sample t-test, with significance assumed if P < 0.05. In all figure legends, n represents the number of independent biological replicates. All quantitative data were presented as the mean ± s.e.m.

The OSIRIS-REx mission deployed contact pad samplers to collect regolith from the uppermost surface of the asteroid Bennu that was exposed to the space environment. Space weathering processes, dominated by micrometeoroid impacts and solar irradiation, modify the mineralogy and chemistry of exposed surfaces to produce solar wind-amorphized layers on clays, metallic whiskers associated with high temperature melts and Fe nitride created by the reaction of indigenous N-bearing gases with space-weathered surfaces. Here, we use cosmogenic noble gases and radionuclides to suggest that the upper metre of Bennu's regolith has been exposed to cosmic rays for 2–7 million years, consistent with remote sensing observations indicating that the asteroid's surface is dynamic and regularly modified by mass movement. Solar energetic particle track and microcrater densities constrain the space weathering spectral changes observed in Hokioi crater to <50,000 years. These spectral changes are driven largely by the accumulation of impact melt deposits on particle surfaces, although compositional or grain size effects may also occur. Comparison of Bennu samples with those collected from the asteroids Ryugu and Itokawa suggest that micrometeoroid impacts might play a more active and rapid role in the space weathering of asteroidal surfaces than was initially suggested, particularly for carbonaceous bodies.

The NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security—Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft returned centimetre-scale and smaller regolith particles from Hokioi crater on (101955) Bennu, a relatively rare, spectrally blue (B-type) carbonaceous asteroid1,2. The spacecraft's Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM)3 captured the ‘bulk' ~122 g sample, which consists of mixed material from the surface and potentially from up to ~0.5 m in depth4. In addition, the TAGSAM included 24 contact pads consisting of stainless-steel Velcro, each ~17 mm in diameter and arranged symmetrically around the circumference of the TAGSAM base (Extended Data Fig. 1)3. Their purpose was to sample Bennu's uppermost regolith to explore the mineralogical, chemical and spectroscopic changes resulting from exposure to space weathering.

Spacecraft data provided our first insights into the extent of space weathering effects across Bennu's surface. Reflectance spectra showed that small craters on Bennu, especially Hokioi, are redder in the visible wavelengths than the global average; these craters were inferred to be the youngest on Bennu, with a surface exposure age estimated to be <105 years (ref. 2). Post-sampling observations of Hokioi crater confirmed that freshly exposed materials are spectrally redder and darker in the visible wavelengths than the more space weathered, spectrally blue material exposed across most of Bennu's surface2,4. However, spectra from an aliquot of the returned sample are even more red-sloped and darker than spectra collected by the spacecraft1, suggesting that, despite its inferred young exposure age, material at the surface of Hokoi crater has already undergone considerable space weathering.

Upon examination of the TAGSAM, we found that all contact pads contained adhering material, including particles captured in the Velcro loops, smaller particles in the base weave and dust particles coating much of the surface area (Extended Data Fig. 1) comprising ≪100 mg. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that contact pad particles are mineralogically similar to the bulk sample1, including fine-grained phyllosilicates, magnetite framboids and plaquettes, Fe and Fe–Ni sulfides, carbonates, phosphates and many other minor and trace minerals5. SEM analyses also show that all four particles extracted thus far from contact pad OREX-452000-0, as well as tens of particles from the bulk sample, show evidence for space weathering on their surfaces, including vesicular impact melt deposits and micrometeoroid impact craters (<10 µm in diameter; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1).

The quenched impact melt deposits (hereafter ‘melts') are present on ~10–20% of the tens of particles analysed from the bulk sample to date and all four particles extracted from the contact pad. One contact pad particle (OREX-452001-0) exhibits ~180 individual melt deposits over ~0.6 mm2 (Fig. 1). The melts range in size and coverage, from splashes only a few micrometres wide to coatings covering >200 µm2 of the particle surface. We extracted focused ion beam (FIB) sections to investigate the microstructure and chemistry of space weathering features in the transmission electron microscope (TEM).

The bulk compositions of the melts (Supplementary Table 2) are approximately solar for most major elements (for example, Mg, Si and Fe), except S, which is depleted from the melts owing to its volatility, resulting in the formation of Fe metal grains in some melts. The melts also contain abundant nano- and micro-phase inclusions of Fe–Ni–S phases and can also include larger immiscible Fe–Ni–S melts, either as discrete deposits or as irregular swirls (schlieren) in the host silicate melts.

In addition to micro- and nano-phase inclusions, there are widespread vesicles throughout the melts (~500 nm in diameter) and also concentrated at the melt interface with the phyllosilicate-rich matrix (~50 nm in diameter). The large vesicles resemble those in melts produced by infra-red laser irradiation of hydrated carbonaceous chondrites—where the vesicles form from evolved volatiles (mainly H2O)6. This H2O probably contributes to the broadening of the 2.7-µm water feature observed in the spacecraft spectra7. The smaller vesicles resemble those observed in solar wind-irradiated surfaces of particles returned from Itokawa8 and laboratory experiments9,10.

In contrast to the silicate melts described above, the Fe–Ni–S melt deposits are crystalline and dominated by fine-grained mixtures of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, FeNi metal and minor magnetite. On one such melt deposit (OREX-501017-101), we observed a polycrystalline ~10-nm Fe nitride layer (Fig. 2) that consists of an intergrowth of siderazot (Fe3N1.3) and roaldite (Fe4N). The Fe nitride minerals probably formed through a gas-phase reaction of the Fe metal layer with a N-bearing volatile phase, most probably indigenous ammonia11. The discovery of nitrides in Ryugu12 and Bennu samples suggests an unexpected but possibly common process involving interactions between ammonia and the space-weathered regolith particles on carbonaceous asteroids.

A sulfide melt on particle OREX-803164-100 lacks an Fe nitride layer; however, on that deposit, we observe the formation of multiple FeNi-rich metal whiskers protruding up to ~100 nm from the surface (Fig. 3), like those observed on sulfides in samples from Itokawa13 and the Moon14 (see ‘Impact melt deposits' section in the Supplementary Data).

Evidence for solar wind irradiation was identified in particles that exhibit other characteristics consistent with surface exposure on Bennu (for example, microcraters and melts). In addition, we examined areas immediately underlying melts superimposed on previously solar wind-exposed surfaces.

On particle OREX-501017-102, we observe a less porous, compact surface layer, ranging in thickness from 60 to 150 nm, consistent with the expected implantation depths for solar wind H+ and He+ in silicate materials estimated by Monte Carlo atomic collision modelling9,15. This compact layer exhibits heterogeneous crystallinity, with a predominantly amorphous surface transitioning to poorly crystalline, and ultimately long-range crystalline order at the base (Extended Data Fig. 2). The compact surface layer is also chemically processed, with a 10-nm-thick rim enriched in Mg and depleted in Si, overlying a similar layer depleted in Mg and enriched in Si. This chemical signature is commonly observed in other solar wind-irradiated returned samples and analogues9,10,16 (see ‘Solar wind irradiation' section in the Supplementary Data).

We directly measured solar wind-derived He in particles that showed evidence for surface exposure (OREX-501017-102 and OREX-501017-100). Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements revealed heterogeneously distributed He in the compact surface layer of particle OREX-501017-102 (Fig. 4). We also identified He in OREX-501017-100 in small vesicles concentrated at the melt–matrix interface. These observations support the inferred relationship between interface vesicles and the implantation of solar wind gases.

Olivine and pyroxene grains exposed to the space environment are rare in Bennu samples1,5. We extracted a FIB section from a forsterite grain on the surface of a contact pad particle (OREX-452001-0) and observed a nanocrystalline solar wind-damaged rim ~100 nm wide and solar energetic particle (SEP) tracks with a density of ~1.4 × 109 cm−2 (Fig. 5). The rim microstructure is similar to solar wind-damaged rims in olivine grains from Itokawa and the Moon with similar SEP track densities17.

We used SEM imaging to identify micrometeoroid impact craters on the basis of their circular morphology, raised rims and the presence of vesicular melt deposits lining the crater floors (Fig. 1b). Micrometre-sized impact craters are commonly observed on contact pad particles and on some particles from the bulk sample. On the surface of contact pad particle OREX-452001-0, we observe ~40 microcraters with diameter typically 1–2 μm. In contrast, the largest crater we have identified is in a particle from bulk sample OREX-803109-0 and is ~10 μm in diameter with radial fractures extending outwards (Fig. 6).

We use solar energetic particle tracks and microcrater densities to constrain recent direct exposure at Bennu's surface (less than millimetre depths). At greater depths (upper few metres), we use the production of the radioactive cosmogenic nuclides (hereafter ‘radionuclides') 10Be and 26Al as well as the stable noble gas nuclide 21Ne by exposure to galactic cosmic rays. Whereas cosmogenic noble gases record the total cosmic ray exposure (CRE) history of the samples, radionuclides record the CRE history of the past 5–10 Myr.

Solar energetic particles leave tracks of ionization damage in anhydrous silicate crystals, and their density can be used as a chronometer for exposure in the uppermost millimetres of the regolith18. The SEP track density in the forsterite exposed on OREX-452001-0 (~1.4 × 109 cm−2) is consistent with an exposure age of ~45,000 years (Methods).

Microcrater densities also constrain the surface exposure age of particles. While contact pad particle OREX-452001-0 has the highest microcrater density, this estimate represents a minimum density for this particle because we did not count micrometre-sized pits without melt as microcraters. We use this density to estimate the exposure age by comparison with the cumulative microcrater production rate observed for lunar rocks and soils19, giving a range in exposure age of ~20,000–85,000 years (Methods).

Bennu particles (Methods), such as those returned from Ryugu20, contain abundant primordially trapped noble gas components that mostly overprint the much less abundant cosmogenic noble gases21. Some particles that were exposed at Bennu's surface also contain abundant trapped solar wind, evident in He and Ne. Because the trapped components are so dominant, any resolvable excesses of cosmogenic 21Ne are minimal if present at all. Otherwise, upper limits were determined (see data in ref. 21). Where resolvable, the concentration of cosmogenic 21Ne in the Bennu particles (2.8 and 4.2 × 10−9 cm3 STP g−1, where STP is standard temperature and pressure) suggests a CRE age of 2–7 Myr, depending mostly on the depth where the exposure to galactic cosmic rays occurred.

We measured the concentrations of the cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be (half-life of 1.36 Myr (ref. 22)), 26Al (half-life of 0.705 Myr (ref. 23)) and 36Cl (half-life of 0.301 Myr (ref. 24)) in aggregate sample OREX-803047-0. (Supplementary Table 3). The cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations correspond to irradiation depths of 170–180 and 100–110 g cm−2, respectively25. Since the collected sample is probably a mixture of materials from the surface and deeper in the crater26, scenarios where individual particles were exposed at different depths and for different durations may explain the cosmogenic nuclide record of the sample. Regardless of the different histories of individual particles, the cosmogenic radionuclide results indicate a minimum CRE age of >3 Myr for the sample, which is consistent with the ages >2 Myr derived from cosmogenic 21Ne here. Nevertheless, some caution is needed as noble gas measurements were performed on different samples than those used for radionuclide measurements.

If the 2–7 Myr CRE age of the samples that we examined is representative of Bennu's average surface, then the exposure time of the top few metres of regolith is less than the asteroid's oldest estimated age (~1 Gyr) by more than two orders of magnitude27. This indicates that the uppermost few metres of Bennu are frequently replenished with material from depths >5–10 m, probably by a combination of impact gardening and downslope mass movements. This is consistent with spacecraft observations indicating a dynamic surface, including particle ejection events (for example, ref. 28), mass movement within the past few hundreds of thousands of years27,29 and a crater size frequency distribution indicating that the upper ~10 m of Bennu is resurfaced on a timescale of 10–65 Myr (ref. 30). Finally, our initial results for Bennu materials indicate a CRE age of approximately 5 million years, similar to the age determined for Ryugu20, suggesting that these two asteroids have experienced comparable surface evolution histories.

With the analysis of samples from Bennu, we can compare weathering timescales from a remote versus laboratory perspective, while also linking spectral characteristics to their microstructural and chemical sources. The younger SEP exposure age we find from a particle collected at the surface (~104 years) suggests that space weathering changes occurred on a more rapid timescale than was estimated from spacecraft data (105 years).

Spacecraft measurements also suggest that surface material on Bennu becomes brighter and bluer with continued exposure to the space environment, in contrast to lunar and ordinary chondritic materials2,3,31. Compositionally, Bennu samples contain hydrated amorphous Mg,Na phosphate1,32; a similar phase in Ryugu samples displays a blue slope across visible wavelengths33, suggesting that such material may be contributing to Bennu and Ryugu reflectance spectra. In laboratory studies with analogue materials, the bluing trend has been attributed to a variety of optically opaque minerals, including carbonaceous materials, sulfides or magnetite6,34. The melt deposits on the surfaces of Bennu particles contain abundant nano-phase and micro-phase inclusions of FeNi metal and FeNi sulfides. Spectral modelling of troilite (FeS) inclusions in silicate hosts indicate that particles >40 nm in diameter cause bluing of reflectance spectra across visible–near-infra-red wavelengths34. This link between nano-phase sulfides, which we observe in the samples, and increasingly blue spectral characteristics offers a fresh paradigm for space weathering on airless carbonaceous bodies where nano- and microscale sulfide inclusions influence the evolution of spectral properties observed through remote sensing, rather than the nano-phase Fe metal. These observations provide context for space weathering processes across the Solar System and may have implications for rocky bodies enriched in sulfur, such as Mercury.

Space weathering is a ubiquitous process affecting airless bodies across the Solar System, and understanding the relative contributions of its constituent processes and their timescales is critical for interpreting the mineralogy and evolution of these planetary surfaces. The canonical model for space weathering constructed from lunar observations suggested that solar wind modifies airless surfaces on short timescales (104–106 years), whereas impacts operate on longer timescales (108–109 years)35,36. This was reinforced by observations from Itokawa samples, where solar wind appeared to be the dominant space weathering agent, acting to alter spectral characteristics more efficiently and on shorter timescales than impacts8,36.

However, we can now compare space weathering characteristics in returned samples across all our asteroidal collections (Itokawa, Ryugu and Bennu). Melt deposits occur in <0.5% of Itokawa samples37, 2% of Ryugu particles16 and 20% of Bennu particles (although analyses of additional material may improve these statistics). In contrast, Ryugu samples have the lowest SEP track density ages (6,000 years), compared with those from Bennu (45,000 years) and Itokawa (50,000 years)8,16. Together, these results suggest that micrometeoroid impacts play a more important role in the space weathering of asteroidal surfaces than was suggested from early observations of asteroidal returned samples.

Comparing space weathering characteristics between only Ryugu and Bennu samples reveals a common suite of products, including vesiculated melts with nano- and micro-phase FeNi sulfide inclusions, solar wind-damaged rims, microcraters and the unusual metal whiskers and nitride layers described above12,13,16,17. This is unsurprising given their mineralogical and compositional similarity and their exposure to the near-Earth space environment. However, the observed SEP track and microcrater densities indicate that Bennu samples have an order-of-magnitude longer surface exposure than Ryugu samples. In addition, there are apparent differences in the spectral slopes, colours and strength of the 2.7-µm hydration feature between Ryugu and Bennu in spacecraft data31.

The spectral slope differences between Ryugu and Bennu31 were attributed to different space weathering trends operating on the bodies, but the asteroids' similar chemical and microstructural characteristics and the age relationship we infer from the samples indicates that the space weathering trend is a single path with spectral slopes evolving from red to blue over time. Ryugu sits at an earlier stage of this pathway, and we predict that it will eventually develop a bluer, Bennu-like spectral slope. Other factors such as particle size, minor mineralogical differences or rock surface textures may also contribute to differences between the asteroids.

The space weathering characteristics of Bennu and Ryugu revealed by remote sensing and sample analysis suggest that space weathering is fundamentally different for primitive carbonaceous bodies compared with the Moon and S-complex asteroids in four ways:

Micrometeoroid impacts are more efficiently driving rapid spectral changes relative to solar wind effects on hydrated carbonaceous asteroids, which also contrasts with existing models for inner Solar System weathering timescales (see, for example, ref. 36).

Observations from Bennu samples have demonstrated that impacts not only alter the surfaces of C-complex asteroids more substantially but do so on a far shorter timescale than hypothesized on the basis of lunar surfaces (104 years compared with >108 years).

The effects of micrometeoroid impacts are known to be magnified by the low mechanical strength38, higher volatile content and more efficient melting of carbonaceous surfaces versus their anhydrous lunar and asteroidal counterparts. These properties result in the wide dispersion of melt ejecta by shocked volatiles39.

Spectral slopes are driven towards bluing with continued exposure, rather than reddening, a reversal of lunar-style space weathering spectral trends. Differences in surface exposure timescales between Ryugu (shorter) and Bennu (longer) support the hypothesis that carbonaceous asteroids experience a pathway of weathering driven by early reddening, followed by eventual bluing2. Bennu and Ryugu are snapshots of asteroids at two different stages of this pathway, with Ryugu exhibiting a redder spectral slope, lower crater density and younger surface exposure ages, and Bennu showing a bluer slope, higher crater densities and longer surface exposure ages. These observations provide another metric by which relative surface ages could be determined for carbonaceous asteroids in the main belt.

Recent crater distribution and retention age analyses40 confirm that rubble-pile asteroids can experience exceptionally rapid regolith mixing and resurfacing, with turnover timescales on Ryugu of 103–105 years. This rapid cycling suppresses long-term spectral bluing and promotes the exposure of fresh material, especially on Ryugu, where younger surface ages result in a redder spectral slope. Bennu, having experienced fewer resurfacing events, has transitioned further along the spectral weathering pathway towards bluer slopes. These processes, driven by impact gardening and surface flows, appear to dominate space weathering on carbonaceous asteroids, fundamentally distinguishing them from those on the Moon and S-type asteroids.

Evidence for space weathering on particle surfaces (for example, vesicular melt deposits with embedded nano-particles) was identified using SEM of particles extracted from contact pad OREX-452000-0 and from aggregate samples OREX-501017-0, OREX-803081-0 and OREX-803164-0 (where ‘aggregate' signifies a sample consisting of unsorted particles). We used a JEOL 7900F scanning electron microscope at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) operated in low vacuum mode to image the contact pad particles without a conductive coating. For other aggregate samples, we used a JEOL 7600F field-emission scanning electron microscope also at JSC. To prepare the samples by FIB milling, we used an FEI Quanta3D at JSC and the FEI Helios Nanolab 660 G3 in the University of Arizona's Kuiper-Arizona Laboratory for Astromaterials Analysis (K-ALFAA). TEM analysis of the microstructural and chemical characteristics of space weathering was performed using the JEOL 2500SE TEM at JSC, the aberration-corrected Hitachi HF5000 in K-ALFAA and the aberration-corrected, monochromated Thermo Themis Z at Purdue. Each TEM is equipped with a silicon drift detector for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a Gatan EELS for chemical analyses.

The complete noble gas data set, obtained at ETH Zurich with a custom-built sector-field mass spectrometer (all isotopes of He–Xe), is presented in a companion paper21. The cosmogenic 21Ne concentrations used here were derived by two-component decomposition of the measured Ne composition between the trapped end-member and cosmogenic Ne typical for material of CI chemical composition. Samples were transported to ETH from the NHM London in N2 atmosphere. They were subsequently handled in a N2-filled glove box, weighed using a Mettler Toledo UMX2 ultra-microbalance in hermetically sealed micro-weighing containers and loaded into an infra-red laser cell without any exposure to air. Three particles (OREX-800032-102, OREX-800032-103 and OREX-800032-104) were placed individually into the laser chamber and pumped down to 10−10 mbar. Each particle was melted completely in two steps using a Nd:YAG laser working at 1,064 nm wavelength. Gases released upon exposure to the infra-red laser were purified, cryogenically separated into He–Ne, Ar and Kr–Xe and analysed according to standard procedures41.

We received ~12 mg of an aggregate sample OREX-803014-0 of loose, unsorted material <1 mm in size for analysis of cosmogenic radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The sample was split into 5-mm-sized particles and a bulk sample, OREX-803047-0, of 9.85 mg. We dissolved the bulk sample along with Be and Cl carriers in a HF/HNO3 mixture. After dissolution, we separated Cl as AgCl for analysis of cosmogenic 36Cl by AMS. A small aliquot of the dissolved sample was split for chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The chemical composition of the sample (Supplementary Table 3) is consistent with that of a similar aggregate sample, OREX-803015-0, measured previously by others1. We then added 1.5 mg of Al carrier and separated Be and Al from the remaining solution for analysis of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al by AMS. The AMS measurements of the 10Be/Be, 26Al/Al and 36Cl/Cl ratios were performed at the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory42. The measured ratios were normalized to those of well-known AMS standards22,23,24. From the normalized ratios, the amount of Be, Al and Cl carrier, and the sample mass, we calculated the 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl concentrations of the sample. Concentrations (in atoms per gram) wre then converted to disintegrations per minute per kg and are reported in Supplementary Table 3. The measured concentrations of 10Be and 26Al are compared with production rates for 2π irradiation from model calculations25, adopting the bulk composition of Bennu aggregate samples1. If the measured concentrations represent saturation values during steady-state exposure conditions, they provide a direct measure of the irradiation depth of the sample.

We determined a SEP track exposure age from the track measurements in OREX-452001-0 by using the 1 AU track production rate calibration from ref. 18 and an r−1.7 model43 for the heliocentric decay of the SEP flux to account for the parts of Bennu's elliptical orbit beyond 1 AU, where r is the heliocentric radius. The measurements were made on a FIB section prepared using the JSC FIB and images obtained using the JEOL 2500SE STEM at JSC.

The microcrater exposure age for OREX-4520001-0 was determined by measuring the number of definite craters in the measured area (~40 craters in 0.6 mm2 of surface area) and using the crater production rates from ref. 19 of ~0.3 craters per square centimetre per year for 2-μm-diameter craters and 0.08 craters per square centimetre per year for 1-μm craters (for a 2π exposure), giving exposure ages ranging between ~20,000 and 85,000 years. However, this estimate represents the minimum crater density for this particle because we did not count micrometre-sized pits or other circular features without melt as microcraters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","At This Point, It's Impossible to Know What the Trump Phone Looks Like","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-phone-t1-samsung-spigen/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:08:24 GMT","

It's been over two months since Trump Mobile announced the T1 Phone was being “Made in the USA” designed “with American values in mind,” and it seems that anyone deciding to preorder it still can't be sure exactly what phone they might receive.

In posts on X and Instagram on Wednesday, the Trump Mobile account encouraged followers to place their preorder, promising them that “the wait is almost over.” This was joined by an image that looks nothing like the one of the T1 phone that's currently on the Trump Mobile website. It instead looks rather suspiciously like the rear side of a Samsung Galaxy S25.

Not just that, it actually appears to be the back of a third-party S25 phone case from Spigen that has been photoshopped gold and stamped with the T1 logo and trademark American flag. Still visible, just behind the flag, is the Spigen company logo.

Spigen's social media account commented under the post on X with an apt “??? bro what” before writing on its own page that it had a “lawsuit incoming.” WIRED has reached out to Spigen for comment.

This isn't the first time questions have been raised about what the T1 Phone will actually turn out to be. Not long after it was announced in June, the specs of the phone changed on the Trump Mobile website, and claims that it would be made in the USA were deleted.

Currently, the Trump Mobile website claims the T1 Phone will have a 6.2-inch punch-hole AMOLED screen with 120-Hz refresh rate, 50-MP main camera with a 16-MP selfie camera, and a 5,000-mAh battery. There's also 256 GB of internal storage, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and “AI face unlock.”

It's priced at $499, which includes a $100 deposit that apparently covers shipping and handling as well as your first month of Trump Mobile service. This suggests buyers will be required to use Trump Mobile with their T1 Phone, with no clear details before you authorize payment of any ongoing commitment to the service.

Users can, at least, wait to receive the phone before activating the service and can request a full refund “at any time prior to the shipment of the phone.”

As to what the phone will look like when (and if) that ever happens, it's impossible to know—and Trump Mobile seems as unsure as the rest of us. All of which isn't helping to curb suspicions that, right now, the T1 Phone—initially pegged to arrive in August—probably doesn't exist in any shape or form.

Microsoft and protesters offered sharply conflicting accounts of a demonstration that led to 20 arrests on the company's Redmond campus Wednesday, with organizers alleging police brutality, and the company saying the vast majority of those arrested were not employees.

“We want to be clear that the destructive and aggressive protest that took place on our campus on August 20 does not represent our workforce,” the company said in a statement Thursday afternoon. 

At a press conference Thursday, members of the group No Azure for Apartheid described what they called “unnecessary and unjustifiable violence” by police. 

The dueling statements followed two days of escalating protests over Microsoft's technology contracts with Israel. The group is demanding the company cut all ties with Israel over its alleged use of Microsoft technology against Palestinians in Gaza. 

After disbanding on Tuesday, demonstrators returned Wednesday to again take over a portion of the plaza at Microsoft's East Campus. They poured red paint on a company sign to symbolize blood, and blocked a bridge, leading to arrests on charges including trespassing, malicious mischief, and resisting arrest. 

Microsoft has pledged to continue upholding human rights standards in its tech contracts. Last week, the company announced a review of a recent report by the Guardian and others that its Azure cloud platform is used in the surveillance of Palestinians. 

In its statement Thursday, the company said the 20 people arrested in the Wednesday protest included one current employee, and three former employees. (The total increased from initial reports of 18 arrests.) 

“Almost all of those arrested [Wednesday], including some carrying fake company ID cards, have never worked at Microsoft,” the company said. 

The statement added, “While we support employees' rights to political expression, our employees know that our campuses are places for business and demonstrations on our private property are not permitted.”

No Azure for Apartheid held a press conference Thursday evening at a public transit station near the Microsoft campus, calling again on the company to cut ties with Israel.

Hossam Nasr, an organizer of the group and a former Microsoft employee who was among those arrested, said he was “violently tackled” and suffered a shoulder injury when a driver slammed on the brakes after he was placed in a police vehicle without a seatbelt. 

Another protester at the press conference said he was shot at point-blank range in the back with pepper balls. Near the scene of the protest Wednesday afternoon, GeekWire reporters saw the protester with large welts on his back after his arrest.

Jill Green, public information officer for the Redmond Police Department, said via email that the police haven't received any claims from protesters.

The police said in a post on X on Wednesday that no injuries were reported. 

An initial version of that post on Wednesday by the Redmond Police included a photograph of four officers arresting a protester on the ground. That post was removed and the photo was not included when an updated post was published later. 

Microsoft released surveillance video that shows protesters taking over the space in front of the Microsoft sign on their bikes; attempting to corral a police officer inside a portable fence; confronting a DJ who was there for a local farmers' market for employees; and ultimately causing the market to be shut down.

Apple is falling behind in the race to transform Siri into an AI assistant that's as powerful as its competitors. As consumers grow more impatient, Apple is considering using another company's tech instead of developing its own.

Apple is now exploring a partnership with Google, its most direct competitor in the smartphone business, according to Bloomberg editor and Apple insider Mark Gurman.

The company previously approached OpenAI and Anthropic for similar discussions about using their technology to power Siri, and reportedly, Google has begun training a model that could run on Apple's servers.

Apple is not expected to make a decision about whether to bring on a partner for the Siri revamp for another several weeks.

Y Combinator has filed an amicus brief in the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, arguing that the App Store has stifled startup innovation.

We've reached out to legal reps for YC and Apple for comment. 

The brief comes during the years-long legal dispute. Epic Games first filed an antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker in 2020 in protest of Apple taking a 30% fee for every purchase made in the App Store, as well as in-game purchases. Epic claimed in its suit that Apple unlawfully banned developers from telling customers about payment alternatives to the App Store. 

A judge ordered Apple to end its anti-steering policy, but instead, the company implemented a link program that allowed developers to link to alternative payment methods, with the app store taking a 27% fee. 

In another complaint, Epic accused Apple of violating the court injunction against anti-steering, and in April, the judge agreed, resulting in an order for Apple to stop imposing restrictions on alternative payment solutions and collecting payment from such methods. 

Apple is appealing that ruling, and that's why Y Combinator, a backer of Epic Games, has filed this amicus brief in support of Epic Games. Y Combinator is asking the court to deny Apple's appeal. 

“Y Combinator — and the larger venture capital community — have long been hesitant to back app-based businesses that were poor investments due to the Apple Tax,” Y Combinator wrote in its filing. “A 30% revenue share can easily be the difference between a company that can afford to scale, hire new employees, and reinvest in its product, and one that is perpetually struggling to stay afloat.” 

With the current ruling — that Apple must allow developers to transparently offer alternative payment options — the startup investor wrote: “For the first time in nearly two decades, Y Combinator can seriously consider investing in innovative businesses that would have been impossible in the past because of the ‘Apple Tax',” the filing continued. The Apple Tax refers to the fees Apple took from App Store purchases. 

It went on to say that the Apple Tax was a “profound and often insurmountable barrier to entry that stifles competition and innovation at its source” and that the court should deny Apple's appeal and allow the anti-steering rule to stand. The next argument is set to take place on October 21.

Sustainability-focused fintech Aspiration was flying high a few years ago, attracting famous investors including Orlando Bloom, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Robert Downey Jr. Now, its co-founder will plead guilty to helping perpetuate a $248 million fraud scheme, according to U.S. attorneys.

Joseph Sanberg, who was arrested in March, has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud, felony counts that could land him in prison for up to 20 years each.

“This so-called ‘anti-poverty' activist has admitted to being nothing more than a self-serving fraudster, by seeking to enrich himself by defrauding lenders and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars,” Acting United States Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement yesterday.

Sanberg is accused of disguising the source of payments used to inflate Aspiration's revenue figures. He obtained letters of intent from companies interested in using the startup's tree planting services. Those letters committed the companies to tens of thousands of dollars per month in revenue, according to the U.S. Attorney's office of the Central District of California.

But the payments to Aspiration instead came from legal entities controlled by Sanberg, falsely inflating the startup's revenue. 

Sanberg also allegedly fabricated a letter from Aspiration's audit committee that said the startup had $250 million in cash and equivalents available. In reality, Aspiration had less than $1 million in cash.

Using that fabricated letter and the false revenue statements, Sanberg is accused of obtaining $145 million in loans by pledging his own shares of Aspiration's stock. He also allegedly worked with one of Aspiration's board members, Ibrahim AlHusseini, to inflate AlHusseini's assets by tens of millions of dollars in an effort to obtain those loans. Aspiration defaulted on the loans twice.

Ultimately, victims of the fraud suffered more than $248 million in losses, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

“Sanberg continued to solicit investors to invest in Aspiration securities into 2025,” the U.S. attorney's office said. He is expected to file a formal plea in the coming weeks.

James Zou used virtual AI ‘scientists' to find novel covid-19 treatments. Now, he's having AI review and present all of the research at a controversial new conference.

In October, a new academic conference will debut that's unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology. 

The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind's AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own. 

That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers. 

Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government's AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.” 

Last month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Agents4Science will look like: “The AI should be the first author and do most of the work. Humans can be advisors.”

As a PhD student at Harvard in the early 2010s, Zou was so interested in AI's potential for science that he took a year off from his computing research to work in a genomics lab, in a field that has greatly benefited from technology to map entire genomes. His time in so-called wet labs taught him how difficult it can be to work with experts in other fields. “They often have different languages,” he says. 

Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. “They've read so broadly,” Zou says, that they can translate and generalize ideas across science very well. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.”

At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial. 

The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Here's how they will work.

Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Pak, who shares Zou's interest in using AI for science, agreed to make the Virtual Lab with him. 

Pak would help set the topic, but both he and Zou wanted to see what approaches the Virtual Lab could come up with on its own. As a first project, they decided to focus on designing therapies for new covid-19 strains. With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal. 

Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.”

Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Zou was shocked, though, at the reason. He claims the models landed on nanobodies after making the connection that these smaller molecules would be well-suited to the limited computational resources the models were given. “It actually turned out to be a good decision, because the agents were able to design these nanobodies efficiently,” he says. 

The nanobodies the models designed were genuinely new advances in science, and most were able to bind to the original covid-19 variant, according to the study. But Pak and Zou both admit that the main contribution of their article is really the Virtual Lab as a tool. Yi Shi, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work but made some of the underlying nanobodies the Virtual Lab modified, agrees. He says he loves the Virtual Lab demonstration and that “the major novelty is the automation.” 

Nature accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it. 

When he was submitting his paper, Zou was dismayed to see that he couldn't properly credit AI for its role in the research. Most conferences and journals don't allow AI to be listed as coauthors on papers, and many explicitly prohibit researchers from using AI to write papers or reviews. Nature, for instance, cites uncertainties over accountability, copyright, and inaccuracies among its reasons for banning the practice. “I think that's limiting,” says Zou. “These kinds of policies are essentially incentivizing researchers to either hide or minimize their usage of AI.”

Zou wanted to flip the script by creating the Agents4Science conference, which requires the primary author on all submissions to be an AI. Other bots then will attempt to evaluate the work and determine its scientific merits. But people won't be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers. 

Zou isn't sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.”

While Zou says the response to the conference has been positive, some scientists are less than impressed.

“How do you get leaps of insight?""

Lisa Messeri, an anthropologist of science at Yale University, has loads of questions about AI's ability to review science: “How do you get leaps of insight? And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer's desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers.

Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another Nature article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou's nanobodies paper. 

“I'm the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I'm not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.” 

And they're both skeptical of the value of using AI to do science if automation prevents human scientists from building up the expertise they need to oversee the bots. Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science. 

“We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett. 

But Zou sees his conference as exactly the kind of experiment that could help push the field forward. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there's a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there's really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they've got.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","The case against humans in space","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/22/1121428/case-against-space-travel-book-reviews/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Three books push back on a rising tide of optimism about space settlements.

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bitter rivals in the commercial space race, but they agree on one thing: Settling space is an existential imperative. Space is the place. The final frontier. It is our human destiny to transcend our home world and expand our civilization to extraterrestrial vistas.

This belief has been mainstream for decades, but its rise has been positively meteoric in this new gilded age of astropreneurs. Expanding humanity beyond Earth is both our birthright and our duty to the future, they insist. Failing to do so would consign our species to certain extinction—either by our own hand, perhaps through nuclear war or climate change, or in some cosmic disaster, like a massive asteroid impact.

But as visions of giant orbital stations and Martian cities dance in our heads, a case against human space colonization has found its footing in a number of recent books. The argument grows from many grounds: Doubts about the practical feasibility of off-Earth communities. Concerns about the exorbitant costs, including who would bear them and who would profit. Realism about the harsh environment of space and the enormous tax it would exact on the human body. Suspicion of the underlying ideologies and mythologies that animate the race to settle space.

And, more bluntly, a recognition that “space sucks” and a lot of people have “underestimated the scale of suckitude,” as Kelly and Zach Weinersmith put it in their book A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?, which was released in paperback earlier this year.

The Weinersmiths, a husband-wife team, spent years thinking it through—in delightfully pragmatic detail. A City on Mars provides ground truth for our lofty celestial dreams by gaming out the medical, technical, legal, ethical, and existential consequences of space settlements. 

Much to the authors' own dismay, the result is a grotesquery of possible outcomes including (but not limited to) Martian eugenics, interplanetary war, and—­memorably—“space cannibalism.” 

The Weinersmiths puncture the gauzy fantasy of space cities by asking pretty basic questions, like how to populate them. Astronauts experience all kinds of medical challenges in space, such as radiation exposure and bone loss, which would increase risks to both parents and babies. Nobody wants their pregnant “glow” to be a by-product of cosmic radiation.

If we're going to live on Mars we'll need a way to grow food in its arid dirt. Researchers think they know a way.

Trying to bring forth babies in space “is going to be tricky business, not just in terms of science, but from the perspective of scientific ethics,” they write. “Adults can consent to being in experiments. Babies can't.”

You don't even have to contemplate going to Mars to make some version of this case. In Ground Control: An Argument for the End of Human Space Exploration, Savannah Mandel chronicles how past and present generations have regarded human spaceflight as an affront to vulnerable children right here on Earth.

“Hungry Kids Can't Eat Moon Rocks,” read signs at a protest outside Kennedy Space Center on the eve of the Apollo 11 launch in July 1969. Gil Scott-Heron's 1970 poem “Whitey on the Moon” rose to become the de facto anthem of this movement, which insists, to this day, that until humans get our earthly house in order, we have no business building new ones in outer space.

Ground Control, part memoir and part manifesto, channels this lament: How can we justify the enormous cost of sending people beyond our planet when there is so much suffering here at home? 

Advocates for human space exploration reject the zero-sum framing and point to the many downstream benefits of human spaceflight. Space exploration has catalyzed inventions from the CAT scan to baby formula. There is also inherent value in our shared adventure of learning about the vast cosmos.

Those upsides are real, but they are not remotely well distributed. Mandel predicts that the commercial space sector in its current form will only exacerbate inequalities on Earth, as profits from space ventures flow into the coffers of the already obscenely rich. 

In her book, Mandel, a space anthropologist and scholar at Virginia Tech, describes a personal transformation from spacey dreamer to grounded critic. It began during fieldwork at Spaceport America, a commercial launch facility in New Mexico, where she began to see cracks in the dazzling future imagined by space billionaires. As her career took her from street protests in London to extravagant space industry banquets in Washington, DC, she writes, “crystal clear glasses” replaced “the rose-colored ones.”

Mandel remains enchanted by space but is skeptical that humans are the optimal trailblazers. Robots, rovers, probes, and other artificial space ambassadors could do the job for a fraction of the price and without risk to life, limb, and other corporeal vulnerabilities.  

“A decentralization of self needs to occur,” she writes. “A dissolution of anthropocentrism, so to speak. And a recognition that future space explorers may not be man, even if man moves through them.” 

In other words, giant leaps for mankind no longer necessitate a man's small steps; the wheels of a rover or the rotors of a copter offer a much better bang for our buck than boots on the ground.

In contrast to the Weinersmiths, Mandel devotes little attention to the physical dangers and limitations that space imposes on humans. She is more interested in a kind of psychic sickness that drives the impulse to abandon our planet and rush into new territories.

Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a scholar of religion at Wesleyan University, presents a thorough diagnosis of this exact pathology in her 2022 book Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race, which came out in paperback last year. It all begins, appropriately enough, with the book of Genesis, where God creates Earth for the dominion of man. Over the years, this biblical brain worm has offered divine justification for the brutal colonization and environmental exploitation of our planet. Now it serves as the religious rocket fuel propelling humans into the next frontier, Rubenstein argues.

“The intensifying ‘NewSpace race' is as much a mythological project as it is a political, economic, or scientific one,” she writes. “It's a mythology, in fact, that holds all these other efforts together, giving them an aura of duty, grandeur, and benevolence.”

Rubenstein makes a forceful case that malignant outgrowths of Christian ideas scaffold the dreams of space settlements championed by Musk, Bezos, and like-minded enthusiasts—even if these same people might never describe themselves as religious. If Earth is man's dominion, space is the next logical step. Earth is just a temporary staging ground for a greater destiny; we will find our deliverance in the heavens.   

“Fuck Earth,” Elon Musk said in 2014. “Who cares about Earth? If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system.”

Jeff Bezos, for one, claims to care about Earth; that's among his best arguments for why humans should move beyond it. If heavy industries and large civilian populations cast off into the orbital expanse, our home world can be, in his words, “zoned residential and light industry,” allowing it to recover from anthropogenic pressures. 

Bezos also believes that space settlements are essential for the betterment of humanity, in part on the grounds that they will uncork our population growth. He envisions an orbital archipelago of stations, sprawled across the solar system, that could support a collective population of a trillion people. “That's a thousand Mozarts. A thousand Einsteins,” Bezos has mused. “What a cool civilization that would be.”

It does sound cool. But it's an easy layup for Rubenstein: This “numbers game” approach would also produce a thousand Hitlers and Stalins, she writes. 

And that is the real crux of the argument against pushing hard torapidly expand human civilization into space: We will still be humans when we get there. We won't escape our vices and frailties by leaving Earth—in fact, we may exacerbate them. 

While all three books push back on the existential argument for space settlements, the Weinersmiths take the rebuttal one step further by proposing that space colonization might actually increase the risk of self-annihilation rather than neutralizing it.

We're making more data than ever. What can—and should—we save for future generations? And will they be able to understand it?

“Going to space will not end war because war isn't caused by anything that space travel is apt to change, even in the most optimistic scenarios,” they write. “Humanity going to space en masse probably won't reduce the likelihood of war, but we should consider that it might increase the chance of war being horrific.” 

The pair imagine rival space nations exchanging asteroid fire or poisoning whole biospheres. Proponents of space settlements often point to the fate of the dinosaurs as motivational grist, but what if a doomsday asteroid were deliberately flung between human cultures as a weapon? It may sound outlandish, but it's no more speculative than a floating civilization with a thousand Mozarts. It follows the same logic of extrapolating our human future in space from our behavior on Earth in the past.

So should we just sit around and wait for our inevitable extinction? The three books have more or less the same response: What's the rush? It is far more likely that humanity will be wiped out by our own activity in the near term than by any kind of cosmic threat. Worrying about the expansion of the sun in billions of years, as Musk has openly done, is frankly hysterical. 

In the meantime, we have some growing up to do. Mandel and Rubenstein both argue that any worthy human future in space must adopt a decolonizing approach that emphasizes caretaking and stewardship of this planet and its inhabitants before we set off for others. They draw inspiration from science fiction, popular culture, and Indigenous knowledge, among other sources, to sketch out these alternative visions of an off-Earth future. 

Mandel sees hope for this future in post-scarcity political theories. She cites various attempts to anticipate the needs of future generations—ideas found in the work of the social theorist Aaron Benanav, or in the values expressed by the Green New Deal, or in the fictional Ministry for the Future imagined by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 2020 novel of the same name. Whatever you think of the controversial 2025 book Abundance, by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, it is also appealing to the same demand for a post-scarcity road map.  

To that end, Mandel envisions “the creation of a governing body that would require that techno-scientific plans, especially those with a global reach, take into consideration multigenerational impacts and multigenerational voices.”  

For Rubenstein, religion is the poison, but it may also offer the cure. She sees potential in a revival of pantheism, which is the belief that all the contents of the universe—from rocks to humans to galaxies—are divine and perhaps alive on some level. She hasn't fully converted herself to this movement, let alone become an evangelist, but she says it's a spiritual direction that could be an effective counterweight to dominionist views of the universe.

“It doesn't matter whether … any sort of pantheism is ‘true,'” she writes. “What matters is the way any given mythology prompts us to interact with the world we're a part of—the world each of our actions helps to make and unmake. And frankly, some mythologies prompt us to act better than others.”

All these authors ultimately conclude that it would be great if humans lived in space—someday, if and when we've matured. But the three books all express concerns about efforts by commercial space companies, with the help of the US government, to bypass established space laws and norms—concerns that have been thoroughly validated in 2025.  

The combustible relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has raised eyebrows about cronyism—and retribution—between governments and space companies. Space is rapidly becoming weaponized. And recent events have reminded us of the immense challenges of human spaceflight. SpaceX's next-­generation Starship vehicle has suffered catastrophic failures in several test flights, while Boeing's Starliner capsule experienced malfunctions that kept two astronauts on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. Even space tourism is developing a bad rap: In April, a star-studded all-woman crew on a Blue Origin suborbital flight was met with widespread backlash as a symbol of out-of-touch wealth and privilege.

It is at this point that we must loop back to the issue of “suckitude,” which Mandel also channels in her book through the killer opening of M.T. Anderson's novel Feed: “We went to the moon to have fun, but the moon turned out to completely suck.”

The dreams of space settlements put forward by Musk and Bezos are insanely fun. The reality may well suck. But it's doubtful that any degree of suckitude will slow down the commercial space race, and the authors do at times seem to be yelling into the cosmic void. 

Still, the books challenge space enthusiasts of all stripes to imagine new ways of relating to space that aren't so tactile and exploitative. Along those lines, Rubenstein shares a compelling anecdote in Astrotopia about an anthropologist who lived with an Inuit community in the early 1970s. When she told them about the Apollo moon landings, her hosts burst out in laughter. 

“We didn't know this was the first time you white people had been to the moon,” they said. “Our shamans go all the time … The issue is not whether we go to visit our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Elon Musk's New Software Company Is the Opposite of Microsoft","https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-new-software-company-microsoft-macrohard-2000646847","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:16:00 GMT","

Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest gooner, has a new software company. And in typical Musk fashion, he's given it a name that only a teenager stuck in a 54-year-old's body would truly appreciate.

The name is Macrohard, a play off the name Microsoft, and Musk knows it's an immature joke about penises. But that kind of humor has never stopped him from raising billions of dollars before.

“Join @xAI and help build a purely AI software company called Macrohard,” the billionaire tweeted Friday. “It's a tongue-in-cheek name, but the project is very real! In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI.”

It's unclear what Musk means by insisting that Microsoft doesn't “themselves manufacture any physical hardware.” Microsoft has products like Surface and Xbox, which are designed by the tech company. Microsoft oversees the manufacturing through various partners.

It's also a bit odd to insist that any software company could be entirely simulated “with AI.” One person replying to Musk's tweet asked the obvious question: “Does this mean all software-only companies – including xAI – are at risk of being fully disrupted?” 

The theory seems to be that with the rise of AI, you can code anything you like, no matter how complicated, and just produce software essentially for free. And even if that were possible (it's not, given the fact that AI still needs a human babysitter to debug), it seems like it would run into some major intellectual property issues.

xAI filed a trademark application for Macrohard on Aug. 1, according to online records held by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Musk first teased the name of his company in a tweet on July 13.

“We are creating a multi-agent AI software company @xAI, where @Grok spawns hundreds of specialized coding and image/video generation/understanding agents all working together and then emulates humans interacting with the software in virtual machines until the result is excellent,” Musk tweeted.

“This is a macro challenge and a hard problem with stiff competition! Can you guess the name of this company?” Musk continued, ending with a laughing emoji.

That tweet caused people online to guess correctly that it would be called Macrohard, perhaps because it's been such a long-running joke in the software community. People speculated that it would be something related to gaming or vibe coding, which seems like a pretty solid bet, though we're still waiting on details.

The trademark application mentions video games, but also seems to be trying to stake a claim in pretty broad fields, including “legal analysis, strategic planning, and professional advisory applications.”

xAI didn't immediately respond to questions emailed on Friday. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back.

As if New York's taxi drivers didn't get squeezed enough by the Ubers and Lyfts of the world, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced on Friday that the New York Department of Transportation has granted Google's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Waymo, a permit to test its self-driving cars in the city. It'll be the first fully self-driving car to operate within the city.

Waymo will roll out eight vehicles in New York City starting in September, and they will operate in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, with the possibility of expanding to other boroughs in the future, according to CNBC. While the cars will operate autonomously, New York state will require Waymo to keep a driver behind the wheel at all times in case intervention is needed. Back when Waymo applied for the permit in June of this year, it said it would lobby to change the law, but the company can probably just slip into a chip bag to get Adams to sign off on that and save itself the lobbying effort.

“We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward,” Adams said in a press release. “New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century.” Last year, Adams signed off on a program that would allow autonomous vehicle testing in New York as a part of an effort to bring companies like Waymo into the city.

This isn't the first time autonomous vehicle operators have tried to worm their way into the Big Apple. In fact, Waymo first asked for permission to put wheels down in the concrete jungle back in 2021, when it brought vehicles to the city. That visit consisted mostly of manual driving, and the company used the trips to gather data about driving in icy and snowy conditions and operating in a densely populated area. Four years later, they'll finally get to see if they learned enough to operate in NYC without issue.

New York City has been something of a white whale for Waymo, which is already operating in several major markets. The company runs its ride-hailing service in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, claiming to complete more than 250,000 rides per week. Waymo plans to expand to Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. next year and will add more than 2,000 cars to its fleet. Getting into New York would be a coup for Waymo, but more importantly, it could give us a modern version of the famous “I'm walkin' here!” moment from Midnight Cowboy.

AM5 and subsequent X870 and B850 motherboards have been a good generation for ASRock boards. From its fair pricing to boards packed with features like its flagship X870E Taichi, there's a lot to like. We recently covered the B850 Steel Legend and walked away from there feeling positive overall as well. Sliding one level down the company's product stack is the B850 Livemixer ($189.99).

The brightly colored B650-based Livemixer is long gone, replaced by a more mature black and silver look. Still focused on content creators, it offers a wide range of USB connectivity “...for streaming devices and multiple other auxiliary devices.”

ASRock packs 14 USB ports on the rear IO, offering more than some boards costing twice as much. Realtek chips manage the audio (last-gen flagship ALC1220) and networking duties (2.5 GbE and integrated Wi-Fi 7). While the power delivery isn't the most robust we've seen, you can still drop a Ryzen 9 9950X (or X3D) in it and get every MHz out of your CPU. The reserved appearance still offers some bling with an RGB strip under the extended M.2 heatsink across the bottom.

The Livemixer performed adequately in most tests, demonstrating competence in both gaming and other functions. Similar to the Steel Legend, the Livemixer encountered issues with our Kingston memory kit. We had to substitute it with a different DDR5-6000 kit, which, while having the same speed, featured slightly looser (slower) timings. However, this difference would generally be imperceptible without a direct benchmark comparison. Overall, the motherboard is more than capable of any typical use case, offering room for additional tweaking if desired.

Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our Best Motherboards list. But before we look at test results and discuss the details, check out the specifications below, provided by ASRock.

You receive the bare essentials in the box: two SATA cables, a Wi-Fi antenna, and a thermistor cable. This minimal accessory package is standard for motherboards in this price range.

The B850 Livemixer features an 8-layer black PCB. Large silver heatsinks with a wavy-line pattern cover the VRMs, chipset, and all M.2 sockets, aesthetically integrating with the PCB. The sole RGB element, located under the extended bottom M.2 heatsink, is sufficiently bright, giving this budget-friendly motherboard an appealing and non-obtrusive appearance sure to blend in with most build themes.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



Starting in the upper left corner, we get a better look at the reflective and matte-finished VRM heatsink, featuring Livemixer branding. Between the two oversized heatsinks are an 8-pin (required) and a 4-pin EPS connector to power the processor. Nothing special here.

To the right of the socket are four unreinforced DRAM slots, with locking mechanisms on both sides. Like the Steel Legend, ASRock lists support for up to 256GB of RAM with two sticks running at speeds of up to DDR5-8000+, which is very fast for this cost-conscious chipset. Again, we experienced some issues with our Kingston DDR5-6000 kit and this BIOS, but our other, faster test kit, DDR5-7200, ran without any problems. Our best advice is to ensure your memory is on the QVL list for the best chance of compatibility.

Above the DRAM slots are the first three (of five) 4-pin fan/pump headers. Like the Steel Legend, it's the CPU_FAN1/2 and the AIO pump. All headers work with DC- or PWM-controlled fans. The CPU_FAN1 header outputs up to 1A/12W, while the remainder outputs up to 3A/36W. CPU_FAN2, CHA_FAN1-3, and the AIO_PUMP header auto-detect whether they are connected to 3- or 4-pin devices.

Turning attention down the right edge, we first run into the Post Status Checker (PSC) LEDs, which light up during POST and remain lit if an issue occurs. Next are two 3-pin ARGB headers, followed by the 24-pin ATX connector to power the board. Last up here are the front panel 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) and 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C (20 Gbps) headers, adding to the total on the rear.



Power delivery is the same as that of the B850 Steel Legend, consisting of 17 phases, with 14 dedicated to Vcore. Power heads from the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to the Richtek RT3678BE controller (for Vcore, there's another for the SOC/MISC). From there, it's on to the 80A Vishay SiC659 Dr. MOS VRMs. While not the most robust, it's still sufficient for a flagship-class processor, with cooling being the limiting factor.



At the bottom of the board, starting from the left, we can easily see the last-generation flagship Realtek ALC1220 audio chip. Flanking it are three dedicated audio capacitors and the audio separation line. It's not the latest and greatest audio solution, but for the price, it's a solid option. If it's not good enough, there are enough PCIe slots to add a PCIe-based sound card.

Speaking of PCIe, the Livemixer offers three full-length slots, with the top slot reinforced for added stability. The top is the primary slot for graphics, connecting through the CPU, and supports up to PCIe 5.0 x16. The bottom two slots are connected via the chipset and operate at PCIe 4.0 x4 (M.2 supports RAID 0/1/10). The bottom slot, PCIe_3, does share lanes with an M.2 socket (M.2_3), so it's one or the other.

Just above the PCIe slot is the large M.2 heatsink, featuring a DIY-friendly one-push latching mechanism. The socket supports up to PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) and accommodates devices up to 80mm in length. The bottom two slots also support up to 80mm modules, but are the ‘slower' PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps) speeds. Again, M.2_3 shares bandwidth with PCIE_3, so be aware if you need to use that bottom PCIe slot and a third M.2.

Past the chipset and along the right edge is another 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 connector, and below that, four SATA ports (support RAID 0/1).

Across the bottom are several useful headers. From left to right, you get:



The rearIO is laid out logically and labeled clearly, which makes things easy (if you can see behind your chassis). On the left is the HDMI video output for integrated graphics, and next to that are the standard Wi-Fi 7 antenna connections. A small BIOS Flashback button is next, followed by two stacks of four USB ports. On the left are four USB 2.0 ports, with two additional ports located on top. The USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) Lightning Gaming ports (on their own controller, free from other USB traffic) at the bottom, indicted by the orange ports. Next to these are the two 10 Gbps Type-C ports and another 5 Gbps Type-A port, both in light blue. Last but not least is the Realtek 2.5 GbE and audio stack, featuring two 3.5mm (mic in/line out) ports and an SPDIF port.

This could be the reason why Noctua has never made a flagship graphics card (yet).

The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is one of the most overbuilt RTX 50 series graphics cards on the market, featuring three NF-A12x25 G2 fans installed above a massive heatsink boasting 11 heatpipes. Such a design would logically have been perfect for an RTX 5090 model, and according to Kitguru, Noctua thinks so as well. However, it turns out Nvidia is the bottleneck preventing an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition from existing.

KitGuru talked with Noctua's Jakob Dellinger, who divulged that Nvidia does not have enough GB202 chip production ""at the moment"" to build an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card. This problem is likely why Noctua has never built an xx90-series RTX graphics card so far. The only graphics cards it has built with Asus are cards based on the RTX 5080, RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4080, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070.



However, Dellinger did discuss what an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition could look like if events ever change. Noctua would allegedly focus on changing the heatsink design to be more optimized for the RTX 5090, potentially using a vapor chamber design similar to the Asus ROG Astral. The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition model's 11 heatpipes could also potentially be switched to 8mm heatpipes entirely for this theoretical RTX 5090 version. By comparison, the RTX 5080 model comes with four 6mm heatpipes and seven 8mm heatpipes.

Nvidia's difficulty producing GB202 dies is something it has been struggling with since Blackwell debuted, thanks to the RTX 5090's insane market demand since its release earlier this year. Even to this day, RTX 5090 AIB partner cards are regularly priced hundreds of dollars above MSRP. This problem has been compounded by Nvidia releasing more GB202-powered GPUs recently, including the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell workstation and server edition graphics cards.

It's a real shame we probably won't see an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card for the foreseeable future. Noctua and its partnership with Asus have produced some of the most overbuilt air-cooled Nvidia graphics cards ever created, with cooling performance that can compete with AIO and water-block cooled GPUs. The RTX 5090's sky-high 575W TDP makes it the perfect candidate for Noctua to put its cooling experience to good use.

The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is the latest GPU to come out of Noctua's partnership with Asus, featuring a first-ever triple-fan cooler design for a Noctua GPU cooling solution. As a result, combined with the aforementioned NF-A12x25 G2 fans, Noctua's RTX 5080 variant allegedly produces some of the most competitive cooling and acoustical performance behavior out of any RTX 5080 to date. Noctua's own testing claims the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition produces 1.7C lower VRAM, 6.2C lower GPU, and 14.5C lower dB(A) temperatures and noise compared to the Asus RTX 5080 ROG Astral.

Cooling performance is so good on the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition, that Noctua benchmarked its card at just 500RPM, achieving 74.6C GPU temperatures, which is more than acceptable temperatures for modern Nvidia GPUs. By contrast, the Asus ROG Astral model is barely able to keep GPU temps under 90C at the same RPM.

If Noctua gets around to making an RTX 5090 version with the same cooler design, it could very well be the best air-cooled RTX 5090 on the market.

You can never have enough ports.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I primarily use my desktop when working from home. And I have am Anker dock at the office so I can plug my laptop into my 4K monitor and peripherals with just one cable. But I also use my laptop at home at my standing desk, where it's also handy to have a dock so I can plug into my TV and any peripherals I might be testing. That's where something like Baseus' Joystar 9-in-1 docking station could come in handy. It doesn't have all the ports or the built-in power of a more traditional, more expensive docking station. But at $39 at Amazon, it has all the ports and functionality I need, and then some.

This 10 Gbps USB-C hub / dock supports two HDMI monitors (or one at 4K and 120 Hz), PD power passthrough for charging your laptop, plus Ethernet and SD and microSD card slots. It would make a great minimal or secondary dock for laptop users who only have USB-C ports.

The Baseus dock is also compact, making it easier to transport than a larger dock. And the inclusion of an Ethernet port makes it dead-simple to get on your home or corporate network without having to deal with Wi-Fi if you don't need or don't want to. The main limitation with this hub is that it only has a single USB-C port. For those who need more, the company also sells a 10-in-1 hub that's also on sale for $47 at Amazon.

Dina  Cheney

 August 22, 2025  

During her residency in emergency medicine, Archana Shrestha, MD, MS, would fall asleep at stoplights on the drive home after night shifts.

“It happened a few times,” she recalled. “It was scary; I didn't feel safe driving.” To power through night shifts, Shrestha snuck in 2-hour naps beforehand.

And maybe you've heard something like this from a senior physician: “If you see a chair, sit in it. If you see a bed, sleep in it. If you see food, eat it. That's how you survive residency.”

Elsa Alaswad, MD, now a fourth-year neurology resident at the George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, learned that “rule” from her cardiologist father. She trained herself to sleep when she had the chance. “It was untenable,” she said. “I wanted to quit so many times.”

Segmenting sleep was just one of several habits that Shrestha, Alaswad, and many physicians have internalized for decades. From stress eating to repressing emotions, Shrestha said she learned these behaviors by emulating senior residents, attendings, and peers. Transmitted implicitly, these values and habits are part of medicine's so-called “hidden curriculum.”

“It's ironic. You basically learn: Do no harm to the patient, but it's okay if you do harm to yourself,” Shrestha said.

“There's an understanding within medicine as old as the Hippocratic Oath that the patient comes first, and you come second,” explained Tania M. Jenkins, PhD, associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and author of Broken Promises: Why So Many Physicians are Sick and Tired.

Jenkins has interviewed hundreds of physicians about their work and heard the same refrain: “That translates to your own needs — drinking water, eating breakfast, getting enough sleep, or fresh air — being secondary to the patients' needs.”

The result is that young physicians ingrain unhealthy routines and, often, never give them up, even years into their careers. That is, unless they make a conscious shift in mindset. The first step is recognizing the unhealthy habits and behaviors frequently learned during medical training.

The second step — well…are you willing to do anything about it?

Ultimately, medical training comes down to one word: endurance. That means learning to ignore your bodily needs, said Stefanie Simmons, MD, FACEP, chief medical officer at the Dr Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation.

Shrestha agreed, “You need to tough it out; it doesn't matter what is happening to your body. Whatever it takes is what is required.”

Hydrating and urinating. “When a patient codes, you're not going to say, ‘I'm sorry, your intubation will have to wait 2 minutes while I pee,'” said Simmons, who once worked as an emergency medicine physician.

An unhealthy logic takes over: If I don't drink anything, I won't have to go. Unfortunately, as physicians know, urinating fewer than four times and consuming fewer than eight cups of water daily are risk factors for urinary tract infections, according to research. Plus, dehydration can impair cognitive performance, especially executive function and motor coordination.

Starvation or junk food. During her second year of residency, Alaswad would work from 6 AM to 6 PM. Many nights, she'd skip dinner and fall asleep, then leave for work the next morning without time to eat breakfast. “I trained myself not to need consistent meals,” she said. “I would be starving a lot of the time, and when I'd eat again, I'd be ravenous. I would lose a lot of weight and then regain it.”

During Shrestha's medical training, “there were always cupcakes for someone's birthday and doctors' lounges stocked with pastries and donuts,” she said. Finding nourishing fare during night shifts, when the hospital cafeteria is closed, was even more difficult. “Students sometimes grab food at 2 AM from the vending machines or raid the nurse's stations for ginger ale and soda crackers,” said Jenkins. “That's what's available.”

As any primary care doctor will tell you, a lack of nutrient-rich food can impair the immune system and lead to headaches, dizziness, irritability, and even fainting.

Working through illness. “During my first 2.5 years of residency, I would get sick almost every 3-4 weeks,” recalled Alaswad. “Night shifts were brutal for my health.” But she never took a day off. She didn't feel she could.

“Getting sick doesn't mean getting to be home recovering. It means getting to work while sick,” she said. “Because otherwise you're seen as the weak link who lets down their peers. It's hard to prioritize yourself when calling out sick means someone else must carry your load. There is simply no wiggle room.”

The obvious fix is a series of tricks designed to make healthy choices easier or automatic: an apple or a bag of nuts in a coat pocket, exercise snacks, carry a water bottle, duck in a bathroom anytime a 2-minute window opens. You've heard them all before: This is a healthy lifestyle via opportunism.

But in the end, even if you remedy the physical toll — and some do — what are you fixing?

Understand not just what you learned, but how you learned it. Gutting it out, pushing through, demanding more from your body, and then pulling it all off…that's an accomplishment. A lot of physicians value that accomplishment.

Working to eliminate this entire aspect of physician training requires a mindset shift, said Shrestha. And often that requires help. She spoke from personal experience. A few years ago, Shrestha began exercising and seeing a nutritionist to address her own weight gain. After improving her health, she became a certified wellness coach to help other doctors do the same. She founded the Mama Docs School and is also the chief wellness officer at Physician Wellness Solutions.

You are a physician, she said. What's really driving your self-neglect? Are you willing to seek the help you need?

Medical trainees absorb psychological habits as well, which are often rooted in the culture of physicians as stoic and self-sacrificing, said Jenkins. These can be even more damaging than bad physical habits because they can in themselves take a physical toll.

Isolation. Isolation can contribute to depression, according to research. But many trainees don't have time or energy to socialize. A common result is impaired personal relationships. “It's a cycle of social isolation,” said Alaswad. “You're isolated because of your work hours. And you're too tired to see friends on the weekends — instead, you just want to sleep.”

Many medical students even avoid study groups, said Christen C. Hairston, PhD, associate dean, Center for Holistic Student Success, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta. The reason: They don't want peers to witness them not always knowing the answers. So, they cram alone. Now that medical schools don't always require students to attend classes, this isolation has become more acceptable, she added. “Being alone on a laptop is part of the culture now. It's a lot easier to appear connected even if you're really suffering.”

Repressing emotions. Shrestha recalled feeling surprised when a med student once started crying after a patient's death. Then she took a step back. “I realized this med student was having a very normal human reaction to death. What was surprising was my surprise. I realized how much I had numbed myself. I'd gotten good at stuffing down emotions as a self-defense mechanism.”

Repressing emotions can feel necessary in medicine, especially during residency, said Simmons. But many doctors continue to hide even severe emotional distress. On licensing forms, applicants must disclose their personal experience with mental health struggles. If they admit such history, there's been a “profound lack of transparency” around the consequences, she added.

The result is medical trainees who are suffering but feel they cannot get help. If they do seek treatment for mental health issues, they sometimes pay out of pocket for sessions or see providers in different health systems, as Jenkins has observed during her research.

Not to mention, getting help can be logistically challenging. “Residents are constantly being evaluated,” said Hairston. “Everyone is watching you all the time, and you want to show up in the best possible way. You don't want to lose time in clinicals to go to a mental health appointment. Students get a half day for wellness sometimes, but that's for everything they must do, including laundry,” she added.

In an essay for Doximity, Shrestha described relearning how to respond to her needs appropriately. If she had a headache, she learned a glass of water might do the trick. If she felt stress, she acknowledged her emotions without reaching for a sweet treat to help blunt them.

To encourage her coaching clients today, she shares these messages with them:

“Doctoring is what you do. But it's not your entire identity. It's helpful to separate doctoring from all the other facets of yourself.

You must take care of yourself so you can have a long career and help more patients in the long run. If you don't take care of yourself, who will? Certainly not your employer.

We're not superheroes. We are smart, caring, hard-working humans, but humans nonetheless with real human needs for rest and recovery.

We take care of patients and advise them to take care of themselves. We should do the same thing for ourselves.”

Self-care doesn't need to be a zero-sum game, Shrestha emphasized. Doing no harm should extend to doctors too, not only patients. It just might take a bit of unlearning.

COMMENTARY

Nayiri  Guedikian, MD, MPH

DISCLOSURES August 22, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Choosing a specialty can be tough, but here are five steps to guide you. 

First, reflect on your clinical experiences. What rotations made you lose track of time or feel excited to go back the next day?

Second, assess your strengths. Are you hands-on and procedural, or more cerebral and diagnostic? 

Third, consider lifestyle factorslike call schedule, income potential, and how the specialty fits into your long-term goals. 

Fourth, get real-world insight. Talk to residents and attendings, ask honest questions, and try to shadow different specialties if you're unsure. 

Finally, trust your gut. If a field excites you and feels sustainable, that's worth listening to.

This isn't just about prestige or pressure; it's about where you will thrive for the long haul.

The association of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affected the disease prognosis, with nearly a 28-fold higher risk for cancer and a 13-fold higher risk for mortality seen among patients with IBD and PSC than among the general population.

""Close follow‐up to ensure early detection of both colonic and hepatic cancers seems necessary, particularly during adolescence and the transition to adulthood,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Marie‐Laura Godet, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Lille, Lille, France. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.

The sample size of the cohort was relatively small, thereby affecting the analysis of treatment exposure owing to a lack of statistical power.

This study was supported by the François Aupetit Association, Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique interrégional, and the Conseil Régional du Nord‐Pas‐de‐Calais (INSPIRED cohort). The registry involved in the study received financial support from the François Aupetit Association, Lille University Hospital, Amiens University Hospital, and Rouen University Hospital. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A standard-dose recombinant growth hormone therapy administered for 2 years demonstrated positive effects on both growth and nutritional status in prepubertal children with Silver-Russell syndrome, a condition characterized by severe growth retardation and feeding difficulties. Initiating treatment before the age of 4 years optimized height gains in these patients.

“The nutritional status is crucial for these children, especially during the early years of life, as there is a high risk of hypoglycemia; therefore, nutritional interventions, such as early oral feeding therapy, nutritional enrichment, and cyproheptadine for those who are severely undernourished is essential,” the authors of the study wrote.

“We show here that rGH [recombinant growth hormone] also plays a part in the nutritional intervention,” they added.

This study was led by Eloïse Giabicani and Raphaëlle Billette de Villemeur of the Hôpital Armand Trousseau in Paris, France. It was published online on August 19, 2025, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

A new Cochrane review casts doubt on the value of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists to relieve chronic noncancer pain.

While ketamine and other NMDA receptor agonists are often prescribed off-label to manage chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, nerve pain, and complex regional pain syndrome, researchers found little convincing evidence of a real benefit and identified an increased risk for side effects such as delusions, delirium, paranoia, nausea, and vomiting.

“Clinicians should know that there is currently no clear evidence supporting use of ketamine for chronic pain. Large-scale, definitive randomized trials are urgently needed to determine benefits, risks, and optimal dosing regimens,” first author Michael Ferraro BSc, BHSc, doctoral candidate at University of New South Wales Sydney and Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia, told Medscape Medical News.

“We want to be clear — we're not saying ketamine is ineffective, but there's a lot of uncertainty,” Ferraro added in a news release.

The review was published online on August 17 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

The review included 67 randomized controlled trials in more than 2300 adults with chronic noncancer, nonheadache pain for at least 3 months that evaluated intravenous (IV), oral, or topical ketamine (39 studies), oral memantine (10 studies), dextromethorphan (9 studies), oral amantadine (3 studies), or IV or oral magnesium (8 studies) vs placebo, usual care, or another medicine.

The researchers looked at the effects across various chronic pain conditions and dosing strategies.

They found no clear evidence that IV, oral, or topical ketamine reduced pain intensity in the intermediate term (48 hours to 1 week), short term (> 1 week to 3 months) or medium term (> 3 months to 6 months) compared with placebo comparators.

IV ketamine may increase the risk for psychotomimetic and other adverse events (risk ratio, 3.26). No studies reported total adverse events with oral ketamine and there was no clear evidence that topical ketamine increased risk for adverse events.

There was also no clear evidence that oral memantine or dextromethorphan, or oral or IV magnesium reduces pain intensity compared with placebo, with “uncertain” evidence regarding side effects.

Do any of the five NMDA receptor agonists have more evidence of support than others?

“Unfortunately not,” said Ferraro. “Although more studies evaluated intravenous ketamine infusions and oral memantine, small sample sizes and low-quality evidence precluded firm conclusions. As a potential benefit could not be excluded for these drugs, definitive research is urgently needed,” he noted.

The authors cautioned that the certainty of the evidence for all critical outcomes was “low to very low” and most results were downgraded for risk of bias, mainly due to deviations from the intended interventions, missing outcome data and measurement of the outcome.

Reached for comment, Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, neurologist and researcher in Miami cautioned that, the way he sees it, ketamine is not a “standalone cure.”

“Mechanistically, it promotes neuroplasticity, opening a window where the brain is more malleable. That window can be filled with structured, high-quality therapies like Pain Reprocessing Therapy,” said Lakhan, who was not involved in the review.

“In practice, ketamine works best not in isolation, but as part of an integrated program that helps patients relearn healthier patterns of perception, emotion, and pain processing. If we only study ketamine monotherapy, we may miss its true therapeutic potential,” Lakhan said.

“From a mechanistic standpoint, ketamine makes sense in chronic pain — modulating NMDA receptor hypersensitivity is one of the few levers we have. In my own clinical experience, patient selection is absolutely paramount, and some patients do very well,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“The challenge is that we lack pharmaceutical-grade, class 1 evidence: large, well-controlled phase 3 trials that can really establish efficacy and safety. A handful of efforts are now underway to address this, but until industry invests, the evidence will remain low quality and Cochrane's conclusion of uncertainty will persist. That is less a verdict on ketamine than an indictment of the research system,” Lakhan said.

The review had no commercial funding. Ferraro and Lakhan had no relevant disclosures.

The FDA has approved brensocatib tablets in 10-mg and 25-mg doses as once-daily treatment for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) in adults and children aged 12 years or older, according to a press release from manufacturer Insmed.

NCFB affects approximately 500,000 individuals in the US and millions globally, according to the press release. The condition is distinct from other respiratory infections, in that it involves widening of the airways rather than narrowing.

Exacerbations involving coughing, increased mucus, and shortness of breath are common and disruptive, but targeted treatments have been lacking, according to the company. Brensocatib, marketed as Brinsupri, is a first-in-class inhibitor of DPP-1, designed to prevent the activation of neutrophils that drive the chronic airway inflammation in patients with NCFB, according to the press release.

The approval was based on data from a phase 3 study known as ASPEN and a phase 2 study known as WILLOW. In the ASPEN study, patients with NCFB (1689 adults and 41 adolescents) randomized to 10 mg or 25 mg brensocatib daily had a 21.1% and 19.4% reduction in annual exacerbations, respectively, compared to placebo at 52 weeks. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second declined significantly in brensocatib patients compared to placebo patients, and significantly more brensocatib patients on either dose were exacerbation-free at 52 weeks.

The WILLOW study, a 24-week randomized controlled trial, established the drug's safety and efficacy based on time to first exacerbation. Brensocatib at both the 10-mg and 25-mg doses significantly extended the time to first exacerbation compared to placebo, and safety data showed no obvious relationships to treatment. Adverse events were mild to moderate in 66%, 88%, and 75% of the placebo, 10 mg, and 25 mg groups, respectively, and serious adverse events were similar across the groups. One death caused by progression of bronchiectasis was reported in a patient in the 25 mg brensocatib group.

The approval authorizes the first treatment that directly targets the root cause of NCFB exacerbations, said ASPEN investigator Doreen Addrizzo-Harris, MD, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York City, in the press release. “Based on the strength of the data and the impact we've seen in patients, I believe this could become the new standard in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis care,” she said.

Brensocatib is indicated for treatment of NCFB at doses of 10 mg or 25 mg once daily in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older, with no current contraindications, according to the prescribing information.

Brensocatib is now available through a specialty pharmacy network in the US. In addition, brensocatib applications have been accepted by the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and filing of an application in Japan is pending, according to the company, which expects commercial launches in these areas in 2026.

The ASPEN and WILLOW studies were funded by brensocatib manufacturer Insmed.

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C.

Trump made the announcement flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office.

The draw is the event at which all qualified teams learn their three group-stage opponents.

The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared to be the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively.

Trump will almost certainly have a role in the event, which is both procedural and a spectacle. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups.

The 2026 World Cup, which will be played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will kick off on June 11, but the draw is the first landmark occasion associated with the tournament.

“The Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said at Friday's news conference, “and we'll be involved.”

Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, had told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so.

Last time the men's World Cup took place in the U.S., 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark hosting the event which included performances from Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Carlos Cordeiro, an Infantino advisor and senior advisor to the White House's World Cup Task Force, were also present for the announcement.

The World Cup trophy stood on a desk in front of them, next to Trump. At one point, Infantino picked it up, handed it to Trump, and said: “This is for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course, you can (touch it) as well.”

Trump smiled, held the trophy, posed for photos, and asked: “Can I keep it?”

Trump later said he was “just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly. He's been very respectful of me and our country, but not so respectful of others.”

He then held up a picture of himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, one week after the two met in Alaska about Russia's war in Ukraine. (The meeting ended without a deal to end the war.)

Trump said that Putin, “I believe, will be coming (to the World Cup final, on July 19), depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not.”

Trump, after announcing the date and location of the draw, immediately pivoted to criticism of Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and promotion of his administration's moves to exert control over the nation's capital. He called D.C. a “crime-infested rat hole,” despite data showing that crime has declined in 2024 and 2025.

“Washington D.C. is a whole different place, and Gianni, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that too, actually,” Trump said. Infantino responded: “Oh yes.”

The Kennedy Center, which has been a D.C. institution since it opened in 1971, has been the subject of a Trump effort to remake the Center in his image. Trump said during Friday's announcement that it could be called the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

Infantino later joked that “everything will start here, in Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center — or the Trump Kennedy Center, we'll see how it will be called — on the 5th of September at noon sharp.”

Analysis by senior soccer writer Adam Crafton

For much of this year, FIFA has been engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with Las Vegas to repeat the draw from the last time the World Cup came to the U.S. in 1994.

The discussions were so advanced that suites were held back by authorities across different resorts in Vegas for the first week of December even until recent weeks, as FIFA continued its negotiations with various venues in Vegas, including the Grand Garden Arena. Vegas was the clear preference of many host city executives, who had their eyes on an opportunity to schmooze prospective sponsors in Sin City and make a big national impact with a major event in Vegas.

However, the spectre of D.C., which is not a World Cup host city, has always loomed in the background, as reported by The Athletic in April, because FIFA has always been determined to make it as easy as possible for Trump to be involved in the draw.

When it was the Club World Cup draw in Miami last year, following his re-election but before beginning his second term, Trump sent only a video message of support. This time, Infantino will want him to be front and center — just as he was when Premier League club Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in July.

A venue in D.C. makes that all the easier, and this is the bromance that shows no signs of letting up.

The draw determines the exact split of the 48 qualified nations into 12 groups of four for the first stage of the World Cup.

Before the draw, the 48 teams will be allocated evenly into four ‘pots', according to the most up-to-date FIFA rankings. Pot 1 will contain the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who qualify for the tournament automatically as host nations, and the next highest-ranked nine teams. That continues across Pot 2 and Pot 3, with Pot 4 containing the 12 lowest-ranked teams. Each group will contain one country from each pot.

It has already been confirmed that the first game of the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, meaning Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the U.S. will play the third match and is in Group D. Those games will be the only ones on June 12.

At the time of the draw, 42 of the 48 teams competing at the World Cup will be known. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.

The match schedule — complete with dates, kickoff times and game locations — is typically released soon after the draw. A sign behind Trump at the news conference stated the draw will begin at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT).

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump announced on Friday.

The draw will be held on December 5, Trump said, adding: ""Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.""

The draw will determine the group-stage matchups for the expanded 48-team field. Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Trump said the Kennedy Center ""will give it a phenomenal kickoff.""

The World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico, with games set across 16 stadiums between June 11 and July 19, 2026.

Before Friday's announcement, Las Vegas had been considered the front-runner to host the draw. However, Washington remained a strong contender, in part because it allowed Trump to be more directly involved.

The draw is more than just a procedural event—it's a high-profile production featuring speeches, performances and global media attention. Trump is expected to play a leading role during the ceremony.

Trump's involvement with FIFA has intensified in recent months. He attended the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where Chelsea lifted the championship trophy. At a separate White House event earlier this year, Trump held the new Club World Cup trophy, presented to him by Infantino.

During Friday's announcement, Trump turned to Infantino and asked whether he could also hold the World Cup trophy. Infantino obliged, handing it over with a grin and said ""only winners"" are allowed to hold it. Trump joked: ""Can I keep it?"" and said it would fit nicely in the Oval Office.

Concerns have been raised internationally about travel to the U.S. ahead of the tournament, particularly over visa delays, travel bans, and the potential for immigration raids during the games.

While discussing the World Cup and the U.S. role as host, Trump surprised the room by holding up a photo of himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I'm going to sign this for him,"" Trump said. ""That's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming [to the 2026 FIFA World Cup], depending on what happens."" The remark appeared to catch Infantino off guard.

The comment raised eyebrows, as Russia has been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. All Russian national and club teams remain barred from international play ""until further notice,"" under a joint decision by the FIFA Council and UEFA Executive Committee.

This wasn't the first time Trump voiced support for Russia in a World Cup context. During a May meeting of his administration's World Cup task force, seated alongside Infantino, Trump said he was unaware of Russia's current exclusion but suggested the war's end could open the door for a return.

""I didn't know that, is that right?"" Trump asked. ""You want to explain that?""

""That is right,"" Infantino replied. ""They are banned for the time being from playing, but we hope that something happens and peace will happen so that Russia can be readmitted.""

Trump responded: ""That's possible. Hey, could be a good incentive, right?""

FIFA President Gianni Infantino, during the press conference: ""As you [Trump] rightly say, with security, beautifying cities and the whole country, we want people to come, enjoy and have fun.""

Vice President JD Vance, during a May press conference: ""Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games.""

The event will mark the first time a FIFA World Cup draw is hosted in Washington. The last time the U.S. hosted a World Cup, in 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center and featured appearances by Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart. The entertainment lineup for this year's event has yet to be announced.

President Donald Trump says the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be at the Kennedy Center, defends his DC crime crackdown and more in Oval Office announcement.

President Donald Trump praised the administration's crackdown on crime in Washington, D.C., on Friday as he announced that the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5. 

The president was joined by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office for Friday's announcement. Trump, now the chairman of the Kennedy Center, confirmed that the draw for the group stage will take place at the performing arts venue.

""On Dec. 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center. Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet – maybe in a week or so,"" Trump said, drawing laughter from the group.

""But right here in Washington, D.C., it's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital."" 

Trump also took the opportunity to highlight his administration's federal takeover of D.C. in an effort to crack down on crime.

""By the way, in Washington, D.C., we have the lowest crime numbers they've had in years. Zero. It's a horrible thing to say, but I might as well say it, zero murders in the last week since we've done this. That's the first time in memory that that's happened. If you can believe it. How pathetic that is to have to even say it.""

TRUMP JOKES ABOUT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CALL SOCCER 'FOOTBALL' IN US, NAMES GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME

""It was unsafe. It was horrible,"" the president continued, ""And Mayor [Muriel] Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run.""

Trump quipped to Infantino that the city ""will be nice"" just in time for the draw, joking that the Italian sports figure ""could handle yourself"" regardless. 

""The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history, and the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time. We have it all set so that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences and everything else. And they'll be in a very safe capital. That will be nice. You don't have to worry about walking down the street, Johnny, okay? But you could handle yourself.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Trump announces the World Cup draw will be held at DC's Kennedy Center as he brings together two second-term priorities","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/sport/soccer-world-cup-draw-donald-trump","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:44:00 GMT","


            President Donald Trump announced Friday the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, combining the world's biggest soccer tournament with the cultural institution he has sought to overhaul.
    


            The decision to hold the opening event of the World Cup – during which FIFA will announce the groups and matchups for the opening stage of the quadrennial tournament – at the Kennedy Center combines two of Trump's second-term priorities. He has taken a special interest in the Kennedy Center, long a cultural icon in the nation's capital, and he's also regularly touted bringing the World Cup to the US.
    


            “It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital,” Trump said.
    


            Trump promised a safe atmosphere at the draw, discussing at length his federal takeover of Washington's police department and issuing threats to Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's rat population.
    


            Next year's tournament is expanding for the first time to 48 teams and will span across the US, Mexico and Canada. Eleven American cities will be hosting games, but Washington is not one of them – an unusual situation for a host nation's capital city during the World Cup. The draw will be the highlight of the tournament for an area of the country that is one of the hotbeds for soccer in the US.
    


            “The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history. And the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved,” Trump said.
    


            The president has been working to put his own stamp on the Kennedy Center since he returned to the Oval Office in January. Trump seized control of the institution's board earlier this year, telling reporters recently he would oversee a sweeping revamp of the center and its programming.
    


            At Trump's behest, congressional Republicans set aside $250 million in July for renovations to the center as part of their tax and spending bill. Those funds will go toward an expansive overhaul of the Kennedy Center, Trump said, arguing that it was badly in need of repairs when he took control of its operations.
    


            The Kennedy Center has served as an early focal point of Trump's attempts to assert his administration's power over DC, drawing an institution that had traditionally remained above the fray of partisan politics directly into the center of the nation's culture wars. Trump in February dismissed a slew of Democratic appointees from the center's board of trustees, replacing them with aides and allies that included chief of staff Susie Wiles and second lady Usha Vance. Trump was subsequently elected chairman, with longtime confidant Ric Grenell installed as the Kennedy Center's new president.
    


            His takeover of the Kennedy Center prompted sharp criticism from Democrats and angered artists connected to the center — including the producer of the hit musical “Hamilton,” who cancelled an upcoming run of the show that was supposed to go through 2026. A series of other prominent artists, including director Shonda Rhimes and musician Ben Folds, resigned from their positions at the center.
    


            Since then, Trump has taken a hands-on approach to overhauling programming and drawing up plans for renovating the complex. Asked about his involvement in picking the center's next honorees, Trump said he personally sifted through the candidates, rejecting some he felt were too “woke.”
    


            Trump joked on Friday that people may start referring to the performance arts center as the “Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


            “We're working on it. It's about a year project to make it. It'll be great. It'll be fantastic. You see the way this is looking, looks nice. I can't tell you how much that gold costs – a lot of money. There's nothing like gold, and there's nothing like solid gold,” Trump said.
    


            FIFA president Gianni Infantino accompanied Trump in the Oval Office for the announcement. Infantino and Trump have developed a close relationship as the tournament was awarded to the US, Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term and is now being planned and held during his second term in office.
    


            “This is this will be absolutely fantastic, the biggest event ever. And everything will start here in Washington, DC, at the Kennedy Center – or the Trump Kennedy Center,” Infantino said with a laugh.
    


            Infantino presented Trump with the first ticket to next year's final, noting that tickets for the tournament go on sale on September 10.

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C.

Trump made the announcement flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office.

The draw is the event at which all qualified teams learn their three group-stage opponents.

The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared to be the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively.

Trump will almost certainly have a role in the event, which is both procedural and a spectacle. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups.

The 2026 World Cup, which will be played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will kick off on June 11, but the draw is the first landmark occasion associated with the tournament.

“The Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said at Friday's news conference, “and we'll be involved.”

Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, had told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so.

Last time the men's World Cup took place in the U.S., 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark hosting the event which included performances from Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Carlos Cordeiro, an Infantino advisor and senior advisor to the White House's World Cup Task Force, were also present for the announcement.

The World Cup trophy stood on a desk in front of them, next to Trump. At one point, Infantino picked it up, handed it to Trump, and said: “This is for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course, you can (touch it) as well.”

Trump smiled, held the trophy, posed for photos, and asked: “Can I keep it?”

Trump later said he was “just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly. He's been very respectful of me and our country, but not so respectful of others.”

He then held up a picture of himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, one week after the two met in Alaska about Russia's war in Ukraine. (The meeting ended without a deal to end the war.)

Trump said that Putin, “I believe, will be coming (to the World Cup final, on July 19), depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not.”

Trump, after announcing the date and location of the draw, immediately pivoted to criticism of Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and promotion of his administration's moves to exert control over the nation's capital. He called D.C. a “crime-infested rat hole,” despite data showing that crime has declined in 2024 and 2025.

“Washington D.C. is a whole different place, and Gianni, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that too, actually,” Trump said. Infantino responded: “Oh yes.”

The Kennedy Center, which has been a D.C. institution since it opened in 1971, has been the subject of a Trump effort to remake the Center in his image. Trump said during Friday's announcement that it could be called the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

Infantino later joked that “everything will start here, in Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center — or the Trump Kennedy Center, we'll see how it will be called — on the 5th of September at noon sharp.”

Analysis by senior soccer writer Adam Crafton

For much of this year, FIFA has been engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with Las Vegas to repeat the draw from the last time the World Cup came to the U.S. in 1994.

The discussions were so advanced that suites were held back by authorities across different resorts in Vegas for the first week of December even until recent weeks, as FIFA continued its negotiations with various venues in Vegas, including the Grand Garden Arena. Vegas was the clear preference of many host city executives, who had their eyes on an opportunity to schmooze prospective sponsors in Sin City and make a big national impact with a major event in Vegas.

However, the spectre of D.C., which is not a World Cup host city, has always loomed in the background, as reported by The Athletic in April, because FIFA has always been determined to make it as easy as possible for Trump to be involved in the draw.

When it was the Club World Cup draw in Miami last year, following his re-election but before beginning his second term, Trump sent only a video message of support. This time, Infantino will want him to be front and center — just as he was when Premier League club Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in July.

A venue in D.C. makes that all the easier, and this is the bromance that shows no signs of letting up.

The draw determines the exact split of the 48 qualified nations into 12 groups of four for the first stage of the World Cup.

Before the draw, the 48 teams will be allocated evenly into four ‘pots', according to the most up-to-date FIFA rankings. Pot 1 will contain the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who qualify for the tournament automatically as host nations, and the next highest-ranked nine teams. That continues across Pot 2 and Pot 3, with Pot 4 containing the 12 lowest-ranked teams. Each group will contain one country from each pot.

It has already been confirmed that the first game of the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, meaning Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the U.S. will play the third match and is in Group D. Those games will be the only ones on June 12.

At the time of the draw, 42 of the 48 teams competing at the World Cup will be known. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.

The match schedule — complete with dates, kickoff times and game locations — is typically released soon after the draw. A sign behind Trump at the news conference stated the draw will begin at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT).

 The wait for a successful men's singles title defence at the US Open is up to 17 years, but Jannik Sinner will have every reason to believe he can snap it this fortnight in New York. 

 The top-seeded Italian enters Flushing Meadows this year with a 31-4 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and he is also on a 21-match winning streak at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments dating back to the start of the 2024 Australian Open.

 At his pre-tournament press conference Friday in New York, defending champion Sinner spoke assuredly when asked how he had recovered from the illness that caused him to retire from Monday's final against Carlos Alcaraz in Cincinnati. 

 “I'm firstly very happy to be back here. It's a great tournament. It's obviously the last Grand Slam we have for this season, so the motivations are very high,” said the Italian. “Physically I feel good. I have recovered mostly, not 100% yet, but we are aiming to be there in couple of days. So should be all fine for the tournament.” 



 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner was asked his thoughts on why defending the title has been so tough in recent years at the US Open, where the last man to win consecutive crowns was Roger Federer (the Swiss won five in a row from 2004 to 2008). The 24-year-old believes the challenge may lie in small contextual details that surround the event. 

 “We are heading towards end of the season, so some players, they are tired. Some players, they are feeling different. Many things can change,” said the 20-time tour-level titlist. “It's also the last big trophy of the year. I feel like here it changes a lot if you play night or if you play day. There are many, many small things at this Grand Slam makes a difference. 

 “For example, also obviously we are sleeping in the city, and it takes one hour to come [to Flushing Meadows}. Small things. But I feel if you don't handle them very well, then it's also very difficult to play the best possible tennis. Let's see. I always say that the future is unpredictable. So I don't know what's going to happen this time. But of course, it's a very, very difficult tournament to play.”

It's showtime for Shelton.

Having recently won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto and building a reputation as someone who produces his best at the majors, American World No. 6 Ben Shelton has laid the foundation for what could be an explosive campaign at his home Slam.

“This is the biggest tournament of the year for me. This is the one,” Shelton said Friday during his US Open pre-tournament media interview. “I put a lot of work into being in a good place when I got here. Feeling confident about my game. Feel really good and prepared going into this tournament.”

Just two years ago as a raw 20-year-old, the former University of Florida standout won over fans with an unlikely run to the semi-finals, barely a year after turning pro. It was apparent from the outset that the big stage of the 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium and rowdy New York fans were a perfect complement to his personality.

“I think I'm an entertainer at heart,” he said. “But I have kind of figured out what state I need to be in to be locked in but also having fun at the same time.

“I'm never going to be the guy who is able to robotically go about my business and not change expression or show any emotion. I think that I play better when I do show some emotion.”



In his young career, Shelton has reached the second week six times in 12 appearances at the majors. He is three for three in 2025 following a semi-final at the Australian Open, fourth round at Roland Garros and quarter-final at Wimbledon. 

Along with World No. 4 Taylor Fritz, No. 14 Tommy Paul and No. 15 Frances Tiafoe, Shelton is one of four Americans in the Top 20 of the PIF ATP Rankings, giving American fans hope that they will celebrate their first home-grown men's champion since Andy Roddick in 2003.

“I'd love to see it,” Shelton said. “I feel like there have been a lot of guys who have been close here. Foe is always on a different level when he plays here. Fritz was in the finals. I think Tommy always plays really well here, too.

“We've got a lot of guys... who can make deep runs here and play against the best players in the world. I think that it's a matter of time for us.”

With Fritz defending 1300 points from his run to last year's final to Shelton's 100 points for reaching the third round, the 2023 semi-finalist has the chance to become the top-ranked American with a deep run at Flushing Meadows.

Shelton is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin, about 1000 points inside the cut for the Nitto ATP Finals. A deep run in New York will go a long way to shoring up his debut appearance at the elite eight-man season finale in Turin from 9-16 November.

Shelton comes into the tournament with a 35-17 record on the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, on track to top his record 42-26 season in 2024. 

Shelton will play his opening match against a qualifier or lucky loser. He is seeded to meet Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor in the third round, Casper Ruud or Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round and Carlos Alcaraz or former finalist Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals.

The main draw for the 2025 men's singles tournament at the US Open has been announced, and some stars have been handed a much better path than others. 

Novak Djokovic's pursuit of a 25th major title at Flushing Meadows will begin with a favourable string of opening matchups, and the Serb can avoid the top two-ranked players until the semifinals. 

For defending champion Jannik Sinner, a potential fourth-round headache awaits in the form of Alexander Bublik, who is the only man to beat him this season outside of Carlos Alcaraz. 

Alcaraz's route to the final does not come without its difficulties either, as the Spaniard finds himself on a collision course with both Daniil Medvedev and Ben Shelton. 

As the full draw begins to take shape with the conclusion of qualifying, one former top 20 player has failed to reach the first round in New York. 

With the first week of the US Open quickly approaching, non-seeded players continue to battle it out for a place in the main draw. 

The dream is over, however, for former Wimbledon quarterfinalist Cristian Garin, who suffered defeat to 35-year-old Argentine Marco Trungelli in straight sets. 

Garin reached a career high of world number 17 in 2021, and earned his best result at a major in 2022, when he made the last eight at the All England Club. 

In SW19 that year, the Chilean secured a statement victory over now-world number eight Alex de Minaur in a thrilling five-setter.

His campaign came to an end after losing to eventual runner-up Nick Kyrgios, bowing out to the Australian in straight sets. 

In 2023, Garin recorded a first-round finish at the Australian Open, but shortly before Roland Garros, he announced he would pull out of the event due to a broken rib. 

The withdrawal from the French Open saw him fall outside the top 100, and although he had made the quarterfinals at Wimbledon the year before, he could not compete in the 2023 tournament through direct entry as his ranking was too low. 

He failed to qualify for the US Open later that season, and since then, Garin has only featured in the main draw of a Grand Slam four times. 

The 29-year-old went out in the first round of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2024 and suffered second-round exits again in Melbourne and London in 2025. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

For all you tennis-lovers out there, the final Grand Slam of the season — The U.S. Open — is finally here.

But will the weather make its own celebrity appearance?

Whether you're heading to New York City or watching from the comfort of your couch, here's how the weather could impact the U.S. Open.

Sunday-Monday

The week will kick off with a mix of clouds and sun during the day on Sunday before the threat of rain moves in.

Occasional rain showers and scattered storms are possible Sunday night, lasting into early Monday. This could potentially force the roofs to close over Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadiums for the evening matches.

By Monday night, skies should clear out — making for prime tennis weather once again.

Tuesday-Thursday

The scattered showers early in the week will usher in some slightly cooler temperatures. Evenings courtside could even give a refreshing taste of fall with low temperatures in the upper 50s and low 60s.

In terms of rain chances, in true tennis fashion, it will be 'love-all' — meaning no chance of rain through Thursday. Sunny skies will dominate the forecast with some clouds rolling in during the afternoon hours.

These forecasts reflect the weather during each day, not necessarily at night.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Maria Sharapova always found a way back, and now she's found her way to the Hall of Fame","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4345272/maria-sharapova-always-found-a-way-back-and-now-she-finds-her-way-to-the-hall-of-fame","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 12:48:01 GMT","

When Maria Sharapova and her father, Yuri, arrived in Florida in 1994 -- from the frigid outer reaches of Eastern Europe -- they only had a borrowed $700 and couldn't speak English.

Sharapova was seven years old.

A year earlier, at a tennis clinic, 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova had recommended professional training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida with coach Nick Bollettieri. Two years later, Sharapova was already so clearly talented that IMG underwrote her scholarship.

The gamble paid off. What began as a scholarship soon became one of the most recognizable careers in modern tennis.

On Saturday, the five-time major singles champion -- and one of only seven women in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam -- will be enshrined along with doubles champions Mike and Bob Bryan in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

It's a worthy honor, for Sharapova finished her career with 36 WTA Tour-level titles, more than $28 million in prize money and a record of 645-171 (.790). She first achieved the No. 1 ranking at the age of 18.

Breakthrough at Wimbledon

You could see her coming. 

Four years after landing at the IMG Academy, she was the winner of the 2000 Girls' 16 division at the Eddie Herr International Junior Tennis Championships -- at the age of 13. Two years later, she was a finalist at the Australian Open and Wimbledon junior tournaments.

Sharapova turned professional on the day of her 14th birthday.

In 2003, at the age of 16, she crashed the Top 50. After winning her first two career titles, the Japan Open and the Bell Challenge in Quebec City, she was named the Newcomer of the Year.

A year later, she kicked it into another gear, winning Wimbledon at the age of 17.

Sharapova loved the strawberries and cream, but most of all she enjoyed stunning two-time defending champion Serena Williams 6-1, 6-4 in the final. That win ended the numerous comparisons to countrywoman Anna Kournikova, a blazing talent who never quite panned out as a professional. Sharapova was the first player from her country to win Wimbledon and, overall, the third youngest ever.

Years later, she was asked for a favorite memory from her playing days.

“I'd say your first Grand Slam final is ultimately just the most memorable one,” Sharapova said. “In my career, it came at a very young age. I was 17 years old and it was in London, in Wimbledon, and the whole world was watching. I was playing against Serena Williams, and everything felt like I should have just been happy to be there, but I was so fearless.

“It's always the memory that comes to mind because I least expected it to come then,” she said. “And I was so tough. I went for it.”

Backing it up

Sharapova, at 6-foot-2, was a baseline banger with a big, well-directed serve. Her secret weapon, though, was an iron will and an unyielding work ethic.

In 2006, at the still-precocious age of 19, she won her second major, the 2006 US Open. This time she beat another of the sport's icons, Justine Henin, 6-4, 6-4 in the final.

After Henin found the net on match point, Sharapova fell to her knees, held her head in her hands and ran to embrace her father.

“I figured I lost the last four times against Justine so I thought I would just flip everything [180] degrees and do the total opposite,” Sharapova said at the time.

Henin, who reached all four major finals that year, gave Sharapova her due.

“She's been a real fighter tonight and she deserves it,” Henin said.

Two years later, at the 2008 Australian Open, Sharapova added a third different Grand Slam to her eclectic resume.





 Getty Images
                        

After missing chunks of time the previous year with a serious shoulder injury, Sharapova -- in terms of ranking -- was actually the underdog against Ana Ivanovic after getting through, among others, Lindsay Davenport, Henin and Jelena Jankovic.

In sweltering conditions, Sharapova emerged as a 7-5, 6-3 winner in 91 minutes.

“If someone had told me in the middle of last year I'd be standing here with the big one,” Sharapova said, “I'd have said, ‘Forget it.'”

An unexpected turn

For Sharapova, the right shoulder was always the fulcrum of her success. And, because of the stress involved, her greatest vulnerability.

A few months after winning in Melbourne, Sharapova developed shoulder pain and eventually two tears were discovered in her rotator cuff. When rehabilitation didn't work, she elected to undergo surgery.

“I had my doubts,” Sharapova said. “I would always ask around who had such problems with their shoulder and who recovered from it, and who had surgery, and who got back to the top. And I didn't get many answers back, which was a little frightening, because you always want to look toward the positives.”

After sitting out for 10 months, she returned to tennis in the spring of 2009. Adapting to that adversity, Sharapova redesigned her serve -- reinvented herself, actually -- to take pressure off the joint most responsible for her success.

And while that leave of absence took her outside the Top 100, she returned to the No. 1 spot after an unexpected title run at Roland Garros in 2012.

On the red clay that had once left her completely befuddled, Sharapova beat Sara Errani in the 2012 final and, with it, joined the short list of women to win all four majors.

“It's the most incredible feeling,” Sharapova said after her win in Paris. “I'm so happy. I've worked so hard for this -- it took a lot to get to this stage and even more to win it.

“There are so many tough days where you feel like giving up, but you don't. It's been such a journey to get to this stage again.”

And then she did it again two years later, defeating Simona Halep in a three-set match that ran more than three hours.

“This is the toughest Grand Slam final I've ever played,” Sharapova told reporters. “If somebody had told me ... at some stage in my career, that I'd have more Roland Garros titles than any other Grand Slam, I'd probably go get drunk -- or tell them to get drunk. One or the other.”

Legends Roundtable: 7 drivers with 14 World Titles talk Formula 1

25 years of team radio

With the summer shutdown coming to an end, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-grid...

The summer shutdown has offered the perfect opportunity for the drivers to reset and recover after a relentless first half of the season. With the next chapter kicking off in Zandvoort from August 29-31, the time away from the paddock has been invaluable.

For drivers, quality downtime is just as important as training and competition, as it provides a chance to switch off and recharge, so they can return at their very best.

Each driver has chosen their own way to maximise their break; some sought thrills away from the circuit, many embraced family time or total disconnection, whilst some kept their fitness ticking over through training. Here's how the grid made the most of their summer before the racing resumes.

After months of hard racing on land, it's no surprise some drivers chose to escape the roads altogether. A number of them chose to swap tarmac for crisp blue seas, spending their downtime unwinding aboard luxury yachts.

George Russell, Charles Leclerc, and Alex Albon all enjoyed time with their partners on the water, combining relaxation and quality moments with loved ones.

Esteban Ocon also spent quality time with family and friends out on the sea, while Kimi Antonelli went on a getaway to Greek waters with close friends and family, making the most of the downtime.

Back on dry land though, Oscar Piastri chose to celebrate the break in true Aussie style by firing up the BBQ with his McLaren team ahead of an exciting news reveal...

Some drivers (and their furry friends) found themselves in the spotlight this summer for reasons beyond the circuit. Piastri delivered exciting news for his home fans: from 2026, he'll have his very own grandstand at the Australian Grand Prix.

Meanwhile, Pierre Gasly kept fans guessing with a cryptic post hinting at the launch of a potential new brand, sparking plenty of intrigue online.

Lewis Hamilton and his companion Roscoe took centre stage in a special feature for Vogue... or “Dogue”, as Roscoe's fans know it.

Even during the break – whether in the water or not – the drivers know how to make waves!

Of course, for F1 drivers, the adrenaline of racing is something they crave. So, it's unsurprising that several drivers found ways to chase the feeling elsewhere over the summer. Max Verstappen took to the water on an eFoil, whilst gaming fan Lando Norris immersed himself in the virtual world by heading to the Esports World Cup.

Some drivers couldn't wait to get back in the driver's seat though. Gabriel Bortoleto got a taste of high-octane fun when taking his partner for a spin in a stock car, while Ollie Bearman helped his GB3-driving brother Thomas celebrate his birthday. How you ask? Behind the wheel of course!

The 2025 grid clearly knows how to keep their pulses racing even when away from the F1 circuit.

Even during the summer shutdown, keeping active was high on the agenda. Championship leader Piastri showed off his skipping skills when in Monaco – perhaps part of his winning formula as he looks to carry his momentum in the title fight.

With so many drivers spending their time relaxing on the water, what about under it? When not on his bike, Carlos Sainz proved there is nothing he cannot do, as he athletically dived down 11 metres underwater amid family time aboard his boat.

Leclerc hit the padel courts, whilst team mate Hamilton hit the weights. And of course, is it even a summer break if we don't see a driver on the fairway? Gasly was out on the golf course, and mixing up his training with a balance of running, cycling, and gym sessions.

George Russell made sure not to skip a workout either, fitting in training sessions while out on a yacht and upon his return from holiday.

The grid proved once again that downtime doesn't mean switching off completely – it's about finding the right balance.

For a number of drivers, the perfect way to relax was to hit 'Do Not Disturb' and leave their phones behind entirely. No posts, no paddock chatter – instead it was time to switch off (the mind and the phone), recharge, and enjoy the quiet before the season roars back into action in Zandvoort at the end of the month.

After joining Kick Sauber as their new Team Principal in April, Jonathan Wheatley is preparing to lead the squad into their transition to Audi in 2026.

Jonathan Wheatley has insisted that he will turn any pressure that comes with acting as Team Principal for the Audi works outfit into “something positive”, with the Kick Sauber squad preparing for the transition in 2026.

Wheatley took up his position at the Hinwil-based outfit back in April, having previously served as Sporting Director at Red Bull, a team he was employed by for 19 years. Prior to that, the Briton started out as a mechanic for Benetton back in 1991.

Since joining Kick Sauber, Wheatley has spoken of feeling “re-energised” by his new role while he has also enjoyed some on-track highlights, most notably Nico Hulkenberg's long-awaited maiden podium at the British Grand Prix.

As he prepares to lead the team into their next era as Audi in 2026, the new team boss was asked ahead of F1's summer break if he is anticipating a greater level of responsibility than he has been used to when the German manufacturer arrives into the sport.

“I don't think so – I think you take these things in your stride,” Wheatley explained to Sky Sports F1. “I feel very comfortable in the role I'm doing at the moment, it's an amazing opportunity. I'm so excited about the project.

“Just saying Audi Formula 1 project sounds like the most incredible thing to be part of. Pressure is part of the job – it's been part of my job for the last 30 years. I turn it into something positive.

“It doesn't really sit with me, I manage to turn it and use it as positive energy and that's what I'm hoping to do next year.”

When pushed on whether he has taken anything from his time at Red Bull into his new environment, Wheatley detailed how he has approached taking on his current role.

“You have to absorb yourself in the team, you have to immerse yourself in it,” he responded.

“You have to listen to what everyone has got to say, you have to try and work out why decisions have been made, why processes are the way they are, and you can very rarely just move a complete procedure from one team across to another – it just doesn't work.

“But what you can bring is a philosophy, you can bring a cultural philosophy as well. There's low-hanging fruit, there's been some of that to be had.

“It's a very young team and I think people forget that. A lot of people here only started in January or February so we're knitting together the team.

“We're on a journey, we're very much in the early part of that journey and we have to understand that we're starting from a humble beginning. I'm excited about it – we're making steps, we're gaining momentum, and of course this business is all about momentum.”

Kick Sauber currently sit in seventh place of the Teams' Championship on 51 points, just one point behind Aston Martin in sixth.

He also starred on 'I'm Dickens, He's Fenster' and 'Camp Runamuck' and wrote for nearly four dozen shows, from 'Hey, Landlord' and 'M*A*S*H' to 'MacGyver' and 'Full House.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	David Ketchum, the goofy comic actor and prolific TV writer best known for squeezing into such stuffy spaces as vending machines, trash cans and airport lockers as Agent 13 on the fabled sitcom Get Smart, has died. He was 97. 


	Ketchum died Aug. 10, his family announced.




	Ketchum also played carpenter Mel Warshaw opposite John Astin and Marty Ingalls on the 1962-63 ABC sitcom I'm Dickens, He's Fenster and starred as Counselor Spiffy on the 1965-66 NBC comedy Camp Runamuck.

	In notable guest-star turns, he portrayed salesmen selling real estate and petroleum on The Andy Griffith Show in 1967 and was a member of a divorce club that offers great vacation rates on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970.

	











	Said fellow Camp Runamuck actor Dave Madden in Robert Pegg's 2015 book, Comical Co-Stars of Television: “Dave was a naturally funny guy. He more or less idolized Danny Kaye in Danny's earlier days, and so an awful lot of the physical things he did in terms of takes and things were very Danny Kaye-ish in their style.”


	Ketchum got his first writing credit on a 1967 episode of Garry Marshall‘s Hey, Landlord, and he would write for nearly four dozen shows — other Marshall series like Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley, plus Here's Lucy, M*A*S*H, Wonder Woman, MacGyver, Highway to Heaven and Full House among them — through 1990.


	The Illinois native joined NBC's Get Smart, created by Buck Henry and Mel Brooks, in time for its second season (1966-67). In one of the spy spoof's great running gags, his resentful Agent 13 would pop up in mailboxes, grandfather clocks, fire hydrants, planters, etc. while on uncomfortable undercover assignments.

	











	It all started when his sweaty head emerges from under the cover of a barbershop steam cabinet for towels. Asked by Agent 86 (Don Adams) what he's learned about the latest KAOS criminal plot, he replies, “I've grown to hate the spy business, that's what I've learned.”


	Soon, producers started saying, “Wait a minute, wouldn't it be funny if he was in a sofa?” he recalled in a 2002 interview. “So there would be a party, everybody would stand up, and I'd be inside the sofa with a girl and a drink. Stuff like that was tricky. And then they put me in a locker at the airport, and then an ice machine, and it kept getting more and more ridiculous.


	“The hardest part for me was when they put Agent 13 in a washing machine. I'm 6-foot-2, so I can't fit easily into cramped places, and a washing machine is about as cramped as it gets. They also built an eight-foot tube I got into so I could be spun around in the front. You try remembering your lines while you're spinning around with water and soap squirting in your face!”


	In what sounds like a joke, Ketchum was born in an elevator in Quincy, Illinois, on Feb. 4, 1928. He majored in electrical engineering at UCLA.


	“I had already done a lot of performing,” he said in a 1965 interview, “but I couldn't quite resign myself to being in show business. I figured eventually I'd have to work for a living — so I took engineering.”

	











	He was supposed to have a part in the John Wayne-starring Flying Leathernecks (1951) but was activated for service in the National Guard, so he had to pass on that. However, he got into a public information unit that offered him the chance to host a nightly radio show in San Francisco.


	He did another radio program in San Diego for seven years, kicking things off there by asking Bob Hope and Doris Day if they'd come on, and they said yes.


	Ketchum appeared in a funny bit about Hollywood on The Steve Allen Plymouth Show in 1957 and was a regular on The New Steve Allen Show in 1961. He also worked alongside Ken Berry, Jackie Joseph and Jo Anne Worley in the Billy Barnes Revue, which made it to Broadway in '61.


	A year later, he released a comedy album called The Long-Playing Tongue of Dave Ketchum, and in its review, Billboard called him “a new comic with a number of funny ideas. What's more, he knows how to put 'em across.”


	He caught a big break being cast on I'm Dickens, He's Fenster, which was created by future Get Smart producer Leonard Stern. On the spy show, he replaced Victor French, who had played Agent 44 in a similar tough-luck role during its first season.


	Here he is with Adams in a toothpaste commercial.


	Ketchum returned as Agent 13 in the 1989 telefilm Get Smart, Again and on an episode of a rebooted Get Smart in 1995.


	His TV acting résumé also included stints on The Real McCoys, The Munsters, Good Morning World, Gomer Pyle, Mod Squad, That Girl, Green Acres, The Odd Couple, Happy Days and Alice.

	











	He also appeared in films including Good Neighbor Sam (1964), The Grasshopper (1970), Bless the Beasts & Children (1971), Your Three Minutes Are Up (1973), The North Avenue Irregulars (1979), Love at First Bite (1979), The Main Event (1979), Young Doctors in Love (1982) and The Other Sister (1999).


	And he played Murph in a series of commercials for Union 76 gas stations in the 1970s and '80s.


	Ketchum had a lot of time on his hands waiting for his scenes on Get Smart to be set up, so he used that to work on his writing. He penned the 1967 episode “Classification: Dead” and multiple installments of other shows like Captain Nice, Love, American Style, The Rookies, Switch, The Love Boat and Sledge Hammer!


	He also co-wrote a claustrophobic ABC telefilm, 1974's The Elevator.


	Survivors include his wife, Louise, whom he married in August 1957; their daughters, Nicole and Wendy; three grandchildren; and a great-grandson.


	“He leaves behind a legacy of laughter, warmth and timeless television moments — reminding us all that sometimes, the simplest surprise (like someone perched in a mailbox) can yield the biggest smile,” his family said.


	A private family gathering will honor his life. In lieu of flowers, his family invites “friends and fans to enjoy one of his classic performances on Get Smart or Camp Runamuck in remembrance of his quick wit, gentle heart and cinematic spirit.”


	Asked in that 2002 interview why Get Smart still resonates after so many years, Ketchum said it was because it was “also satire, and nobody does satire on television today.

	











	“Get Smart did stuff like an episode where they had KAOS take over an entire television network to announce to the world that they had better capitulate, that it was all over, and KAOS had won. But no one saw that broadcast, because it ran opposite a first-run movie on another network!”

The prequel series won't go ahead, but a writers room for season two of ‘Dexter: Resurrection' is set to open soon.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The Dexter prequel Original Sin won't get a second season, despite an announcement to the contrary earlier this year. The Dexter franchise is still a going concern, however, with a writers room for season two of Dexter: Resurrection set to begin work in the near future.


	Showtime announced a second season renewal for Dexter: Original Sin in April, six weeks after the 1991-set series following a young Dexter Morgan (played by Patrick Gibson) ended its 10-episode first season. Sources say, however, that the show had been on hiatus since production wrapped, and no start date for production on a second season was ever scheduled.

	With a change in leadership at Paramount following the Skydance merger, the Dexter franchise moved from Showtime/MTV Entertainment into the reborn Paramount Television Studios under Matt Thunell. The decision then came to focus on Resurrection, which continues the present-day Dexter's (Michael C. Hall) story from the original 2006-13 series and the 2021-22 follow-up Dexter: New Blood.


	A writers room for a potential second season of Resurrection is set to open soon, with the intent being a renewal, sources tell THR — though season two has yet to be formally greenlit. The series has been performing well for Paramount+ Premium and the linear Showtime channel. The premiere episode drew 3.1 million viewers over its opening weekend and grew to 4.4 million after seven days; Paramount says the Aug. 15 episode drew the show's largest audience of the season. 

	











	Sources also note that Paramount remains invested in the Dexter franchise but is directing its efforts toward the unfolding story of Resurrection rather than filling in more of the character's life in a continued prequel series.


Variety first reported the news.

The ""Industry Baby"" rapper was also placed under arrest for battery on a police officer, according to the LAPD.

Pride Editor


	Singer-rapper Lil Nas X was hospitalized on Thursday morning (Aug. 21) for a potential drug overdose in Los Angeles after allegedly charging at police officers in an early morning encounter.


	A statement given to Billboard by the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that officers responded to reports of a naked man roaming Ventura Boulevard around 5:50 a.m. PT. Police said “the suspect charged at officers and was taken into custody” upon their arrival on the scene. He was then handcuffed and taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for a “possible overdose,” while also being placed under arrest for battery on a police officer.

	











	According to information posted to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's inmate information center, Montero Hill — Lil Nas X's birth name — was arrested at 6:10 a.m. in North Hollywood, and booked for a misdemeanor offense at the Los Angeles Police Department Valley Jail in Van Nuys at 11:22 a.m. A spokersperson for the LAPD tells Billboard that the artist “cannot be cited out,” and that “it is mandatory that he appears before a judge before he is released.” The rapper's bail hearing will take place on Monday (Aug. 25).




			Trending on Billboard		







Billboard has reached out to representatives for Lil Nas X.


TMZ on Thursday published a video showing Lil Nas X roaming the streets of Los Angeles, dressed in a pair of white underwear and white cowboy boots and telling the person filming, “Don't be late to the party tonight,” while mimicking a series of dance moves.


	The incident comes just one day after Lil Nas X cleared his Instagram page, updated his name on the app to “Queen Madeline” and began repopulating it with a series of odd posts, showing himself posing in a series of costumes. The singer also shared teasers for songs, featuring collaborators such as Young Kio and Lil Jon.


	In April, Lil Nas revealed that he had been hospitalized due to partial paralysis on the right side of his face. The “Old Town Road” star never shared a diagnosis for his condition, but he did update fans a few days after his initial post, revealing that he was recovering and could now move most of his face.

Political Editor


Donald Trump made a much-teased announcement from the Oval Office on Friday, saying the FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center on December 5.


	But he also signaled his desire to put his own name on the arts institution.


	“On December 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center,” Trump said. “Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,' but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.”


	Since taking office, Trump has taken an intense interest in the Kennedy Center, making his fourth visit to the institution on Friday to survey contractor plans to renovate the complex. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump's signature piece of legislation, included $257 million to upgrade the facility.

	











	Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) last month introduced legislation to rename the Kennedy Center as the Donald J. Trump Center for the Performing Arts. But a 1983 law specifies that “no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The World Cup announcement will take place two days before the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with this year's recipients George Strait, KISS, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford. Trump has said that he had a “98%” influence on the selection of the recipients. Just weeks after taking office, Trump ousted Joe Biden's appointees to the Kennedy Center board, ensuring that he would be named its chairman, a first for a POTUS.


	At the Oval Office announcement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino brought the gold World Cup trophy, telling Trump, “Presidents of countries and winners can touch it, because this is for winners only. And since you are a winner, you can, as well touch it.” 


	“Can I keep it?” Trump said, noting that it would fit in with his Oval Office gilt-laden decor. Infantino said that they do have to give it to the next winner.

disgusting/get him impeached.  The oval office looks like Saudi Arabia.  He's a Power Hungry dictator that must be removed from office

Epstein. Epstein. Epstein.
He can try anything he wants but he won't get away from everyone wanting to see the files.
He knows he's gonna come out on the wrong side of history so why not take his whole family with him?

He is the worst of us

This will be a haven for D and F-list celebrities and poorly selling musical groups. They may reconfigure the building to accommodate monster truck shows and wrestling matches. The possibilities are limitless. And that is frightening.

To be fair, he's an idiot.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Amid monster viewership for Happy Gilmore 2, which last month scored Netflix‘s biggest U.S. opening weekend ever, Adam Sandler's Happy Madison is teaming with Shawn Levy's 21 Laps to develop a feature adaptation of Evan S. Porter‘s debut novel Dad Camp, with Kevin Jakubowski on board to pen the script.


	Published by Dutton in June 2024, Dad Camp follows John, a devoted father who finds his once-close bond with daughter Avery unraveling as she enters her preteen years. Desperate to reconnect before she starts middle school, he signs them up for a week-long father-daughter retreat at a rundown summer camp, where he's forced to confront both his fears of losing her and the evolving nature of their relationship.

	











	Shawn Levy and Dan Levine will produce on behalf of 21 Laps, with Emily Feher and Max Gains overseeing the project for the company.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Working as a blogger in between writing his novels, Dad Camp author Porter wrote for Upworthy from 2015-2018, and spent three years as Lead Copywriter and Director of Content at Atlanta-based digital marketing agency Nebo before that.


	Jakubowski is a Humanitas Prize-nominated screenwriter whose credits include HBO Max's 8-Bit Christmas, which was nominated for a PGA Award for Outstanding Producer of Televised or Streamed Motion Pictures, and Assassination of a High School President, which was an official selection of the Sundance and SXSW Film Festivals. In television, he created Legendary Dudas for Nickelodeon and Play by Play for Verizon/Roku Channel. His original scripts Old Time Hockey and Full Fenski Christmas are currently set up at Skydance. 


	The scribe began his career as a PA on South Park and is repped by Kaplan/Perrone, Verve, and attorney Adam Cooper.


	Recently setting Tripper Clancy to write a Night at the Museum reimagining for 20th Century Studios on which we had the scoop, 21 Laps launches the fifth and final season of global hit Stranger Things later this year. Recently, the company has also announced feature adaptations of Grady Hendrix's short story “The Blanks” and Freida McFadden's psychological thriller Never Lie for Netflix, as well as a Madonna limited series for the same streamer.

	











	As a director, Levy's next project is Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling, Mia Goth and Matt Smith, which he's also producing. Pic goes into production this fall and will be released theatrically on May 28, 2027.


	Marking Sandler's first Netflix film based on one of his legacy characters, Happy Gilmore 2 amassed 46.7 million views in its first three days on the platform, beginning July 25, and has now garnered over 109 million views. This puts the film on track to break into Netflix's Top 10 Most Popular Movies, as the last of 10 entries on that list, the Millie Bobby Brown starrer Damsel from 2024, has just 138 million views.

Bart Simpson has been in fourth grade for 36 years; Stewie Griffin's been in diapers since 1999; and more than a decade down the line, Tina Belcher still hasn't gotten her first period. When you stop to think about it, isn't that…kinda weird? We've come to accept the eternal child as a convention of the animated family sitcom. It's a big part of the reason why these shows can churn out hundreds of episodes: An actual child actor is eventually going to sprout zits and body hair, but Huey Freeman will be 10 years old forever.

That trope gets turned on its head in Netflix's Long Story Short, the latest show from BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg. The series is all about how people change over the years—and the fact that, no matter how far you run, the past always returns to haunt the present. It plays out like a novel, leaping backward and forward across decades. And just as BoJack did when it premiered in 2014, Long Story Short feels like something entirely new.

The show centers on the Schwoopers, a sprawling Jewish family from Northern California. Though this is a true ensemble piece, the closest we have to a main character is eldest son Avi (voiced by Ben Feldman), an elder millennial struggling with complicated feelings about his Jewish identity and his place in the family. His siblings—Shira (Abbi Jacobson), the middle child with a rebellious streak; and Yoshi (Max Greenfield), the little bro with big dreams and zero follow-through—are grappling with much of the same. Meanwhile, their dad, Elliott (Paul Reiser), is pretty chill—a demeanor that's in stark contrast to his wife, Naomi (Lisa Edelstein).

The Schwooper matriarch is Long Story Short's most vividly rendered creation. If you grew up with a Jewish mother, you'll feel this woman in your bones. For her, love is expressed via needle-sharp criticisms and hovering concern, bolstered by an Old Testament sense of divine justice: “Things don't happen for no reason,” she insists. “It can't be nobody's fault.” But whether Naomi is present or absent, she's the glue holding this big, messy brood together. 

Things get increasingly complicated as the young Schwoopers grow up and build lives of their own. The two eldest settle down and have kids with partners whose childhoods were vastly different from theirs—Avi with certified blonde goy Jen (Angelique Cabral); and Shira with Kendra (Nicole Byer), a Black woman who converted to Judaism as an adult. Meanwhile, Yoshi drifts through life like the ADHD-addled stoner he is, hungry for meaning and a place to belong.  



Even though Long Story Short tackles some heavy subjects—grief, trauma, existential dread, the pandemic—it's decidedly a comedy, complete snappy one-liners and high slapstick. (Witness a scene in which the Schwooper house is forcibly remodeled by an epic mattress explosion.) That visual humor is amped up by production designer Lisa Hanawalt, who also worked on BoJack. She trades in that sharp detail for a looser style here, giving Long Story Short the cozy, nostalgic feel of the Sunday funnies. Credit is also due to the voice cast of sitcom veterans from beloved shows like Mad About You, Broad City, New Girl, and Superstore, who all know how to play up both the comedy and drama.

Bob-Waksberg is no stranger to time-hopping narratives about intergenerational trauma: He co-created the cult Prime Video series Undone, about a woman who uses her shamanic powers to uncover dark family secrets. But Long Story Short is Bob-Waksberg's most personal series to date. Like Avi, he's a Jewish millennial who grew up in the Bay Area. It shows in the story's specificity, particularly when it comes to the characters' varying attitudes about what it means to be a Jew in the modern age. 

Because the narrative hops from the '90s to the aughts to the 2020s and back again, season one only covers a handful of days in the Schwoopers' lives. We don't see most of the “big” moments—marriages, divorces, births, deaths—only the way they impact what comes after. But Long Story Short suggests that it's not these life-altering events that matter, but the way they leave us changed.  

Long Story Short premieres August 22 on Netflix

The official cast of “Survivor 49” has been revealed, featuring 18 brand-new castaways ready to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition. While the latest players to join the Emmy-winning reality series includes the likes of a NASA rocket scientist and a former Marvel Studios executive, longtime host Jeff Probst revealed in a statement that two cast members were added to the season's lineup just hours before the game began. 

Those players come in the form of 32-year-old legal clerk Jason Treul and 29-year-old fitness trainer Michelle “MC” Chukwujekwu. The duo originally traveled to Fiji as alternates for the season, but officially joined the “Survivor” family after two prospective castaways were sent home before filming began. 

A historic first for the longrunning series, Probst opened up about “Survivor” producer's last minute descision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly following the August 20 cast announcement.

“What I can say about the reason we made the move is this: ‘Survivor' has rules and standards, and if a player crosses that line, we act,” said the host. He went on to explain that the players had been removed from the cast for violating the show's pre-game rules that prohibit contestants from engaging in any kind of communication with one another before filming begins.

The rule, put in place to prevent players from forming pre-season alliances and to preserve the authenticity of the game, stipulates against prospective players engaging in any kind of verbal, non-verbal, or physical contact during their pre-game quarantine.

“It's one of the reasons we bring alternates,” said Probst, adding that the tradition of bringing more castaways than necessary to Fiji ahead of filming acts as sort of “insurance” policy for producers. 

“Typically, we bring alternates in case somebody gets sick or has a panic attack and can't begin the game,” he said. “That's very, very, very rare there. But regardless why we brought them there initially, they are also there to serve as a reminder that we do put a lot of importance on the integrity of the game, and we won't let anything or any person put that in jeopardy.”

While Jason and MC flew to Fiji ahead of filming knowing that they likely wouldn't appear on “Survivor 49,” Probst explained that the duo were “suddenly thrust into the game” with just 12 hours notice. 

“It was a shock, for sure,” the host continued. 

Despite having less than a day to mentally prepare for “Survivor,” Probst told EW that he saw Jason and MC's last minute addition to the cast as an “advantage” for the players. 

“You've spent a week observing, but without the pressure of thinking you were going to have to play and put it into motion,” said the host, adding, “Jason and MC find themselves in this marooning challenge that 12 hours ago they were dreaming might happen one day and suddenly it's right in front of them.”

Probst went on to identify the moment as a “completely unique situation” for “Survivor,” adding that he hopes the last-minute casting shuffle will add a “cool layer to this experiment.”

Jason and MC will similarly be joined on the “Survivor 49” cast by two former alternates, Sage Ahrens-Nichols and Sophie Segreti, who were alternates for Season 47 and 48, respectively. 

“We have four alternates playing,” said Probst, noting the historic series first. “When we tell you you're an alternate, we tell you what that means. It means we want you on the show. We just don't have a spot for you this season. And we really mean it.” 

Probst added that he hopes “Survivor's” most alternate-heavy season will encourage future alternates to hold out hope that they'll eventually find themselves on the beaches of Fiji searching for Hidden Immunity Idols and attending Tribal Council ceremonies. Conversely, the longtime host said he also hopes this moment acts as warning to future prospective castaways that the show takes its rules very seriously. 

“The word should spread,” he said, “Just because we tell you you're on the show – until the game begins, you're not on the show.”

“Survivor 49” is set to make its two-hour CBS debut on Wednesday, September 24 at 8:00pm ET.

In a year that's proven a bit soft at the box office, the biggest story (and just plain biggest film, period) is the monstrous power of “Ne Zha 2,” a Chinese CGI animated feature that, during its theatrical release in January, utterly annihilated the likes of “Fantastic Four,” “Superman,” and even “A Minecraft Movie” to become the highest global earning film this year. The competition isn't tight, either: with $2.2 billion grossed so far, it has an absurd $1.2 billion lead over “Lilo & Stitch” and is the fifth highest-earning movie ever, no qualifications needed.

 










“Ne Zha 2” isn't the first Chinese film to challenge Hollywood productions in terms of success, with the country having established itself as a highly important market for global productions. But its sheer impact still heavily outpaces any other Chinese film ever made. By comparison, the second-highest-grossing Chinese film of all-time is 2021's “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” which “only” grossed a lowly $913 million. Even more impressive is “Ne Zha 2” managed to make all that money with barely any help from North American markets: the movie received a limited eight-week U.S. release by CMC Pictures in February, where — per Box Office Mojo — it managed around $20 million.

Which is where A24 comes in. With U.S. audiences still largely ignorant of what exactly “Ne Zha” is, the indie distributor acquired the rights to the film and gave it a glossy English dub for a second introduction to the market, complete with an IMAX rollout to better appreciate the film's stunningly detailed backdrops and fight scenes.

What unsuspecting viewers will find at the theater is a film that's not really anything like the animated films Hollywood produces: glossy and operatic in its scale, “Ne Zha 2” has a mammoth 150-minute running time that's longer than expected for the average kids' attention span (or the average attention span of a TikTok-rotted adult brain, to be frank). But in its emotional viewpoint and its streak of gleeful potty humor, “Ne Zha 2” is also quite blatantly a movie for children. The closest comparison to make isn't Pixar's “Elio” or Disney's “Zootopia,” but the world of battle Shonen anime like “Dragon Ball Z” or “Naruto,” long shows characterized by excitable teen boys engaging in nonstop, over-the-top brawls with their own specialized power sets.

Like many products of this genre, “Ne Zha 2” can occasionally veer on the numbing, its barrage of setpieces blending in together into one amorphous blob. But at the same time, you can't help but admire the sheer scale of the canvas director Yang Yu (alternatively credited as Jiaozi) uses to paint, and the often jaw-dropping artistry and detail of the animation speaks for itself.

 










As its title makes clear, “Ne Zha 2” is a sequel, and anyone who hasn't taken the time to study up on the original 2019 “Ne Zha” is going to inevitably be a bit confused by this one, which starts with a very brief recap of the first movie, but nonetheless plunges the audience directly into this fantasy version of China with little context or effort to handhold. For American audiences this will inevitably jar, given how much the characters and story takes inspiration from the 16th-century novel “Investiture of the Gods” and various mythological and folk figures from Chinese history. After an opening that starts immediately after the first film introducing the titular Ne Zha and his best friend Ao Bing as spirits whose bodies need to be rebirthed, followed by a massive war sequence between characters just introduced, you would not be forgiven for getting a headache trying to keep up.

Once the movie slows down, the uninformed are able to ease more readily into the plot of the film. The first movie covered the story of how Ne Zha — a foul-mouthed, raccoon-eyed, rebellious youth who was born to demon hunters as the feared reincarnation of a demon orb — befriended the serene, properly mannered Ao Bing. In “Ne Zha 2,” master Taiyi Zhenren recreates their bodies, only for Ao Bing to lose his body in an attack from the dragons — led by the main villain, the sniveling but sympathetic Shen Gongbao — who mistakenly attack their hometown under the belief he is dead. With Ao Bing's spirit now in Ne Zha's body, the two manage a truce with dragons to venture to the land of the heavenly Chan sect and complete three tasks that will grant them immortality and restore Ao Bing's body.

 










That journey to and through the divine world is long, and a plot synopsis in a review can't really capture all of the characters and moving parts to this tale. There's just too much of it. At 2 hours and 24 minutes, the movie sags in pacing, with a protracted first act to get to the real meat of things that could use a serious edit, jokes that linger a second too long, and fight scenes that drag to the point that you sometimes lose the emotional stakes of the story. The sheer amount of toilet humor — there's a lot of mucus, snot, and jokes about people drinking piss stuffed into one film — often proves more annoying than fun.

Luckily, things click into place when Ne Zha begins his trials, and the tension between using Ao Bing's greater power to win and remaining true to his own misfit self begins to wear at him. It's also the point in which the often bratty, off-putting character clicks into place, and his simple desire to be accepted and prove his worth emerges as the real emotional heart of the story. The other characters emerge as complex figures rather than stock archtypes, as the Chan sect holds obvious secrets and biases towards demons while Shen Gongbao's hidden soft side comes to light.

Most importantly, the trials gives “Ne Zha 2” a framework to showcase some of the most impressive and vibrant 3D animation that has been seen on film in quite some time. The product of roughly 138 Chinese companies and around 4,000 individual animators, “Ne Zha 2” looks vibrant and alive in every frame, striking an unusual balance between anime-inspired exaggeration and realism that works shockingly well in practice. The environments — from the white jade walls of the Chan sect palace to the dusty town of talking bandit moles that Ne Zha begins his trials in to the rushing waterfall where he fights a shapeshifting water demon — are astonishingly ornate and detailed, while the characters that inhabit them are creatively imagined and varied, from cartoonish old fat men to dragons with scales that shine like they're truly alive. 

 










Then there's the action, which melds influences from anime, wuxia, and good old-fashioned “Looney Tune” pratfalls to create some jaw-dropping setpieces that zig and zag in new directions; you never know how a brawl will resolve or what a character will do next, and that unpredictability allows for real exhilaration. The climax, an operatic conflict that manages to successfully merge emotion with spectacle in a way the rest of the film sometimes struggles with, is a particular feat. In one stunning shot, two hordes of warriors on rival sides of a conflict are seen from afar, like two waves crashing into each other. And yet, the detail, attention, and artistry of every pixel in frame is very evidently displayed. In many respects, watching “Ne Zha 2” feels akin to viewing the “Avatar” films, as the film provides a visual experience that's the absolute peak of what its medium is capable of.

It also benefits from a solid dubbing effort that gratifyingly features a mostly Asian cast and a absence of stunty A-list gets. The sole exception is Michelle Yeoh, who's appropriately warm and heartbreaking as the title character's mother Lady Yin. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns or professional voice actors, including Crystal Lee and Aleks Le, a winning double act as Ne Zha and Ao Bing. Occasionally, the dialogue doesn't quite match up with the character's mouth flaps, but it's a minor distraction in a mostly seamless experience. 

 










All dubbing inevitably invites a debate over whether or not it's necessary or if English speakers should learn to appreciate subtitles, but “Ne Zha 2” has a good case for why it's necessary. When a movie is as stuffed with detail and action as this, better to make sure the audience has their eyes on the whole screen rather than just a tiny third of it.

A24‘s “Ne Zha 2” is currently playing in theaters.

The idea of a “period piece” usually conjures up images of Georgian ballrooms and crenellated battlements. But now that “Time to Pretend” is a vintage track (how horrid), any TV show or film set in the back half of the 20th Century is firmly a period project; and the 1970s, specifically, might be one of the most challenging decades for contemporary movies and series to recreate. 

There are a number of reasons why this is. IndieWire reached out to production designers who have worked on contemporary films or shows set in the 1970s — including Anastasia Masaro (“Fellow Travelers”), Curt Beech (“BlacKkKlansman”), Howard Cummings (“Behind the Candelabra”), Aaron Haye (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), and Beth Mickle (“The Deuce”) — to ask how difficult they've found the time period and none of them classed the ‘70s as easy.

They all highlighted ways in which our cultural awareness of the ‘70s can fool film crews and audiences alike into thinking we remember what the period should look like. But memory, just like a shag carpet, is tricky to maintain. 

 










“It's close enough to our time to feel familiar, yet so much has changed that every detail matters if you want to keep the world authentic and believable,” Haye told IndieWire. “For example, finding a location that still retains a true sense of the '70s can be difficult. Small details like rooftop antennas, graphic elements, and of course, more obvious things like vehicles and architecture are essential to grounding a piece in that period.” 

Yet, as Beech pointed out, a lot of the material goods actually from the ‘70s are of a lower quality than earlier decades and also more degraded than the period relics of the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Because of the [economic] downturn, products made and used in this period were of a lower quality than what the baseline is today. Because of this, they have largely been relegated to landfills. They had little value then, and did not retain it. The upside is, this all adds up to an interesting visual story to try to tell,” Beech told IndieWire. 

Masaro told IndieWire that she and her team needed to rely on a lot of specialty shops and rentals in order to create an authentic sense of the ‘70s in her sets. “The thing that makes the ‘70s a little more manageable is that it's still a highly desirable era, whether it be for the design or the nostalgia, so there are collectors who specialize in it,” Masaro said. 

 










Cummings agreed that the one bright spot about working in the decade is the nostalgic desirability of the styles and items most associated with the period. “The color palette alone of the ‘70s just immediately transforms the visuals. Add in the exploration and use of textures… [it's] heaven,” Cummings told IndieWire. 

It only takes some diligent scanning on eBay, Chairish, and Facebook Marketplace to get to heaven, it turns out — at least when it comes to finding '70s-appropriate furniture. Mickle told IndieWire that it's not necessarily hard to find pieces from the decade, but it is tricky to use them in the right way, and in the correct proportion. 

“The ‘70s saw a wave of more experimental styles [in] shapes and forms used in architecture, furniture design, and surface patterns, as well as clothing and vehicle design. But in recreating the period, it's important to remember that these more extreme visuals weren't seen everywhere all at once,” Mickle told IndieWire. “If that's not kept in mind, it's easy to go overboard and flood the frame with ‘70s cliches. The design can quickly feel like a caricature of the period.” 

Beech agreed with the danger of flooding the zone; if he had any advice for others working on projects set in the ‘70s, it would be to remember that people did not accumulate so much stuff in the way that we do now. The temptation to fill the walls is something that production designers going for period accuracy have to fight against. “If you need to fill a space visually for a 1970s project, you will have to be more creative than cramming the walls with stuff. It's going to be more about the basics of color, texture, and shapes than ‘things,'” Beech said. 

 










Those signifiers of time period also have to be balanced with a lived-in sense of other time periods, too. Masaro's work on “Fellow Travellers” is decade-spanning, but she said that the key was that she couldn't hermetically seal the ‘50s and ‘60s away when it came time to design her ‘70s sets. “The thing I find with any period is [you can't] focus too heavily on the decade styles themselves, without including design choices from previous decades,” Masaro said. “Layering previous decades with the ‘present' makes it feel more realistic and less like an advertisement for the 1970s.” 

Because the colors, textures, and geometric patterns that immediately scream “1970s” are such strong deviations from both contemporary design and a lot of what came before in the 20th Century, that balance is easy to get wrong or to tip into pastiche. “Only the 1930s are harder,” Beech said, about another era that maybe has become too iconic in our shared cultural imagination for its own good.  

The '70s require a great deal of patience to search out scarce resources, to sift through imperfect research material, and to combat our contemporary myths and misunderstandings that it was all waterbeds and egg-shaped chairs. “But if you aren't excited about that challenge, you are in the wrong career,” Beech said. “I speak for all production designers when I say we live for the really hard assignments!”

Hotline TNT have pulled their music from Spotify, joining an exodus of indie acts including Godspeed You! Black Emperor, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof. “The company that bills itself as the steward of all recorded music has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that it does not align with the band's values in any way,” frontman Will Anderson wrote in a statement. “A cooler world is possible.”

In announcing their departures from Spotify, King Gizzard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof all cited the military investments made by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek through his venture capital fund Prima Materia. Since 2021, Prima Materia has been investing in Helsing, a defense company that sells software that uses AI to inform military decisions. Godspeed You! Black Emperor went one step further and removed their music from all major streaming platforms.

This year, Hotline TNT shared their latest album Raspberry Moon. They're currently on tour in support of the record. On September 5, Hotline TNT will host a “24-hour telethon” on Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram, during which, according to a press release, they'll “aim to sell 500 copies of Raspberry Moon via Bandcamp while also talking to artists, journalists, record store owners and others about their favorite new music, sources for discovery, and their feelings on Spotify.”

The Smiths drummer Mike Joyce has announced his autobiography. The Drums offers a frontline view of the band's story from “the self-confessed biggest Smiths fan in the world,” as the product description puts it. “His off-piste, frank and witty perspective allows him to re-contextualise fan favourite moments through a beautifully vulnerable, human insight into his life.” The Drums is due for release on November 6.

New Modern, an imprint of HMV owner Doug Putman's new Putman Publishing house, is behind the publication. Beyond international postage, details of a North American release have not been revealed.

In 2013, Morrissey published the first Smiths memoir, the slightly notorious Autobiography, which he managed to get released via the august imprint Penguin Classics. Johnny Marr followed suit with Set the Boy Free in 2016.

Smiths bassist Andy Rourke, who played alongside Joyce with Sinéad O'Connor after the band's dissolution, died of pancreatic cancer in 2023.

In 2018, SOPHIE and Liz reunited to make a follow-up to their 2015 collaboration “When I Rule the World” at SOPHIE's Nichols Canyon home studio. That song, “Sunscreen,” did not immediately see the light of day, though it leaked on streaming platforms and occasionally popped up in DJ sets. Now, Liz is back, and she is releasing the finished song to mark her return. Below, watch the song's video, shot on the Greek island of Mykonos. James Orlando directed it, and co-designer Renata Raksha drew from an idea conceptualized with SOPHIE.

SOPHIE's brother, Benny Long, and vocal engineer Suzy Shinn worked with Liz to complete the track. The song is also getting a vinyl release. “Sunscreen” is the latest in a string of posthumous SOPHIE releases, the latest being the self-titled album released last year.

Liz wrote on social media, “After all the years of rips, leaks, lore, and speculation, SUNSCREEN is finally here. SOPHIE always wanted me to put this song out, and I'm so grateful to Benny and Emily Long for being the loving and classy individuals they are, and for trusting me with the vision for this release.”

She added, “And to SOPHIE… your brilliance, your spirit, your friendship—I carry all of it with me. Thank you for believing in me. You continue to shape me and so many others; your impact is eternal. SOPHIE FOREVER.”

Bruce Springsteen‘s unreleased song vault is a source of seemingly infinite wonders. Just two months after releasing seven shelved albums on Tracks II: The Lost Albums, Springsteen has gone back into the vault and emerged with the Born to Run outtake “Lonely Night in the Park” that he's sharing to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of the landmark LP.


	“Lonely Night In the Park” was recorded at New York's Record Plant across two days in May 1975, and came very close to appearing on Born to Run. Springsteen included it on several proposed Born to Run track sequences in his notebooks, and Jon Landau argued it should be on the album instead of “Meeting Across The River.”


	“I won my way on things,” former Springsteen manager/Born to Run co-producer Mike Appel told Backstreets in 1990. “When [Landau] and Bruce would say ‘Here's Lonely Night in the Park and Linda Let Me be the One.' They came in and they thought that was going to be a commercial song. And I won my way. I said ‘These are such dogs and the lyrics are so bad.' I said, just go away. I said these songs aren't staying on the record − over my dead body. I told him this stuff was ‘shit.' And nobody today would talk to him like that.”

	











	“Lonely Night In the Park” remained little more than a myth until SiriusXM's E Street Radio played the song in 2005, around the album's 30th anniversary. The credits for this new version include Steve Van Zandt and Ron Aniello on guitar, confirming there were recent overdubs on the original studio recording. (Van Zandt didn't join the E Street Band until the Born to Run tour, and Aniello didn't enter Springsteen's orbit until the 2000s.) But they stuck with Springsteen's vocal track from 1975.

	The 30th anniversary of Born to Run in 2005 was celebrated with a new box set and documentary. The plans are a little more muted for the 50th this year, but the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center For American Music is holding a 50th anniversary symposium at Monmouth University's Pollak Theatre on September 6. According to the official website, the symposium will feature “panels, presentations, and interviews with members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, as well as with journalists and historians, music industry legends, and special guests.”

PORTLAND, Ore. — Donald Trump's forces have tear gassed a public school into submission. Or at least into fleeing its longtime campus.The local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) complex in Portland has become a near-nightly flashpoint this summer for local activists demonstrating against the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign — marked by masked agents snatching law-abiding non-citizens from court houses; Home Depot parking lots; garment factories; taco trucks; and city streets. 


	By day, protester signs, directed at passersby, carry messages like: “You're not safe. You're next.” After dark, demonstrators here square off with federal agents, in a cat-and-mouse conflict that often begins with protesters taunting ICE agents with verbal tirades, leading federal riot cops to respond with a disproportionate show of force. 


	Agents in gas masks burst out of a gated driveway amid curtains of green smoke and other crowd-control munitions. Protesters tell of agents raining pepper-ball rounds down on them from the rooftop of the facility. The demonstrators have been broadly nonviolent — although some agitators have been arrested and brought up on both minor and serious charges. 


	The habitual deployment of chemical irritants by federal agents has created fear in the neighborhood. Locals have posted biohazard warning signs: “This area has been sprayed with TEAR GAS & TOXIC CHEMICALS.” 

	











	As a new academic year approaches, a nearby public school has been forced to abandon its longtime campus, citing threats to student health. “We didn't know if there are new gases being used. We didn't even know how to identify them,” says the school's interim executive director, Laura Cartwright, who committed to an “emergency move” amid cratering enrollment. “If we would have stayed, we might have lost our school because of people's concerns around safety.”


	The publicly funded Cottonwood School is a charter school focused on “civics and science,” serving students from kindergarten to eighth grade. Its now-former campus sits south of downtown, near the Willamette River, amid a jumble of apartments and warehouses, with a Tesla dealership squeezed in for good measure. 

	











	The ICE facility sits half a block away from the school, across old trolley tracks. The multi-story concrete complex resembles a minimum-security prison. Because of protests, the windows of its bottom two floors have been up-armored with plywood. The building is tagged with graffiti, including incendiary messages like “ICE=Gestapo.”

	When this reporter visited the area in late June, a laminated message hung on the fence of the Cottonwood School play area denouncing the “harm being inflicted on our neighbors, ecosystem, students and school.” It called on the feds to “cease the deployment of ‘less than lethal' weapons,” including tear gas, “‘green' gas, pepper balls, and rubber bullets reported near our campus.”


	The makeup and potential health impacts of the chemical munitions used by ICE in the neighborhood has not been disclosed. ICE did not respond on the record for this story, including to questions about its crowd-control arsenal. Anti-ICE activists have begun cataloging canisters collected from the streets outside the facility, posting pictures of munitions labeled “CS,” or tear gas; “Green Smoke”; and “Orange Smoke.” (A demonstrator on the scene also showed this reporter a spent canister of Green Smoke.) 


	In July, Portland's city government disclosed it has received reports of “chemical munitions” being used against protestors, including “pepper balls, pepper spray, and… smoke grenades.” It described steps it has taken to prevent ICE's chemical pollution from entering local waterways. (The city's own police have been so trigger-happy firing chemical munitions against protesters that the bureau got written up by war crimes investigators.)

	Cartwright described for Rolling Stone a years-long struggle to keep kids safe at school. “Munitions and tear gas — we aren't new to this,” she says. “We'd been next to the ICE building the whole time.” She emphasized that the school has coexisted “harmoniously with the protesters,” but adds: “Our issue is the chemical weapons being used against them that were impacting our space.” 


	When the latest round of anti-ICE demonstrations kicked up in June, school officials thought they could ride it out with familiar due-dilligence, sweeping the school yard for any stray munitions. “We can't have children picking up a plastic tear-gas ball that's going to pop,” Cartwright says. “That was just part of our process.” 


	But as the intensity of the conflict rose, it soon became clear that the school would have to make a dramatic change. “We were getting nightly reports that green gas was enveloping our garden — our edible garden — and all of the different chemicals were impacting our soil.” Cottonwood faced the costly prospect of constant testing and remediation, or being unable to use its outdoor spaces. When the bottom dropped out of enrollment, the school chose to relocate to a recently vacant middle-school campus where Cottonwood could take over the lease.

	For a school dedicated to civics, Cottonwood has a powerful advocate in Washington, D.C. in Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). In an interview with Rolling Stone, Wyden recalled tangling with the first Trump administration over the school's safety. “I thought we wouldn't have to go through this again at Cottonwood,” he says. “But if anything, they've given more power to ICE, more unchecked authority.”


	In the monomaniacal campaign to deport as many people as quickly as possible, Wyden says, “the Trump people are willing to put kids and families at risk,” with weapons it won't discuss. “Depending on what they're using over there,” the senator says, “the kids can get sick.”

The B-2 bomber flying wing design was shaped by decades of engineering, not alien craft. Yet, its UFO-like look fuels mystery and conspiracy. Is it really just stealth science or something more? 

The B-2 bomber flying wing shape is not from a crashed UFO. As per reports it evolved from 1940s American aircraft designs like the Northrop XB-35 and YB-49. It's design focuses on aerodynamics and stealth, developed engineers.

A flying wing is a plane without a separate tail or fuselage. Instead, it's all wing this shape reduces drag and radar visibility. Engineers first experimented with it in the 1930s-40s, aiming for better fuel efficiency and stealth.

The B-2 Spirit builds on these earlier designs. Its crescent shape results from decades of research into reducing radar detection and improving flight. It uses advanced materials and computer modelling, but the shape's roots are purely terrestrial.

Some believe the B-2 bomber design was copied from a UFO from the Roswell incident or that whistleblower Bob Lazar revealed secret files. As per reports these claims have no solid evidence and remain in the realm of conspiracy theories.

The sleek, smooth shape of the B-2 resembles reported UFO sightings. This is just because both designs aim for the same things: invisibility to radar and efficient flight. Experts say the similarity is functional, not alien.

The B-2's radar system uses cutting-edge electronics and radar-absorbing materials. While rumours suggest alien tech involvement, the reality is human-made advances after years of research and testing.

Though some stories claim secret UFO files influenced the B-2 bomber, official records show it was human engineering. The truth about possible alien technology remains unproven.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

Visitors at Disney World's Epcot are reporting an out-of-this-world experience.

A woman working behind the scenes at a popular Nashville radio show gained newfound notoriety with her recent claim of a UFO sighting, during a visit to the Orlando theme park with her boyfriend. 

While waiting for the nightly fireworks show with her boyfriend, Morgan Huelsman, digital director of “The Bobby Bones Show”, said she saw a sudden bright light overhead — one that apparently had nothing to do with the planned pyrotechnics.

After scouring the internet for information regarding potential satellites or drones in the area and coming up short, the tourist from Tennessee pronounced the bright object as “definitely a UFO with aliens.”

A video of the episode posted to the official “Bobby Bones Show” X account on Aug. 21 was widely circulated online — sparking discussion over what Huelsman could have seen.

“[Morgan] saw this hovering over EPCOT at Disney World for several minutes before it just blipped away,” the post said. 

The video showed a small bright light hovering in the dark night sky, though it's unclear if the object was moving or not because the camera was not steady.

One person noted that there had been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral earlier in the week which could explain the sighting, but show staff reported that the object “was never moving.”

It's unknown exactly when the video was taken, though SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World.

Another comment said that the bright light in the video “looks exactly like a police helicopter.”

Epcot's proximity to NASA launch sites has sparked scores of UFO reports from parkgoers.

Experts have noted that the combination of clear skies in Florida, rocket launches and highly populated tourist areas make it a hotspot for misidentified aerial phenomena.

Florida ranks behind only California for the most number of reported UFO sightings, according to the Florida Times-Union. 

Since 1995, there have been 8,623 UFO sightings in Florida reported to the National UFO Reporting Center.

If an extraterrestrial civilization went hunting for human-made signals, the best time to listen would be during lineups between Earth and other planets. The best places to look would be solar systems oriented edge-on to us, within a few dozen light-years.

That's the message from a new analysis of our strongest, most persistent transmissions into deep space. The study was led by researchers at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The experts mapped 20 years of human deep-space communications to show when and where they would be most detectable by observers beyond the solar system. The findings could improve our own search strategies for technosignatures.

“Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,” said lead author Pinchen Fan, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State.

Because Mars does not fully block transmissions, a distant spacecraft or planet aligned with Earth and another Solar System body could detect the spillover.

“This suggests that we should look for alignment of planets outside of our solar system when searching for extraterrestrial communications,” she said.

SETI scientists sift the sky for technosignatures – signs of past or present technology – as evidence of intelligent life.

“Researchers often search the universe for signs of past or present technology, called technosignatures, as evidence of intelligent life,” Fan said. 

“Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.”

The team analyzed public logs from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). This trio of powerful antenna complexes in California, Spain, and Australia that uplinks commands and downlinks data to and from interplanetary spacecraft and space telescopes.

The researchers matched each DSN transmission to the targets' positions, reconstructing the timing and directionality of Earth's most potent radio beams.

“NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft and the James Webb Space Telescope,” said co-author Joseph Lazio, a project scientist at JPL.

“It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.”

Most of those beams point toward Mars missions. Others target spacecraft elsewhere in the Solar System and observatories parked at the Sun–Earth Lagrange points. These are gravitational sweet spots where telescopes like the JWST hover in a stable alignment as seen from Earth.

Because the Solar System is essentially flat – think planets tracing paths on a dinner plate – DSN transmissions hug Earth's orbital plane, with the vast majority within five degrees of it. Eavesdroppers are most likely to catch our signals when Earth aligns with another planet.

”Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77 percent chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions,” Fan said.

“If they could view an alignment with another solar-system planet, there is a 12 percent chance they would be in the path of our transmissions.”

In practical terms, an average DSN signal would be detectable with Earth-class radio telescopes out to roughly 23 light-years, the team calculated. Focusing on edge-on star systems and timing observations with planetary alignments could greatly improve success odds.

Astronomers already watch exoplanets during transits, when a world crosses its star and dims it from our perspective. That same planetary alignment is when spillover from another civilization's interplanetary chatter would most likely pass our line of sight.

“However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,” Fan said.

“With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundreds of thousands previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.”

The team noted that this alignment-first strategy also applies to searches for optical technosignatures. Future spacefaring societies may prefer lasers for deep-space links, which spill less than radio beams. These signals would still be most detectable along the transmitter's line to its target.

“Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey,” said Professor Jason Wright, the director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center and co-author of the study. “As we reach further into our Solar System, our transmissions to other planets will only increase.” 

The next step is to identify nearby star systems that match those criteria, focusing on planetary alignments, and estimate how often any given system would have been swept by Earth's beams over the past two decades.

In a field where vast search spaces collide with limited telescope time, aiming at the cosmic equivalents of our own “Mars call” geometry could be the efficiency gain that finally turns a faint whisper into a first hello.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official.

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The firing is the latest upheaval in military leadership and in the country's intelligence agencies, and comes a few months after details of the preliminary assessment leaked to the media. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In a news conference following the June strikes, Hegseth lambasted the press for what he claimed was an anti-military bias but did not offer any direct evidence of the destruction of Iranian nuclear production facilities.

Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the Air Force's top uniformed officer, Gen. David Allvin, planned to retire two years early. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — which is responsible for coordinating the work of 18 intelligence agencies, including DIA — announced that it would slash its staff and budget.

The firing of Kruse was first reported by The Washington Post.

Ambulances, choppers on site in Illinois

Multiple people are dead, including children, after a tour bus traveling from Niagra Falls to New York City on Friday crashed and rolled over on the highway in Genesee County, New York.

The crash, which involved a tractor-trailer and a tour bus, happened near mile marker 4039, according to New York State Police.

The tour bus was carrying about 50 passengers, troopers said. A passenger manifest provided by the bus company confirms 52 individuals, including the driver, were on board.

Trooper James O'Callaghan told Fox News Digital at least three people are dead and multiple people are unaccounted for. Some passengers were ejected from the bus and others likely remain trapped underneath it.

Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is on his way to Maryland, his attorney confirmed Friday.

Abrego Garcia, 29, was freed after U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes authorized his release while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges in Nashville. His legal team has arranged for private security to transport him directly to Maryland, where he previously lived with his family before his arrest earlier this year, according to a report from CBS News.

Federal prosecutors charged Abrego Garcia in June with conspiracy to transport migrants illegally across the country, a case tied to a 2022 traffic stop. The Justice Department has also accused him of ties to the violent MS-13 gang, allegations his lawyers deny. His trial is scheduled to begin in January.

The release does not resolve the government's parallel effort to remove Abrego Garcia from the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement still has the authority to place him back into custody and pursue deportation.

A Maryland-based federal judge has ruled that ICE must restore him to its supervision program and give his attorneys 72 hours' notice before attempting another removal. That notice could be given as soon as Abrego Garcia arrives in Maryland.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FACES KEY DECISION AHEAD OF POSSIBLE ABREGO GARCIA RELEASE

The administration has openly considered deporting him to a third country, rather than El Salvador, where he was sent in March despite a limited court order.

That removal resulted in a monthslong process, following his initial deportation to El Salvador in March, which spurred litigation over a prior immigration judge's limited order barring him from removal to his home country. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The global humanitarian system was not set up for a crisis like this one.

The hunger crisis in Gaza reached another grim milestone on Friday when the world's leading hunger watchdog confirmed that a famine is taking place within the enclave, amid Israel's ongoing blockade and bombardment.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the consortium of humanitarian groups and UN agencies that monitors and classifies global hunger crises with a five-phase classification system, considers a famine to be taking place in an area when at least 20 percent of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30 percent of children are acutely malnourished, and at least two people out of 10,000 die per day from malnutrition. The IPC issued an alert this week that found those conditions now exist in parts of Gaza and are expected to expand in September. In response to the report, UN Secretary General António Guterres called the famine “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment — and a failure of humanity itself.”

The IPC has been warning for months now that Gaza was on the brink of famine. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS Net), an analysis body set up by the US Agency for International Development, assessed that famine conditions were “possible, if not likely” as far back as May 2024.

While malnutrition has been a serious issue for Gaza throughout the war since it began after Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack, and to a lesser extent even before that, the situation has dramatically worsened since March, when a short-lived ceasefire between Israel and Hamas broke down and Israeli authorities halted all food aid into Gaza for two months. While food shipments eventually resumed, much of it is now delivered by a much-derided new US-backed nonprofit called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The GHF operates a small handful of sites — compared to hundreds that were in place before Israel's March ban on aid — which critics say makes it difficult for the most vulnerable Gazans to access food. The Israeli government says the new system is necessary to prevent Hamas from stealing the food, though the New York Times reported in late July that two senior Israeli military officials said there was no evidence of aid being “systematically” stolen.

Famine classifications are rare. In the IPC's 20-year history, there have been only four: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan last year. Though the distinction matters little to people who are starving, the IPC is set up to confirm the conditions on the ground. But it does not “declare” famine — governments are supposed to do that, but given that modern hunger crises are mainly driven by war or deliberate political policy, they very rarely do. The Israeli government is no exception: It is already pushing back on the IPC's report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it “an outright lie,” and the foreign ministry accusing the experts of lowering the threshold for one of the criteria, the proportion of acutely malnourished children. (The New York Times summarizes the threshold dispute, which involves two different methods of measuring malnutrition and what the IPC says is a lack of data.) In other crises, advocates have criticized the IPC for being too slow to issue a famine classification, saying that by the time it's in place, it's often too late to stop the worst of the suffering.

If governments rarely acknowledge that a famine is happening, and if famine conditions or something very close to them are often in place long before the official statement is made, what's the point? Advocates say that a famine classification can focus attention, political capital, and donor dollars on a crisis hot spot. While evidence of that is mixed, there are cases such as Somalia in 2011 where funding dramatically increased after a famine was announced.

But this just highlights the degree to which much of the international humanitarian system is not set up for a conflict like the war in Gaza. This isn't a case like Somalia or Sudan, which struggle to get the attention of the media and wealthy governments. Photos of emaciated children in Gaza have been on the covers of the world's leading news sites for weeks (though these too have been politicized). The US government, for better or worse, is deeply enmeshed in both diplomacy and aid in Gaza, to say nothing of the involvement of governments in the Middle East and Europe. A lack of resources is also not the problem here. There are already thousands of trucks worth of aid sitting outside Gaza's borders and within them. Aid agencies say they can't deliver the food in adequate amounts because of delays and restrictions put in place by the Israeli government and because — given the fact that aid can only enter at a limited number of places and times — they are often mobbed by desperate Gazans before they can reach distribution points.

This is not a neglected conflict, and the issue is neither a lack of attention nor inadequate resources. The problem is political will. And that's something the IPC is not set up to provide.

Omega fatty acids could protect against Alzheimer's disease in women, new research has found.

Analysis of lipids - fat molecules that perform many essential functions in the body - in the blood found there was a noticeable loss of unsaturated fats, such as those that contain omega fatty acids, in the blood of women with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy women.

Scientists found no significant difference in the same lipid molecule composition in men with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy men, which suggests that those lipids have a different role in the disease according to sex. Fats perform important roles in maintaining a healthy brain, so this study could indicate why more women are diagnosed with the disease.

The study, published on August 20 in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association by scientists from King's College London and Queen Mary University London, is the first to reveal the important role lipids could have in the risk for Alzheimer's between the sexes.

Senior author Dr Cristina Legido-Quigley, from King's College London, said: ""Women are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer's Disease and are more often diagnosed with the disease than men after the age of 80. One of the most surprising things we saw when looking at the different sexes was that there was no difference in these lipids in healthy and cognitively impaired men, but for women this picture was completely different. The study reveals that Alzheimer's lipid biology is different between the sexes, opening new avenues for research.""

The scientists took plasma samples from 841 participants who had Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitively health controls and and were measured for brain inflammation and damage.

They used mass spectrometry to analyze the 700 individual lipids in the blood. Lipids are a group of many molecules. Saturated lipids are generally considered as 'unhealthy' or 'bad' lipids, while unsaturated lipid, which sometime contains omega fatty acids, are generally considered 'healthy'.

Scientists saw a steep increase in lipids with saturation - the 'unhealthy lipids' - in women with Alzheimer's compared to the healthy group. The lipids with attached omega fatty acids were the most decreased in the Alzheimer's group.

Now, the scientists say there is a statistical indication that there is a causal link between Alzheimer's Disease and fatty acids. But a clinical trial is necessary to confirm the link.

Dr Legido-Quigley added: ""Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet - through fatty fish or via supplements. However, we need clinical trials to determine if shifting the lipid composition can influence the biological trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease.""

Dr Asger Wretlind, first author of the study from King's College London, said: ""Scientists have known for some time that more women than men are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. The results are very striking and now we are looking at how early in life this change occurs in women.""

Dr Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK says: ""In the UK, two in three people living with dementia are women. This could be linked to living longer, or other risk factors like social isolation, education, or hormonal changes from the menopause being at play.

""While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet could have a role. Future research should also be carried out in a more ethnically diverse population to see if the same effect is seen.

""Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice. Alzheimer's Research UK is proud to be funding this work that will bring us a step closer to a cure.""

The research was supported by funding from LundbeckFonden and Alzheimer's Research UK.

The U.S. government plans to take a 10% stake in Intel, President Donald Trump told reporters Friday. Bloomberg was first to report the news, which pushed the semiconductor chip company's stock up more than 7%. Trump said Intel has agreed to the proposal.

Intel declined to comment. 

The news comes during a pivotal — and recently volatile — time for Intel. CEO Lip-Bu Tan is currently restructuring the chipmaker, shuttering certain divisions and laying off workers in a bid to focus on its core businesses and catch up to rivals like Nvidia.

Earlier this month, Trump pushed Tan to resign because of perceived conflicts of interest. Tan later met with Trump to find out a way to assuage the president and figure out ways for the company and government to work together. 

While speaking to the White House press pool, Trump acknowledged the resignation push.

“I said well if that's right he should resign and he came in and he saw me we talked for a while. I liked him a lot,” Trump said, according to emailed comments from the press pool. “I thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim but you know nobody's a total victim I guess, and I said, you know what, I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel. And he said, I would consider that. I said, well, I'd like you to do that because Intel's been left behind as, you know, compared to Jensen. And some of our friends Nvidia.”

Trump continued, “I said I think it would be good having the United States as your partner. He agreed. And they've agreed to do it and I think it's a great deal for them and I think it's a great deal.” 

Such federal government ownership of a major corporation would mark a dramatic departure from long-standing U.S. policy. Government equity stakes in private companies are extremely rare in the U.S. and highly controversial, with notable exceptions occurring during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the government took temporary ownership stakes in companies like General Motors, AIG, and a few major banks to prevent economic collapse.

The government systematically sold those stakes back to private investors over the following several years.

The Intel deal, which is expected to be announced later Friday, comes days after the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank agreed to make a $2 billion investment in Intel. That deal was couched as a commitment to advanced technology and semiconductors in the U.S. Under that agreement, SoftBank agreed to buy Intel common stock at $23 per share. Intel shares were trading around $25 on Friday afternoon.

TechCrunch has reached out to the White House for comment.

In a meta-analysis assessing first-line treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), atezolizumab plus bevacizumab demonstrated the highest overall probability of delaying deterioration across key quality-of-life (QoL) domains and outperformed other treatment options when integrating health-related QoL with overall survival benefits.

""This network meta-analysis provides robust evidence that immunotherapy-based combinations, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, offer the most favorable balance between survival benefit and QoL preservation in advanced HCC,"" the authors wrote. 

The study, led by David James Pinato, MD, MRes, PhD, Imperial College London Hammersmith Campus, London, England, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

The analysis relied on aggregate data, which limited patient-level insights. Heterogeneity in health-related QoL assessment tools and definitions of deterioration across studies affected comparability. The composite endpoint assumed independence between survival and QoL. Additionally, HR-QoL data were unavailable for some regimens due to inconsistent reporting.

The study received funding from multiple sources, including the European Society for Medical Oncology, UK National Institute for Health and Care Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, European Association for the Study of the Liver, Cancer Research UK, and the European Union's NextGenerationEU. Several authors reported receiving consulting fees or personal fees and having other ties with various sources. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Chivu: ‘Time to give something back to Inter'","https://football-italia.net/chivu-time-to-give-something-back-to-inter/","Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:16:40 GMT","

Cristian Chivu believes ‘the time has come to give something back' to Inter as their new coach, but he is not concerned at the age of their defensive line.

The Nerazzurri begin their campaign at home to Torino on Monday at 17.30 UK time.

Chivu already made his debut on the bench at the FIFA Club World Cup, which means their pre-season was shorter than usual and the schedule thrown off.

“We've been working hard for three weeks and had the opportunity to play four friendly tests too,” he told DAZN Italia.

“I saw some good things and some that didn't go so well, but that's understandable at this stage of the summer. What I liked was that we didn't have any serious injuries, as more than the result, it was important to keep an eye on the minutes each player had in his legs.

“We are starting to see some of the ideas and tactical principles that we tried to introduce.”

The attempt to sign Giovanni Leoni from Parma was scuppered by Liverpool, so Inter are left with perhaps the oldest defensive line in Serie A this season.

“I don't look at the age of players, I look at their motivation, passion and desire to prove themselves every day. You do your talking on the pitch with motivation, discipline and hard work. These are more fundamental to me than your age.”

Inter are still active on the transfer market and secured midfielder Andy Diouf today from RC Lens for €20m plus €5m in add-ons.

“We have the same ideas on what players we need to add to this squad, but there is still time to get certain deals over the line. We don't want to add quantity, but quality, people who can help raise the overall level of the group,” noted Chivu.

Simone Inzaghi left with his only season empty-handed, having finished runner-up in Serie A, the Champions League, and the Supercoppa Italiana.

“Inter's objective is to be competitive on all fronts, whether it's the Scudetto, Champions League or Coppa Italia, because I often see that tournament left out. We must be competitive and give our best, aim for 38 wins out of 38, even if it's generally impossible, but that has to be the mentality.”

Chivu's only previous senior coaching role was at Parma for a couple of months, so taking over at Inter is a huge step for the former defender and youth academy boss.

“This is a big responsibility for me and a wonderful one too. I've been with this club for a while, in other roles, and had wonderful years together that saw me grow as a man, a person, and a coach. Now the time has come for me to give something back to this club.”

The US Open is the fourth and final Grand Slam on the tennis calendar.

Thousands of fans will flock through the gates at Flushing Meadows to witness the entertaining action unfold.

The raucous yet special atmosphere at Flushing Meadows adds to the brilliance displayed on some of the world's finest courts.

It remains to be seen which players will conquer New York and lift the coveted US Open title, and the tournament has drawn attention from stars in other sports.

The likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner lead the way for the men's favourites to win the US Open title.

Sinner is the world number one and defending champion, while Alcaraz claimed the Cincinnati Open title on Monday.

Furthermore, Novak Djokovic, who is aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title and a fifth at the US Open, cannot be counted out.

But Sky Sports asked Premier League footballers Rodri and Alexis Mac Allister who they would pick to lift the title, and they threw their support behind Alcaraz.

“I will say Carlos,” Rodri answered, before MacAllister added: “Today Sinner and Alcaraz are up there, so I'm going to go with Alcaraz.”

Sinner and Alcaraz are the world's top two players and they have contested the last four tournament finals they have entered, two each at Grand Slam and Masters 1000 level.

They have firmly established themselves as the leading men of this era of men's tennis, and the French Open final illustrated how phenomenal their matches can be when both are at their best.

Despite their intense and fierce rivalry on court, Alcaraz stressed the fact he has a good relationship with Sinner both in an outside of tennis.

“Trash-talking gets a lot of attention. People really like the idea that there is friction between us,” Alcaraz told The Financial Times. “That's what sells.

“But although tennis is an individual sport, we are with the same players every week, day in and day out … Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it.

“We talk, we train together sometimes. And in the end you forge a good relationship, a beautiful relationship. We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter. For me that is one of the virtues and values of sport.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

...

NEW YORK (AP) — There was a time, not all that long ago, when any conversation about the up-and-coming U.S. players in men's tennis included a reference to Sebastian Korda. He made it to the fourth round of the 2020 French Open as a 20-year-old qualifier ranked No. 213 before losing to his idol, Rafael Nadal.

The following year, Korda became the youngest American man to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick was a semifinalist there in 2003. And in 2023, Korda made it to the first Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career at the Australian Open.

Injuries derailed Korda's progress, though, including surgery on his right elbow last year and a stress fracture in his right shin this year. He was sidelined following the French Open in May until this week, when he returned to the tour at the hard-court Winston-Salem Open, a chance to prepare for the U.S. Open, which begins Sunday.

“It was a long time,” the 25-year-old Korda, who reached the Winston-Salem Open semifinals but withdrew because of an illness Friday, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But it's nice to be playing again.”

He grew up in as sports-forward a family as there is: His parents were professional tennis players — Mom, Regina, was ranked in the top 30, and Dad, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open and was the runner-up at the 1992 French Open — and his sisters, Nelly (ranked No. 1 until recently) and Jessica, are professional golfers.

After the shin problem was confirmed by an MRI exam, Korda needed a bit of a break, and only was back to hitting balls at 100% about two weeks ago. But he didn't exactly come to a complete stop before that, still swinging a racket while sitting on a chair and wearing a boot to protect his leg.

“It's been a lot of fun being back out here and running around,” Korda said. “Something I won't ever take for granted again is being able to run pain-free.”

Just about exactly a year ago, he was at a career-high No. 15 in the ATP rankings thanks to winning the title in Washington and making it to the semifinals in Montreal.

Back then, there was little reason to believe he wasn't ready to keep on climbing, right alongside other Americans such as Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

But Korda's body wouldn't let him. First, he was out of action because of the operation on his elbow. Then came the trouble with the shin.

When the rankings points he earned in Washington and Montreal came off his record because he missed both events this year, Korda slid all the way down to No. 86.

Before getting to Winston-Salem, Korda had competed in only 21 matches in 2025, going 11-10.

“I definitely haven't been playing healthy. That's kind of the main goal right now,” Korda said. “I'm not comparing myself to anyone, but definitely, there's a lot of motivation from seeing your peers doing so well — Ben, Taylor, Frances, Tommy, (Alex) Michelsen, Learner (Tien). They're all pushing each other. We're all pushing each other.”

Jones narrowly missed out on automatic qualification

US Open 2025

Venue: Flushing Meadows, New York Dates: 24 August-7 September

Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website & app

Less than a couple of minutes after reaching the US Open for the first time, Francesca Jones rummaged in her racquet bag and grabbed her mobile phone.

The 24-year-old Briton wanted to ring her mother Adele, who is back home in the UK because she could not get a dog sitter.

Sharing the elation of coming through three rounds of qualifying was Jones' instant reaction to beating Dutch opponent Arianne Hartono.

""My parents don't get to travel with me everywhere so I made sure I can share those moments with them as soon as I can,"" Jones told BBC Sport after sealing her place in the main draw in New York.

""I want them to feel as part of it as possible, considering how much they've sacrificed to give me opportunities. 

""They're not here because a dog sitter wasn't available – the dogs come first!""

After sealing her 6-2 6-4 victory with an ace, Jones covered her face with joy and ran over to hug the members of her team sitting courtside. 

Jones was born with a genetic condition which means she has three fingers and a thumb on each hand, three toes on her right foot and four toes on her left.

Doctors told the Yorkshire-born player to forget about playing tennis professionally - but she beat the odds after moving to Spain as a teenager.

Learning her craft on the clay was a different path to many Britons, and her way into the US Open main draw has been typically unconventional.

Jones was the top seed in the women's qualifying draw after just falling short of the cut-off date for automatic entry.

Since then, she has cracked the world's top 100 for the first time, moving up to 86th after winning back-to-back titles on the WTA 125 tour - the rung below the main tour.

""I've always done things differently - so why should I change now?"" Jones said.

Jones, who has never won a main-draw Grand Slam match, held a commanding position against Ukraine's Yuliia Starodubtseva before losing 1-6 6-3 6-1.

Instead of wallowing in self-pity, or heading to the practice courts, she chose to get back to match action straight away - promptly winning the 125 events in France and Italy.

""Wimbledon was extremely hurtful and previously I've not dealt with those situations well,"" Jones added.

""But it's your choice how you back up that situation. Previously I've taken time to get over it, but this year I felt I needed to be efficient, using maturity and experience.

""I stuck to my guns and did want I felt was best for my career.""

Jones joins fellow Britons Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the women's singles main event which begins on Sunday.

Reaching the main draw means she has claimed $110,000 (£81,238) in prize money and now she waits to see who she will face in the first round.

In the men's event, British men's number six Billy Harris fell at the final qualifying hurdle as he lost 6-3 6-4 to Hong Kong's Coleman Wong.

The 30-year-old had been the last British qualifier standing, meaning Jack Draper, Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley will represent Britain in New York.
