                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent Capitol Hill hearing has reignited debate over Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. In a May UAP briefing, physicist Dr Eric Davis, known for his work on top-secret Pentagon projects, stunned listeners by referencing alleged alien species, 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians,' as potential operators of unidentified craft. Davis described these entities as humanoid, approximately human-sized, and possibly linked to classified reverse-engineering programs. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.' Burlison, a self-described skeptic, admitted uncertainty about Davis's sources, noting the physicist's comments may stem from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports. 'If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment,' Burlison said. Dr Eric Davis (left) described these entities as humanoid, approximately human-sized, and possibly linked to classified reverse-engineering programs. The couple described being taken by small humanoids with smooth gray skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and lacking typical human features like noses or ears. Nordics are described as tall, slender beings resembling Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Often linked to the Pleiades star cluster, these entities are said to possess advanced technology and peaceful intentions, featuring prominently in 1950s contactee and UFO lore. Insectoids, meanwhile, have been part of alien mythology since at least the early 1900s, with roots tracing back to Georges Méliès' 1902 film 'A Trip to the Moon.' These beings exhibit insect-like traits such as multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae. The reptilian theory, claiming shape-shifting reptilian aliens secretly control Earth, surged in popularity through conspiracy theorist David Icke in the late 20th century. Interestingly, similar half-human, half-serpent figures appear in ancient South and Southeast Asian myths, such as the Nāga. Another is Grays, described as small humanoids with smooth gray skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and lacking typical human features like noses or ears While Davis named each of these in May, Burlison leaned toward a more earthly explanation, suggesting UAPs are likely advanced human-made technologies, perhaps experimental projects by private contractors. However, Burlison expressed frustration at the thought of such technology existing, recalling how he sat delayed on a tarmac for three hours due to weather, joking, 'If we have advanced propulsion, I'm going to be really angry.' Insectoids, meanwhile, have been part of alien mythology since at least the early 1900s, with roots tracing back to Georges Méliès' 1902 film 'A Trip to the Moon.' These beings exhibit insect-like traits such as multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae Davis named each of these under oath in May as the beings invading Earth's skies. Pictured is a shot from the 'Go Fast' video that was released in 'Some will think we're nuts,' Burlison acknowledged, aware of the skepticism his comments invite. Yet he defended the investigation, emphasizing that taxpayer money funds Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs. However, he insisted that any such discoveries should not be hidden. While remaining cautious about extraterrestrial claims, Burlison plans to press Dr Davis for clarification on whether his startling remarks come from direct knowledge or secondary reports. The reptilian theory, claiming shape-shifting reptilian aliens secretly control Earth, surged in popularity through conspiracy theorist David Icke in the late 20th century 'Some will read the headline and go about their day,' he predicted, citing human behavior's tendency to normalize even earth-shattering news. However, he stressed that any such revelation should not be kept secret. 'I believe that this government belongs to the people. It's not that the people don't belong to the government,' he said, arguing that withholding paradigm-shifting discoveries would betray public trust.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prince Harry confessed in his autobiography Spare that he had turned to a spirit guide to invoke his late mother, Princess Diana of Wales, who had a great interest in the mystical world and turned to her personal psychic, Sally Morgan, up to three times a week. But an inclination and interest in paranormal events and esotericism is not exclusive to the youngest son of Charles III and Lady Di, but shared by the British royal family in general. Biographer Robert Hardman, in the latest episode of the Daily Mail podcast Queens, Kings and Dastardly Things, released on August 7, recalled a story related to the royals and the paranormal: it occurred one night in 1953 when Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance to connect with her deceased father, King George VI. To address the situation, Elizabeth II's mother contacted a local parish priest in 1953 to perform a “religious cleansing ceremony” inside the room, inviting her daughter and her lady-in-waiting, Prue Penn, to attend. There was no dramatic expulsion of demons, as you see in the movies. The room was said to house a tormented spirit, and the parish priest was supposed to bless the space,” Hardman explains in his conversation with his co-host, Kate Williams, about an anecdote first reported in 2000 by the late Kenneth Rose, royal biographer and journalist. Although, as Rose speculated at the time, “No one was quite sure who the ghost was supposed to be.” As Hardman and Williams explain in their podcast, they believe the Queen Mother decided to conduct the séance to show her servants that they took their concerns seriously. And Harman adds her own impressions of the attendees: “It was particularly odd that Elizabeth II attended, given her cynicism about this kind of wild theory. The late Queen had a strong faith, but she wasn't superstitious. She didn't have time for such theories, but she did have a strong sense of the spiritual, as King Charles III does.” Among them, one starring Lilian Bailey, the royal family's trusted medium, stands out after she forged a friendship with George VI's speech therapist, Lionel Logue. On an unspecified date, the psychic was contacted to conduct a private session with clients who, at first, remained anonymous. Bailey was taken blindfolded from her home in Wembley to a house in Kensington, where she entered a trance and shared various messages from the beyond. During the Victorian era (1837-1901), it was fashionable to turn to spirit guides, and the monarch was no exception. According to The King of UFOs, she turned to medium Robert Lees to help her communicate with her late husband, Prince Albert, after the Birmingham psychic impressed her with a reading when he was 13. He later channeled the monarch's former husband through one of his trusted aides, John Brown, whose ghost was later perceived by Elizabeth II. Their hackles go up and they start to growl so I never go without them and I never stay the night there,'” former royal butler Paul Burrell told the Daily Mirror newspaper on January 22, 2024. The list of paranormal occurrences at British royal residences goes on. Paranormal historian Richard Felix claims in the aforementioned documentary that “all of their properties have ghosts, they know it, and they've witnessed it. The King [Charles III] has seen the same ghost, and his grandfather George VI saw Queen Elizabeth I eight times in the library before the start of World War II.” Other ghosts sighted at Windsor include George III muttering “what” over and over again, and Henry VIII moaning and groaning because of his ulcerated leg, British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Vanity Fair in an October 30, 2024, piece. According to her son, Tom Parker Bowles, the Wiltshire mansion where he grew up was haunted. “As a child, he found the rooms frightening. There were a lot of very rational people who, in the middle of the night, would get in a car and drive back to London because something had gotten into their bed, and it was a spirit,” he recounted on Gyles Brandreth's Rosebud podcast on September 26, 2024. And, as John West writes in his book Britain's Ghostly Heritage, Charles and a staff member fled Sandringham Library in terror. Felix claims that Anmer Hall, the current residence of William, Prince of Wales, and Kate Middleton, is haunted: “There was a ghost of a Catholic priest who had his residence there, and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered for high treason, and for some reason, he has now returned home.” As long as ancient castles and monarchies exist, stories of hauntings will continue to intrigue and appear in the media. In July 2024, a royal follower shared footage with Radar Online of what appeared to be the ghost of Elizabeth II holding her iconic Launer handbag in a room at Windsor Castle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPRINGFIELD — America's Top Psychic Medium is returning to MGM Springfield this month for another round of live readings. "What makes my upcoming show at MGM Springfield so special is that it will be completely different from the last," said Matt Fraser, New York Times bestselling author and star of “Meet the Frasers” on E! Fraser has received global regard for his ability to connect with the “Other Side” and share messages from audience members' loved ones who have passed. His readings have turned skeptics into believers for including names, dates and other details that he could not possibly have known. They bring with them memories, validation, and undeniable proof that the afterlife is real,” Fraser said. Fraser will bring his live audience reading event to the Aria Ballroom on Saturday, Aug. 23 at 8 p.m. A meet and greet with Fraser will begin at 6 p.m. Fraser has amassed more than 100 million views across social media and his live shows are often a sell-out event. He has caught the attention of celebrities like Kelly Clarkson, who said of Fraser: “He sees dead people! “I have a really good track record with turning skeptics into believers,” he said in a 2024 interview with The Republican. Tickets to Fraser's MGM Springfield event begin at $45. Early reservations are strongly encouraged, and tickets can be purchased on MGM Springfield's website. “Whether you've been to one of my events before or this is your first time, get ready for a brand-new experience filled with healing, connection, and unforgettable moments,” Fraser said.

Inspiring Business by Sharing Success

Added by Love Business East Midlands | 8 August 2025

Established in 1996, UAP Group is home to six product brands including the well-known Fullex door lock. The business has previously been backed by Maven Capital Partners, who Browne Jacobson also acted for.

UAP Group serves customers across the UK and holds nearly 200 patents, trademarks, and registered designs, including for its pioneering Armasmart range, the industry's first door hardware range to eliminate 99.98 per cent of viruses, including Covid-19.

Following completion of the deal, UAP now reports into the Allegion International segment, with founder and chief executive David Jennings remaining to drive the combined growth strategy.

The Browne Jacobson team was led by Partner Ryan Brown, Senior Associate Bethany Grummit, Associate Bennedetta Cocconi, and Samuel Moore provided tax advice. 

Ryan Brown, Partner at Browne Jacobson, commented: 

"UAP has been a long-standing client of the firm, having supported it on a range of matters including acquisitions over the past few years. This is another great story for a fantastic north-west based business which has been supported by a local private equity firm, has continued to grow and then attracted interest from multi-national acquirers. It is also a great example of the increasing confidence that exists for M&A in this sector, which we highlighted in our inward investment report.”

The transaction delivered a strong return for both Maven Investor Partners and Maven's institutional buyout fund, following a successful buy-and-build strategy that integrated five complementary businesses to broaden UAP's product and service range.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, the topic of UFOs—or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs)—has surged into mainstream political and cultural conversations. Among the voices taking a serious look at these mysteries is Vice President J.D. Vance, who has openly expressed his fascination and concern over the growing evidence of unexplained objects in our skies. As L.A. Marzulli shared, Vance discussed UFOs candidly on the Ruthless Podcast, acknowledging the many puzzling videos and reports that have emerged in recent years. “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet,” Vance admitted, “but we're only six months into the administration.” His comments reflect a growing political interest in uncovering the truth behind these phenomena, especially as they continue to appear in military and civilian airspace. Marzulli, a prominent researcher and host known for his work on the supernatural and UFO topics, highlights Vance's involvement as a key moment in public awareness. Marzulli also issues a stark warning that goes beyond politics: UFOs represent what he calls the coming great deception, a spiritual and global event that many are not prepared for. “Do we have a form of religion but deny its power?” Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! This silence, he argues, leaves many vulnerable when these mysterious crafts become impossible to ignore. Marzulli's grim prediction is that when the Rapture occurs, these alien crafts will arrive openly. This convergence, he warns, will cause massive confusion and challenge believers' faith in unprecedented ways. Marzulli laments that the church remains largely silent, failing to prepare its people for what he calls a “mega lever” — a game-changing event that will alter paradigms globally in an instant. He speculates these drones could be searching for hidden “dirty bombs” with radioactive material, a theory that underscores the layers of danger beyond just the UFO phenomenon itself. Meanwhile, voices like Marzulli are urging the church to awaken and prepare, because the coming great deception is not just about technology or politics—it's a challenge to faith itself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural is rated TV-14, which means that it includes violence, magic, and supernatural creatures but usually doesn't go as far as an R-rated movie. Supernatural excels at storytelling and weaving different elements into a highly entertaining narrative. Almost hardly repeating itself, the show has delivered many episodes that can be considered horror masterpieces despite their family-friendly nature. "Bloody Mary" plays around one of the most well-known legends in America and sees three girls who didn't believe the curse of Bloody Mary, dare each other to summon her in front of the mirror. Aided by jump scares and horrific character designs, the episode features a famous vengeful spirit responsible for giving many people nightmares at night. Supernatural incorporated elements from the Japanese film Ringu to create a uniquely terrifying portrayal of the figure that's rarely been seen in other media. Revolving around the mysterious deaths that occur in a town, Sam and Dean trace the trail to an old house in "Playthings," where their investigation leads them to the realization that a little girl's imaginary friend isn't purely imaginary. This episode of Supernatural handles it expertly and delivers the reveal in a shockingly satisfying manner without spoiling the fun ahead of time. The creepy house that's full of dolls is easily misleading, which not only serves to distract viewers from figuring out the truth but also paints an eerie mood. From disappearing dolls to strangely twisted doll heads and a dollhouse that mysteriously depicts a murder scene, the episode is rich in horror elements, perfect for fans with an appetite for suspense and mystery. Notably, "Playthings" also doesn't feature any dull moments after the plot twist. Sam and Dean Winchester have worked on many fascinating cases, but the case that Jo brought to them still beats most. In "No Exit," Jo, eager to follow her father's path to becoming a hunter, defies her mother's wish and goes on a hunt with the Winchester brothers, and the episode sees them tracking down the ghost of America's first serial killer, H.H. Holmes, who hunted his victims through secret pathways in the walls. Instead of a real person, the ghost of a serial killer becomes an evil entity that can't be killed. It lives in the walls and sneaks up on its victims like Pennywise. Filled with creepy details, jump scares, humor, and a bit of romance, the episode has a little bit of everything, but what makes it shine is the execution of the story. Dr. Ellicott used his power on Sam and turned him against Dean, who fought his younger brother and burned the doctor's corpse. Talking about having everything in one place, "Asylum" is a neat little episode that's emotionally layered. Horror fans are no strangers to seeing scary mascots. From Five Nights at Freddy's to Terrifier, mascot horror movies have already become a subgenre. However, this supernatural episode still brings something terrifying and refreshing to the genre. Whoever puts on the costume becomes a slasher and goes around killing innocent people. The giant bunny's head also doesn't come off easily. As an episode with feature film potential, "Plush" further sees Sam and Dean try to solve the mystery behind the bunny's head. Combining crime-solving with horror, the episode has a good storyline that's not too complicated to understand. There are scenes where the bunny is captured and investigated (instead of running around purely as a slasher), which significantly add to its creepiness. Bottom line, the episode does something so obvious but somehow hard to come by in the horror genre, which makes it a must-watch for mascot horror fans. "Bitten" is one of the more unconventional episodes where Supernatural experiments with form. Consisting of footage of a unique student film made by college students who were turned into werewolves, the episode follows their story and sees Sam and Dean unknowingly being featured in their project while in town to investigate a case. What makes "Bitten" an impressive horror piece is the story's emotional weight. She became someone that the viewers can invest in. The Winchesters also made a rare decision by sparing her, which makes this gruesome episode even harder to forget. Much like an R-rated movie, it continues to see more inanimate objects coming "alive." What makes this episode more complex than most horror movies is its complexity and how unexpected the plot twists are. It doesn't follow the same exact pattern of a vengeful spirit, with each murder taking place in a different town. On top of that, the episode uses Annabel-esque techniques to create a disturbing, eerie mood. "Mannequin 3: The Reckoning" has it all: emotional depth, brilliant storytelling, and interesting characters. "Provenance" follows Sam and Dean's investigation into a young couple's murder after they purchased an antique painting of a family portrait. They quickly realized that whenever the painting went, death followed. Revolving around a haunted object, the episode explores themes of legacy, trauma, and unresolved family issues. Sam, still haunted by Jessica's death, had issues with letting her go, and this episode saw him taking a step forward with a new love interest. "Provenance" is creepy and unsettling, layered with horror elements, but at its core, the episode is about resolution and letting go of the past. As a horror-filled episode, "Provenance" has depth that is rare to come in the horror genre, which makes it easily stand out. The episode contains a twist that many didn't see coming. "Mystery Spot" features a Happy Death Day-style premise, where Sam is stuck in a time loop, but instead of him being the one who died and restarting the clock, he relieved Dean's death over and over again. Sam, unlike most horror movie protagonists, is witty and resourceful. The fact that he started paying attention to the people around him and figured out Loki's trick is refreshing, given that most horror movies see the protagonist give up and go into self-destruction mode before something comes up again. Dean died, but the clock didn't reset, and Sam had to live months believing he had lost his brother for good. Even though Loki eventually let the brother go, part of Sam would also wonder if Dean was going to die again (and so did the viewers). Not short of gory details and bloody kills, the episode is also packed with charming moments from Sam and Dean singing in the car to a head that refuses to die. Given it's set in the Supernatural's universe, seeing events unfold through Baby's point of view also has an effect on viewers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the effects were small, the findings support a long-standing theory that some people may develop interconnected systems of conspiratorial thinking, where one belief helps reinforce others. Although previous studies had shown that people who believe in one conspiracy theory tend to believe in others, there was little direct evidence about how these beliefs develop over time. One influential theory, proposed by psychologist Ted Goertzel in 1994, suggested that conspiracy beliefs could form a closed system, where each belief supports and amplifies the others. This model has been widely cited, but its central claim—that believing in one conspiracy theory increases the likelihood of adopting others—had not been tested in a way that could establish causality. To address this gap, a group of researchers from institutions in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany conducted two extensive longitudinal studies to examine how beliefs in various conspiracy theories influence each other over time. A well-known theory suggests this is because developing a belief in one conspiracy theory causes people to develop beliefs in others,” said study author Matt N. Williams, an associate professor at the School of Psychology at Massey University. But despite a lot of discussion about this idea in the academic literature, there haven't previously been any studies on the topic with a credible way of testing causal effects. I realized that by doing longitudinal studies it'd be possible to test whether people who develop a belief in one conspiracy theory are more likely to subsequently develop beliefs in other conspiracy theories.” This method allowed them to isolate changes within individuals over time, separating those from stable personality traits that might predispose someone to conspiracy beliefs in general. While none of the individual cross-lagged effects were statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the average effect across all 90 possible pairings was positive and significant. This pattern supported the idea that, for at least some people, adopting one conspiratorial belief can make it more likely they'll adopt others in the future. They preregistered their hypothesis that belief in any one conspiracy theory would positively influence belief in all others over time and laid out strict criteria for what would count as support or refutation of that hypothesis. One positive effect remained statistically significant even after a strict correction for multiple comparisons, and the average cross-lagged effect was again small but positive and statistically significant. “The results suggest that developing a belief in one conspiracy theory probably does make you more likely to subsequently develop beliefs in other conspiracy theories, but only very slightly!” Williams told PsyPost. “The effect sizes we found were statistically significant but very small.” “This lines up with one of our previous studies showing that people's levels of belief (or disbelief) in conspiracy theories tend to be quite stable over time. One concern is that the findings could be influenced by factors that change over time and affect belief in multiple theories, such as exposure to new information or political events. “Our paper was specifically focused on estimating causal effects,” Williams noted. “We did collect longitudinal data, and applied a form of analysis that can rule out one type of confounding variable—confounding variables that are stable over time. However, our studies definitely aren't as conclusive as a true experiment would be, and it is possible that our estimates of causal effects could be biased (upwards or downwards! “It's also worth mentioning that the two studies in this paper are about the effects of beliefs in different conspiracy theories on one another. They weren't designed to tell us anything about other consequences of belief in conspiracy theories. That's a different question, and other researchers have published on this topic. But to me, the fact that people are willing to entertain conspiracy theories isn't a bad thing in and of itself; real conspiracies do happen! That said, when beliefs about conspiracies become unmoored from reality, negative consequences can take place.” Another limitation is that the surveys may not accurately reflect participants' true beliefs. Factors such as social desirability bias, inattentiveness, or insincere responding could have distorted how people reported their agreement with the conspiracy theories. “Such insincere responses could possibly distort some of our findings in this research area. Some of my collaborators and I are therefore working on a study where we aim to find out more about insincere responding and how it affects research on conspiracy theories.” “I think it's important that research on conspiracy theories (or any topic, really) is done in a transparent fashion. The study, “Does Developing a Belief in One Conspiracy Theory Lead a Person to be More Likely to Believe in Others?,” was authored by Matt N. Williams, Mathew D. Marques, John R. Kerr, Stephen R. Hill, Mathew Ling, and Edward J. R. Clarke. Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to overestimate their own abilities and wrongly assume that others share their views, according to a new study. The findings highlight overconfidence as a key factor behind conspiracy belief. A new study used artificial intelligence to analyze over 75,000 Reddit posts and uncover the deep emotional toll QAnon beliefs take on families. The findings reveal widespread grief, fear, and strained relationships as loved ones struggle with ideological division. Psychologists have found that conspiracy theory beliefs may stem from spite triggered by feelings of social, existential, or cognitive disadvantage. The findings suggest that tackling misinformation requires addressing deeper social inequalities and psychological frustrations. People prone to conspiracy theories may share cognitive tendencies with those who experience delusional thinking. Two new studies suggest that biases like anomalous perception and impulsive reasoning help explain why some are more likely to embrace conspiratorial beliefs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has stated that she believes extraterrestrial life forms may exist, suggesting that there may be classified documents supporting her theory. Gabbard spoke about this topic during an interview with “Pod Force One,” the New York Post podcast. Gabbard has already done her part in this regard, diverting public attention from it by declassifying parts of former special prosecutor John Durham's report on the origins of the “Russiagate” scandal. The move was an attempt to reinforce the president's long-standing and repeatedly discredited claims that Democrats conspired to frame him. Although Gabbard refused to provide further details on classified information regarding the existence of alien beings in her new interview, she hinted that she still has unanswered questions about certain ambiguous incidents. “I still have a lot of questions around that,” she said of what the intelligence community officially calls UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). “I've heard what the public official line is. According to the federal administration, the flying objects were simply a combination of private, commercial, and government aircraft. However, this version has never fully convinced Gabbard. It was happening in different parts of the country… There's a lot of classified information about that”, she added. Vice President JD Vance has also said he is obsessed with UAPs. “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we're only six months in—we've been very busy,” he explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SETI has reviewed over one million objects for technosignatures as part of large-scale radio surveys, while new systems like LaserSETI are being constructed to monitor laser pulses across the sky, enhancing our detection capabilities for intelligent signals. Surveys reveal that a strong majority of scientists, especially astrobiologists, consider extraterrestrial life, at least in simple form, likely to exist elsewhere in the universe. SETI has reviewed over one million objects for technosignatures as part of large-scale radio surveys, while new systems like LaserSETI are being constructed to monitor laser pulses across the sky, enhancing our detection capabilities for intelligent signals. Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified promising biosignature gases like dimethyl sulphide in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light-years away, though confirmation remains pending. Projections suggest that even if alien civilisations are listening, two-way communication with beings beyond about 50 light-years would take at least half a century. Some models estimate a "contact era" could still be 400 years away. Debate continues over whether humanity should actively reach out via Active SETI. Critics emphasise the risks of revealing Earth's location without global consensus. While scientists widely acknowledge the possibility of extraterrestrial life, actual contact, especially involving intelligent beings, remains a distant prospect. Technological advances are improving detection potential, yet timelines span decades to centuries, with societal readiness still evolving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UAP Old Mutual's planned exit from the South Sudan's insurance market is facing legal resistance from former employees, who claim the company is attempting to flee the country with unresolved labour disputes and financial liabilities. “We have already submitted a request for a temporary injunction, which was expected to be issued by August 7, to prevent UAP from winding down operations pending the court's final decision,” Reech said. He accused the company of concealing its true closure timeline. “UAP claims it will cease operations over two years, but internal documents indicate they plan to shut down within 90 days,” Reech alleged. “They are trying to avoid liabilities that may arise from this case.” The case was initially set for final judgement in July but was delayed after the presiding judge was transferred, a development Reech suggested could complicate the employees' pursuit of justice. Former staff association chair Mading Jacob said: “South Sudanese courts have the authority to prevent UAP from leaving while legal matters are unresolved. We trust the judiciary will deliver justice.” If granted, the injunction could keep the multinational's South Sudan operations running until the labour dispute is resolved, setting a potential precedent for corporate exits in fragile markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 30 years after the first reports emerged, the mystery surrounding a small village in central Scotland remains as baffling as ever. Bonnybridge, near Falkirk, shot to global attention in the 1990s after a wave of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or what are now officially referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). Since then, more than 300 reports of unexplained activity have been recorded, making it one of the UK's most active areas for supposed other-worldly encounters. At its height, the story drew international media coverage, sparking theories of conspiracies, government cover-ups and even the possibility of a portal to another dimension. One of the earliest and most significant sightings occurred in January 1992. Local businessman James Walker was driving along a country road towards Droves Loan when he claimed to see something he could not explain. Malcolm Robinson, one of the UK's leading UFO and paranormal researchers, recalled: “He claimed that he saw a large triangular-shaped craft low down in the sky, which had small lights on its underside. He founded Strange Phenomena Investigations in 1979, Scotland's longest-running UFO research group, and has written extensively on unexplained sightings. At the time of the Bonnybridge sightings, local councillor Billy Buchanan took it upon himself to gather accounts from residents. By the end of 1992, he had documented over 200 separate incidents involving unusual lights, shapes and aerial objects. Despite repeated attempts by Buchanan to raise the issue at the highest levels of government, his calls for an official investigation were consistently ignored. He wrote to several ministers and even Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair in 1997, but received no formal response. “It is important to say that the term UFO means Unidentified Flying Object. It does not describe alien ships visiting the earth,” Robinson added. The growing number of reports soon drew widespread media attention. Local and national newspapers were quick to seize on the story, and television crews descended on the village. A public meeting was held in January 1993, as concerned locals sought answers. That November, broadcasters filmed a UFO watch event in Bonnybridge. By the mid-1990s, sightings from the area had featured in countless newspaper articles and were even explored on national television.

However, as the years went on, the wave of sightings gave way to scepticism, with critics accusing witnesses of seeking publicity or fabricating stories. Some national tabloids even ran claims of alien contact with villagers. Still, for many residents and researchers, the questions remain unanswered. And for some, it remains a mystery worth revisiting. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RIO RANCHO, N.M. — Students at one New Mexico school district could get some extra lessons this year on extraterrestrial life. The National UFO Historical Records Center is opening up their collection to teachers and students at Rio Rancho Public Schools for unique lessons in physics, history and critical thinking. This comes after the district gave the center some portable classrooms to house their hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents and other evidence. And in the UFO realm, it's just a really good subject matter to springboard into that critical thinking piece,” said Michael Baker, chief operating officer of Rio Rancho Public Schools. Archive volunteers met with teachers ahead of the school year. They gave them a rundown of what is in their filing cabinets. Ultimately, it is up to each teacher to decide on incorporating these UFO files into their lesson plans. The district is hosting an open house on this Saturday, Oct. 18. Any person with disabilities who needs help accessing the content of the FCC Public File may contact KOB via our online formor call 505-243-4411.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ghosts of War was released in 2020, it didn't get a lot of traction and gained mostly unfavorable reviews from the critics. From the current perspective, this horror film set in the penultimate year of World War II hits differently, with its effective mix of not only suspense and action but also supernatural and psychological aspects. Few films, however, offer truly interesting concepts within the genre wrapping, mostly content with finding new ways to introduce various monsters (most commonly, zombies) to the historical setting. And Ghosts of War, despite all the plot differences, leans towards the same idea, focusing on the way war shapes horrific moral dilemmas and showing how guilt and shame over certain actions or inaction can create their very own monsters and curses. In 1944, five American troopers of the 82nd Airborne Division arrive at a chateau located somewhere in rural France. The guys barely manage to settle in when strange, seemingly paranormal occurrences start happening all around them. German soldiers arrive and attack, but at this point, the Americans have already come to realize that what they're dealing with inside the house might be much more dangerous than the enemies they are trying to keep out. The Gothic setting of the mansion and all the potential chills that come with it can bring another reference to a supernatural horror set during WWII to mind—the unfortunate sequel to an already unnecessary remake, The Woman in Black: Angel of Death, which came out in 2014. Unlike the latter, though, Ghosts of War doesn't only utilize war as a backdrop to a classic ghost story about a vengeful spirit who wants retribution but incorporates it into the emotional core here: war isn't the background of the horror; it's the catalyst for it. Eric Bress isn't a novice in genre cinema, having previously worked on the Final Destination franchise—both the second and fourth films—as a screenwriter and having directed The Butterfly Effect. In Ghosts of War, which he both wrote and directed, he makes effective use of space, which remains pretty limited for most of the story, making it work for both horror and the prolonged action sequence depicting the attack by the Germans. Like many movies with a clear anti-war message, Ghosts of War has a very specific set of characters and a very particular cast that all help to sharpen the idea that most people who find themselves in the trenches aren't black and white heroes or villains. Here, however, he unexpectedly becomes the first and almost random victim, once again emphasizing the idea of war as the dark force that devours everything and everyone in its path. Other actors in the core cast fully contribute to this effect too. Brenton Thwaites plays the unit's commander, who does his best to lead but comes off just as confused as the men he's supposed to be in charge of. And Kyle Gallner, who hadn't fully reached his Scream King status at that point but already had several noticeable genre outings under his belt, seems to be channeling his experience in The Haunting in Connecticut, playing a character who is probably the most perceptive of the supernatural presence inside the mansion. Rounded out by Skylar Astin and Theo Rossi, this group comes off as a bunch of regular young men who are roughened and exhausted by the war, but try to stick to some semblance of normalcy by gathering around the fireplace and scaring each other by relaying terrible incidents as if they were campfire stories. In the context of the movie's broader meaning, though, there is another way to see this controversial ending. In its final sequence, Ghosts of War seems to be fully embracing its psychological horror origin, showing that the only way to deal with trauma is to go back to the roots of it and address it directly, instead of going through the soothing motions that are merely an illusion of moving forward.
