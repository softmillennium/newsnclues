                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lando Norris might be holding second place in the World Championship, but the McLaren driver feels that certain parts of his season so far were "not good enough". Norris' campaign initially looked to have started strongly when 2025 kicked off at the Australian Grand Prix in March, having won what turned out to be a chaotic wet-dry encounter. However, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri claimed four victories across the next six rounds, Norris had to wait until Round 8 in Monaco to stand on the top step again. But since Round 11 in Austria, the 25-year-old has bolstered his points tally by scoring three wins, with the most recent of these in Hungary seeing him cut Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points. When asked ahead of the race in Budapest to assess his season and give an insight into what his area of focus will be during the next few weeks, Norris explained: “Just what I've been doing really over the last month, two months. “Prior to that, [it was] not good enough, so in a harsh way, I would say I was pretty average before then. Since then, I think things have been a lot stronger. Earlier in the season, Norris spoke of how he had been spending time off social media, a move that he felt had allowed him to “do things that are productive”. With this in mind, the nine-time race winner was quizzed on how different his 2025 summer break might look in comparison to previous years. “It's not going to be that different,” he reflected. “So really, it's not any different to what I've done the last few years, which is a good thing.</p>
