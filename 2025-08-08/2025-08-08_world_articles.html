                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration notified shelter providers who care for unaccompanied migrant children this week that federal law enforcement agents will begin conducting in-person interviews of kids at shelters around the country, according to an internal notification obtained by CNN. In recent months, the Trump administration has targeted legal services for migrant kids in custody, made it more difficult for parents and guardians to retrieve their children from government custody, and directed federal agents to ask migrant teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country. While the administration says the interviews will be part of an ongoing effort to identify and root out potential criminal activity, immigrant and child advocates say the notification raises significant red flags and threatens to dismantle safeguards meant to protect migrant children. The internal notification received by providers this week refers to July guidance about an interagency federal team, which includes officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, that has been set up to identify, investigate and prosecute criminal activities relating to unaccompanied kids. But the notification is short on details, like how many children will be interviewed, for what purpose, and whether they will be able to have an attorney present. That's sparked concerns among immigrant advocates and experts who are now scrambling for answers ahead of the expected interviews. “It might cause harm (rather) than mitigate harm,” said Jennifer Podkul, chief of global advocacy for Kids in Need of Defense, a group that works with unaccompanied migrant minors. Podkul told CNN that she, along with other advocates and attorneys, already flag cases to federal law enforcement when concerns arise about trafficking or other criminal activities. For example, some of the children who may be questioned might include those placed into government custody after recent interior enforcement actions resulted in their parent or guardian being detained. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration over its handling of migrant children and claimed (often without evidence) that many of those kids are in danger. They've also expressed skepticism over the federal program designed to care for migrant children until they are placed with sponsors, who are generally parents or guardians already living in the United States. Former Biden officials refute that a large number of children are missing. Trump administration urges Supreme Court to allow divisive ICE patrols in California Trump administration officials argue, however, that sponsors weren't properly vetted amid the influx of minor arrivals. If necessary, cases are referred to law enforcement, which might include an interview with the child though it would likely happen off campus based on the circumstances. Currently, there are more than 2,000 children in the custody of ORR, according to federal data. Earlier this year, the Trump administration set up a makeshift “war room” in the HHS Washington, DC, headquarters to pore over sensitive data to track down migrant children and deploy federal authorities to the homes where children are residing after being released from custody. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is among the agencies involved in effort. “As of July 24, 2025, more than 59,000 of the backlogged reports have been analyzed and processed, resulting in more than 4,000 investigative leads, including fraud, human trafficking, and other criminal activity,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. Since Trump returned to the White House, ICE agents have taken around 500 children into government custody, CNN previously reported, either because their situations were deemed unsafe or because of immigration enforcement actions against sponsors, the majority of whom are the kids' parents or other family members. The guidelines require that staff meet with them in person before placing the kids, according to an email sent to staff and obtained by CNN. But it also notes that federal law enforcement agencies “may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors,” the email states. The potential involvement of federal enforcement agencies could exacerbate the already present chilling effect among immigrant families, many of whom are undocumented and who have children in custody, experts say.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We have no plans to recognize a Palestinian state. I don't know what it would mean to really recognize a Palestinian state given the lack of a functional government there," Vance said at a meeting at Lammy's country residence in the south of London. Speaking about the possible recognition of Palestine by London, Vance noted: "It's one of the things that we're to talk about. Obviously, the United Kingdom is going to make its decision. What the President has made very clear is our two goals are very simple right now, vis a vis the situation in Israel and Gaza. Number one, it's we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack innocent Israeli civilians ever again, and we think that has to come through the eradication of Hamas. On July 24, French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris would recognize the State of Palestine at the same UN General Assembly session in September. Israel retaliated by a military operation in the enclave trying to destroy Hamas' military and political structures and free all the abductees. In March, Israel broke a January ceasefire with massive strikes on the enclave. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States flopped.</p>

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Israel's security cabinet has approved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to take over and occupy Gaza City, forcibly displacing an estimated 1 million Palestinians sheltering there and establishing “camps” to confine Palestinians in an escalation of Israel's genocide. “The goal is to evacuate all Palestinian civilians from Gaza City to the central camps and other areas by October 7,” one senior Israeli official told Axios. “A siege will be imposed on the Hamas militants who remain in Gaza City, and at the same time, a ground offensive will be carried out in Gaza City.” “The Israeli Government's plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza strip must be immediately halted,” said UN human rights chief Volker Türk in a statement Friday. “It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible.” European leaders also criticized the plan, but took little action to stop it. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany, one of Israel's top foreign arms providers, is halting transfer of weapons that could be used in Gaza — though UN experts have previously said that states have the obligation to halt transfers of all, not just some, arms to Israel due to the high risk of them being used to violate international law. Meanwhile, even though the plan marks a major escalation of Israel's genocide, some of Netanyahu's extremist coalition partners still feel it doesn't go far enough. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said via a spokesperson on Friday that the plan “may sound good, but it's actually more of the same,” adding that it's “not Zionist,” per Times of Israel. Though he uses the lives of Israeli captives as reasoning for his opposition, Smotrich has previously called for Israel to fully take over and occupy Gaza regardless of the captives. We will stop being afraid of the word ‘occupation,'” Smotrich reportedly said at a far right conference in May. This would entail “no retreat from the territories we have conquered, not even in exchange for hostages.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated with additional information. Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine created an online "catalog" where Ukrainian children are offered up for adoption while sorted based on physical traits like eye or hair color, a head of a Ukrainian NGO said on Aug. 6, denouncing the practice as child trafficking. "Most children in this catalog were born in Luhansk Oblast before the Russian occupation and had Ukrainian citizenship," Mykola Kuleba, CEO of the Save Ukraine organization, said in an Instagram post. "Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction." Ukraine has identified more than 19,500 children abducted by Russia during the full-scale war and forcibly transferred to Russia, the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, or Belarus. Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure of abducted children could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000. Since 2014, Ukrainian children have appeared in Russian adoption databases. However, since 2022, the practice has become widespread and systematic," Kuleba noted on X. "Initially, Russian authorities tried to cover their tracks — shutting down registries and erasing references. Children are introduced with their photos, age, gender, and character traits, with some being described as "obedient" or "calm." "The way they describe our children is indistinguishable from a slave catalog. This is child trafficking in the 21st century, and the world must act to stop it immediately," Kuleba said. Russia has "streamlined" the system to such an extent that "a Ukrainian child can now be effectively 'ordered' online" and "stripped of their identity, issued a Russian passport, and subjected to ideological control" with a "single click," the NGO head said. The platform exposes the children to significant dangers, including sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illegal adoption, forced changes of name and identity, psychological trauma, and trafficking for organ harvesting, he warned. Save Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in 2014 to support vulnerable groups, namely orphans and children rescued from Russian-occupied territories. The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's children's rights officials for comment. Their return has remained a central demand in Ukraine's negotiations with Moscow. During peace talks in Istanbul, Russian officials dismissed Kyiv's appeal to return the abducted children as a "show for childless European old ladies," even as they admitted to relocating hundreds, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their personal roles in organizing the illegal transfers. "They (Russian troops) are now regrouping for further attempts, but remain positioned in Donetsk Oblast," said Victor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Dnipro group of forces. "Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction," said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization. More than three years later, the foreign fighters who remain are a different breed — driven by a deep commitment to Ukraine. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko are among Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest international allies. According to the source, two explosions near the unit's checkpoint killed at least 12 Russian soldiers and injured dozens more. Russian military equipment was also destroyed, they added. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna's death has become a stark symbol of Russia's systemic abuse of Ukrainian civilians and the brutal risks faced by journalists in occupied territories. The crude mixed with organic chloride, which was transported through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, could have seriously corroded infrastructure at OMV Petrom's Petrobrazi refinery, potentially triggering a national fuel crisis, G4Media reported. Barrels of Russia's Urals oil are now being offered at a discount to both state-owned and private Chinese refineries, Bloomberg reported. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said first-person-view (FPV) drones and night bombers were responsible for most of the hits. At the same time, five Ukrainian clubs have not received similar payments due to restrictions by a Swiss bank, allegedly because they are located in a "zone of military operations," the Guardian reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said the ceasefire deadline he set for Russia — scheduled for Aug. 8 — now depends on Vladimir Putin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking at her regular marathon morning news conference Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum offered pithy comments on her meeting the previous day with Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand. Ms. Sheinbaum spoke of wanting to improve relations with Canada, promote investment and have Prime Minister Mark Carney visit Mexico. She then mentioned Canadian mining companies – an old bugaboo for her political base. Canadian ministers to discuss trade in meetings with Mexican president and government officials But it also demonstrated her control of the national agenda, as she alone speaks for the country – with little accountability and no rejoinders from state governors or business leaders. Comments from opposition politicians are rebuked as unpatriotic, and Mexican media rarely press the President with tough questions. Ms. Sheinbaum boasts a 75-per-cent approval rating, according to newspaper El Financiero, while Morena and its allies hold supermajorities in Congress and control of most of the state governments. Her domestic political strength and dominance over the media landscape provide leeway for dealing with U.S President Donald Trump and making steep concessions without drawing a sharp outcry. “The fundamental difference” with Canada “is that President Sheinbaum can say whatever she wants publicly because there is no one in Mexico who will demand comments that correspond with the facts,” said Carlos Heredia, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, a Mexico City university. Ms. Sheinbaum addresses Mexico through her morning news conferences, where simple questions from pro-government influencers are the norm. She often downplays negative news with pledges of co-ordination and co-operation, all the while insisting that “Mexico is respected.” There are even attempts to find common ground with Mr. Trump, such as populist politics. “I think he respects us and we respect him for what we are: neighbours elected by our peoples,” she said July 31 after Mexico received a 90-day postponement of 30-per-cent tariffs. Left unsaid: the concessions made by Mexico and the increasingly heavy ask being made by Mr. Trump, who has accused Mexico of giving drug cartels free rein. They just wouldn't have the political capital or a population willing to do that,” he added. Champagne and Ms. Anand held a virtual news conference for the parliamentary press gallery after their first day of meetings in Mexico City. They spoke of rekindling relations with Mexico, deepening business ties and strengthening supply chains. But they dodged questions about how Mexico got a 90-day deferment. Ms. Sheinbaum described the reprieve as “a very advantageous condition for Mexico compared to any other country.” Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand pose at the National Palace in Mexico City on Tuesday as Ms. Sheinbaum looks on.Supplied/AFP/Getty Images The country also handed over 29 drug cartel bosses to U.S. justice officials and cracked down on fentanyl labs. And unlike Canada, Mexico has not imposed countervailing tariffs on U.S. goods. … It's absolutely out of the question,” Ms. Sheinbaum said Friday in response to story. And if we had to summarize Mexico's strategy, it's ‘live to fight another day,'” said Luis Antonio Espino, a Mexican political analyst based in Toronto. Ms. Sheinbaum has received a boost from domestic factors, too, such as social programs that provide seniors, single mothers and students with cash stipends of roughly $455 every two months. Why ‘elbows up' is Canada's rallying cry in the trade war against Trump's tariffs El Financiero put the figure at 86 per cent, according to a July survey. Analysts describe Mexicans as holding clear-eyed views of the United States. They never considered Americans to be close friends, have grown accustomed to receiving threats from U.S. leaders and remember being invaded twice by U.S. soldiers – losing half their territory in the Mexican-American War. But he does this very openly and rudely,” Mr. Espino said. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An inspection said Folkston immigration jail is “unsanitary and dilapidated.” Activists have called for it its closure. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Trump's budget allocates $45 billion for ICE detention centers through the end of September 2029. Folkston, a private prison run by The GEO Group, is not without considerable problems. “Folkston did not meet standards for facility conditions, medical care, grievances, segregation, staff-detainee communications, and handling of detainee property,” the report read. “We identified violations that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees.” Last year, Jaspal Singh, an Indian national, died after spending nine months in detention at Folkston. “We are heartbroken by Mr. Singh's passing while he was confined in this abusive and poorly managed facility that has been violating immigrants' human rights since ICE began detaining people there in 2017,” said Meredyth Yoon, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, in a statement calling for the facility's closure. U.S. Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter, R-Georgia, has heralded the new detention facility as a boon for Charlton County's economy, with the creation of 400 jobs and additional water and sewer revenue. Pew Research estimates around 200,000 Black immigrants, mostly from Jamaica, Haiti, and Nigeria, call metro Atlanta home. Capital B Atlanta spoke with Nana Gyamfi, executive director for The Black Alliance for Just Immigration, in June about why Black immigrants especially need to be on alert. “What we know from the data, as well as anecdotal experiences, is that most law enforcement interactions with Black immigrants begin as racial profiling that then goes down another road when the officer hears an accent or realizes there is a language barrier,” Gyamfi said. Brian Kemp has already been ramping up efforts in the state to support Trump's immigration. Then in May, Kemp signed House Bill 1105, requiring sheriffs to hold suspects believed to be in the country illegally if they are wanted by ICE. None of the sheriffs in metro Atlanta's five core counties are reportedly signed up to participate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. and Russia are seeking to reach a deal to cement Moscow's occupation of Ukrainian territories and end the war, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 8, citing undisclosed sources. U.S. and Russian officials are working on a territorial agreement, the sources told Bloomberg. Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the latter four regions in 2022 and insists on Ukraine's full withdrawal from them as part of a peace deal, even though it does not control them completely. The Kremlin is also pushing for formal recognition of its control over occupied Ukrainian territories. While Trump has reportedly signaled a willingness to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, Ukraine has firmly rejected this move along with any withdrawal from the territories it currently holds. As part of the deal currently under discussion, Russia may cease offensive operations in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts along existing front lines, according to Bloomberg's sources. The terms remain in flux and could be changed. It remains unclear whether Moscow is prepared to relinquish any of the territories it currently occupies, including Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, according to Bloomberg. Washington is reportedly trying to secure support from Ukraine and its European allies for the potential deal, which remains far from certain. The Trump-Putin meeting comes amid growing U.S. pressure aimed at cutting off Russia's war funding. Oil revenues make up roughly one-third of Russia's federal budget, and Washington is targeting those flows through secondary tariffs. The U.S. president issued an ultimatum to Moscow on July 28, demanding a ceasefire within 10 days or face severe U.S. sanctions. "They (Russian troops) are now regrouping for further attempts, but remain positioned in Donetsk Oblast," said Victor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Dnipro group of forces. "Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction," said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization. More than three years later, the foreign fighters who remain are a different breed — driven by a deep commitment to Ukraine. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko are among Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest international allies. According to the source, two explosions near the unit's checkpoint killed at least 12 Russian soldiers and injured dozens more. Russian military equipment was also destroyed, they added. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna's death has become a stark symbol of Russia's systemic abuse of Ukrainian civilians and the brutal risks faced by journalists in occupied territories. The crude mixed with organic chloride, which was transported through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, could have seriously corroded infrastructure at OMV Petrom's Petrobrazi refinery, potentially triggering a national fuel crisis, G4Media reported. Barrels of Russia's Urals oil are now being offered at a discount to both state-owned and private Chinese refineries, Bloomberg reported. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said first-person-view (FPV) drones and night bombers were responsible for most of the hits. At the same time, five Ukrainian clubs have not received similar payments due to restrictions by a Swiss bank, allegedly because they are located in a "zone of military operations," the Guardian reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Con Edison, city's monopoly utility, cut off 88,000 households in first half of 2025 as climate crisis drives extreme temperatures An energy company seeking to hike utility bills in New York City by 11% disconnected more than 88,000 households during the first six months of 2025, signaling a crackdown on families struggling to cover rising energy costs even as the climate crisis drives extreme temperatures. Con Edison, the monopoly utility that provides electricity to 3.6m homes across the country's largest city and neighboring Westchester county, disconnected almost 2.5% of all its customers between January and June this year – triple the total number of families left without power in 2024. One in five disconnected homes remain without power for at least a week. Heat-related deaths account for about 3% of all fatalities from May through September, making New York the second deadliest city for heat after Phoenix, Arizona. In the past five years, more than 40% of New Yorkers have fallen into arrears, and 23% of households were disconnected at least once – leaving families without access to a fridge, internet, cooking facilities and heat or cooling until they can find the money to pay for reconnection. Black and Latino New Yorkers are more than twice as likely as white residents to fall behind, and almost eight times more likely to have a utility shutoff, according to the 2024 Poverty Tracker/Robin Hood report on energy insecurity. “Disconnection is an effective cost recovery strategy but it's also completely inhumane. It's traumatizing for families and costs some people their lives,” said Diana Hernandez, co-author of the report and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University. “People want to pay their bills but they are unaffordable for too many families.” The disconnection numbers show that Con Edison is aggressively cracking down, and life is going to become harder for poor people in New York,” said Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada). There is no demographic breakdown but people of color, households with children, renters in small buildings, and people with pre-existing medical conditions who rely on electronic devices such as oxygen dispensers, as well as Bronx residents are all more likely to experience energy poverty and therefore a disconnection, the 2024 Robin Hood report found. A Con Edison spokesperson said: “Termination of service is a last resort, and we do so only after extensive outreach and exhausting all other options … nearly two-thirds of residential customers in arrears are on payment plans. Nationwide, an estimated one in three households experience energy poverty – the inability to access sufficient amounts of electricity and other energy sources due to financial hardship. Across New York state – and the country – a patchwork of regulations prevent some households from being shut off on very hot or cold days, but millions are not protected at all. Heat kills twice Black New Yorkers at twice the rate of white residents due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, healthcare, housing, energy and other systems that benefit white people and disadvantage people of color, the report found. Most deaths occur in homes without access to a functioning air conditioning. One study found that a fifth of renters do not use their air conditioner due to cost. According to its website, Con Edison currently suspends disconnections on the hottest and coldest days based on forecasts from the National Weather Service. It also suspends disconnections for two days after a 90F heat index day. Energy poverty is a chronic problem for many New Yorkers. New York state is the largest recipient of Liheap, the chronically underfunded bipartisan federal program that helped about 6m households keep on top of energy bills last year – and which narrowly survived being cut completely from Trump's 2026 budget. In fiscal year 2024-25, New York received $379m (almost 10%) of the total Liheap fund, and Governor Kathy Hochul invested an additional $35m to supplement support for heating bills in January after Liheap money ran out with months of winter still to go. Disconnections declined during the pandemic thanks to a statewide moratorium and debt forgiveness schemes, as well as child tax credits and a boost to food stamps among other federal programs that helped lift millions of Americans out of poverty. But the Covid-era social safety programs have now all been terminated, and recent focus groups conducted by Hernandez and her colleagues found people still struggling to recover and rationing energy use because they were so concerned about rising bills. Yet energy costs are about to get even higher in New York. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will make electricity production more expensive, leading to residents paying $140 a year on average more by 2030, according to analysis by Energy Innovation. The bill also slashes benefits such as Snap (food stamps) and Medicaid, which will put further pressure on millions of families. Con Ed's proposed electricity rate hike could raise the average household bill by $372 next year. “There needs to be strategies in place so that people will pay their bills – but to punish people who are poor by cutting off their electricity ever, but especially in extreme heat or wintertime, is inhumane. Con Edison said it provided $311m in bill discounts to income-eligible customers last year, and the regulator (PSC) recently expanded the Energy Affordability Program to help more vulnerable residents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A divided federal appeals court ruled on Friday that US District Court Judge James Boasberg cannot move ahead with criminal contempt proceedings against Trump administration officials involved in a high-stakes immigration case. The 2-1 ruling from the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals wipes away a ruling from Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama issued in April that said “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his orders in mid-March halting the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. The dissenting judge was an Obama appointee. The decision from the judges is another vote from Trump-appointed jurists in support of executive power and against Boasberg's ability in this case to sanction or even question the behavior of the Trump Justice Department. “The district court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Judge Greg Katsas wrote in a concurring opinion. Katsas, in his opinion, said he believed Boasberg's original orders to stop the removal of detainees on planes, which Boasberg found the Trump administration violated, were too ambiguous. Nor may we decide whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter. Perhaps it should warrant more careful judicial scrutiny in the future. Another Trump-appointed appellate judge, Neomi Rao, also wrote that a criminal contempt proceeding shouldn't happen. In a concurring opinion that was less sweeping about avoiding interbranch conflict than Katsas', Rao said contempt used by a judge as punishment couldn't be a “backdoor to obtain compliance” with a court order. Writing in dissent, Judge Nina Pillard, the Obama appointee, defended Boasberg in how he responded to the detainees' situation during his emergency hearing in mid-March. “Chief Judge Boasberg faced immense pressure to make a quick decision in a rapidly evolving, high-stakes situation. He performed that task calmly and with an even hand, bringing to bear his skill and wisdom as an experienced jurist,” Pillard wrote. She continued: “Even when faced with what reasonably appeared to him to be foot dragging, evasion, and outright disregard for his jurisdiction and his orders, he responded with unfailing composure. The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.” Attorney General Pam Bondi declared the court's ruling a “MAJOR victory” for Trump and his Justice Department, saying in a statement on X that Boasberg's ruling represented “failed judicial overreach at its worst.” The second broadside to Boasberg from the appeals court stemmed from an order he issued in June that required the officials to give hundreds of migrants a chance to challenge their designation as “alien enemies” who could be swiftly removed from the US. Last month, the group of about 250 Venezuelans who had been imprisoned in CECOT were flown back to their home country in exchange for 10 US nationals. The appeals court acknowledged those potential pathways in its ruling Friday, saying if some of them “do wish to proceed, they may be required to adjust their habeas and other claims to account for these changed circumstances.” Boasberg's ruling from June concluded that US officials had “improperly” loaded the migrants on to flights in mid-March and sent them to El Salvador without giving them a chance to challenge their designation as “alien enemies” subject to President Donald Trump's use of the sweeping 18th century wartime law. Earlier this year the Supreme Court, without deciding whether Trump had properly invoked the Alien Enemies Act, said officials must give migrants targeted under it a chance to contest their removal through so-called habeas petitions. The DC Circuit's unsigned opinion on this case included Katsas and Rao, as well as Judge Justin Walker, who is also a Trump appointee.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friend says Quornelius Radford, man accused of shooting five fellow soldiers at army base, was ‘bullied a lot' A friend of the man accused of gunning down five fellow soldiers at the Fort Stewart army base in Georgia earlier this week recounted how the suspect had been repeatedly bullied for having a serious stutter, according to a news report. The man in custody for the shooting, Sgt Quornelius Radford, 28, was relentlessly mocked and mimicked for his speech impediment, from the earliest days of his army career, NBC News reported on Thursday. It was very bad to the point where he could barely talk,” Sgt Cameron Barrett, 28, a friend of Radford's, said in an interview with the TV network. Another soldier who had worked alongside Radford earlier in his career said that the sergeant had also lost a loved one in a traffic accident in January, and had taken it hard. The suspect's father has said his son complained of experiencing racism. When initial reports that there was a shooting began to reach soldiers on the base south-west of Savannah, Barrett said to NBC that he messaged Radford to ask if he was all right, but did not get a response. Meanwhile, Sgt Aaron Turner recounted to the Associated Press that he was helping lock down a supply warehouse at Fort Stewart when he saw a fellow soldier walking past, wearing a hooded sweatshirt over his uniform and holding a handgun – after shots had already been fired. When he got close enough, Turner grabbed the soldier's gun and took him to the ground, where soldiers held him down until military police arrived. “I was able to keep a cool head, but pretty much my training ended up kicking in,” Turner said on Thursday. “It wasn't about my life at that point. Driscoll awarded each of them the meritorious service medal. Fort Stewart officials have not said why he opened fire, citing the criminal investigation. The battalion's commander, Lt Col Mike Sanford, said on Thursday that he's unaware of any problems with Radford or arguments that preceded the shootings. Radford's father, Eddie Radford of Jacksonville, Florida, said in an interview with the New York Times that his son had sought a transfer and complained to his family about racism at the base. Radford, who is Black, texted an aunt shortly before the shooting and “said that he loved everybody, and that he'll be in a better place because he was about to go and do something”, Eddie Radford said.</p>

BERLIN, August 8. /TASS/. Former military adviser to ex-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Brig. Gen. (Ret) Erich Vad described the upcoming meeting between the presidents of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, as "good news."

"It's good news that the presidents of Russia and the US want to meet to discuss an end to the conflict. In essence, the goal of European states and governments was to put an end to the conflict on the European soil," he told TASS.

Following a working meeting between Putin and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Wednesday, Trump said there was a good chance "that we could be ending" the Ukraine conflict and that there will be a meeting with both Putin and Zelensky. The New York Times reported that Washington is planning to hold a bilateral US-Russia summit, followed by trilateral talks with Zelensky. CNN reported later that the US leader has already tasked his team with preparing for both meetings as soon as possible.

According to Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov, the parties agreed to hold a face-to-face meeting between the two countries' leaders and preparations for the summit have already begun.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Belarus—nestled between the European Union, Ukraine, and Russia—has long been overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, who often see it as little more than an extension of Russia. Since 1994, he has transformed Belarus into a repressive state marked by fraudulent elections, systemic violence, and a deepening reliance on Moscow and Beijing. But five years ago, Belarusians made it clear that they do not want to live in a belligerent autocracy, isolated from the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. In 2020, I entered Belarus's presidential election to stop Lukashenko from claiming a sixth term. I didn't expect to win; Lukashenko had rigged every previous contest. According to independent observers, Belarusians overwhelmingly voted for me. Up to 1.5 million people flooded the streets of Belarusian cities demanding change. I was an English teacher and then a full-time mother focused on helping my hearing-impaired son. When he announced his candidacy in May 2020, the regime arrested him days later. I was forced into exile, along with many others. The demonstrations might have succeeded, if not for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To prepare for his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Putin needed Belarus as a launching pad. He thus propped up Lukashenko by sending in security advisers and other kinds of operatives, providing financial assistance, and signaling a readiness to intervene more intensely—saving Lukashenko's rule in return for obedience and Belarus's subjugation. Today, my country remains under de facto Russian occupation. Although Lukashenko was able to stop the protests, Belarusians still yearn for freedom. Operating outside the country, my colleagues and I are working to liberate our homeland. We have established a government in exile, staffed with Belarusian activists and defectors from the regime, prepared to take charge of rebuilding the country. We have formalized ties with American and European officials. Many countries now see me as Belarus's legitimate leader. We have even made inroads with regime insiders who are ready for change. The spirit of resistance, in other words, endures. And with it, so does the possibility of Belarusian democracy. It has its own language, history, and identity. Over 60 percent oppose Putin's deployment of nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil. They are evidence of a deep, pro-independence and pro-European orientation that the regime cannot extinguish. They have made it tricky for Putin to do as he wishes in Belarus, despite his and Lukashenko's tyranny. Putin failed, for example, to drag the Belarusian army into his war. Many Belarusians have even joined Ukraine's defense, forming the Kalinouski Regiment: the largest foreign volunteer unit in Ukraine's army. But even in exile, the Belarusian opposition has built a rare thing: a unified, credible, and ready alternative to dictatorship. We have formed the United Transitional Cabinet and Coordination Council, in which representatives are elected using digital tools. These bodies represent the democratic will of the Belarusian people and provide practical support to those still inside Belarus and to over half a million Belarusians now in exile. They serve as a viable structure of governance—a government in waiting. Our media platforms continue to reach millions inside Belarus, despite press restrictions. Inspired by a step taken by the Estonian government in exile that formed in the 1940s to oppose Soviet occupation, we have introduced a new Belarusian passport for exiles and drafted a new constitution. And we are carrying out a strategic dialogue with the U.S. State Department to increase pressure on the regime, to support our movement for freedom, and to ensure that Belarus remains on the international agenda and that it features in conversations about Europe's security architecture. These steps will help ensure that whenever Belarus has its next political opening, we can swiftly take action and turn the country toward democracy. Right now, such an opening may seem unlikely. But history shows that dictatorships often collapse unexpectedly—triggered by internal or external shocks. Lukashenko, for example, is aging, and discussions about an inevitable transition of power have already begun within the regime's highest circles. Unfortunately for them, the system he built is entirely centered on himself and lacks any legitimate or stable mechanism for succession. Unlike some autocrats, Lukashenko also has no viable heir. We are proposing a roundtable dialogue between representatives of the democratic forces and those in the regime who are ready to talk about change. The goal of such a roundtable is to achieve national reconciliation and end the political crisis through a peaceful, negotiated transition. Some of them are already leaking valuable information to us, including on how Minsk evades sanctions. These insiders could prove crucial when the window for change opens. That is why we keep quiet but active lines of communication with them. In fact, our task is to expand these contacts while maintaining the support of Belarusians and preserving pro-European sentiment. We are working to prevent Russian propaganda from poisoning Belarusian society. We are also defending what is left of Belarus's independence. For decades, Lukashenko tried to play Europe and Russia off each other, but today, he is entirely dependent on the latter. As long as he remains in power, Minsk will only more closely align itself with Moscow, to the point where Belarus could become little more than a Russian military outpost. If Belarus is free, Russia will no longer have the same military balcony in Europe, and that will reduce pressure on NATO's eastern flank and lower the bloc's defense costs. A democratic Belarus would contribute to digital innovation (the country has a top-notch IT sector), support energy diversification, and facilitate trade. But we do ask for help in making this transformation achievable. After the Belarusian election was stolen in 2020, they developed a three-pronged approach to support the Belarusian people: weakening Lukashenko's regime, supporting pro-freedom and pro-European aspirations, and assisting in an eventual transition. To that end, both imposed sanctions on the regime. The EU has even pledged over $3 billion to support Belarus through its democratic transition once it begins—a powerful signal that Belarus belongs in Europe. At times, I hear analysts call for a return to working with Lukashenko as a means of isolating the Kremlin, as if the two can be separated. Instead, the United States and Europe must double down on their support of Belarus's people through technical assistance for Belarusian civil society, independent media, human rights activists, cultural organizations, digital security tools, and diaspora networks. That support must be extended to exiles and our institutions. The United States and Europe must make sure we can keep building a strong, resilient alternative. Some U.S. and EU analysts may wonder whether regime change is feasible when Russia is so committed to keeping Lukashenko around. Morally, the future of Belarus is not for Moscow to decide, but in reality, much will depend on Russia's strength during any moment of crisis and on the outcome of its war against Ukraine. If Russia is weak and contained, then Belarus has a chance. For this reason, American and European officials cannot ignore Belarus as they begin to discuss cease-fires, Ukraine, and lasting peace in the region. Other states must ensure that Moscow won't interfere when change in Belarus begins—and that Belarus does not become a consolation prize for a defeated Putin. Even the threat of such actions could make a difference for Belarus's cash-strapped government. That is why we are also calling on other countries to support Lithuania's initiative at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice to hold the regime accountable for its crimes. We understand that ending Lukashenko's regime may require some kind of settlement: if Lukashenko were to step down voluntarily and agree to free and fair elections under international supervision, for example, other states could consider giving him and his family personal security guarantees. Too often, their actions stop at words of condemnation. Individual world leaders, however, are a different story. As I have met presidents and prime ministers—at the G-7, the UN General Assembly, and other global platforms—I have realized how crucial personal initiative truly is. I have witnessed bold leadership on Belarus from leaders such as President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Vice President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Perhaps most important, I have witnessed such leadership from U.S. President Donald Trump. It was during his first administration that the United States took decisive action against Lukashenko—action that largely shaped the transatlantic approach to Belarus. Trump appointed Julie Fisher as ambassador to Belarus. Trump has continued this strong track record during his second term in office. Retired general Keith Kellogg—the president's Ukraine envoy—secured the release of several Belarusian political prisoners, including U.S. citizens and my husband, Siarhei, who had spent five years in solitary confinement. I will be forever grateful to Trump and his team for this breakthrough. Lukashenko fears Trump's unpredictability, and so he chose to release Siarhei rather than risk stronger sanctions or some other escalation that could endanger his hold on power. Today, we urge Trump to go even further and use that same leverage to push for the release of the remaining 1,150 political prisoners. If his efforts succeed, Trump could score the greatest humanitarian victory for Belarus in modern history. Trump need not fear the consequences of deeper involvement. Unlike many global crises, Belarus is not mired in civil war, ethnic conflict, or ideological divisions. For Trump, this is a low-cost, high-impact opportunity. Belarus could become his foreign policy success story—one that sends a message to other entrenched authoritarian regimes, including in Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela, that they are not secure. To strengthen and coordinate these efforts, it is time to again appoint a U.S. special envoy for Belarus, just as Kellogg was appointed for Ukraine. This envoy can work closely with Washington's EU partners and our movement on releasing political prisoners, synchronizing sanctions policy, and ensuring that Belarus moves along the path of reform. I am confident that the U.S. Congress will support this approach. Belarus remains one of the few foreign policy issues that unites lawmakers across party lines. An updated version of the bipartisan Belarus Democracy Act—which has historically authorized support for Belarusian civil society, independent media, and political prisoners, while mandating sanctions against regime officials—is already being drafted, with both Democratic and Republican sponsors. It can serve as a blueprint for action. Yet it still requires being ready at a moment's notice. Even the most entrenched dictatorships can suddenly fall. They are also the values that inspire me to keep fighting, as are the thousands of families who are still waiting for their loved ones and the hundreds of thousands of Belarusians who remain in exile. The regime may have believed that releasing my husband would silence me. Some may say Belarus is too small to matter. But we are part of Europe's story, and we have paid a high price to advance the continent's overall freedom. The question is not whether change will come to Belarus. The question is who will be ready when it does.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice-President JD Vance's security detail had an Ohio river's water level raised last weekend to accommodate a kayaking trip he and his family took to celebrate his 41st birthday. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under president George W. Bush, said on X that “it's outrageous for the Army corps of engineers to spend taxpayer money to increase water flow in a river so @VP can go canoeing when budget cuts to the National Park Service have severely impacted family vacations for everyone else.” Trump says Vance ‘most likely' to lead as Republican nominee in 2028 JD Vance gives Pope Leo XIV an invitation from Trump to visit U.S. Spokesman Gene Pawlik said the agency's Louisville District temporarily increased outflows from the Caesar Creek Lake in southwest Ohio into the Little Miami “to support safe navigation of U.S. Secret Service personnel.” He said the move met operational criteria and fell within normal practice. “It was determined that the operations would not adversely affect downstream or upstream water levels,” he said in a statement. “Downstream stakeholders were notified in advance of the slight outflow increase, which occurred August 1, 2025.” Vance's birthday was on Aug. 2. The sprawling 2,830-acre Caesar Creek Lake has an unlimited horsepower designation and five launch ramps, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website. A marina, campground and lodge are also located on site. During a recent trip to Italy, the Roman Colosseum was closed to the public so that his wife, Usha, and their children could take a tour, sparking anger among some tourists. Such special treatment isn't reserved for one political party. When Democratic vice-president Al Gore, then a presidential candidate, paddled down the Connecticut River for a photo opportunity in 1999, utility officials had opened a dam and released four billion gallons of water to raise the river's level. That request, too, came after a review of the area by the Secret Service – and Gore also experienced political pushback. Editor's note: A previous headline on this story incorrectly stated that JD Vance had the river's water level raised.
