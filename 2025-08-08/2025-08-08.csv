            The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, CNN has exclusively learned, marking the latest effort by the White House to shape higher education and extract significant concessions from universities.
    


            Last week, the Trump administration began freezing millions in funding to UCLA, with the school's chancellor Julio Frenk saying in a letter to the university community this week that $584 million “is suspended and at risk” and warning of “devastating” consequences to its research mission.
    


            Officials from UCLA have now returned to the negotiating table, a source familiar with the matter said, and have made clear they would like to reach a deal to restore that funding. The Trump administration, in turn, is laying its marker for a high-dollar settlement.
    


            CNN has reached out to the UC System for comment.
    


            A draft of a proposed agreement sent to the school Friday and obtained by CNN requires UCLA to pay the federal government $1 billion over multiple installments, along with a $172 million claims fund for people impacted by violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
    


            The agreement the administration is proposing – which, if agreed to, would mark the biggest settlement it's received from a higher education institution — requires a resolution monitor to oversee the school, as well as a new senior administrator who will be focused on compliance with anti-discrimination laws.
    


            The proposed agreement prohibits overnight demonstrations and calls on the school to revise its policies and procedures on protests. It also requires UCLA to discontinue race and ethnicity-based scholarships and provide the resolution monitor with admissions data.
    


            The proposal would ensure single-sex housing for women on campus and ensure athletic recognition for female athletes in women's sports. The UCLA hospital and medical school will also be expected to stop providing gender-affirming care.
    


            In return, UCLA's funding would be restored and the school would be eligible for future federal grants and contracts.
    


            The Trump administration has targeted UCLA, along with other schools, as it cracks down on alleged antisemitism on college campuses. The school is currently under an antisemitism investigation by the Department of Justice.
    


            UCLA in March launched its own initiative to combat antisemitism and last week settled a lawsuit that accused the university of letting Jewish students get targeted during 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on campus.
    


            The proposed deal comes as President Donald Trump and his team have pushed for policy changes at colleges and universities, including over diversity, equity and inclusion and other initiatives. The Trump administration has heralded multi-million-dollar deals in recent days with Brown University and Columbia University, and it remains engaged in a pair of lawsuits with Harvard University.

            A divided federal appeals court ruled on Friday that US District Court Judge James Boasberg cannot move ahead with criminal contempt proceedings against Trump administration officials involved in a high-stakes immigration case.
    


            The 2-1 ruling from the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals wipes away a ruling from Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama issued in April that said “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt for violating his orders in mid-March halting the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.
    


            The appeals court had temporarily put Boasberg's plans on ice while it weighed the government's appeal of the ruling, and Friday's ruling represents a significant setback for the judge, who had vowed to hold officials involved in the matter accountable.
    


            In a separate decision on Friday, the DC Circuit wiped away a different ruling from Boasberg that required the administration to give the migrants flown to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act an opportunity to challenge their removal from the US under the sweeping wartime law.
    


            The two judges siding with the Justice Department in the contempt case were appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term. The dissenting judge was an Obama appointee.
    


            Attorneys for the immigrants at the center of the case could appeal Friday's contempt decision to the full bench of the DC Circuit, as well as the Supreme Court.
    


            “All options are on the table,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who represents the migrants, told CNN following the court's issuance of the opinion.
    


            The decision from the judges is another vote from Trump-appointed jurists in support of executive power and against Boasberg's ability in this case to sanction or even question the behavior of the Trump Justice Department.
    


            “The district court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Judge Greg Katsas wrote in a concurring opinion.
    


            Katsas, in his opinion, said he believed Boasberg's original orders to stop the removal of detainees on planes, which Boasberg found the Trump administration violated, were too ambiguous.
    


            He also noted that by stepping in now to end the contempt proceedings Boasberg started, the appeals court would be putting an early stop to a standoff between the judiciary and the executive branch.
    


            “This proceeding does not concern the lawfulness of the AEA removals made on March 15 and 16. Nor may we decide whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter. Perhaps it should warrant more careful judicial scrutiny in the future. Perhaps it already has,” Katsas wrote. “Regardless, the government's initial implementation of the proclamation clearly and indisputably was not criminal.”
    


            Another Trump-appointed appellate judge, Neomi Rao, also wrote that a criminal contempt proceeding shouldn't happen.
    


            In a concurring opinion that was less sweeping about avoiding interbranch conflict than Katsas', Rao said contempt used by a judge as punishment couldn't be a “backdoor to obtain compliance” with a court order.
    


            Writing in dissent, Judge Nina Pillard, the Obama appointee, defended Boasberg in how he responded to the detainees' situation during his emergency hearing in mid-March.
    


            “Chief Judge Boasberg faced immense pressure to make a quick decision in a rapidly evolving, high-stakes situation. He performed that task calmly and with an even hand, bringing to bear his skill and wisdom as an experienced jurist,” Pillard wrote.
    


            She continued: “Even when faced with what reasonably appeared to him to be foot dragging, evasion, and outright disregard for his jurisdiction and his orders, he responded with unfailing composure. The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi declared the court's ruling a “MAJOR victory” for Trump and his Justice Department, saying in a statement on X that Boasberg's ruling represented “failed judicial overreach at its worst.”
    


            The second broadside to Boasberg from the appeals court stemmed from an order he issued in June that required the officials to give hundreds of migrants a chance to challenge their designation as “alien enemies” who could be swiftly removed from the US.
    


            That unanimous ruling from the DC Circuit said that because the group of migrants sent to the prison, known as CECOT, in mid-March have since been released, the changed circumstances “have overtaken the rationale” for Boasberg's order.
    


            Last month, the group of about 250 Venezuelans who had been imprisoned in CECOT were flown back to their home country in exchange for 10 US nationals. Their attorneys in the case before Boasberg told the judge on Thursday that despite being freed from the prison, “many” of them want to pursue legal avenues to potentially return to the US.
    


            The appeals court acknowledged those potential pathways in its ruling Friday, saying if some of them “do wish to proceed, they may be required to adjust their habeas and other claims to account for these changed circumstances.”
    


            Boasberg's ruling from June concluded that US officials had “improperly” loaded the migrants on to flights in mid-March and sent them to El Salvador without giving them a chance to challenge their designation as “alien enemies” subject to President Donald Trump's use of the sweeping 18th century wartime law.
    


            Earlier this year the Supreme Court, without deciding whether Trump had properly invoked the Alien Enemies Act, said officials must give migrants targeted under it a chance to contest their removal through so-called habeas petitions.
    


            “Absent this relief, the Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action,” Boasberg, the chief judge of the trial-level court in Washington, DC, wrote at the time.
    


            The Justice Department quickly appealed his ruling, and the appeals court put his requirement on hold while it reviewed the case.
    


            The DC Circuit's unsigned opinion on this case included Katsas and Rao, as well as Judge Justin Walker, who is also a Trump appointee.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House on Friday, where they are expected to finalize a peace agreement that would grant the United States exclusive development access to a critical transit corridor in the South Caucasus, which will be named after Trump, according to White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly.
    


            “This will allow unimpeded connectivity between the two countries while respecting Armenia, sovereignty and territorial integrity and its people,” Kelly said.
    


            Trump announced the deal in a social media post on Thursday ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, touting it as an agreement with the two nations “to pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.”
    


            Armenia plans to grant the US long-term, exclusive rights to develop a newly designated transportation route through its territory as part of the forthcoming agreements.
    


            And in a concession sure to delight Trump, who has sought to brand himself in his first six months in office as a global peacemaker, the corridor will be called the TRIPP — the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.
    


            The project will operate under Armenian legal jurisdiction, and the United States will in turn lease the land to a consortium responsible for construction and management, according to a senior administration official.
    


            “Working groups will launch immediately to fully implement the details of the roadmap over the coming months. By locking in this path to peace, we are unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade, transit, and energy flows,” the official added.
    


            The deal is the latest in a string of diplomatic pacts that the White House has played a role in brokering around the globe. It comes on the heels of a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand that was reached late last month, after Trump threatened to cut off trade talks with both countries if they continued to fight each other.
    


            “I stopped five wars in the last five months,” Trump said earlier this week. “You just take a look at the ones just over the last two or three months, it's been amazing.”
    


            White House officials have prioritized the diplomatic efforts in a bid to follow through on Trump's campaign pledge to end wars across the world. The administration has highlighted its work on smaller-scale conflicts even as Trump struggles to resolve the two wars that more directly involve the US: Israel's war in Gaza and Russia's incursion into Ukraine.
    


            And for Trump himself, there is an added motivation: Each peace deal, the president has argued, should bring him closer to winning the Nobel Peace Prize that he's coveted for years.
    


            The president has long complained about the decision to award former President Barack Obama the prize in 2009, at the start of his first term. And in recent months, Trump has increasingly pushed for receiving the same recognition — multiple foreign leaders have now nominated the president for the award to curry favor with him.
    


            In addition to the peace framework between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the countries' heads of state will endorse a formal request to disband the Minsk Group. The group, established in 1992 and co-chaired by France, Russia and the US, has long been tasked with mediating the dispute between the two nations.
    


            “President Trump will sign deals with both Armenia and Azerbaijan that will unlock our relationships with each country and the region while benefiting American businesses,” Kelly said.
    


            A senior administration official said the Trump administration identified the transportation corridor as a strategic opportunity in the South Caucasus as early as the end of February. Formal negotiations to determine which US entities will operate the transit corridor are expected to begin next week.
    


            “What President Trump is going to sign today is a directive to set up the TRIPP negotiating team,” the official said, adding that the administration has received calls from nine potential candidates — including three US-based operators.
    


            “This entire area has been shrouded in Russian language and Russian domination for many, many years,” the official added. “What President Trump has done is he's taken the politics out of the picture and made common sense available.”
    


            The trilateral signing coincides with a key deadline set by Trump for Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to steps to halt his invasion of Ukraine or face further economic sanctions.

US President Donald Trump plans to obtain exclusive US development rights to a strategic South Caucasus transit route during an upcoming meeting with the Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders at the White House, Reuters has reported, citing officials.

Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, have been locked in a decades-long territorial dispute over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh since the late 1980s. Baku regained control over the predominantly ethnic-Armenian-populated territory in 2023.

Trump has announced that Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will join him for a trilateral summit and sign a peace deal in the White House on Friday.

“The United States will also sign Bilateral Agreements with both Countries to pursue Economic opportunities,” he wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.

According to Reuters, the peace framework will include exclusive and long-lasting US development rights to a major transit corridor through the South Caucasus. It will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP), the agency wrote on Thursday, citing anonymous officials.

The TRIPP will be operated according to Armenian law, and the US will sublet the land to a consortium for management, Reuters said.

Baku previously proposed creating a Zangezur corridor through Armenia's Syunik Province to connect the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan – which borders Türkiye – to mainland Azerbaijan. Yerevan resisted the idea.

Last month, Spanish news outlet Periodista Digital reported that Armenia quietly agreed to hand over a strategic corridor on its territory to the US. Yerevan officially denied the report, calling it “an element of hybrid warfare and manipulative propaganda.”

Pashinyan has increasingly had to crack down on dissent back home, faced with protests sparked by the pro-Western leader's handover of key Armenian border villages to Baku, which many Armenians saw as a betrayal of national interests.

The Pentagon has a policy in place allowing US-made weapons intended for Ukraine to be redirected back to American stockpiles, CNN reported on Friday, citing a confidential memo seen by several sources.

According to the memo reportedly written by Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby – described by the network as “a noted skeptic of arming Ukraine” – the department has the power to retake arms designated for Kiev under a program known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).

While CNN sources reported that no weapons have apparently been diverted under the guidance, the policy could “rob Ukraine of billions of dollars worth of US-made materiel expected to be delivered over the coming months and years.”

The memo makes “an already murky picture of the status of US arms shipments to Ukraine” even more uncertain, the network warned, particularly given the expected meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Under the reported memo, weapons in short supply, such as interceptor missiles for Patriot air defense systems, require direct approval from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth before being sent abroad.

The pull-back provision is reportedly part of the same document Hegseth used last month to suspend the flow of weapons, including Patriot missiles, to Ukraine. At the time, Pentagon officials sounded the alarm over dwindling supplies at home, although Trump later ordered that shipments be resumed.

The US president has since said that American weapons could be sent to Ukraine under an arrangement in which the EU would pay Washington “100% of the cost of all military equipment.”

Russia has repeatedly condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning they only prolong the conflict without changing its outcome while making NATO a direct participant in the hostilities.

US President Donald Trump reportedly shouted at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a phone call after the Israeli leader attempted to downplay reports of starvation in Gaza, NBC News reported on Friday.

Netanyahu has publicly claimed that “there is no starvation” in the Palestinian enclave, which is being blockaded by Israeli military forces, despite multiple claims to the contrary from medical staff in Gaza.

During a recent trip to the UK, Trump pushed back, telling journalists the starvation is real.

According to the outlet, Netanyahu insisted during the call that allegations of widespread hunger in Gaza were fabricated by the militant group Hamas, but Trump interrupted him, raising his voice and stating that his aides had shown him evidence to the contrary.

The conversation was reportedly initiated at Netanyahu's request, but the exchange ended up being “mostly one-way,” with Trump doing most of the talking, according to one source.

Netanyahu's office denied the claim, calling it “complete fake news” in a brief statement.

NBC News suggested that Trump has taken a personal interest in the issue due to US support for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-affiliated organization conducting limited relief work in the enclave since May. The foundation has been shunned by the UN, which operates its own aid network in Gaza and has accused Israel of obstructing food deliveries.

This week, a group of UN experts criticized the GHF, calling it “an utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas.” They accused the foundation of operating as a “tangle of Israeli intelligence, US contractors and ambiguous non-governmental entities,” rather than a legitimate relief agency. The UN estimates that nearly 1,400 people have been killed in Gaza while searching for food.

Israel is currently preparing for a military operation to occupy Gaza City, marking yet another escalation in the conflict.

Friend says Quornelius Radford, man accused of shooting five fellow soldiers at army base, was ‘bullied a lot'

US politics live – latest updates

A friend of the man accused of gunning down five fellow soldiers at the Fort Stewart army base in Georgia earlier this week recounted how the suspect had been repeatedly bullied for having a serious stutter, according to a news report.

Meanwhile, soldiers who acted swiftly to suppress the gunman and prevent the possibility of a much higher death toll were being hailed as heroes for their bravery in the terrifying moments after shots rang out on the sprawling military base on Wednesday morning.

The man in custody for the shooting, Sgt Quornelius Radford, 28, was relentlessly mocked and mimicked for his speech impediment, from the earliest days of his army career, NBC News reported on Thursday.

“He got bullied a lot. It was very bad to the point where he could barely talk,” Sgt Cameron Barrett, 28, a friend of Radford's, said in an interview with the TV network.

No motive has been officially discussed in the aftermath of the incident, amid the criminal investigation, in which five service members were wounded by gunfire and rushed to the hospital, although they are expected to recover.

Another soldier who had worked alongside Radford earlier in his career said that the sergeant had also lost a loved one in a traffic accident in January, and had taken it hard. The suspect's father has said his son complained of experiencing racism.

When initial reports that there was a shooting began to reach soldiers on the base south-west of Savannah, Barrett said to NBC that he messaged Radford to ask if he was all right, but did not get a response.

Meanwhile, Sgt Aaron Turner recounted to the Associated Press that he was helping lock down a supply warehouse at Fort Stewart when he saw a fellow soldier walking past, wearing a hooded sweatshirt over his uniform and holding a handgun – after shots had already been fired.

Instead of ducking for cover, Turner said, he approached the gunman and started talking – asking what he was doing there and where he was heading. When he got close enough, Turner grabbed the soldier's gun and took him to the ground, where soldiers held him down until military police arrived.

“I was able to keep a cool head, but pretty much my training ended up kicking in,” Turner said on Thursday. “It wasn't about my life at that point. It was about the soldiers.”

The US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, came to Fort Stewart on Thursday to praise Turner and five other soldiers for their quick actions in subduing the gunman to prevent further bloodshed and rendering life-saving aid to the victims. Driscoll awarded each of them the meritorious service medal.

“The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under trauma and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Driscoll said at a news conference afterward.

Authorities say Radford used a personal handgun in the shootings, not a service weapon. Fort Stewart officials have not said why he opened fire, citing the criminal investigation.

Radford worked as a supply sergeant assigned to the 703rd brigade support battalion of the third infantry's 2nd armored brigade at Fort Stewart, the largest US army post east of the Mississippi River, and home to thousands of soldiers.

The battalion's commander, Lt Col Mike Sanford, said on Thursday that he's unaware of any problems with Radford or arguments that preceded the shootings.

“Right now, there's no signs that there was an issue,” Sanford said in an interview.

Radford's father, Eddie Radford of Jacksonville, Florida, said in an interview with the New York Times that his son had sought a transfer and complained to his family about racism at the base.

Radford, who is Black, texted an aunt shortly before the shooting and “said that he loved everybody, and that he'll be in a better place because he was about to go and do something”, Eddie Radford said.

Sgt Carlos Coleman, who worked with Radford early on after the latter joined the army in 2018, also spoke to NBC about the man's stutter.

“It was easy for those people to make fun of him for the way he spoke. After that, he really didn't speak that much,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Rapidly spreading brush fire prompts evacuations for thousands in California","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/california-canyon-fire","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 11:53:00 GMT","

Canyon fire in Ventura county, north of Los Angeles, is a ‘very dynamic situation' and 0% contained, officials say

A brush fire in a mountainous area of Ventura county, north of Los Angeles, ignited and spread quickly on Thursday, forcing thousands of evacuations.

The Canyon fire ignited around 1.30pm, growing to over 7.6 sq miles (19.7 sq km) by 11pm, according to authorities. It remained 0% contained on Thursday evening and was spreading east, the county said.

The fire is burning just south of Lake Piru, a reservoir located in the Los Padres national forest. It's close by Castaic Lake, a popular recreation area burned by the Hughes fire in January. That fire burned about 15 sq miles (39 sq km) in six hours and put 50,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings.

In Los Angeles county, around 4,200 residents and 1,400 structures are under an evacuation order, and another 12,500 residents are under an evacuation warning, said Andrew Dowd, spokesperson for the Ventura county fire department.

The evacuation zones in nearby Ventura county are relatively unpopulated, Dowd said. Fifty-six people were evacuated from the Lake Piru recreation area.

Dowd said the fire was a “very dynamic situation” caused by hot, dry weather, steep and rugged terrain and dry fuel. There were 250 firefighters on the ground coordinating with helicopters and other air support, he said.

Kathryn Barger, the LA county supervisor who represents the district, urged residents to evacuate.

“Extreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,” Barger said in a statement. “If first responders tell you to leave, go – without hesitation.”

The new blaze comes as a huge wildfire in central California became the state's largest blaze of the year, threatening hundreds of homes and burning out of control in the Los Padres national forest.

The Gifford fire had spread to 154 sq miles (399 sq km) by Thursday afternoon and was at 15% containment. It grew out of at least four smaller fires that erupted last Friday along State Route 166, forcing closures in both directions east of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people. It has injured at least four people. The causes of the fires are under investigation.

Wildfire risk will be elevated through the weekend across much of inland California as a heatwave gripping the area intensifies. August and September are typically the most dangerous months for wildfires in the state.

“In southern California, the threat is driven by persistent drought, high grass loads, and weakening coastal moisture,” according to a wildfire forecast by the state's fire department.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Con Edison, city's monopoly utility, cut off 88,000 households in first half of 2025 as climate crisis drives extreme temperatures

An energy company seeking to hike utility bills in New York City by 11% disconnected more than 88,000 households during the first six months of 2025, signaling a crackdown on families struggling to cover rising energy costs even as the climate crisis drives extreme temperatures.

Con Edison, the monopoly utility that provides electricity to 3.6m homes across the country's largest city and neighboring Westchester county, disconnected almost 2.5% of all its customers between January and June this year – triple the total number of families left without power in 2024. One in five disconnected homes remain without power for at least a week.

The utility shut off 16,327 households in the month leading up to 25 June. New York was hit by its first heatwave between 23 and 25 June, breaking daytime and night-time records in Central Park and driving a surge in emergency room visits.

New York is among the most expensive places for electricity, with families shouldering above-inflation price hikes in recent years on top of unaffordable housing and the broader cost of living crisis stemming from the Covid pandemic.

Heat-related deaths account for about 3% of all fatalities from May through September, making New York the second deadliest city for heat after Phoenix, Arizona.

In the past five years, more than 40% of New Yorkers have fallen into arrears, and 23% of households were disconnected at least once – leaving families without access to a fridge, internet, cooking facilities and heat or cooling until they can find the money to pay for reconnection.

Black and Latino New Yorkers are more than twice as likely as white residents to fall behind, and almost eight times more likely to have a utility shutoff, according to the 2024 Poverty Tracker/Robin Hood report on energy insecurity.

“Disconnection is an effective cost recovery strategy but it's also completely inhumane. It's traumatizing for families and costs some people their lives,” said Diana Hernandez, co-author of the report and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.

“People want to pay their bills but they are unaffordable for too many families.”

Almost 16% of New York homes – one in six Con Edison residential customers – were behind on their energy bills at the end of 2024, with debts totaling $948m, according to data submitted by the utility to the state regulator.

But as Con Edison ramped up disconnections over the past six months, the debt fell to $840m by the end of June with 12.5% of New Yorkers now behind on their bills.

At the current rate, Con Edison could disconnect 150,000 households by the end of the year, the highest number by any utility in the country, according to Mark Wolfe, an energy economist.

“Energy is unaffordable so people fall behind. The disconnection numbers show that Con Edison is aggressively cracking down, and life is going to become harder for poor people in New York,” said Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada).

Researchers at Neada, the organization for state directors of the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap), collated the debt and disconnection figures submitted to the New York Public Services Commission, the regulator.

There is no demographic breakdown but people of color, households with children, renters in small buildings, and people with pre-existing medical conditions who rely on electronic devices such as oxygen dispensers, as well as Bronx residents are all more likely to experience energy poverty and therefore a disconnection, the 2024 Robin Hood report found.

A Con Edison spokesperson said: “Termination of service is a last resort, and we do so only after extensive outreach and exhausting all other options … nearly two-thirds of residential customers in arrears are on payment plans. It is essential that our customers pay their bills to maintain safe service and the most reliable system in the nation.”

Most customers were reconnected within 24 hours and 80% within a week, the spokesperson added.

Nationwide, an estimated one in three households experience energy poverty – the inability to access sufficient amounts of electricity and other energy sources due to financial hardship. Low-income households, people of color and states with the fewest social safety nets are disproportionately affected, and millions of families are regularly forced to ration food, medicines, energy and other essentials

Across New York state – and the country – a patchwork of regulations prevent some households from being shut off on very hot or cold days, but millions are not protected at all.

New York, like much of the US, is susceptible to extreme highs and low temperatures, and the climate crisis is driving more frequent and more intense heatwaves.

The number of heat deaths has been rising over the past decade, and on average 525 people in New York City die prematurely each year for heat-related reasons – the vast majority due to the impact high temperatures and humidity have on existing medical conditions, according to the latest figures from the city's department of public health.

Heat kills twice Black New Yorkers at twice the rate of white residents due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, healthcare, housing, energy and other systems that benefit white people and disadvantage people of color, the report found.

Most deaths occur in homes without access to a functioning air conditioning. Citywide, 11% of New Yorkers do not have air conditioners at home but the rate is much higher in low-income communities of color. One study found that a fifth of renters do not use their air conditioner due to cost.

And while protections have improved in recent years, it has not been enough to shield families hit hardest by rising energy prices, rents and inflation – or the increasingly brutal heat and humidity.

According to its website, Con Edison currently suspends disconnections on the hottest and coldest days based on forecasts from the National Weather Service. In the summer, the utility will not disconnect a family the day of or day before the heat index – what the temperature feels like when humidity is taken into account – is forecast to hit 90F (32.2C) at Central Park – one of the shadiest parts of the city. It also suspends disconnections for two days after a 90F heat index day.

Yet temperatures in some neighborhoods in the Bronx and upper Manhattan, where there are fewer trees, less access to air conditioning, more Black and Latino residents, and most heat deaths, exceed Central Park by 6 to 8 degrees due to the heat island effect, according to one study from 2022.

Energy poverty is a chronic problem for many New Yorkers.

New York state is the largest recipient of Liheap, the chronically underfunded bipartisan federal program that helped about 6m households keep on top of energy bills last year – and which narrowly survived being cut completely from Trump's 2026 budget.

In fiscal year 2024-25, New York received $379m (almost 10%) of the total Liheap fund, and Governor Kathy Hochul invested an additional $35m to supplement support for heating bills in January after Liheap money ran out with months of winter still to go.

In the summer, the Liheap program only covers the cost of an air conditioning unit and installation for qualifying low-income households in New York – not energy bills. A city program can provide a means-tested loan for working families in arrears.

Disconnections declined during the pandemic thanks to a statewide moratorium and debt forgiveness schemes, as well as child tax credits and a boost to food stamps among other federal programs that helped lift millions of Americans out of poverty. But the Covid-era social safety programs have now all been terminated, and recent focus groups conducted by Hernandez and her colleagues found people still struggling to recover and rationing energy use because they were so concerned about rising bills.

“The city has got better at advocating for households disproportionately impacted by disconnections but it's a drop in the bucket of where it should be,” said Hernandez, the energy justice expert. “The 88,000 households disconnected are people who have done everything to get the money and still couldn't get caught up. It illustrates families have been left completely exposed.”

Yet energy costs are about to get even higher in New York.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will make electricity production more expensive, leading to residents paying $140 a year on average more by 2030, according to analysis by Energy Innovation. The bill also slashes benefits such as Snap (food stamps) and Medicaid, which will put further pressure on millions of families.

Meanwhile, Con Edison is under fire from city and state politicians including Hochul and the city comptroller (chief finance officer) and former mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, for requesting a rate hike of 11% for electricity and 13% for gas, which the regulator is currently considering. Con Ed's proposed electricity rate hike could raise the average household bill by $372 next year. (The utility provides gas to 1.1m homes.)

“The combination of rising temperatures, rising electricity rates, the possible termination of the federal Liheap program, and this increase in shutoffs by Con Ed risks dramatically increasing heat-related illness and deaths for New Yorkers,” Lander told the Guardian.

“There needs to be strategies in place so that people will pay their bills – but to punish people who are poor by cutting off their electricity ever, but especially in extreme heat or wintertime, is inhumane. It is a form of debtors' prison.”

Con Edison said it provided $311m in bill discounts to income-eligible customers last year, and the regulator (PSC) recently expanded the Energy Affordability Program to help more vulnerable residents.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional information.

Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine created an online ""catalog"" where Ukrainian children are offered up for adoption while sorted based on physical traits like eye or hair color, a head of a Ukrainian NGO said on Aug. 6, denouncing the practice as child trafficking.

The database, which includes data on 294 children, is available on the education department of the Russian occupation authorities in Luhansk Oblast.

""Most children in this catalog were born in Luhansk Oblast before the Russian occupation and had Ukrainian citizenship,"" Mykola Kuleba, CEO of the Save Ukraine organization, said in an Instagram post.

""Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction.""

The news underscores the impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine on the country's most vulnerable groups, namely children.

Ukraine has identified more than 19,500 children abducted by Russia during the full-scale war and forcibly transferred to Russia, the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, or Belarus. Only 1,480 have been brought back home.

Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure of abducted children could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000.

Kuleba said that many children who grew up in territories occupied by Russia since 2014, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, have been ""systematically deported and transferred to Russian families in Moscow and other Russian regions.""

""This isn't a new tactic. Since 2014, Ukrainian children have appeared in Russian adoption databases. However, since 2022, the practice has become widespread and systematic,"" Kuleba noted on X.

""Initially, Russian authorities tried to cover their tracks — shutting down registries and erasing references. Now, the pretense is gone.""

The Russian-run database describes the children listed in the database as ""orphans and children left without parental care."" The website allows users to filter the children by age, eye and hair color, and the preferred form of guardianship, such as adoption or foster care.

Children are introduced with their photos, age, gender, and character traits, with some being described as ""obedient"" or ""calm.""

""The way they describe our children is indistinguishable from a slave catalog. This is child trafficking in the 21st century, and the world must act to stop it immediately,"" Kuleba said. According to him, the database is part of an effort to ""improve"" the system in the face of dropping demand for adoptions.

Russia has ""streamlined"" the system to such an extent that ""a Ukrainian child can now be effectively 'ordered' online"" and ""stripped of their identity, issued a Russian passport, and subjected to ideological control"" with a ""single click,"" the NGO head said.

The platform exposes the children to significant dangers, including sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illegal adoption, forced changes of name and identity, psychological trauma, and trafficking for organ harvesting, he warned.

Talking to the Kyiv Independent, Save Ukraine's head of communications, Nataliia Savchenko, said Russia began deleting photographs after the platform was exposed, but the Ukrainian NGO downloaded information about the children listed on the website and will hand over all relevant information to Ukrainian authorities.

""At the moment, we are working together with them to determine the whereabouts of these children and to do everything possible to bring them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory,"" the spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent.

The database ""should serve as evidence in the investigation of crimes committed by Russia. In this case, we are talking about human trafficking — specifically, the trafficking of children,"" she said.

Save Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in 2014 to support vulnerable groups, namely orphans and children rescued from Russian-occupied territories. 

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's children's rights officials for comment.

The abductions of Ukrainian children have been broadly denounced by the international community as a war crime. Their return has remained a central demand in Ukraine's negotiations with Moscow.

During peace talks in Istanbul, Russian officials dismissed Kyiv's appeal to return the abducted children as a ""show for childless European old ladies,"" even as they admitted to relocating hundreds, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their personal roles in organizing the illegal transfers.

""They (Russian troops) are now regrouping for further attempts, but remain positioned in Donetsk Oblast,"" said Victor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Dnipro group of forces.

""Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction,"" said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization.

The U.S. and Russia are seeking to reach a deal to cement Moscow's occupation of Ukrainian territories and end the war, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 8, citing undisclosed sources.

The news come as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are expected to meet as soon as next week. 

U.S. and Russian officials are working on a territorial agreement, the sources told Bloomberg.

The proposed deal is aimed at freezing the conflict and laying the groundwork for a ceasefire and technical negotiations toward a final peace settlement, the news agency reported.

Putin is demanding that Ukraine cede all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as Crimea, Bloomberg wrote. 

Russia currently occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory. This includes the whole of Crimea, occupied in 2014, and large parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the latter four regions in 2022 and insists on Ukraine's full withdrawal from them as part of a peace deal, even though it does not control them completely.

The Kremlin is also pushing for formal recognition of its control over occupied Ukrainian territories. While Trump has reportedly signaled a willingness to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, Ukraine has firmly rejected this move along with any withdrawal from the territories it currently holds.

As part of the deal currently under discussion, Russia may cease offensive operations in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts along existing front lines, according to Bloomberg's sources. The terms remain in flux and could be changed.

It remains unclear whether Moscow is prepared to relinquish any of the territories it currently occupies, including Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, according to Bloomberg.

Washington is reportedly trying to secure support from Ukraine and its European allies for the potential deal, which remains far from certain. 

The Kyiv Independent reached out to the President's Office for a comment.

The Trump-Putin meeting comes amid growing U.S. pressure aimed at cutting off Russia's war funding. Oil revenues make up roughly one-third of Russia's federal budget, and Washington is targeting those flows through secondary tariffs.

The U.S. president issued an ultimatum to Moscow on July 28, demanding a ceasefire within 10 days or face severe U.S. sanctions. As the Aug. 8 deadline approached, Trump signaled impatience and said the decision now ""depends on Putin.""

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) attacked a Russian air defense brigade in the town of Afipsky in Russia's Krasnodar Krai on Aug. 8, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent.

The operation struck Russia's 90th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, which has been involved in Russian assaults in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, according to the source. 

Two explosions near a checkpoint killed at least 12 Russian soldiers and injured dozens more, the source said. Russian military equipment was also destroyed, they added.

Russian Telegram channels reported that air raid sirens sounded across several settlements in Krasnodar Krai on the morning of Aug. 8 due to a drone threat.

Details of the operation remain undisclosed. 

The HUR source claimed that an ""anti-terrorist operation"" had been declared in Afipsky following the explosions. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. 

Krasnodar Krai, located just east of occupied Crimea, has become an increasingly frequent target of Ukrainian drone strikes. The region's military infrastructure is critical for Russia's air operations in the south and over the Black Sea.

Growing evidence of mercenary involvement in the Sudan war has prompted Colombian President Gustavo Petro to seek action against the “spectres of death” from his country who are allegedly training child soldiers in Darfur.

The Sudanese army released videos this week that appeared to show foreign mercenaries in the ranks of the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful militia that has been accused of civilian massacres and other atrocities in its two-year battle against the army.

The army said the foreigners were among an estimated 80 Colombian mercenaries who had joined the RSF in its prolonged siege of the Darfur city of El Fasher in western Sudan. The army said it had killed several of the Colombians, including one who was serving as an RSF commander in the city.

In a separate report on Wednesday, Sudanese state television said at least 40 Colombian mercenaries were killed when the army destroyed an airplane landing with weapons and other supplies at the Darfur city of Nyala, an RSF operations hub.

Mr. Petro swiftly ordered an investigation and called for the urgent passage of legislation to ban mercenaries. “They are spectres of death,” the Colombian leader said in a social media post on Wednesday night.

“The bosses who send young men to kill and be killed for nothing are murderers,” he said. “It is also a form of human trafficking, turning men into commodities for killing.”

Mr. Petro said the report of 40 deaths is unconfirmed. He said he has asked Colombia's ambassador in Egypt to investigate the number of deaths and to see whether the remains of any Colombians could be returned to their home country.

Colombian mercenaries at RSF camps near Nyala have been giving military training to large numbers of children, including some as young as 10, according to an investigative report published this week by a Colombian news site, La Silla Vacía.

The report included several photos of foreigners in military uniforms, identified as Colombian mercenaries, working with young trainees who appeared to be children.

It also contained an account from one of the Colombians, who said the mercenary operation was funded by the United Arab Emirates. He told the media outlet that he found the training of child soldiers to be sad and ugly, since the children are quickly killed when they reach the battlefront. The children were trained to use assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, he said.

The controversy over the Colombians in Sudan has highlighted the growing use of mercenaries in many of Africa's wars. Hundreds of thousands of mercenaries, from countries in Africa and beyond, have become involved in the Sudan war, according to a statement by Sudan's Foreign Ministry this week.

The Foreign Ministry said it has proof that the Colombian mercenaries are “sponsored and financed” by the United Arab Emirates. The mercenaries who were killed in Nyala this week were flying on a UAE airplane, it said.

There have been widespread reports for years that the UAE government is supporting the RSF with regular shipments of weapons and other supplies, but the UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation. It has also denied any connection to the Colombian mercenaries.

The role of the Colombians first emerged in public last November when pro-government fighters stopped an illegal weapons convoy in northern Darfur. They released videos showing that the convoy was accompanied by Colombians with UAE visas in their passports.

A few days later, a report by La Silla Vacía said at least 300 Colombian mercenaries, from a private force known as “the Desert Wolves,” were fighting in Sudan in an operation spearheaded by the UAE.

It said the former Colombian soldiers had been recruited and flown to cities in the UAE and then to Libya, where they were transported across the border to Darfur. They were promised salaries of US$2,600 to US$3,400 a month, the report said.

The Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs later acknowledged the presence of Colombian mercenaries in Darfur and formally apologized to Sudan's government.

This past April, a report by a United Nations panel of experts said the allegations of Colombian mercenary involvement were “credible.”

Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. The decision taken early Friday marks another escalation of Israel's 22-month offensive launched in response to Hamas's Oct. 7 attack.

The war has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, destroyed much of Gaza and pushed the territory of some two million Palestinians toward famine.

Ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting, which began Thursday and ran through the night, Netanyahu said Israel planned to retake control over the entire territory and eventually hand it off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.

The announced plans stop short of that, perhaps reflecting the reservations of Israel's top general, who reportedly warned that it would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel's army after nearly two years of regional wars. Many families of hostages are also opposed, fearing further escalation will doom their loved ones.

Andrew Coyne: Continuing the Israeli military campaign in Gaza can no longer be justified, morally or strategically

Israel has repeatedly bombarded Gaza City and carried out numerous raids there, only to return to different neighbourhoods again and again as militants regrouped. Today it is one of the few areas of Gaza that hasn't been turned into an Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders.

A major ground operation there could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory.

It's unclear how many people reside in the city, which was Gaza's largest before the war. Hundreds of thousands fled Gaza City under evacuation orders in the opening weeks of the war but many returned during a ceasefire at the start of this year.

Expanding military operations in Gaza would put the lives of countless Palestinians and the roughly 20 remaining Israeli hostages at risk while further isolating Israel internationally. Israel already controls around three quarters of the devastated territory.

Families of hostages held in Gaza fear an escalation could doom their loved ones, and some protested outside the Security Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. Former top Israeli security officials have also come out against the plan, warning of a quagmire with little added military benefit.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News Channel's Bill Hemmer on Thursday that Israel intends to take military control of all of Gaza, despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating almost two-year-old war in the Palestinian enclave.

An Israeli official had earlier said the Security Cabinet would discuss plans to conquer all or parts of Gaza not yet under Israeli control. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity pending a formal decision, said that whatever is approved would be implemented gradually to increase pressure on Hamas.

Israel's air and ground war has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and caused severe and widespread hunger. Palestinians are braced for further misery.

“There is nothing left to occupy,” said Maysaa al-Heila, who is living in a displacement camp. “There is no Gaza left.”

At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals.

Asked in an interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza,” Netanyahu replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.”

“We don't want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter,” Netanyahu said in the interview. “We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.”

The Security Cabinet, which would need to approve such a decision, began meeting Thursday evening, according to Israeli media, and it was expected to stretch into the night.

Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, warned against occupying Gaza, saying it would endanger the hostages and put further strain on the military after nearly two years of war, according to Israeli media reports.

Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive.

Almost two dozen relatives of hostages set sail from southern Israel toward the maritime border with Gaza on Thursday, where they broadcast messages from loudspeakers.

Yehuda Cohen, the father of Nimrod Cohen, an Israeli soldier held in Gaza, said from the boat that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to satisfy extremists in his governing coalition. Netanyahu's far-right allies want to escalate the war, relocate most of Gaza's population to other countries and re-establish Jewish settlements that were dismantled in 2005.

“Netanyahu is working only for himself,” Cohen said.

Opinion: Genocide is a process, not an event

Israel's military offensive has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals who keep and share detailed records.

The United Nations and independent experts view the ministry's figures as the most reliable estimate of casualties. Israel has disputed them without offering a toll of its own.

Of the 42 people killed on Thursday, at least 13 were seeking aid in an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where UN aid convoys are regularly overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds. Another two were killed on roads leading to nearby sites run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American contractor, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies.

GHF said there were no violent incidents at or near its sites on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The military zone, known as the Morag Corridor, is off limits to independent media.

Hundreds of people have been killed in recent weeks while heading to GHF sites and in chaotic scenes around U.N. convoys, most of which are overwhelmed by looters and crowds of hungry people. The UN human-rights office, witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces have regularly opened fire toward the crowds going back to May, when Israel lifted a complete 2½ month blockade.

Parents in Gaza are scrambling to save their children from malnutrition and starvation.

The military says it has only fired warning shots when crowds approach its forces. GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired into the air on some occasions to prevent deadly stampedes.

Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity known by its French acronym MSF, published a blistering report denouncing the GHF distribution system. “This is not aid. It is orchestrated killing, “ it said.

MSF runs two health centres very close to GHF sites in southern Gaza and said it had treated 1,380 people injured near the sites between June 7 and July 20, including 28 people who were dead upon arrival. Of those, at least 147 had suffered gunshot wounds – including at least 41 children.

MSF said hundreds more suffered physical assault injuries from chaotic scrambles for food at the sites, including head injuries, suffocation, and multiple patients with severely aggravated eyes after being sprayed at close range with pepper spray. It said the cases it saw were only a fraction of the overall casualties connected to GHF sites; a nearby Red Cross field hospital has independently reported receiving thousands of people wounded by gunshots as they sought aid.

“The level of mismanagement, chaos and violence at GHF distribution sites amounts to either reckless negligence or a deliberately designed death trap,” the report said.

GHF said the “accusations are both false and disgraceful” and accused MSF of “amplifying a disinformation campaign” orchestrated by Hamas.

The Little Miami River in Oregonia, Ohio, whose water level was raised to accommodate the trip.Patrick Aftoora-Orsagos/The Associated Press

U.S. Vice-President JD Vance's security detail had an Ohio river's water level raised last weekend to accommodate a kayaking trip he and his family took to celebrate his 41st birthday.

The U.S. Secret Service said it requested the increased waterflow for the Little Miami River, first reported by The Guardian, to ensure motorized watercraft and emergency personnel “could operate safely” while protecting the Republican Vice-President, whose home is in Cincinnati.

But critics immediately blasted the action as a sign of the vice-president's entitlement, particularly given the Trump administration's focus on slashing government spending.

Richard W. Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under president George W. Bush, said on X that “it's outrageous for the Army corps of engineers to spend taxpayer money to increase water flow in a river so @VP can go canoeing when budget cuts to the National Park Service have severely impacted family vacations for everyone else.”

Trump says Vance ‘most likely' to lead as Republican nominee in 2028

JD Vance gives Pope Leo XIV an invitation from Trump to visit U.S.

The Corps of Engineers declined to address any financial impact of raising the river. Spokesman Gene Pawlik said the agency's Louisville District temporarily increased outflows from the Caesar Creek Lake in southwest Ohio into the Little Miami “to support safe navigation of U.S. Secret Service personnel.” He said the move met operational criteria and fell within normal practice.

“It was determined that the operations would not adversely affect downstream or upstream water levels,” he said in a statement. “Downstream stakeholders were notified in advance of the slight outflow increase, which occurred August 1, 2025.” Vance's birthday was on Aug. 2.

Vance spokesman Taylor Van Kirk said the vice-president was unaware the river had been raised.

“The Secret Service often employs protective measures without the knowledge of the Vice President or his staff, as was the case last weekend,” she said via text.

The sprawling 2,830-acre Caesar Creek Lake has an unlimited horsepower designation and five launch ramps, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website. A marina, campground and lodge are also located on site. The department provided two natural resources officers to assist the Secret Service with the Vance event, spokesperson Karina Cheung said.

The Vance family has already become accustomed to certain accommodations being made as they move about the world. During a recent trip to Italy, the Roman Colosseum was closed to the public so that his wife, Usha, and their children could take a tour, sparking anger among some tourists. The Taj Mahal also was closed to visitors during the Vance family's visit to India.

Such special treatment isn't reserved for one political party.

When Democratic vice-president Al Gore, then a presidential candidate, paddled down the Connecticut River for a photo opportunity in 1999, utility officials had opened a dam and released four billion gallons of water to raise the river's level. That request, too, came after a review of the area by the Secret Service – and Gore also experienced political pushback.

Gore's campaign said at the time that he did not ask for the water to be released.

Editor's note: A previous headline on this story incorrectly stated that JD Vance had the river's water level raised. The U.S. Secret Service says it had the water level raised.

“¿Cuándo nos hemos reunido para decir que esa isla debe tener un alcalde y una bandera peruana y no colombiana?”, se preguntó el mandatario durante una actividad en Leticia. 

El presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, afirmó este jueves (07.08.2025) en la ciudad fronteriza de Leticia que su Gobierno no reconoce ni la soberanía de Perú ni a las autoridades de ese país en la isla de Santa Rosa, una formación en el río Amazonas que marca el límite entre los dos países, y acusó al Gobierno del país vecino de incumplir el tratado de 1922 que estableció los límites entre los dos países en ese cauce de agua.

""Colombia no reconoce la soberanía del Perú sobre la denominada isla de Santa Rosa y desconoce a las autoridades de facto impuestas en la zona"", dijo Petro en Leticia, ubicada frente a Santa Rosa, donde agregó que la asignación de dicha isla y de otras surgidas en el río Amazonas después de otro tratado, firmado en 1929, debe discutirse en una comisión binacional y, en última instancia, en tribunales internacionales.

""Que me expliquen por qué a la que llaman isla de Santa Rosa ha llegado un helicóptero ruso con militares, si esa isla, de común acuerdo, no se ha decidido que sea del Perú. ¿Cuándo nos hemos reunido para decir que esa isla debe tener un alcalde y una bandera peruana y no colombiana?"", expresó Petro durante su visita a Leticia, donde trasladó los actos conmemorativos del 206 aniversario de la Batalla de Boyacá, que selló la independencia de Colombia.

En tanto, el presidente del Consejo de Ministros de Perú, Eduardo Arana, y otros integrantes del gabinete llegaron al distrito amazónico de Santa Rosa de Loreto, ubicado en la isla reclamada por Petro, para supervisar una acción social con los pobladores de esta alejada localidad fronteriza.

El reclamo de Petro se dio después de que el Congreso de Perú crease el municipio de Santa Rosa de Loreto, que hasta entonces era parte del municipio de Yavarí, en la provincia de Mariscal Ramón Castilla, del departamento de Loreto, el más extenso del territorio peruano. Se trata de una población surgida a partir de los años 70 que desde un inicio fue administrada por Perú, al punto que actualmente cuenta con destacamentos de la Policía Nacional y de la Armada, así como oficinas del servicio de migraciones y de aduanas, entre otras instituciones estatales. Incluso una de sus principales avenidas se llama ""Mi Perú”.

Para el Gobierno peruano, su soberanía sobre este territorio está fuera de discusión, pues sostiene que desde un primer momento Santa Rosa fue una extensión de la isla Chinería que en 1929 ambos países acordaron que quedase en manos de Perú y que actualmente, debido a los cambios en el río Amazonas, es una única isla.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","German court rejects deported Yazidi family's return","https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-rejects-deported-yazidi-familys-return/a-73566697","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 08:41:07 GMT","

Judges say the deportation of a Yazidi family was legally valid despite controversy over the family's fate. The Yazidi people were targeted by a genocidal attack from the ""Islamic State"" in Iraq. 

The Potsdam Administrative Court has rejected an emergency application by a Yazidi family seeking reentry to Germany after their deportation to Iraq.

The decision comes amid political pressure and public debate over whether the removal violated legal protections for survivors of a genocide perpetrated by the ""Islamic State"" (IS) militant group.

The court found no grounds to reverse the deportation, ruling that the family's removal was lawful under a March 2023 decision by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). That decision rejected their protection claim as ""manifestly unfounded"" and found no obstacle to deportation.

The judges said the deportation order had been enforceable since then. Another court order granted on July 22 — suspending the obligation to leave after an emergency appeal — was only delivered after the deportation was complete.

In its Thursday ruling, the court said it did not believe the plaintiffs had suffered ""individual persecution."" Furthermore, it found no significant individual threat, such as persecution by IS, nor sufficient evidence of current group persecution of Yazidis.

The family, two parents and four children, belonged to the Yazidi minority targeted in a 2014 IS genocide that was recognized by the German parliament in 2023. They had lived in Lychen, Brandenburg, for years, with the children integrated into local schools.

Their deportation was part of a charter flight carrying 43 people from Leipzig to Baghdad. Authorities initially claimed only single men were on board, some with criminal records. It was eventually revealed that this was not the case and that the family were among the deportees.

Brandenburg's Interior Minister Rene Wilke called the situation ""deeply concerning"" and said he had asked federal authorities to work on bringing the family back — if the court ruling in their favor remained valid.

The BAMF has defended its decision, citing the family's failed asylum claim and the lack of recognized danger in Iraq under current assessments.

Advocacy groups such as Nadia's Initiative warn that Yazidi families in Germany face similar removal orders, causing widespread fear in the community. They argue that many Yazidis still cannot return safely due to destroyed villages, insecurity, and the presence of IS remnants.

Politicians from the center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens, and the socialist Left Party have joined calls for the family's return, citing Germany's recognition of the genocide and moral responsibility toward survivors.

The case has reignited debate over how German asylum policy should treat communities affected by mass atrocities — especially when legal rulings and humanitarian considerations appear to clash.

Israel's decision to take over the densely populated city came despite opposition from families of the remaining hostages and has drawn international criticism. DW rounds up the latest.

This blog covers the latest headlines from Israel, Gaza and the conflict in the region on Friday, August 8:

After German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's surprise announcement of a halt in arms deliveries to Israel, DW spoke with Alon Liel, former director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, who warned of Israel's growing isolation due to its plans to reoccupy Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed ""disappointment"" with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to end the export of arms that could be used in Gaza ""until further notice.""

""Instead of supporting Israel's just war against Hamas, which carried out the most horrific attack against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, Germany is rewarding Hamas terrorism by embargoing arms to Israel,"" Netanyahu said in a statement posted on X by his office.

The Central Council of Jews in Germany has criticized the German government's decision to stop exporting arms to Israel that could be used in the war in Gaza.

""The change of course runs counter to all expressions of solidarity and promises made by the chancellor since he took office,"" council president Josef Schuster said, adding that ""depriving Israel of the ability to defend itself"" is a danger to the country's existence.

According to Schuster, Germany should instead increase pressure on Palestinian militant group Hamas, a group the country has labeled as a terrorist organization.

US Vice President JD Vance said the US and Britain had a different approach toward the crisis in Gaza but ultimately shared common goals in the region.

""We may have some disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and we'll talk about that today,"" he said when asked if the US would recognize Palestinian statehood.

Vance reiterated that the US had no plans to recognize a Palestinian state, saying he didn't know what recognition would mean ""given the lack of a functional government there.""

""If it was easy to bring peace to that region of the world, it would have been done already,"" he said.

Vance made the remarks in England, where he is meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy while on holiday in the UK.

The UK has announced that it would recognize a state of Palestine unless Israel takes significant steps to end the ""appalling situation"" in Gaza and meets other conditions.

France and Canada have made similar declarations.

European Council President Antonio Costa has said the Israeli government's decision to take over Gaza City ""must have consequences"" in terms of the country's relations with the European Union, ""to be assessed by the Council.""

Costa stressed that taking over Gaza ""not only violates the agreement with the EU announced by the High Representative on July 19 but also undermines fundamental principles of international law and universal values.""

""The situation in Gazaremains dramatic, and the decision by the Israeli government will only further worsen it,"" Costa posted on X.

Costa stressed that the two-state solution is the ""only sustainable solution"" for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry has criticized Israel's decision to take over Gaza City. 

The ministry condemned what it described as Israel's ""starvation, brutal practices and ethnic cleansing"" against the Palestinians.

Saudi Arabia, a major regional power, had seemed close to establishing ties with Israel before October 7, 2023, but has since said it could not normalize ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Egypt also condemned the move, saying the plan would ""entrench the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories"" and ""eliminate all elements of life for the Palestinian people."" 

Cairo called for the international community to pressure Israel to move toward a two-state solution. 

For years, Egypt — along with Qatar and the US — has taken on a mediator role between Israel and Hamas in repeated outbursts of conflict. 

Egypt has also repeatedly refused US plans to displace Palestinians into its territory, and instead has been pushing for a reconstruction plan for Gaza. 

Pakistan also joined international condemnation, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif calling Israel's plan a ""dangerous escalation"" that will worsen the humanitarian crisis and derail peace prospects.

German Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan said she ""strongly supports"" Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to stop sending arms to Israel which could be used in the war in Gaza, saying it is the ""necessary consequence"" after the Israeli government's decision to take over Gaza City as part of the ongoing war in the enclave.

""The German government positioned itself clearly,"" Alabali Radovan said in a statement, adding that the annexation of Gaza or the expulsion of people from Gaza is ""unacceptable.""

The Social Democrat (SPD) lawmaker also called for Palestinian militant group Hamas to free all the Israeli hostages unconditionally and ""end all terrorism"" against Israel.

Hamas is considered a terrorist group in Germany, the US and several other countries.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said Israel's move to expand its military operation in Gaza ""must be reconsidered"" and called for the release of all hostages. 

Von der Leyen also urged ""immediate and unhindered access to Gaza"" for humanitarian aid. 

""A ceasefire is needed now,"" she added, posting on social media.

The EU has been criticized for a lack of action over the war in Gaza. The bloc has been split between strong supporters of Israel, including Germany, and others calling for pressure on Israel to end the war, such as Spain.

In July, the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, proposed some options to punish Israel after breaching a cooperation deal with the bloc on human rights grounds. The measures have yet to be approved.

Hamas, the Islamist militant group ruling Gaza, has warned Israel that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to ""sacrificing"" the hostages still being held in the Palestinian enclave. 

Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not caring ""about the fate of their captives.""

""They understand that expanding the aggression means sacrificing them,"" the group said. 

Israel has said the aim of expanding its military operation to take over Gaza City was to destroy Hamas and return the hostages. 

The plan has been met with strong opposition in Israel, with critics saying the decision risks the safety of the hostages and Israeli soldiers in areas considered dangerous for them on the ground.

The Hostage Relatives Forum, an organization representing the majority of hostage families, has called Israel's expansion of the war in Gaza a ""death sentence"" for the captives held by Hamas and other groups in the enclave. 

The decision is ""an official declaration of abandonment of the hostages,"" while ignoring the warnings of the military, the group said in a social media post.

Army chief Eyal Zamir had reportedly opposed a plan to take control of the entire Gaza Strip and warned that such a plan would endanger the hostages and further strain Israel's army.

""[This government] is leading us to a colossal disaster for the hostages and the soldiers,"" the Hostage Relatives Forum said, calling for a deal to return their loved ones.

Israel estimates that 50 hostages are still being held in Gaza, including some 20 who are believed to be alive.

More European countries have joined the condemnation against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announced plans to occupy Gaza City, further extending the war in the enclave that has already killed at least 60,000 Palestinians.

""Following the official confirmation by the Israeli government of its intention to encircle and then occupy Gaza City and take military control of the entire Gaza Strip, Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot has decided to summon the Israeli ambassador,"" the Belgian Foreign Ministry said.

It added that the ministry wanted to ""express [its] total disapproval of this decision, but also of the continued colonization ... and the desire to annex the West Bank,"" saying it would ""vigorously advocate"" for the decision to be reversed.

Neighboring Netherlands had a similar message for Netanyahu.

""The plan of the Netanyahu government to intensify Israeli operations in Gaza is a wrong move. The [Gaza] humanitarian situation is catastrophic and demands immediate improvement. This decision in no way contributes to this and will also not help to get the hostages home,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a statement on X.

Similarly, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told Denmark's TV2 that the Israeli decision was wrong and should be reversed.

Israel is seeing growing opposition to any expansion of the war in Gaza.

Prominent figures ranging from artists to retired army commanders are making their voices heard.

And many Israeli citizens are joining rallies demanding an end to the conflict.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced that Berlin will not approve German weapons exports to Israel for use in the Gaza Strip ""until further notice."" 

""Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas terrorism. The release of the hostages and determined negotiations for a ceasefire are our top priority,"" Merz said in a statement on Friday. 

""The disarmament of Hamas is essential. Hamas must not play any role in Gaza's future,"" he added. 

However, ""the even tougher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip"" that was approved by the Israeli Security Cabinet ""makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals can be achieved,"" he added. 

Read the full story on Germany's partial suspension of arms exports to Israel.

Turkey's Foreign Ministry has described Israel's plan to take over Gaza City as a ""heavy blow"" to peace and security.

""We call on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to prevent the implementation of this decision, which aims to forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land,"" it said in a statement. 

Separately, China expressed ""serious concerns"" over Israel's decision. 

""Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.

""The correct way to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to secure the release of hostages is an immediate ceasefire,"" the spokesperson added.

""A complete resolution to the Gaza conflict hinges on a ceasefire; only then can a path to de-escalation be paved and regional security ensured.""

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said Israel's plan ""for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted.""

Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan to take over Gaza City, where half of the Palestinian territory's population lives, but stopped short of referring to a full occupation of the Gaza Strip. 

Israel is estimated to already be in control of 75% of the Gaza Strip. Israeli media reports have suggested that the military would move toward taking over the remaining parts of the enclave. 

Türk said that the plan ""runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realization of the agreed two-State solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination.""

He called on Israel to instead allow ""the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid."" 

Palestinian armed groups must unconditionally release hostages, and Israel likewise should free ""Palestinians arbitrarily detained,"" Türk added. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Three more victims of the 9/11 attacks have been identified using DNA analysis.

Officials in New York City named the individuals as Ryan Fitzgerald of Floral Park, New York, and Barbara Keating of Palm Springs, California.

Another individual, an adult woman, was identified also but her details were withheld at the request of her family.

News that the 1,651st, 1,652nd and 1,653rd victims have been positively identified 24 years after the Al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington DC, highlighted the fact that a little more than half of the 2,753 people killed that day have not been.

“The pain of losing a loved one in the September 11th terror attacks echoes across the decades, but with these three new identifications, we take a step forward in comforting the family members still aching from that day,” said Mayor Eric Adams.

He added: “As a former law enforcement officer who served our city on 9/11, I understand deeply the feeling of loss so many families have experienced. We hope the families receiving answers from the Office of Chief Medical Examiner can take solace in the city's tireless dedication to this mission.”

New York media said Fitzgerald, 26, was working as a currency trader at Fiduciary Trust International in the south tower of the World Trade Centre.

Fitzgerald's mother, Diane Parks, said he had recently moved to New York City. When she saw his credit card bill after his death, she realised he had been enjoying his new-found independence, buying clothes at Banana Republic and presents for his girlfriend.

In an article by the New York Times, Ms Parks said he had told her of his intention to attend a friend's bachelor party in Las Vegas. She said that at the time, she advised him against it, but she was glad he went. 

“‘It made me feel good that he enjoyed the summer because it was the last summer of his life,” she said.

Keating, who was aged 72 and a grandmother, was onboard the American Airlines Flight 11 that left Boston and was due to head to Los Angeles when the jet was seized by the hijackers.

After her death, Paul Keating, one of her five sons, said in an obituary she was “smart, tough, professional and funny”.

Keating spent more than 25 years in public service, much of it with the non-profit Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Middlesex, outside of Boston. 

Her family said she had been widowed 20 years before she lost her life and had divided her time between Cape Cod, Mass and California. In Palm Springs, she drove a red convertible and attended church every day.

“Nearly 25 years after the disaster at the World Trade Center, our commitment to identify the missing and return them to their loved ones stands as strong as ever,” Chief Medical Examiner Ryan Graham said.

“Each new identification testifies to the promise of science and sustained outreach to families despite the passage of time. We continue this work as our way of honouring the lost.”

Sharon Premoli, a 9/11 survivor who was on the 80th floor of the north tower, told The Telegraph that identifying victims was important because it gives families closure.

“While I did not lose a family member on 9/11, I know from having spoken to some who have yet to get a definitive identification, that to them, their loved one has disappeared,” Ms Premoli said.

“That disappearance has to exacerbate a grief that may never subside. Losing a child, a spouse or partner, or a sibling with no remains prevents any kind of closure.”

Antonio Mazzeo filed a complaint against the Israeli government at the Rome Tribunal for kidnapping and mistreatment.

The Handala, a Freedom Flotilla Coalition ship, set sail to Gaza from Gallipoli, an Italian city on the coast of Puglia, on July 20. Its aim was to bring humanitarian aid — including food, medicine, and toys — to the Palestinian population under Israeli siege. Twenty-one people from around the world took part in the mission, attempting to break the naval blockade that Tel Aviv has maintained for nearly two decades. Just weeks earlier, Israeli naval forces had boarded and seized another vessel from the same group, the Madleen, with Greta Thunberg on board, in international waters. On the night of July 26 to 27, Israeli forces repeated the action, intercepting the Handala and illegally deporting the entire crew. Antonio Mazzeo, an Italian journalist, was among those on board. In this exclusive interview for Truthout, Mazzeo discusses his experience, the crew's journey, and what motivated the difficult and dangerous mission. The interview that follows has been edited for clarity and length.

Andrea Umbrello: Can you describe what happened on the Handala's final day, before and after the Israeli navy arrived?

Antonio Mazzeo: Saturday, [July] 26 was quiet. We knew it would be a long day, but we stayed calm. In the afternoon, an Israeli Heron drone circled low over the boat for more than an hour. Only then did we realize for certain that Israel was watching us closely. Soon after, we learned two ships carrying special forces had left Haifa. We prepared for anything, even an armed attack. We tried to steer the ship south, asking the Egyptian authorities for permission to enter their territorial waters to reach Gaza. We were given permission to land in Egypt, but that wasn't our goal. When the Israeli ships became visible on the horizon, we sat on the deck wearing our life jackets, ready to face what was to come. The commandos arrived on fast rubber boats and boarded the Handala. They found us sitting side by side, our hands open as a sign of peace, singing the famous Italian resistance song “Bella Ciao.” There was no violence or abuse; in fact, the soldiers tried to be courteous. The journey aboard the Handala, now occupied by about 30 commandos, lasted nearly 12 hours. We were taken to the port of Ashdod, where the police took us into custody. From that moment on, everything changed, and the ongoing harassment, mistreatment, insults, and violations of our most basic rights began.

What happened after you landed in Israel?

We were taken to a large hall for the first of many body searches, the seizure of our backpacks, and photo identification. Then 18 of us were made to sit in a semi-circular room, watched over by brutal and violent police. It was the last time we were able to share the Handala mission together. One by one, they took us to interrogation booths where the interrogations took place and we were notified of our arrest. Then we were transferred to cramped cells at police stations near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, or in a maximum-security detention center that has housed thousands of Palestinian prisoners.

The interrogations were conducted by police with strong ideological prejudices, who did not hold back insults or threats. My interrogator tried to belittle the political and humanitarian value of our mission. “But do you know how many children Hamas has killed?” he yelled at me when I explained that the Handala wanted to deliver aid and stuffed animals to Palestinian children. “Have you ever taken aid to Syria or Africa?” When I replied that I didn't have to justify to the Israeli state what I had done or planned to do, he screamed incomprehensible phrases for over five minutes. I asked the translator and my lawyer for a summary, but they advised me to let it go. For me, it was important to formally contest the accusation and declare that I would report Israel for kidnapping upon my return to Italy. I left Israel as soon as I could because I had set out to get to Gaza to see the eyes of the children of Gaza, not the hate-filled eyes of Israel's fascio-Zionist police. I spent another 24 hours in detention, in three different cells in Ashdod, at a police station near Ben Gurion Airport, and in a police center on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Everywhere I was stripped, searched, and completely deprived of my personal belongings. In 24 hours, I was offered two glasses of water and a sandwich.

What were the conditions of your detention?

The first detention facility where I spent almost three hours, two of which were in total isolation, was a cage inside a two-by-two-meter cell. It was hot and there was a noisy air conditioner that did little good. The second cell was in a police station, a cramped, windowless room with a concrete bed and a filthy toilet. It was myself, Jacob Berger, another U.S. activist, and two journalists from Al Jazeera. There were insects everywhere and the air felt suffocating. After a couple of hours, Jacob and I were transferred to Tel Aviv to a cell we ironically called a “five-star hotel” compared to the previous ones. A reinforced concrete bunk bed was the only furniture. We stayed there until 4:00 in the morning. Then they took us to the airport, to a large room where, under guard, we slept on blankets and sofas with about 10 immigrants without legal status, most of them from Asia. With us was also Emma Fourreau, a French parliamentarian and a member of the Handala crew.

In those hours, my only thought was for my Palestinian brothers, for thousands of minors who have spent entire parts of their lives imprisoned, tortured and often without even an accusation to defend themselves against.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirmed that U.S. human rights defender Christian Smalls was physically attacked by seven uniformed officers immediately upon entering Israeli custody. They choked him and kicked his legs, leaving clear marks of violence. Did you witness similar acts of violence against him or other activists?

I know what the legal team that visited Chris in the detention center reported, and I can attest to the especially violent behavior of the police during the landing in Ashdod. There was a strong sense of racism among the police at the port. The most vulnerable were him, being of African descent, and the other activists of Arab origin. If U.S. citizens received different treatment, it's perhaps because they lacked adequate consular assistance. A country that declares war against anyone who “offends” its citizens or interests has abandoned the seven American activists. Chris was one of them and we unfortunately know the level of violence he suffered. This indifference finds its reason in the fact that Washington — along with Brussels, Strasbourg, Paris, Berlin, and Rome — have the blood of the Palestinian people on their hands. [These countries] provide the weapons for the genocide, and make key facilities available, like the U.S. base in Sigonella in my Sicily, which offers operational, logistical, and strategic support. [These countries] also support [Israel] politically and diplomatically, legitimizing crimes, abuses, and unheard-of violations.

What's next for you?

I will continue to do what I have done my whole life: analyze and denounce Israel's crimes, the military-industrial-financial-academic system that governs it and feeds apartheid and genocide, and especially the very serious responsibilities of partner countries, first and foremost my own: Italy…. I would do a mission like the Handala's again, with the utmost conviction and the same hope of reaching Gaza.

Originally published by Capital B.

While much of the outrage over the rising number of immigration detention facilities is focused on Florida's “Alligator Alcatraz,” Georgia is quietly working on building the largest ICE facility in the country, thanks to the passage of President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Charlton County, located 10 miles from the Florida border and 274 miles south of Atlanta, approved a nearly $50 million agreement with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in June to expand the Folkston ICE Processing Center from 1,100 detainees to nearly 3,000. The plans incorporate the shuttered D. Ray James Correctional Facility into the existing footprint. 

Trump's budget allocates $45 billion for ICE detention centers through the end of September 2029.

Folkston, a private prison run by The GEO Group, is not without considerable problems.

According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in 2022, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General published the results of a 2021 inspection of the Folkston detention center, citing “unsanitary and dilapidated” facilities, with water leaks, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, lack of access to hot showers, inoperable toilets, and no hot meals.

“Folkston did not meet standards for facility conditions, medical care, grievances, segregation, staff-detainee communications, and handling of detainee property,” the report read. “We identified violations that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees.”

Last year, Jaspal Singh, an Indian national, died after spending nine months in detention at Folkston. He was 57.

“We are heartbroken by Mr. Singh's passing while he was confined in this abusive and poorly managed facility that has been violating immigrants' human rights since ICE began detaining people there in 2017,” said Meredyth Yoon, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, in a statement calling for the facility's closure.

U.S. Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter, R-Georgia, has heralded the new detention facility as a boon for Charlton County's economy, with the creation of 400 jobs and additional water and sewer revenue. 

Against the backdrop of the Georgia expansion are growing fears within Atlanta's immigrant community that deportation efforts without due process will increase. 

Pew Research estimates around 200,000 Black immigrants, mostly from Jamaica, Haiti, and Nigeria, call metro Atlanta home. 

Capital B Atlanta spoke with Nana Gyamfi, executive director for The Black Alliance for Just Immigration, in June about why Black immigrants especially need to be on alert. She said blackness adds another critical level to the type of profiling that can lead to arrest by ICE officers

“What we know from the data, as well as anecdotal experiences, is that most law enforcement interactions with Black immigrants begin as racial profiling that then goes down another road when the officer hears an accent or realizes there is a language barrier,” Gyamfi said. “As a result, Black migrants are detained, deported and held in solitary confinement at a disproportionately higher rate.”

Trump's travel ban adds another layer of concern: Eight out of 12 banned countries — and three out of the seven partially banned countries — are Black or African.

“Even though most people are focused on the Muslim element, the face of the ban is really a Black face,” Gyamfi said.  

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has already been ramping up efforts in the state to support Trump's immigration. In March, he announced that the Georgia Department of Public Safety had requested ICE train 1,100 officers “to better assist in identifying and apprehending illegal aliens who pose a risk to public safety in the state.”  

Then in May, Kemp signed House Bill 1105, requiring sheriffs to hold suspects believed to be in the country illegally if they are wanted by ICE. None of the sheriffs in metro Atlanta's five core counties are reportedly signed up to participate.

The contract for the new Charlton County facility awaits approval by the Department of Government Efficiency.

Israel plans to forcibly evacuate an estimated 1 million Palestinians from Gaza City.

Israel's security cabinet has approved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to take over and occupy Gaza City, forcibly displacing an estimated 1 million Palestinians sheltering there and establishing “camps” to confine Palestinians in an escalation of Israel's genocide.

Netanyahu's office said in a statement on the plan that the Israeli military is preparing to take control of the capitol city “while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones.” Netanyahu has separately announced plans to take over all of Gaza, saying in an interview on Fox News Thursday that Israel intends to seize Gaza and then hand over governing responsibilities to another Arab nation.

Israeli media reports that the plan would take place in phases over the next five months. The first phase would entail driving the entire civilian population in the city, estimated to be about half of Gaza's population, toward al-Mawasi in the south — where Israel is planning to create camps to confine Palestinians, Israel's defense minister said last month.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Then, Israel would launch a military campaign in the region in the second phase, Israeli sources said, while U.S. officials ramp up the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation death trap operation in the Strip. 

The plan still awaits final approval from the full cabinet, which is expected to meet this weekend, according to Reuters. NBC reports that commercial satellite images show the Israeli military is increasing troops near the Gaza border, potentially indicating a major new ground invasion.

Israeli officials have outright said that the plan is to push Palestinians into camps, while Israeli outlets are also reporting as such. 

“The goal is to evacuate all Palestinian civilians from Gaza City to the central camps and other areas by October 7,” one senior Israeli official told Axios. “A siege will be imposed on the Hamas militants who remain in Gaza City, and at the same time, a ground offensive will be carried out in Gaza City.”

Netanyahu's office also outlined supposed five principles for the “end” of the genocide as approved by the cabinet: disarming Hamas; return of Israeli hostages; demilitarization of Gaza; Israeli security control in Gaza; and the establishment of an government not controlled by Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.

The siege and forced evacuation plan was swiftly condemned by the UN and world leaders.

“The Israeli Government's plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza strip must be immediately halted,” said UN human rights chief Volker Türk in a statement Friday. “It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible.”

Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas condemned the plan as a “full-fledged crime” furthering Israel's “policy of genocide, systematic killing, starvation, and siege.” Hamas added that the plan shows that Israeli officials “do not care about the fate of the captives.”

European leaders also criticized the plan, but took little action to stop it. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany, one of Israel's top foreign arms providers, is halting transfer of weapons that could be used in Gaza — though UN experts have previously said that states have the obligation to halt transfers of all, not just some, arms to Israel due to the high risk of them being used to violate international law.

Meanwhile, even though the plan marks a major escalation of Israel's genocide, some of Netanyahu's extremist coalition partners still feel it doesn't go far enough. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said via a spokesperson on Friday that the plan “may sound good, but it's actually more of the same,” adding that it's “not Zionist,” per Times of Israel.

“This is not an operation to conquer the Strip, take full military control of the territory and push for a decisive outcome — the only way to ensure victory, lasting security and the return of the hostages — but a specific and dangerous operation whose sole purpose is to return Hamas to the negotiating room — a goal that isn't a goal of the war,” Smotrich said.

Though he uses the lives of Israeli captives as reasoning for his opposition, Smotrich has previously called for Israel to fully take over and occupy Gaza regardless of the captives. 

“We are finally going to occupy the Gaza Strip. We will stop being afraid of the word ‘occupation,'” Smotrich reportedly said at a far right conference in May. This would entail “no retreat from the territories we have conquered, not even in exchange for hostages.”

In the half century after the Watergate scandal exposed the degree to which graft and bribery had tainted Washington and warped U.S. foreign policy, preventing corruption at home and combating it overseas became a signal mission for federal law enforcement and American diplomacy. Over the decades, commitment to those goals waxed and waned, and numerous scandals demonstrated that the U.S. political system and important American institutions and corporations remained vulnerable to and complicit in corruption. But thanks to a set of powerful laws and regulations and generations of professionals dedicated to supporting transparency and a level playing field, the United States made tremendous strides in fighting corruption.

In the past six months, that progress has been almost completely undone. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has blunted Washington's most effective anticorruption tool, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which he described as a “horror show for America”; dissolved task forces to combat kleptocracy; and declared that his administration would not enforce laws designed to prevent wealthy people and companies from hiding their assets in offshore accounts. In one particularly shocking act, as part of a clear quid pro quo, the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, promised to cooperate with Trump's crackdown on immigrants; in exchange, Trump's Department of Justice moved to dismiss federal charges against Adams, who had allegedly turned to foreign sources to illegally fund his reelection campaign. This open embrace of corruption has not stopped at the water's edge: the Trump administration recently condemned the bribery conviction of a former Colombian president, Álvaro Uribe, calling it the work of “radical judges.”

And then there's the orgy of self-dealing through which Trump has transformed the White House into a profit platform for himself and his family. Since Trump was inaugurated in January, the company run by his son Eric, the Trump Organization, has struck many new deals with kleptocratic regimes abroad, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, opening a direct line between these regimes and the American president's wallet. Meanwhile, Trump has become deeply involved in the shady world of cryptocurrency, with foreign funders directly bankrolling Trump's “meme coin” for the chance to gain access to the president. As Richard Briffault, an expert on government ethics, told The Guardian, “People are paying to meet Trump and he's the regulator in chief. It's doubly corrupt. This is unprecedented. I don't think there's been anything like this in American history.” And of course there is the $400 million jet that the government of Qatar “gifted” to Trump to use as a new Air Force One—and perhaps to take with him when he leaves office.

The damage Trump has already done is staggering, and he has more than three years to go even further. But his tolerance for and embrace of the crudest kinds of corruption also create an opportunity for his opponents. The United States may have given up its leading role in the fight against corruption, but Americans still care about it. An October 2022 New York Times/Siena poll of registered voters found that “when respondents were asked to volunteer one or two words to summarize the current threat to democracy, government corruption was brought up most often.” As the Pew researchers who conducted polling on the subject found in 2023, “The belief that there is too much money in politics is widespread. References to the influence of money and concerns about corruption are some of the most frequently cited critiques of the political system, and many Americans see monetary gain as a reason why most elected officials seek office to begin with.”

Few candidates for high-level offices have seized on anticorruption as a campaign platform. (An ironic exception is Trump himself, who managed, in three successive campaigns, to cynically persuade many Americans that he is not an avatar of corruption but a crusader against it.) But earlier this year, the leading mayoral candidate in New York City, Zohran Mamdani, won an upset victory in the Democratic primary in part by criticizing both Adams and another candidate, Andrew Cuomo, for representing “the same donors, the same corruption, the same small vision funded by big money.” And anticorruption messages have proved effective in a number of recent issue-based political campaigns around the country. In 2022, a ballot initiative successfully took on the role of “dark money” in elections in Oakland, California, by lowering donation limits and increasing donor transparency rules. Campaigns to establish ranked-choice voting in Evanston, Illinois; Fort Collins, Colorado; and other cities have relied on anticorruption messages in taking on entrenched interests who benefit from traditional balloting.

In seizing on corruption, Democrats and progressives can't limit themselves to criticizing Trump's personal venality. Rather, they should connect it to the broader global phenomenon of corruption and argue that Trump is subverting American interests by working in parallel with oligarchs, kleptocrats, and criminals who are eroding democracy all over the world and making the United States less safe and prosperous. Anticorruption efforts should become the main pillar of progressive and Democratic politics not only at home but also in foreign policy.

The idea of values-based U.S. foreign policy may strike some as an anachronism. After all, the Biden administration cast itself as a defender of democratic values that would “lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example,” as President Joe Biden put it in his inaugural address. In practice, however, such lofty rhetoric was married to a nostalgic attachment to American primacy that led to a foreign policy plagued by hypocrisy and incoherence.

Biden's failure to match rhetoric with action does not mean that future U.S. officials should stop trying to align foreign policy with the broader project of restoring faith in democratic governance and confronting the increasingly oligarchic character of U.S. politics and society. Sticking the landing on the next iteration of a foreign policy that honors both interests and values will hinge on a pragmatic and clear-eyed assessment of what matters to American voters and what the United States can plausibly hope to achieve in its global engagement. In this respect, there is one issue that uniquely bridges the domestic and foreign policy realms and offers a clear path to rebuilding goodwill with Washington's foreign partners: the fight against corruption.

To understand why anticorruption is the future of U.S. foreign policy, it's helpful to look to the past. For much of American history, corruption was not seen as a major foreign policy issue. That changed after the Watergate scandal. In addition to unearthing wrongdoing on the part of the president, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies, the congressional investigations that took place after Watergate also revealed just how deeply entwined American corporations were with corrupt foreign networks abroad. As investigators discovered, many of the most prominent U.S. companies were routinely engaging in high-level bribery around the world, entrenching kleptocratic regimes in the process. The sheer scale of the revelations went far beyond anything American officials ever imagined; as one investigator put it, “None of us dreamed that there were the millions, the tens of millions, the hundreds of millions [in bribes], that we found.”

The fallout was swift. Anti-American protests erupted around the world, centered on how Washington had propped up corrupt regimes and officials. In Honduras, the country's pro-American autocracy quickly disintegrated when it became clear that the head of the United Fruit Company had bribed the Honduran president to make it easier for the firm to ship bananas. The revelations cemented a generation of anti-American animus in the country. In Italy, companies such as Lockheed had bribed multiple officials in exchange for favorable terms in military aircraft sales. When the details spilled out, the clearest beneficiaries were Italy's communists, who could point to their capitalist opponents as little more than bought-off American puppets. As Frank Church, the Democratic senator from Idaho who presided over the congressional hearings, put it: “This country and its major allies are going to wake up one morning and find that the basis of stable democratic government has been eaten away.”

Remarkably, it was somehow not illegal for American corporations to spend hundreds of millions of dollars bribing foreign officials. The solution, then, was simple: criminalize the activity, and prevent these private American entities from single-handedly detonating American foreign policy. In 1977, legislators did just that, passing the FCPA, which finally made this kind of bribery illegal.



It was, in many ways, a watershed; not only was this the first legislation of its kind in American history, but it was also the first of its kind in global history. No country had ever criminalized bribery that took place in other countries or so explicitly linked anticorruption efforts to its foreign policy. It set a bar for other democratic countries and created a bedrock for Washington to flesh out its anticorruption and counter-kleptocracy policy in the decades to come.

Although it took some time, by the early twenty-first century American legislators and White House officials were launching salvo after salvo against transnational corruption, implementing new policies and issuing new appointments that gradually drew anticorruption efforts closer and closer to the center of American foreign policy. In the first decade of this century, the United States made it harder for American banks to launder the wealth of foreign officials, a practice that corroded international stability and corrupted the American financial system in the process. In the 2010s, the creation of the Magnitsky Sanctions—named for the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, an anticorruption crusader who died in jail in 2009 after being denied medical care—targeted not just human rights abusers but also some of the most corrupt figures around the world, including the former Gambian despot Yahya Jammeh, the Israeli mining magnate Dan Gertler, and Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbekistan's former dictator, among many others.

Momentum stalled during Trump's first term, but it did not halt entirely. Although Trump issued rhetorical broadsides against many of these policies, he didn't dismantle any of them, instead allowing them to continue and even expand in certain aspects. After Trump's defeat in 2020, the momentum returned—and accelerated. The Biden administration and allies in Congress launched multiple efforts to expand Washington's anticorruption regime. The White House launched initiatives such as the KleptoCapture task force, specifically targeting wealth stashed abroad by corrupt oligarchs. Congress passed the country's first-ever shell company registry, the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which promised to end the United States' role as one of the major centers of the global offshore economy. The administration announced new counter-kleptocracy rules for sectors such as real estate and private investment industries, created a new positions at the State Department and the National Security Council focused exclusively on corruption, and even issued the first-ever U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption, which argued that by “preventing and countering corruption and demonstrating the advantages of transparent and accountable governance, we can secure a critical advantage for the United States and other democracies.”

The first six months of Trump's new administration have been a blur of efforts to dismantle all of that progress, going back decades. Fortunately, because Trump has opted for legislative shortcuts, many of the most powerful tools, such as the FCPA, technically remain on the books, and can be picked up again by a future administration. But future officials can't simply pick up where Biden left off. Democrats need a much broader, much more salient anticorruption plan moving forward—one that is at the center of their platform rather than at the periphery.

This project is unlikely to succeed if it confines itself to domestic reforms. The old-fashioned notion of corruption as a local problem made sense in an era in which capital mostly stayed within national borders. But in a modern digitized economy when shell companies can be generated in minutes and funds can cross jurisdictions in milliseconds, corruption—especially grand corruption involving elected officials and national leaders—is of an increasingly transnational character.

Consider the recent charges against U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), which allege that the legislator accepted bribes from an Azerbaijani oil company and a Mexican bank through a series of sham contracts involving offshore shell companies, or the criminal conviction of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) for accepting illicit payments through individuals and front companies linked to the governments of Egypt and Qatar. If the United States does not confront and disrupt the kleptocratic networks, offshore havens, and money-laundering professionals that enable global illicit finance, it is leaving its own institutions exposed to this kind of malign foreign influence.

The United States' ability to advance its interests at home and abroad depends on the vitality, efficacy, and legitimacy of its own democratic institutions and those of its partners. Corruption is a driver of democratic retrenchment, political instability, civil strife, transnational crime, and human rights abuses. It undermines security partnerships and jeopardizes U.S. military and civilian assistance, as Washington learned the hard way in Afghanistan. It frustrates U.S. efforts to build resilient and reliable supply chains for critical goods by driving up the cost of capital and deterring investment in jurisdictions perceived to have weak rule of law. Finally, corruption provides autocratic governments with a “gray zone” strategic weapon to influence the workings of democratic systems in furtherance of their geopolitical ambitions.



If a future administration wants to reorient U.S. foreign policy toward a genuinely cooperative, post-primacy approach that emphasizes the common good in an increasingly multipolar world, it must do so in tandem with a robust anticorruption program. A world in which corruption runs rampant is one in which states will struggle to cooperate effectively to fight climate change, prepare for and respond to pandemics, promote sustainable development, and ensure equitable and broad distribution of renewable energy technologies, health infrastructure, and other global goods. By the same token, corruption and the offshore jurisdictions and kleptocratic networks that sustain it are obstacles to international coordination on labor exploitation, corporate impunity, and environmental crimes. Put simply, the United States will never succeed in building a more democratic, equal, and peaceful world if it fails to control endemic graft.

Anticorruption also offers the most plausible pathway to repairing Washington's badly damaged credibility on values. Even before Trump's second term, the United States' double standard on Israel's horrific treatment of Gaza's civilian population bred mistrust and cynicism in much of the world. That legacy, in conjunction with four more years of “America first” posturing, makes it very unlikely that the next administration will be able to draw on the reserve of global goodwill that Biden enjoyed when he assumed office. Going forward, the United States will face a far heavier burden of proof in establishing its bona fides as a positive force in global affairs.

Anticorruption is a logical point of departure in seeking to establish a new, more benign role for the United States in global affairs. Opposition to corruption is about as universal a belief as exists in the world today, one that even blatantly kleptocratic regimes such as Russia claim to deplore. And notwithstanding the Trump administration's assault on U.S. anticorruption capabilities, the United States has a strong record of shaping and defending anticorruption and transparency norms. Indeed, before the current administration, Washington was in a class of its own in its prosecution and sanctioning of corrupt acts outside its own borders, driving international cooperation to crack down on money laundering and illicit finance, and supporting local anticorruption efforts in fragile democracies in the Americas and the Indo-Pacific. These accomplishments offer a foundation from which the United States can resume values-based cooperation with its international partners.

A future administration that is serious about fighting corruption must first reverse the Trump policies that undercut U.S. anticorruption capabilities. At a minimum, this will mean reinstating the enforcement of key anticorruption and anti-money-laundering laws such as the FCPA and the CTA, restoring initiatives such as the Justice Department's anti-kleptocracy task force and the State Department's Office of the Coordinator on Global Anti-Corruption, and rejoining international efforts to strengthen transparency in the global economy, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Open Government Partnership.

The next administration should take aggressive early steps to protect U.S. institutions from the outsize influence of both foreign and domestic special interests that enjoy privileged links to public officials. To mark a clear break from the Trump era for both domestic and foreign audiences, the White House must curb the misuse of public office for private gain wherever it occurs. If the world's foremost democracy cannot get its own house in order, it will struggle to catalyze reforms elsewhere in the world.

A first step would be to reform the federal bribery statute and federal gifts statute to criminalize a broader range of abuses of public office, such as the payment of “gratuities” to an official as a token of appreciation for an act that he or she had performed in office. (Astonishingly, in 2023, the Supreme Court held that such intuitively corrupt behavior was not bribery under federal law.) The United States should also reform federal lobbying regulations to limit influence peddling by former officials, expanding the definition of lobbying to include any professional who is paid to influence lawmakers, and establishing a lifetime ban on lobbying for former senior officials and a cooling-off period for all others. New laws should bar executives of firms that have been subject to repeated criminal sanctions from serving as senior government officials and prohibit members of Congress from trading stocks or serving on corporate boards. And Congress should ban the grotesque practice of giving top diplomatic posts to major donors.

Perhaps the most important step will be to drastically reform the campaign finance system. The United States is an outlier among developed democracies in that its system of campaign finance is basically a form of legalized bribery. In recent years, more and more foreign actors have begun bankrolling American legislators, taking advantage of massive loopholes in campaign finance laws and the Federal Election Commission's lack of enforcement. At a minimum, Congress must move to legislate a reversal of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which effectively greenlighted bottomless campaign funding from American corporations. It must also reform the FEC, providing the body with much-needed resources to investigate campaign finance crimes and restoring the practice of allowing congressional appointments to the commission, which has become little more than an appendage of the executive branch.



At the same time as it puts its own house in order, the United States should be vigorously engaging with like-minded partners to forge a united front against corruption. As the regulator of the dollar-based financial system, the United States is uniquely positioned to shape the global financial infrastructure within which corruption thrives. In partnership with its European allies, Washington can establish new rules of the game for cross-border financial activity and impose order and transparency on ungoverned financial spaces, including by coordinating sanctions and other coercive measures against governments that abet money laundering, pursuing coordinated sanctions against corrupt officials and their enablers using authorities such as the Global Magnitsky Act, and conditioning access to U.S. markets and other leading financial systems on stringent anti-money-laundering standards that go beyond current international requirements. To enhance these efforts, officials should also step up intelligence collection relating to overseas corruption and provide greater resources for anti-money-laundering entities such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN.

Alongside these regulatory and law enforcement measures, Washington should recommit to foreign assistance and diplomacy focused on strengthening the rule of law and fighting kleptocracy and state capture. The Biden administration's most successful initiatives in leveraging American soft power to fight kleptocracy overseas—including defending Guatemala's electoral integrity against entrenched oligarchy and helping governments in eastern Europe and the Pacific Islands identify and prevent Russian and Chinese attempts to use corrupt networks to tilt elections and shift policy—provide constructive examples to draw on. This effort should be paired with a concerted effort to increase the number of overseas personnel with experience and training in combating corruption, beginning with ambassadors, who are often the tip of the spear of anticorruption efforts in fragile democracies.

American tough talk on corruption has not always translated into action when it has conflicted with other strategic interests. The Biden administration's reluctance to sanction Indian and Israeli officials dogged by well-documented and credible corruption allegations, as well as its partnerships with deeply corrupt governments in places such as Egypt, Honduras, and Afghanistan, compromised its ability to call out corruption elsewhere in the world and provided ammunition to claims of U.S. hypocrisy and double standards. This will require the next presidential administration to make a public commitment to anticorruption as a priority and a congressional cohort ready and willing to use its oversight authority to monitor progress and hold the administration to those commitments. A good place to start would be passing a law that would prohibit security cooperation with military forces credibly implicated in corrupt acts or linked to regimes that support transnational corruption—akin to the way the so-called Leahy law prohibits security cooperation with forces that commit human rights violations.

At some point, perhaps as soon as 2029, a U.S. administration will once again find itself confronted with the difficult task of persuading its erstwhile partners and allies that it stands for something greater than its own power. But unlike previous reboots, the United States should not expect to sit at the head of the table after spending four years trying to overturn it. Instead, it will need to demonstrate that it is as good as its word on values. A full-throated campaign to restore transparency, accountability, and integrity to its own institutions as well as those of fellow democracies is the place to start.

SVIATLANA TSIKHANOUSKAYA is the leader of the Belarusian opposition and head of the United Transitional Cabinet.

 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya

Belarus—nestled between the European Union, Ukraine, and Russia—has long been overlooked and underestimated by outsiders, who often see it as little more than an extension of Russia. This perception stems largely from the grip of the country's dictator, Alexander Lukashenko. Since 1994, he has transformed Belarus into a repressive state marked by fraudulent elections, systemic violence, and a deepening reliance on Moscow and Beijing.

But five years ago, Belarusians made it clear that they do not want to live in a belligerent autocracy, isolated from the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. In 2020, I entered Belarus's presidential election to stop Lukashenko from claiming a sixth term. I didn't expect to win; Lukashenko had rigged every previous contest. But my message—free the country's political prisoners, end repression, hold real elections, and restore the rule of law—struck a nerve. According to independent observers, Belarusians overwhelmingly voted for me. When Lukashenko declared himself the winner anyway, the country exploded in the largest peaceful uprising in its modern history. Up to 1.5 million people flooded the streets of Belarusian cities demanding change.

I did not intend to enter politics. I was an English teacher and then a full-time mother focused on helping my hearing-impaired son. My husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, was the political one—an entrepreneur whose blog exposed the daily humiliations of life under dictatorship. His words inspired thousands. When he announced his candidacy in May 2020, the regime arrested him days later. I decided to run in his place—not out of ambition, but out of love.

The response to the protests was brutal. To clear the streets, the regime carried out waves of mass arrests, engaged in widespread torture, and generally terrorized the populace. It detained tens of thousands of people, and it beat hundreds more. I was forced into exile, along with many others. But still, the uprising shook the regime to its core. The demonstrations might have succeeded, if not for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To prepare for his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Putin needed Belarus as a launching pad. He thus propped up Lukashenko by sending in security advisers and other kinds of operatives, providing financial assistance, and signaling a readiness to intervene more intensely—saving Lukashenko's rule in return for obedience and Belarus's subjugation. Today, my country remains under de facto Russian occupation. Nine million people are being held hostage by a regime that answers not to them, but to the Kremlin.

Although Lukashenko was able to stop the protests, Belarusians still yearn for freedom. Operating outside the country, my colleagues and I are working to liberate our homeland. We have established a government in exile, staffed with Belarusian activists and defectors from the regime, prepared to take charge of rebuilding the country. We have formalized ties with American and European officials. Many countries now see me as Belarus's legitimate leader. We have even made inroads with regime insiders who are ready for change.

The spirit of resistance, in other words, endures. And with it, so does the possibility of Belarusian democracy.

Belarus is a European nation. It has its own language, history, and identity. It has a long tradition of democratic aspirations and of support for its western neighbors. Despite censorship and repression, polls consistently show that Belarusians oppose Russia's war on Ukraine, reject tyranny, and support democracy. Only four percent favor unification with Russia. Over 60 percent oppose Putin's deployment of nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil.

These numbers are not anomalies. They are evidence of a deep, pro-independence and pro-European orientation that the regime cannot extinguish. They have made it tricky for Putin to do as he wishes in Belarus, despite his and Lukashenko's tyranny. Putin failed, for example, to drag the Belarusian army into his war. In fact, Belarusian railway workers have sabotaged Russian military logistics, starting in the early weeks of the invasion. Many Belarusians have even joined Ukraine's defense, forming the Kalinouski Regiment: the largest foreign volunteer unit in Ukraine's army.

Because of repression, resistance to Lukashenko has shifted underground and out of the country. But even in exile, the Belarusian opposition has built a rare thing: a unified, credible, and ready alternative to dictatorship. We have formed the United Transitional Cabinet and Coordination Council, in which representatives are elected using digital tools. These bodies represent the democratic will of the Belarusian people and provide practical support to those still inside Belarus and to over half a million Belarusians now in exile. They serve as a viable structure of governance—a government in waiting.



In addition to this cabinet and council, our movement includes a network of civil society organizations, diaspora groups, independent media, education and legal services, and humanitarian aid providers that help the repressed and their families. We work with religious groups, small businesses, and labor unions to sustain social solidarity, defend workers' rights, and preserve Belarusian identity and civic life, despite the dictatorship. Our media platforms continue to reach millions inside Belarus, despite press restrictions.

Our movement is delivering on its pledges. Inspired by a step taken by the Estonian government in exile that formed in the 1940s to oppose Soviet occupation, we have introduced a new Belarusian passport for exiles and drafted a new constitution. We formalized cooperation with the European Union and the Council of Europe. And we are carrying out a strategic dialogue with the U.S. State Department to increase pressure on the regime, to support our movement for freedom, and to ensure that Belarus remains on the international agenda and that it features in conversations about Europe's security architecture. These steps will help ensure that whenever Belarus has its next political opening, we can swiftly take action and turn the country toward democracy.

Right now, such an opening may seem unlikely. But history shows that dictatorships often collapse unexpectedly—triggered by internal or external shocks. Lukashenko, for example, is aging, and discussions about an inevitable transition of power have already begun within the regime's highest circles. Unfortunately for them, the system he built is entirely centered on himself and lacks any legitimate or stable mechanism for succession. Unlike some autocrats, Lukashenko also has no viable heir. That makes his system brittle. We are working to ensure that when a power vacuum emerges, Belarus is handed over to us, not to Putin.



To do so, we are already sending a clear message to the regime's elites: there is a chance for a negotiated, peaceful transition. We are proposing a roundtable dialogue between representatives of the democratic forces and those in the regime who are ready to talk about change. The goal of such a roundtable is to achieve national reconciliation and end the political crisis through a peaceful, negotiated transition. This model is inspired by the Polish round table of 1989 between Solidarity, the country's opposition movement at the time, and the authorities, who were enfeebled by a weakened Moscow and by U.S. and European sanctions. It ended with Solidarity taking charge.

The Belarusian regime, like the Polish one then, is far less monolithic than it appears. Inside ministries, security services, and even state-run media, there are officials who are disillusioned. Some of them are already leaking valuable information to us, including on how Minsk evades sanctions. These insiders could prove crucial when the window for change opens. That is why we keep quiet but active lines of communication with them. They know that change is inevitable—and that their own future depends on being part of it. In fact, our task is to expand these contacts while maintaining the support of Belarusians and preserving pro-European sentiment. We are working to prevent Russian propaganda from poisoning Belarusian society.

We are also defending what is left of Belarus's independence. For decades, Lukashenko tried to play Europe and Russia off each other, but today, he is entirely dependent on the latter. As long as he remains in power, Minsk will only more closely align itself with Moscow, to the point where Belarus could become little more than a Russian military outpost.

Given the regime's heavy reliance on the Kremlin, a democratic Belarus is not only in the best interest of Belarusians. It is in the best interest of the United States and the European Union. If Belarus is free, Russia will no longer have the same military balcony in Europe, and that will reduce pressure on NATO's eastern flank and lower the bloc's defense costs. In fact, a free Belarus could become a source of regional stability and a true security partner for Ukraine. A democratic Belarus would contribute to digital innovation (the country has a top-notch IT sector), support energy diversification, and facilitate trade. Unlike Lukashenko, it would contribute to border security rather than weaponizing migration to provoke instability in Europe.

To be clear, we are not asking outsiders to change our country for us. That is our job, our mission, and our responsibility. But we do ask for help in making this transformation achievable.

The United States and the European Union have already taken many essential, useful steps. After the Belarusian election was stolen in 2020, they developed a three-pronged approach to support the Belarusian people: weakening Lukashenko's regime, supporting pro-freedom and pro-European aspirations, and assisting in an eventual transition. To that end, both imposed sanctions on the regime. Lithuania and Poland gave refuge to hundreds of thousands of Belarusians, and Washington and the EU provided support to independent Belarusian media, activists, and projects aimed at preserving national identity. The EU has even pledged over $3 billion to support Belarus through its democratic transition once it begins—a powerful signal that Belarus belongs in Europe. They have continued to draw a line between the Belarusian people and the regime, even after the latter helped Moscow drive toward Kyiv. That distinction is one of the key achievements of our movement.



This approach must continue. At times, I hear analysts call for a return to working with Lukashenko as a means of isolating the Kremlin, as if the two can be separated. Instead, the United States and Europe must double down on their support of Belarus's people through technical assistance for Belarusian civil society, independent media, human rights activists, cultural organizations, digital security tools, and diaspora networks. They are the oxygen of resistance. That support must be extended to exiles and our institutions. Russia is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into propping up Lukashenko's regime. The United States and Europe must make sure we can keep building a strong, resilient alternative.

Some U.S. and EU analysts may wonder whether regime change is feasible when Russia is so committed to keeping Lukashenko around. Morally, the future of Belarus is not for Moscow to decide, but in reality, much will depend on Russia's strength during any moment of crisis and on the outcome of its war against Ukraine. If Russia is weak and contained, then Belarus has a chance. For this reason, American and European officials cannot ignore Belarus as they begin to discuss cease-fires, Ukraine, and lasting peace in the region. Other states must ensure that Moscow won't interfere when change in Belarus begins—and that Belarus does not become a consolation prize for a defeated Putin.

In the meantime, Washington and the EU can increase their punitive actions toward Minsk. They could, for instance, apply more secondary sanctions and restrict the cargo trade through the EU-Belarus border, one major source of income for the regime. Even the threat of such actions could make a difference for Belarus's cash-strapped government. We must raise the cost for Minsk of every act of repression and every crime it commits. That is why we are also calling on other countries to support Lithuania's initiative at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice to hold the regime accountable for its crimes. We understand that ending Lukashenko's regime may require some kind of settlement: if Lukashenko were to step down voluntarily and agree to free and fair elections under international supervision, for example, other states could consider giving him and his family personal security guarantees. In fact, we proposed doing this in 2020. But in general, to end the regime's impunity, its perpetrators must be brought to justice.

Unfortunately, over the past five years, I've often felt that international organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have struggled to respond meaningfully to crises like the one in Belarus. Too often, their actions stop at words of condemnation. They lack the tools or the political will, or they are paralyzed by rules demanding consensus and by the obstruction of authoritarian members.

Individual world leaders, however, are a different story. As I have met presidents and prime ministers—at the G-7, the UN General Assembly, and other global platforms—I have realized how crucial personal initiative truly is. I have witnessed bold leadership on Belarus from leaders such as President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Vice President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Perhaps most important, I have witnessed such leadership from U.S. President Donald Trump. It was during his first administration that the United States took decisive action against Lukashenko—action that largely shaped the transatlantic approach to Belarus. Washington was among the first governments to react to his brutal 2020 crackdown, imposing sanctions on his regime. Trump appointed Julie Fisher as ambassador to Belarus. She was denied entry by the regime, but she later brilliantly served as the U.S. special envoy for Belarus until 2022 and now works as the American chargé d'affaires in Kyiv.



Trump has continued this strong track record during his second term in office. Retired general Keith Kellogg—the president's Ukraine envoy—secured the release of several Belarusian political prisoners, including U.S. citizens and my husband, Siarhei, who had spent five years in solitary confinement. I will be forever grateful to Trump and his team for this breakthrough. It was not only a humanitarian mission but also a clear demonstration of American leverage. Lukashenko fears Trump's unpredictability, and so he chose to release Siarhei rather than risk stronger sanctions or some other escalation that could endanger his hold on power. He got nothing from Washington in return. Today, we urge Trump to go even further and use that same leverage to push for the release of the remaining 1,150 political prisoners. Doing so could mark the beginning of de-escalation between the Belarusian regime and democratic forces. If his efforts succeed, Trump could score the greatest humanitarian victory for Belarus in modern history.

Trump need not fear the consequences of deeper involvement. Unlike many global crises, Belarus is not mired in civil war, ethnic conflict, or ideological divisions. It is in a decades-long standoff, rooted in one man's relentless grip on power. For Trump, this is a low-cost, high-impact opportunity. Belarus could become his foreign policy success story—one that sends a message to other entrenched authoritarian regimes, including in Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela, that they are not secure.

To strengthen and coordinate these efforts, it is time to again appoint a U.S. special envoy for Belarus, just as Kellogg was appointed for Ukraine. This envoy can work closely with Washington's EU partners and our movement on releasing political prisoners, synchronizing sanctions policy, and ensuring that Belarus moves along the path of reform.

I am confident that the U.S. Congress will support this approach. Belarus remains one of the few foreign policy issues that unites lawmakers across party lines. Democrats and Republicans alike, in both the House and the Senate, believe in the steps I have laid out. An updated version of the bipartisan Belarus Democracy Act—which has historically authorized support for Belarusian civil society, independent media, and political prisoners, while mandating sanctions against regime officials—is already being drafted, with both Democratic and Republican sponsors. It can serve as a blueprint for action.

I often say the fight for freedom is not a sprint—but a marathon. Yet it still requires being ready at a moment's notice. Even the most entrenched dictatorships can suddenly fall.

Fortunately, Belarusians are ready. They are peaceful, patient, and resilient. We are fighting for their dignity, for justice, and for their right to live at home, in peace. They want what every American and European already enjoys: the right to speak freely, to worship without fear, to choose our representatives, to shape our own future, and to live with dignity. They are the values that bind us to our neighbors to the west.

They are also the values that inspire me to keep fighting, as are the thousands of families who are still waiting for their loved ones and the hundreds of thousands of Belarusians who remain in exile. The regime may have believed that releasing my husband would silence me. But it has only reignited my resolve. With Siarhei beside me, and with the strength of our people, I will continue this struggle with double the energy.

Some may say Belarus is too small to matter. But we are part of Europe's story, and we have paid a high price to advance the continent's overall freedom. We will not give up. The question is not whether change will come to Belarus. The question is who will be ready when it does.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","US man killed by buffalo he was tracking during South Africa hunting trip","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/africa/buffalo-kills-hunter-south-africa-scli-intl","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:52:00 GMT","


            A hunter from the United States has been killed by a buffalo he was tracking during an expedition in South Africa, organizers said this week.
    


            Asher Watkins, from Texas, was killed on Sunday “while on a hunting safari with us in South Africa's Limpopo Province,” Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CVS), the safari company that organized the trip, said in a statement sent to CNN.
    


            Hans Vermaak, who leads CVS, which says on its website that it's the longest-running hunting safari company in South Africa, said Watkins “was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers.”
    


            Vermaak did not say whether the animal was later killed.
    


            Safari-style hunting is common in Southern Africa and involves driving around hunting areas in an open-top safari truck in search of game. When the target animal is spotted, hunters trail them on foot before taking a shot.

            CVS team member Sarah Vermaak told CNN in an email that the group “does not intend to share any specific details regarding the tragic event (involving Watkins) publicly… out of respect for the family's privacy and in recognition of the sensitive and traumatic nature of the situation.”
    


            The Custodians of Professional Hunting and Conservation (CPHC), an association representing South Africa's hunting industry, said in a statement sent to CNN that “the circumstances surrounding the incident are (being) reviewed.”

            Buffalos, which can weigh up to nearly 2,000 pounds, are regarded as the most dangerous animals to trail in Africa, according to CVS.
    


            In 2018, a big game hunter was similarly killed by a buffalo in the province, according to local reports. Another man in the area was reported to have been attacked and killed by a buffalo after he fired shots at it.
    


            South African authorities have faced criticism and even legal action from wildlife groups who condemn trophy hunting.
    


            “This didn't have to happen. Trophy hunting is a cruel pastime that turns sentient beings into targets, all for a grotesque photo,” animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said in a Facebook post.
    


            Another group, called We Will Not Be Silenced about Hunters, posted on social media: “If Asher Watkins had not come to our country to steal the lives of South African wildlife, he would still be alive and his family and friends would not be heartbroken right now.”

            Every year after the Michelin guide announces its selection of starred restaurants in France, journalist Nora Bouazzouni receives a flurry of angry and resentful messages.
    


            It's become an unexpected consequence of her burgeoning reputation as one of the most influential whistleblowers of France's restaurant industry.
    


            The messages come from despondent restaurant staff, livid at seeing abusive, toxic chefs who have made their lives hell elevated to hero status with the awarding of one of the highest accolades in the industry.
    


            “It's really the straw that breaks the camel's back,” Bouazzouni tells CNN.
    


            Since 2017, the French food journalist has reported on toxic restaurant culture in kitchens across France. But it was her latest book “Violence in the Kitchen” published in May, that blew the lid off the story, exposing the extent of physical, emotional and psychological abuse in kitchens across France: open secrets in the industry, little-known to the general French public.
    


            Through testimonies collected from industry workers since 2020, the book recounts chefs erupting in violent tantrums, burning staff deliberately or throwing pans in their faces if they make a mistake during service. For people of color, it's putting up with race-based harassment and being exploited and mistreated. For women, it's being constantly sexualized, be it hands patting their bottoms every day, lewd remarks on their appearance and, in a more serious case, rape in a walk-in cooler by a colleague.
    


            In short, few emerge unscathed.
    


            “The testimonies that struck me the most were those that very quickly aimed to dehumanize people in the kitchen,” Bouazzouni says. “Because it's by dehumanizing people in the kitchen that they can be exploited.”
    


            Toxic kitchen culture is hardly unique to France and has been exposed and denounced for years in Anglophone and European countries.
    


            But Bouazzouni's work has helped spark a national reckoning in France and has reached the ears of the country's top lawmakers:  On July 7, a motion to create a commission of inquiry into violence in the kitchen was tabled in the French National Assembly.
    


            “Indeed, behind the smooth and idealized images of the profession as presented in various entertainment programs hides a rigid, almost military and brutal hierarchical organization,” the motion reads. “The working conditions of the kitchen ‘brigades' are often degrading, stressful, even violent. Yet silence reigns…”
    


            The mention of the “military and brutal hierarchical organization” is noteworthy as it refers to the system codified by French chef, restaurateur and writer August Escoffier in the late 19th century. Inspired by his time in the military, the kitchen brigade, as it's known, was modeled after the army, in which rank and hierarchy determines the chain of command. At the top of the food chain are the chef de cuisine and sous-chef, followed by the chefs de partie, who are responsible for specific stations (sauces, seafood, cold dishes and so on), junior cooks or commis and trainees.
    


            Both Escoffier and the precision of the professional restaurant kitchen that he inspired are revered in French culture.
    


            But in many ways, it's this top-down organization that has facilitated toxic kitchen culture, allowing chefs to abuse their staff with impunity, Bouazzouni points out.
    


            What's more, the kitchen brigade system has been exported and duplicated in fine dining and hotel kitchens around the world by the legions of international chefs who have come to train in the birthplace of haute gastronomy throughout the decades.
    


‘My hands were throbbing and burning': The Michelin-starred chef fighting toxic kitchen culture



            “When foreign chefs come to learn in France, either in schools, or in internships, they go back to work in other countries and continue to export this way of doing things,” Bouazzouni says.



            In other words, it's a vicious cycle.
    


            But how do you undo a century-old French system that is replicated in kitchens around the world?
    


            While male-dominated kitchens and high-pressure situations have long been known to contribute to toxic work environments, a 2021 paper published in the Journal of Management Studies offered up one compelling, but simple solution: create more open kitchens.
    


            For the study, researchers from Cardiff University concluded that the unique working environment of fine dining kitchens – isolated, closed, hidden spaces, far from the public eye – comes with a sense of freedom from scrutiny, where regular rules don't apply.
    


            “What surprised us in our study was the importance of where chefs worked in the context of cultures of bullying, violence and aggression. The kitchen environment effectively became a different moral universe for them,” lead researcher Robin Burrow said in a press release.
    


            The study was based on interviews with 47 chefs from fine dining restaurants around the world.



            The cult of celebrity chefdom in France has also contributed to the code of silence that has long muzzled victims. Top chefs are often lionized in long, fawning profiles, documentaries and cooking shows which makes them “untouchable,” Bouazzouni says, adding that the food media bears much responsibility for feeding the “mythology” of French gastronomy.
    


            But over the last five years, the post-pandemic world has flipped the script. France is no exception to the labor shortage and the “Great Resignation” phenomenon driven by overworked, disgruntled employees and younger generations in Western Anglophone countries. Today, 300,000 positions in France's restaurant and hospitality industry remain to be filled, says Thierry Marx, president of France's Union of Hotel Trades and Industries (UMIH).
    


            While an average of five new restaurants open every day, 23 restaurants close their doors permanently.
    


            Marx, who runs 10 high-end restaurants in Japan and France including the Michelin-starred restaurant Onor and the Restaurant Madame Brasserie at the Eiffel Tower, explains that the brigade system is necessary for delegating tasks and maximizing efficiency in stressful, high-pressure environments. But he also acknowledged that the system can be flawed, pointing out that the best chefs don't necessarily make the best leaders.
    


            “I think we need to add management courses and admit that being competent in a professional technique doesn't necessarily give you managerial know-how,” Marx said. “And it doesn't mean you can behave like an executioner.”
    


            Over the last few years, the emergence of both the #metoo movement in cinema and of younger generations who are more likely to push back against abuse has helped advance the discourse on creating safe kitchens in France.
    


            Since 2021, a non-profit association Bondir.e, founded by female French chefs, has organized violence prevention seminars in culinary and hospitality schools in a bid to raise awareness early and break the cycle of violence. That's because in France enrollment in vocational schools can start with students as young as 15, an age when teenagers are still highly impressionable and easy to indoctrinate.
    


            “When you're 15, you're still a child,” says Bondir.e spokesperson Vittoria Nardone. “You don't know what work is, but you're confronted with violence where strict rules are imposed. You're told that suffering is normal and a necessary part of success. When you're 15 and that's the only example you have to go on, it's easy to accept.”
    


Shacks! Rats! Regulations! New York City's outdoor dining scene has been on a wild ride



            The group has also set up a helpline to support victims of violence in the kitchen and offers professional training courses on communication and management in the kitchen.
    


            Both Nardone and Bouazzouni emphasize that while vulnerable individuals and minority groups are easy targets, violence and abuse can be perpetrated by both men and women of all ages, and within all ranks.
    


            One of the group's founding chefs, Manon Fleury, 34, has since gone on to open her own restaurant, Datil in Paris, which holds a Michelin star. As the boss, Fleury has made efforts to run her ship differently than her predecessors: the restaurant is closed weekends to promote work-life balance. All new staff are given a code of conduct charter that emphasizes mutual respect and a spirit of collaboration, and leadership training is provided for managers. Communication is also a key part of the workplace, with pre- and post-service briefings and monthly one-on-one meetings. The restaurant is also female-led.
    


            “When I opened my restaurant, I wanted to put women in positions of responsibility. My goal was to set an example, to show that women can and want to hold these positions,” Fleury said in a statement. “…At Datil, there are men in the dining room and kitchen, but all the management positions are held by women.”
    


            Marx acknowledges that times have changed: workers hold more leverage and have different relationships to work.
    


            “Bad management is a fear reflex,” he said. “Falling on the most fragile, that doesn't work anymore.”

            When Australia wants to put on a show, it turns to the sweeping expanse of Sydney Harbour, home to the Opera House and the iconic bridge that connects the city with its northern suburbs.
    


            So, when organizers of usually small pro-Palestinian protests held every two weeks since Israel's 2023 invasion of Gaza detected a shift in community attitudes towards the grinding conflict – at home and abroad – they chose the bridge to make a global statement.
    


            “We thought that the kind of bold and somewhat audacious idea that we were going to march over Sydney Harbour Bridge would capture the imaginations of everyone out there who was horrified by what we were seeing,” said protest organizer Josh Lees, from the Palestinian Action Group.
    


            The group had been emboldened by artists making pro-Palestinian statements at Glastonbury and the victory of Democratic New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who received backing from some of the city's Jewish population despite his criticism of Israel.
    


            “We felt it here in Australia, too,” said Lee, adding that the “real uptick in horror and anger” had translated into pledges of support from church groups, unions and members of parliament representing “a much broader section of society” than had previously engaged in the group's protests.
    


            Last Sunday, at least 90,000 people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge clutching umbrellas, signs and flags, lashed by cold winds and heavy rain, according to police estimates. Organizers put the figure at closer to 300,000. That so many people braved the elements for the hastily organized event – conceived just seven days before – suggests that Australians want their government to act, Lees said.
    


            Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday she wasn't surprised about the scale of the turnout.
    


            “I think the distress of Australians on what we are seeing unfolding in Gaza, the catastrophic humanitarian situation, the deaths of women and children, the withholding of aid, I anticipated that we would see marches of this scale,” she told ABC Radio National.
    


            “They do reflect the broad Australian community's horror at what is going on in the Middle East, and the desire for peace and a ceasefire, which is what the government is seeking.”
    


            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government is under increasing pressure to join other US allies, the United Kingdom, France and Canada, in pledging formal recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.
    


            Albanese and senior ministers have in recent weeks laid the groundwork for a public announcement saying it's a matter of “when, not if.”
    


            Wong said Tuesday talks are being held with the international community ahead of the UNGA, as she underscored the urgency of the situation.
    


            “There is a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognize if the international community don't move to create that pathway to a two-state solution,” she said.
    


            The US now stands increasingly alone from many of its closest Western allies on the issue of recognizing a Palestinian state and has condemned the moves by the UK, France and Canada. Recognition by Australia would add to that isolation.
    


            Calling for recognition of Palestinian statehood wasn't on the list of four demands submitted by the Palestinian Action Group before Sunday's march.
    


            “What we marched for on Sunday, and what we've been protesting for two years, is not recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state that Israel is in the process of wiping out,” said Lees. “What we are demanding is that the Australian government sanction Israel and stop the two-way arms trade with Israel.” The group also called for aid to be allowed into Gaza, an immediate ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal.
    


            The Australian government says it hasn't supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel during the latest Gaza war or for at least the past five years. However, Australian businesses are part of a supply chain that provides parts for F-35s, the type of fighter jet that Israel uses to bomb Gaza.
    


            “Australian industry contributes components and parts, but the Australian Government does not have a direct bilateral arrangement with the Government of Israel in relation to the F-35 program,” a defense ministry spokesperson said. The F-35 supply chain is centrally coordinated by Lockheed Martin and the US government, the spokesperson added.
    


            “Once they go to the United States, Australia has no control over them,” said Ian Parmeter, Research Scholar and Middle East Expert at the ANU Centre of Arab and Islamic Studies in Canberra. “The Australian government could refuse export permits for these components, but the contribution we make to the manufacture of F-35s would almost certainly be picked up elsewhere without any trouble.”
    


            To date, Australia has sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, in a joint move with Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom in June. It previously sanctioned individuals over their involvement in settler violence in the West Bank.
    


            But whatever Australia does in response is likely nowhere near enough to pressure Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu to end the conflict, which his security cabinet agreed to extend Thursday with the occupation of Gaza City.



            “Frankly, the one person who has leverage over Netanyahu is (US President Donald) Trump,” said Kenneth Roth, former Human Rights Watch executive director and visiting professor at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs. “He alone could condition the arms sales and military aid on an end to the mass atrocity being committed in Gaza,” Roth told public broadcaster ABC Tuesday.
    


            Parmeter said Trump is prepared to disagree with Netanyahu, but “whether he's prepared to rein in Netanyahu and make him stop the war in Gaza, to go to a ceasefire, and to essentially allow as much aid to flow as is needed, is very hard to say.”
    


            They may be thousands of miles away but the conflict in Gaza has been deeply felt by members of Australia's Muslim and Jewish communities.
    


            Reports of both antisemitism and Islamophobia have surged in Australia since October 2023, according to the offices of two separate envoys appointed to address the issue.
    


            Last month, antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal presented a sweeping plan to combat what she said was a “wave of hate.” It included education campaigns, police and immigration reforms, and penalties for public institutions, particularly universities, who fail to act
    


            At the time, the government said it would consider the recommendations, as critics pointed to their potential threat to free speech in a country that values freedom of expression.
    


            The size of Sunday's march was considered by some a victory over attempts to silence criticism of Israel. Days before the event, New South Wales Police tried to block the march in the Supreme Court on the grounds of public safety, after similar objections from state authorities.
    


            The bid failed when a judge ruled that, on balance, the prosocial nature of the event and experience of the organizers meant that banning it would not make it any safer, as thousands would still likely turn up.
    


            Police warnings of a crowd crush didn't eventuate, though there were so many people on the bridge that at one stage officers issued text messages and orders from loudspeakers on helicopters telling protestors to stop and walk back towards the city.
    


            Perceptions of the event ranged from a soul-restoring display of public compassion to a misguided attempt to wade into a complex debate with a cast of Hamas sympathizers.
    


            “Obviously, we don't politically support Hamas,” said Lees, of the Palestinian Action Group.
    


            Australian media reflected the opposing views in vastly different front-page treatments. Alongside an image of a woman in a headscarf, The West Australian's headline read: “Bloody chaos: Baby dolls smeared in fake blood and Aussie flag burned as wild protests become our norm.”
    


            The same day, the Sydney Morning Herald, owned by a rival media group, ran an image of crowds on the bridge with the headline, “Sydney says ‘enough'.''
    


            The march was noticed from Israel where Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar urged Australians to “wake up!”
    


            “The distorted alliance between the radical Left and fundamentalist Islam is sadly dragging the West toward the sidelines of history,” he wrote on X with an image of a protester holding a photo of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
    


            In a statement, the Australian Iranian Community Alliance also pointed to the photo and other imagery at the march and asked whether participants were “truly part of a movement seeking peace, or inadvertently amplifying forces opposed to it?”
    


            Co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Peter Wertheim noted in a letter to The Australian newspaper that none of the protesters called for the release of Israeli hostages.
    


            The day before the march, images of two emaciated Israeli hostages were released by the group, including video of one who said he was digging his own grave.
    


            “If people want to see Israeli hostages return, then they should also be fighting to end this genocide and for Israel to get out of Gaza,” said Lees.
    


            After the march, the Australian government committed an extra 20 million Australian dollars ($13 million) in aid to Gaza, taking the total to 130 million Australian dollars ($84 million) since October 2023, but it stopped short of granting any of the other demands.
    


            Hoping to build on the momentum, Lees says the group's planning a nationwide event on August 24.
    


            “I think we have, by holding this like immense demonstration on Sunday, helped to inspire people around the world to see that the tide is shifting, that masses of people now have seen through all of the kind of pro-Israel lies and propaganda that we've been bombarded with for so long, and are prepared and willing to stand up in bigger numbers than ever before to try to stop this genocide.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A split appeals court panel tossed out a judge's contempt finding against President Donald Trump's administration on Friday in a case over deportations to an El Salvador prison.

The decision comes after planes carrying Venezuelan migrants landed at the prison even after U.S District Judge James E. Boasberg said in court they must return to the United States.

Boasberg found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. The ruling marked a dramatic battle between the judicial and executive branches of government. 

But the divided three-judge panel in the nation's capital found that Boasberg had exceeded his authority and intruded on the executive branch's foreign affairs powers. 

Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of whom were nominated by Trump in his first term in the White House, agreed with the unsigned majority opinion.

“The district court's order attempts to control the Executive Branch's conduct of foreign affairs, an area in which a court's power is at its lowest ebb,” Rao wrote.

Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, dissented. “The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust,” she wrote. 

The 250 migrants have since been released back to their home country in a prisoner swap with the U.S. after months at the mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.




Boasberg had accused Trump administration officials of rushing deportees out of the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act before they could challenge their removal in court and then willfully disregarding his order that planes already in the air should return.

The Trump administration has denied any violation, saying the judge's directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order.

Last month, the Justice Department filed an unusual judicial misconduct complaint against Boasberg over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of judges as well as his actions in the deportations case. The complaint calls for the case to be taken away from Boasberg while an investigation proceeds.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the appeals court ruling, calling it a “MAJOR victory defending President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act” in a social media post and vowing to “continue fighting and WINNING in court.”

Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the migrants, said there was “zero ambiguity” in Boasberg's order about the planes. 

“We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward,” he said.

The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said. 

But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.

The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. 

USDA officials this week said they had “thoroughly reviewed” the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18. 

“The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,” officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday. 

And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. 




In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons — or wash their hands.

The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods. 


        USDA inspection findings from Boar's Head factories in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.
    

“If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. 

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria. 

Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site. 

The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.

Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize” for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.”

But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause. 

Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board. 

“Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols” described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement. 

“We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,” the statement said.

The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. 

They surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.

“You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. 

Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings “appalling.” 

“This is a pattern of negligence — cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. 

The findings echo the “inadequate sanitation practices” that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded. 

At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. 

While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of “dried fat and protein from the previous day's production” on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including “5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.”

Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.

The reports point to a “food safety culture problem,” said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.

“What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,” she said. “Usually that culture has to start at the top.”

In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections. 

“I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,” Kowalcyk said. 

Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Firefighters in a mountainous area north of Los Angeles made good progress overnight in their battle against a brush fire that has forced thousands of people to evacuate, an official said Friday.

The Canyon Fire ignited Thursday afternoon and spread rapidly in the dry, steep terrain in Ventura and Los Angeles counties to more than 7.6 square miles (19.7 square kilometers) with no containment by 11 p.m., according to the Ventura County Fire Department. At least 400 personnel battled the blaze along with several planes and helicopters. No further growth was reported Friday morning, though the fire remained uncontained, county fire department public information officer Andrew Dowd said by telephone.

The fire is burning just south of Lake Piru, a reservoir located in the Los Padres National Forest. It's close by Lake Castaic, a popular recreation area burned by the Hughes Fire in January. That fire burned about 15 square miles (39 square kilometers) in six hours and put 50,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings. 

Firefighters battling the Canyon Fire took advantage of lower temperatures overnight to directly attack the fire and made lots of progress, Dowd said. By Friday morning, they were seeing subdued fire behavior, he said. 

With 100-degree temperatures and strong winds, firefighters faced a “tough firefight” on Thursday, Dowd said.

“They were putting it all on the line to bring this fire under control,” he said. 




One firefighter reported a minor injury, but no civilian injuries were reported, Dowd said. No single-family or multi-family residences were destroyed, but two minor structures were destroyed, he said.

Sunny, hot and dry conditions were expected Friday in the area where the Canyon Fire was burning, with the daytime high near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) and minimum humidity in the mid-teens, according to the National Weather Service. Winds were expected to be light in the morning and grow from the south to southwest in the afternoon.

In LA County, around 2,700 residents evacuated with 700 structures under an evacuation order, officials said late Thursday. Another 14,000 residents and 5,000 structures were covered by an evacuation warning. Areas within the Val Verde zone had been reduced from an order to a warning.

The evacuation zones in nearby Ventura County were relatively unpopulated, Dowd said. Fifty-six people were evacuated from the Lake Piru recreation area.

LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the district, urged residents to evacuate.

“Extreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,” Barger said in a statement. “If first responders tell you to leave, go — without hesitation.”

The new blaze comes as a massive wildfire in Central California became the state's largest blaze of the year, threatening hundreds of homes and burning out of control in the Los Padres National Forest.

The Gifford Fire had spread to 155 square miles (402 square kilometers) by Thursday night with 15% containment. It grew out of at least four smaller fires that erupted Aug. 1 along State Route 166, forcing closures in both directions east of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000. It has injured at least four people. The causes of the fires are under investigation. 

Wildfire risk will be elevated through the weekend across much of inland California as a heat wave gripping the area intensifies. August and September are typically the most dangerous months for wildfires in the state.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House said Thursday night that there will be increased presence of federal law enforcement in the nation's capital to combat crime for at least the next week, amid President Donald Trump ‘s suggestions that his administration could fully take over running the city. 

“Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens.”

She added that the increased federal presence means “there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C.” 

Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining — but could face steep pushback.

“We have a capital that's very unsafe,” Trump told reporters at the White House this week. “We have to run D.C.”

The White House said the increased law enforcement would “make D.C. safe again” and would be present on the streets starting at midnight — led by U.S. Park Police following an 11 p.m. Thursday roll call at an established command center. 

The push will last the next seven days with the option to extend “as needed,” under the authority of Trump's previous executive order establishing the Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force. The added federal officials will be identified, in marked units and highly visible, the White House said. 




Participating law enforcement include personnel from the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Enforcement and Removal Operations, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. 

The police forces for Amtrak and the city's Metro rail service are also involved. 

However a two-hour tour of the D.C. streets, starting around 1 a.m. Friday morning, revealed no evidence of the sort of multi-agency flood of uniformed personnel described in Trump's announcement. There was a robust, but not unusual, Metropolitan Police Department presence in late-night hot spots like 14th Street and along Florida Avenue. But there was no overt or visible law enforcement presence other than the MPD. 

Trump has long suggested crime and violence is on the rise in Washington, and has lately begun to criticize things like litter and graffiti. But the catalyst for the order to increase police presence was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. 

The victim, Edward Coristine, nicknamed “Big Balls,” was among the most visible figures of DOGE, which was tasked with cutting jobs and slashing the federal bureaucracy. Police arrested two 15-year-olds and say they're still looking for other members of the group.

“If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they're not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump posted on Truth Social earlier this week. 

The president subsequently said he was considering repealing Washington's limited Home Rule autonomy or “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” 

Thursday's announcement comes as Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser's government can claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings — both of which spiked citywide in 2023. 

Carjackings in Washington overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and the number is on track to decline again this year — with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through 2025.

CHICAGO (AP) — A sex toy was thrown onto the court in the closing seconds of the Atlanta Dream's 86-65 victory over the Chicago Sky on Thursday night, the latest such incident at a WNBA game.

Sex toys also were thrown on court during games in Atlanta on July 29, Chicago on Friday and Los Angeles on Tuesday. Police said a second toy was thrown at the game in Atlanta, but it's unclear if that one reached the court.

A man was arrested Saturday in College Park, Georgia, after he was accused of throwing a sex toy onto the court during the Dream's July 29 game with the Golden State Valkyries, according to a police report. The report said he threw another sex toy during the Dream's game on Friday against the Phoenix Mercury.

He was charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespassing, public indecency and indecent exposure. 

Another man in Phoenix was arrested after police say he threw a sex toy in the crowd at a Mercury game on Tuesday. Police say the 18-year-old pulled the sex toy from his sweater pocket and threw it toward seats in front of him, striking a spectator in the back.

Police say the man was arrested on suspicion of assault, disorderly conduct and publicly displaying explicit sexual material.

The WNBA said any spectators throwing objects onto the court will face at least a one-year ban and prosecution from law enforcement.

‘Alligator Alcatraz' challenged in federal court hearing

MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday ordered a two-week halt to construction at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws.

The facility was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport and can hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. The site was continuing to be built out, but the order by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams temporarily bars the installation of any new industrial-style lighting, as well as any paving, filling, excavating or fencing. The order also prohibits any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories or other residential or administrative facilities.

The order doesn't include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity at the center, which is currently holding hundreds of detainees. Williams issued the temporary restraining order during a hearing and then followed up with a written order later Thursday. 

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe have asked Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit argues that the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars' worth of environmental restoration.

“We're pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director at Friends of the Everglades.

A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis decried the ruling but said it “will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida.”

“Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” spokesperson Alex Lanfranconi said in a statement.

Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday in support of the injunction, while attorneys for the state and federal government were scheduled to present next week.

Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued.

Williams asked Florida attorney Jesse Panuccio if the state would agree to halt construction so that she wouldn't need to issue the restraining order. She pointed out that anything built at the site would likely remain there permanently, regardless of how the case was ultimately decided.

Panuccio said he couldn't guarantee that the state would stop all work.

This sparked an hour-long hearing about the temporary restraining order, which will be in place for the next two weeks while the ongoing preliminary injunction hearing continues. Temporary restraining orders are meant to maintain the status quo during a legal dispute for a short period of time, while preliminary injunctions are generally issued after a longer hearing and last until the final resolution of the case. 

The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects.

Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply.

Schwiep said the purpose of the facility is for immigration enforcement, which is exclusively a federal function. He said the facility wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the federal government's desire for a facility to hold detainees.

Williams said Thursday that the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.

Christopher McVoy, a soil physicist, hydrologist and wetlands ecologist, testified for the plaintiffs on Thursday that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Department of Emergency Management began construction, based on a tour that he took of the facility in June, just days before it opened, and subsequent arial photos of the site. Tents, trailers and other heavy equipment have also been moved to the airport, which previously had just a few small structures.

Dillon Reio, a licensed professional geologist, testified that the new paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands and spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades.

The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center, which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.

A second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees' constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 18.

In a court filing in the civil rights lawsuit on Thursday, the state of Florida said that detainees have been allowed to meet with their lawyers for three weeks at the detention center, which opened July 3, despite some initial delays due to logistical challenges in having private contractors build infrastructure and install equipment. Since July 15, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, it said.

“More meetings are taking place every day and there have been no complaints,” according to the filing.

Construction, maintenance and operation of the detention center are done by the state of Florida, “without involvement of the federal government,” though the state is granted authority over the detainees through an intergovernmental agreement with federal agencies, the court filing said.

Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.

It makes no difference that the detention center was built by the state of Florida, since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the lawsuit said.

Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Williams had yet to rule on that argument.

The lawsuits were being heard as DeSantis′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what's labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.”

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the Justice Department filing an official misconduct complaint against federal judge James Boasberg on 'America's Newsroom.'

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 Friday that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg cannot move forward with possible contempt proceedings against the Trump administration.

The case involves the administration's alleged violation of an emergency court order blocking the administration from using a 1798 law to summarily deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador — the latest in an evolving, high-stakes court clash that has played out for months in various courts. 

Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, two Trump appointees on the majority-Democrat bench, sided with the Trump administration Friday in blocking Boasberg's contempt motion from moving forward. 

Judge Nina Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented. 

The 2-1 ruling is all but certain to be appealed to the full court to be heard en banc, where the Democrat-majority bench is seen as more favorable to the plaintiffs, or directly to the Supreme Court for review.

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

""The district court here was placed in an enormously difficult position,"" Katsas said Friday, writing for the majority.

""Faced with an emergency situation, it had to digest and rule upon novel and complex issues within a matter of hours. In that context, the court quite understandably issued a written order that contained some ambiguity.""

Katsas noted that the appellate court ruling does not center on the lawfulness of Trump's Alien Enemies Act removals in March, when administration officials invoked the 1798 immigration law to send more than 250 Venezuelan nationals to CECOT, the maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

""Nor may we decide whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter,"" he added. ""Perhaps it should warrant more careful judicial scrutiny in the future. Perhaps it already has.""

""Regardless, the government's initial implementation of the proclamation clearly and indisputably was not criminal.""

The ruling comes months after Boasberg originally found grounds to move on potential contempt proceedings in the case.

It comes as Boasberg has also ordered ongoing status updates on the location and custodial status of the 252 CECOT class migrants, after they were deported last month from El Salvador to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Venezuela.

It is unclear how many of those migrants had pending asylum applications in the U.S. or had been granted a ""withholding of removal"" order blocking their return to their country of origin. 

100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST ​​TESTS IN COURT

The long-awaited ruling comes months after Boasberg ruled that the court had found probable cause to move on criminal contempt proceedings after he issued a late-night temporary restraining order on March 15 blocking the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport certain migrants to El Salvador.

Boasberg had also ordered all migrants to be ""immediately returned"" to U.S. soil, which did not happen. 

Despite the order, hundreds of migrants were deported to the Salvadorian prison, CECOT, in March, where they remained until late last month, when they were sent from the prison in El Salvador to Venezuela, as part of the prisoner exchange. 

Boasbeg ruled in April that there was ""probable cause"" to move on criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for failing to return the planes to U.S. soil and said the court had determined that the Trump administration demonstrated a ""willful disregard"" for his order.The appeals court granted the Trump administration's request for an emergency stay of the ruling months earlier, prompting questions as to why they did not move more quickly on the motion.

Still, the decision is almost certain to be appealed either to the full circuit court to be heard en banc, or directly to the Supreme Court for review. 

The Trump administration for months has sparred with judges who have blocked the president's executive orders from taking force.

Boasberg, in particular, has emerged as one of Trump's biggest public foes. Last month, the court attempted to have him removed from overseeing the case and have it reassigned to another case — a long-shot effort that legal experts and former judges suggested is unlikely to go far.

Heritage Foundation research fellow E.J. Antoni joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the importance of investment as President Donald Trump's tariffs take effect. 

President Donald Trump is preparing to announce new secondary tariffs Friday on nations who conduct trade with Russia amid its deadly war in Ukraine. 

The White House has remained tight-lipped on what those tariffs will look like after the president first said in July they would amount to ""100%"" tariffs before causing confusion earlier this week when he told reporters he ""never said a percentage.""

While the specifics of what tax rates nations that trade with Russia could face remain unclear, Trump's change in posture toward Russian President Vladimir Putin has become increasingly evident.

FROM TALK TO TACTICS: TRUMP PIVOTS ON RUSSIA STRATEGY TO END WAR

""Trump's frustrated that the Russians have not taken advantage of his patience and generous offers, but it's very interesting that even after Trump announced he was moving submarines, and even after he announced the tough tariffs, the Russians still want to talk to him,"" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president's first term, told Fox News Digital.

""Putin does not want to anger Trump,"" he added. ""Putin never worried about angering Biden, and I think that this shows a degree of respect. 

""It shows what Trump has achieved by exercising leadership on the global stage. And we'll see what happens,"" Fleitz said, adding he hoped it was not merely a stalling tactic by Putin.

Trump's return to the White House brought with it a sense of shock as he appeared to distance Washington from its top allies in Europe in favor of attempting to improve diplomatic relations with Putin, culminating in the infamous Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. 

While the tussle brought renewed support from his top MAGA base, who favor ending U.S. involvement in foreign wars, it prompted concern among security experts. Ultimately, Trump's patience with Putin began to shift, with the president consistently expressing his frustration at the Kremlin chief's continued brutal attacks in Ukraine. 

In mid-July, while sitting next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump announced Putin had 50 days to enter into a ceasefire or face ""very severe"" tariffs that would affect Moscow's top commodity, oil.

ZELENSKYY TELLS PUTIN TO 'BE BRAVE' AND FINALLY AGREE TO TRILATERAL MEETING WITH TRUMP

""Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs,"" he had said, indicating that nations that trade with Russia will see 100% tariffs slapped on them when trading with the U.S. 

This would most greatly affect China and India, according to data released by the U.S. government Thursday, which showed both nations account for 46% of all Russian oil purchases in 2025.

But the U.S. is also the No. 1 export market for both China and India, which means higher price tags at the checkout line on their products will make Americans think twice before completing those purchases. 

After ongoing trade negotiations with both nations and Putin's continued war effort in Ukraine, Trump last week pushed up his deadline to within 10 days of July 29, forcing a new deadline of Friday.

But while his promised tariffs were met with applause by some in the GOP, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. — he, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-C.T., is pushing the charge for 500% sanctions on Russia — other Republican members have not backed the move. 

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been outspoken against not only Trump's tariffs but the bipartisan sanction push and argued to Fox Business' Larry Kudlow this week that Trump's tariffs on allies and foes alike will amount to $2 trillion in taxes for the American consumer.

But Fleitz pushed back on this argument and said he is not convinced that the tariffs will hurt the U.S. or Chinese economy, though Russia and India are likely to feel the pain. 

""I think they're going to hurt the Russian and Indian economies,"" he said, noting that India could recover by buying oil elsewhere. Though some reporting has suggested that India may have saved over $30 billion by increasingly turning to Russian oil during 2022-2024 due to Moscow's price cuts.

TRUMP OPEN TO MEET PUTIN FACE-TO-FACE NEXT WEEK FOLLOWED BY THREE-WAY TALKS WITH UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY

""It is going to be another factor that's going to pressure Putin to agree to a ceasefire. I don't know if that's going to happen immediately or in a few months, but I think it is going to put real pressure, inflict real pain on Russia,"" Fleitz said. 

Once a staunch Trump ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R- Ga., took to X this week in response to a post by Trump that he would be enforcing tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil and said, ""End Indian H1-B visas replacing American jobs instead and stop funding and sending weapons to the Obama/Biden/Neocon Ukraine Russia war.""

Trump's favorable transition toward Ukraine and European allies has also ruffled some MAGA feathers, though security experts have argued it has given the president better leverage to take on major adversaries like Putin, and by extension, China.

""Diplomacy and negotiations are a good thing,"" said Fleitz, who serves as vice chair of the America First Policy Institute's Center for American Security. ""Peacemaking takes time, and the U.S.-Russia relationship was in a very bad situation when Trump came to office.

""I think these sanctions will hurt Russia very badly,"" Fleitz continued. ""The fact that Trump knows that secondary sanctions on India has, at least temporarily, hurt our relationship is really a remarkable sign of how committed Trump is to these sanctions.

""There's not going to be exceptions. It's not going to be some type of soft strategy with all kinds of loopholes,"" he added. ""I think it shows to Putin how serious Trump is, and it gives Trump leverage to negotiate with Putin.""

DNC chair Ken Martin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Texas' redistricting effort as Gov. Abbott feuds with Democrats over the effort and his reaction to Sen. Warren embracing Zohran Mamdani.  

Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan hinted at a possible run for higher office as a Democrat after announcing he was leaving the Republican Party.

Duncan, who served as lieutenant governor as a Republican from 2019 until 2023, said he is considering running for higher office after revealing his switch to the Democratic Party earlier this week, with a decision about his political future potentially coming in the next few weeks or months, according to WSB-TV.

""I think Georgians want people who can speak truth to power in the middle,"" he told the outlet.

He did not specify which higher office he might seek, but it has been speculated that he may launch a campaign for governor to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who Duncan served with during his time as lieutenant governor.

Notable names already in the race for governor for the 2026 election include Keisha Lance Bottoms, a former mayor of Atlanta who later worked in the Biden administration, and – on the Republican side – current Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr.

In an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published Tuesday, Duncan wrote that his path to becoming a Democrat had been years in the making, starting before President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

""My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,"" Duncan wrote in the newspaper.

""There's no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has,"" he continued. ""My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.""

Trump responded to Duncan's party switch by saying the former lieutenant governor is a ""total loser"" who is no longer wanted in the Republican Party.

""Failed former Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser,"" Trump wrote Friday on Truth Social. ""Was never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn't want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I'm told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff. You don't even have a chance!!!""

Duncan pointed to several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, criticizing Republicans for their handling of issues such as health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and how to help poor people.

He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to ""love my neighbor"" is through public policy. Before his time as lieutenant governor, he served in the Georgia House from 2013 until 2017. He opted not to run for re-election as lieutenant governor in 2022.

Duncan's decision to leave the GOP comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the party earlier this year over alleged disloyalty. The party's resolution cited his endorsement of Biden in the 2024 presidential election and, once he dropped out, his endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as alleged efforts to undermine and sabotage some Republican candidates, including Jones and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker.

The former Republican also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Harris.

""Geoff Duncan has finally said out loud what any person with eyes has known for years: he is a Democrat,"" Georgia Republican Party chairman Josh McKoon told WSB-TV.

Duncan has been a vocal critic of Trump and the Republican Party in recent years, particularly since the president's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

""There isn't like one line in the sand or one moment in time. It was a series of parallel processes. One, watching the heart and soul of the Republican Party just get sucked out of it by Donald Trump and those that follow him closely,"" Duncan told WSB-TV.

Duncan wrote in the op-ed that the Trump-backed spending bill that was signed into law last month will leave Medicaid funding ""in shambles,"" as it cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from the government program. He also criticized the measure for its cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, and its impact on ensuring children do not go hungry at school.

He also pointed to polls showing support for gun control measures such as universal background checks and red-flag laws.

The ex-Republican also criticized the Trump administration's mass deportation immigration policies that he said ""have turned into a lesson on how not to love your neighbor."" He said that immigration policy should focus on securing the border, deporting those in the country illegally who have committed felonies, but that a path to citizenship should be created for other migrants in the U.S.

Fox News national correspondent William La Jeunesse has the latest on the rebuilding process in California on 'Special Report.'

A brush fire was quickly moving across parts of Southern California on Thursday, spurring evacuations of the area as fire officials worked to put out the blaze.

The Canyon Fire broke out on Thursday afternoon east of Lake Piru in Ventura County, earlier estimated at about 50 acres, before spreading to more than 1,000, according to fire officials.

The fire began burning north of Highway 126 east of Los Angeles County before it later spread into the county, officials said.

Evacuations were ordered for the Lake Piru Recreation Area and parts of the surrounding area. An evacuation warning was issued for ranches in the west end of Holser Canyon, NBC 4 reported.

Parts of Los Angeles County also had evacuation orders and evacuation warnings.

""The Canyon Fire is currently burning between Los Angeles County and Ventura County in the Piru Lake area. Several zones are under evacuation order and warning,"" the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.

Water-dropping aircraft responded to the blaze, as firefighters were using Lake Piru, a reservoir in Los Padres National Forest northwest of Los Angeles, to refill firefighting aircraft, NBC 4 reported.

The Canyon Fire was one of at least four burning in Southern California on Thursday.

It was not clear what caused the fires in the Golden State.

This comes after multiple wildfires swept across Southern California at the beginning of the year, burning more than 50,000 acres and destroying more than 18,000 homes and structures. At least 30 people were killed and roughly 200,000 were forced to evacuate.

The new Federal Reserve chair, to be selected by President Donald Trump, could significantly influence monetary policy by changing the tone at the central bank, even if they lack the power to revamp operations single-handedly.

Trump has fumed publicly and privately about the central bank's course of monetary policy under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whose term is up in May 2026. That means Trump will have the opportunity to nominate a new Fed chair, who will have to be confirmed by the Senate.

However, the new Fed chair's ability to steer policy toward easier money, as Trump desires, will be limited to changing the discussion at the Fed and making the case public, thanks to the design of the central bank.

Congress designed the Fed to decentralize decision-making. Some of that power is given to the Fed's board of governors, and some to the presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks, who are unelected officials.

The Fed chair also cannot change monetary policy whenever or without consensus. Instead, that is up to a 12-person board called the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the Fed Board of Governors and a rotation of regional Fed presidents. The FOMC decides collectively what the course of interest rate policy should be. But the Fed chair can help set the tone and messaging of the central bank.

“I think first of all, just the language that that nominee uses can provide some measure of forward guidance with respect to where they see the potential path of interest rates going,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told the Washington Examiner.

Given Trump's push for lower rates, it is expected that the new chair will guide the Fed's tone and messaging toward a more dovish monetary policy, but whether the FOMC participants go along with that is an open question.

Powell has been quite cautious in the messaging of monetary policy, largely taking a wait-and-see stance with interest rates and emphasizing the avoidance of another wave of inflation that could be brought on by softening policy too soon.

And while Powell's term is up in May 2026, the tone shift would likely begin earlier. Hamrick pointed out that Trump has indicated that he wants to announce his choice sooner rather than later. Trump could even announce the nominee very early, hoping to undermine Powell's influence.

Dennis Lockhart, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told the Washington Examiner that one thing the new chair could do to sway monetary policy is change how meetings are conducted.

“For example, a chair could declare up front the direction he or she wants to go, rather than letting the discussion reveal a committee consensus,” he said over email. “This might inject a dynamic of voters seeking to avoid open defiance of the chair.”

“Manhandling the committee process would be a significant departure from Fed decision-making protocol,” Lockhart added.

The Fed typically conducts monetary policy through the FOMC's set meetings, which occur every month or every other month. This year, there are eight meetings for the board will decide what to do with interest rates.

Trump and some in his administration have been calling for immediate interest rate cuts, which cannot be done without an emergency meeting.

Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, pointed out that the new chair would be able to call such emergency meetings.

“And I wonder, you know, one test of how much would the new chair be their own person would be if they call an emergency meeting or not or if they wait” for the next scheduled meeting, Young told the Washington Examiner.

Aside from monetary policy, the Fed chair might also try to immediately change the central bank by making staffing changes or canceling research that might be controversial. Much of that, though, would still have to go through the regional Fed banks and their presidents rather than through whoever Trump picks to lead the Fed.

“Most of these things are determined by the individual Fed branches, the regional banks, and they have a lot of leeway in deciding research policy and things like that, that the chair doesn't really have direct control over,” Jai Kedia, an economist at the Cato Institute, told the Washington Examiner.

Still, Kedia said, that does not negate the fact that the Fed conducts a lot of excess research that is not tightly focused on its purview of monetary policy.

“And it would be great if we could trim all of that, but that's a conversation aside from who's going to be elected Fed chair,” he said.

Young said that, at least for the Fed Board of Governors in Washington, the new Fed chair will have some discretion regarding staffing. But he expressed concerns about politics factoring into those decisions.

HOW A FORMER FED STAFFER GOT THE FED'S RENOVATION COST OVERRUNS ON TRUMP'S RADAR

“But given the administration, the way it treats messengers of bad news, I can't help but think that if a new Fed chair comes in who is pliable to the president's wishes, that any cuts they make would be politically motivated rather than merit motivated,” Young said.

Recently, the overwhelming majority of the FOMC has opted to hold interest rates steady, although two Fed governors dissented at the Fed's July meeting.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

National missile defense is still impossible—and expensive.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Donald Trump wants to spend billions of dollars on a successor to President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, and he's calling it “Golden Dome,” inspired by both Israel's Iron Dome defense and Reagan's early-1980s concept of a “peace shield” over North America. It's a hugely ambitious project, but Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth apparently would prefer that no one talk about it.  This week, military and civilian experts are in Huntsville, Alabama, for the 2025 Space and Missile Defense Symposium, a gathering of more than 7,000 top experts, military officers, and defense-industry representatives from around the world. One might think that such a jamboree is the obvious place to cheerlead for a new American missile-defense plan. But one would be wrong: The Pentagon has barred anyone from speaking about Golden Dome in public. Instead, according to Politico, representatives of the Missile Defense Agency joined a closed meeting that was not part of, or sponsored by, the symposium.

This shyness about discussing Golden Dome is probably part of Hegeseth's clampdown on Pentagon officials going to meetings at think tanks and attending other public symposia. Still, the choice to go silent at this meeting is strange: Golden Dome is projected to cost gobs of money, and SMDS is exactly the kind of place where the government can tell its story and get science, industry, and the military on the same page.

Read: When Pete Hegseth's Pentagon tenure started going sideways

The official Pentagon announcement about why the Defense Department backed out of public meetings doesn't offer any clues, and doesn't even make much sense:

Golden Dome for America remains a strategic imperative for the Department of Defense. As we continue gathering information from industry, academia, national labs, and other government agencies for support to Golden Dome for America, it would be imprudent for the Department to release further information on this program during these early stages, keeping operational security of this endeavor top of mind.

Operational security? The Pentagon could in theory argue that the meeting with the Missile Defense Agency folks was held privately to thwart Russian and Chinese spies who might be lurking about the exhibition tables, but the project doesn't even exist yet, and the closed session is only out of the public eye, not classified.

A more likely explanation is that no one is supposed to talk about Golden Dome because no one knows what it is yet. (A Lockheed Martin vice president said: “Golden Dome is the defense of our nation against all aerial and missile threats,” an unhelpful formulation that probably only means Whatever it is, it will be big and spread among multiple contractors.) If all anyone knows about Golden Dome is that it will be an expensive, all-azimuth defense against everything that flies, then the Pentagon's reluctance to discuss it is understandable.

It's also already a flawed concept: If Trump is indeed basing Golden Dome on Iron Dome, then he doesn't understand the Israeli system. Iron Dome is a regional defense aimed at relatively slow-moving rockets—and not comparable to a national missile defense over the entire United States meant to stop warheads incoming at 20 times the speed of sound. The difference between the two, according to the nuclear-weapons analyst Jeffrey Lewis, is “the difference between a kayak and a battleship.” Or as the arms-control expert Joe Cirincione put it some years ago, trying to translate the success of Iron Dome's short-range interceptions into an argument for national missile defenses is ‘‘like being good at miniature golf and thinking you can win the Masters.''

Reagan's SDI—or “Star Wars,” as its critics dubbed it—served its purpose at a particular time in history. I say this with a certain amount of affection for SDI, not least because one of my first jobs in Washington was working on the program. In the mid-1980s, I was hired by a defense contractor to be part of a “Red Team” of Soviet experts; we were supposed to game out how the Kremlin would react to the American development of space-based missile defenses.

The goal of SDI in those days was not to seal North America under an impenetrable missile shield. To be sure, Reagan pitched the program that way; his intention, he said in a 1983 television address, was to make nuclear missiles “impotent and obsolete.” But the instructions to our team a few years later made a lot more sense: How, we were asked, can the United States get the Soviet Union to move to a more stable world where defense, rather than instant nuclear attack, would dominate strategic thinking?

This might seem an odd question for readers who are not schooled in the arcana of nuclear strategy. But the basic problem is that long-range nuclear missiles are inherently offensive weapons. They are use-them-or-lose-them systems: They can't hold territory, they can't defend anything, and they are vulnerable to an enemy's first strike. Their only purpose, should war come, is to travel far away, very fast, and destroy the most important enemy targets. In rough order of priority, these would include the enemy's nuclear forces, command-and-control installations, and other military assets; then war-supporting industries, such as steel and energy; and then, if all else is lost, the enemy's cities and the millions of people in them.

The inherent incentive to strike first was—and remains—dangerous and destabilizing, and SDI was supposed to add an element of uncertainty to the Soviet Union's first-strike calculations. If their planning was disrupted by the wild card of space-based defenses against nuclear missiles, perhaps the Soviets would hesitate to go first, thus buying time for both sides.

When the Cold War ended, no one was quite sure what to do with the idea of national missile defense. President George H. W. Bush's administration tried to repurpose SDI as “GPALS,” or “Global Protection Against Limited Strikes,” a kind of scaled-down defense against future troublemakers. Bill Clinton's secretary of defense Les Aspin renamed and reorganized the program, and stripped out the space-based elements. Current missile-defense efforts are focused on shooting down small numbers of missiles rather than defending the entire nation from a full-on attack.

So far, shooting down one missile, to say nothing of more, is still an immensely risky proposition. Under controlled, best-case conditions, the Pentagon's chances of successfully intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles run at roughly 50 to 60 percent—a coin toss at best. (Regional defenses against shorter-range launches have a slightly better test record.)

Reagan planted the idea of a North American continental missile defense firmly in the American imagination. But Reagan's people and those who came after them knew that peace shields and domes are impossible. Cities are always going to be vulnerable because of their size and exposure, especially in the United States, whose capital, along with its two largest cities, are all close to the coastline and vulnerable to the kind of close-in, submarine-launched attacks that missile defenses would be unlikely to catch in time.

Tom Nichols: The Pentagon against the think tanks

The value and strategic wisdom of trying to develop a national missile shield are as debatable now as they were when the efforts to create the first missile-defense systems began in the 1960s. The enemy, as the saying goes, gets a vote, and the Russians and Chinese could not only interpret a new push for national defense as provocative but choose the simple countermeasure of building more weapons to overwhelm that system. (Even the North Koreans could build enough weapons and decoys to overwhelm limited defense.) And during a crisis, American presidents—even the most cold-blooded of them—might not risk relying on a missile-defense system anyway. If the enemy seems about to attack, any commander in chief will be tempted to launch a preemptive strike (especially against a smaller nuclear power) rather than gamble on unproven defenses and take a 50–50 chance that the missiles won't get through

“Golden Dome” probably sounded good to the president, and now no one is going to talk him out of it—especially given that the administration is willing to throw mountains of money at such a program, just as Reagan did. Hegseth can order his people not to talk about it at public gatherings, but at some point, the administration should answer the two most important questions about an expensive system that could destabilize nuclear deterrence: What is Golden Dome supposed to do, and does it have any chance of working?","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Eventually, they'll have to go home.

Texas state Democrats had been plotting their departure for weeks. But most weren't sure they were going—or where they were headed—until just before they boarded their plane. For a successful quorum break, the timing “has to be ripe,” State Representative Gina Hinojosa told me. “Like a melon at the grocery store.” On Sunday, she and dozens of her colleagues hopped on a chartered plane and flew to Chicago in an attempt to prevent Texas Republicans from redrawing the state's congressional maps. They don't seem to know how long they'll be there or when, exactly, they'll consider the job done. Perhaps, Hinojosa suggested, they can attract enough attention to the issue that Republicans will be shamed into abandoning the effort.

Shame, however, is not an emotion experienced by many politicians these days, least of all ones who answer to Donald Trump. The likeliest conclusion of this effort is that Republicans will get their wish, just as they did after a similar situation in 2021.

Right now, the Texas Democrats' quorum-break project appears to have two goals, one much more easily accomplished than the other. The first is to send a message; the gerrymandering attempt in Texas is a chance for Democrats nationwide to accuse Republicans of cheating, and to demonstrate a bit of the gumption their voters have been clamoring for. Because the party is effectively leaderless, now is a perfect moment for wannabe standard-bearers to soak up some of the limelight. Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, for example, has made a lot of speeches and trolled Republicans; so has New York Governor Kathy Hochul. And tonight, California Governor Gavin Newsom will host Hinojosa and other Texas Democrats in Sacramento for a press conference.

The second, more practical objective is to run down the clock. If Texas Democrats can stay out of state long enough, they could make it difficult for Republicans to implement the new district maps ahead of the first 2026 election deadlines. This goal is optimistic, experts I interviewed said. Living in a hotel for weeks is expensive, and resources will eventually dry up. Pressure is mounting from Republican leaders. “And there's a stamina factor at play that can't be avoided,” Brandon Rottinghaus, a political-science professor at the University of Houston, told me. It seems, he added, “inevitable that the new maps pass.”

Read: How Democrats tied their own hands on redistricting

State Democrats have only been on the run for five days in the Chicago area (as well as in New York and Massachusetts). The public is still interested, and Democrats have plenty of opportunities to shape the media narrative. “Democratic voters are paying attention,” Joshua Blank, the research director of the nonpartisan Texas Politics Project, told me. “Having something to rally around is very, very useful for them.” Republicans have not tried to deny that they're making a blatant power grab, though they argue that they're simply following the lead of Democrats in heavily gerrymandered states such as Illinois. “It's just unilateral disarmament if you don't match what Democrats have done on the other side,” Matt Mackowiak, a Texas Republican strategist who is working on Senator John Cornyn's reelection campaign, told me. (The difference is that in Texas, they're redrawing the maps five years early, rather than waiting for the census.)

But quorum breaks are, by nature, temporary. Eventually, the wayward lawmakers will go home. What matters is when. The candidate-filing deadline for the 2026 election is December 8, and the primary is in March, so theoretically, if lawmakers can stay out of state for multiple months, Republicans might run into legal problems getting their new map in place.

One problem with the run-down-the-clock strategy is that, in the past, Texas courts have simply postponed the state's primary while congressional maps were being litigated. (That delay likely contributed to Ted Cruz's 2012 Senate victory.) Another challenge is keeping up the political will; as time drags on, Texas voters will want their representatives to come home and do their job. Then, there are the logistical issues. A long quorum break means that Texas Democrats spend weeks or months living in a hotel, away from their families and racking up bills. Many of those state lawmakers have jobs outside politics—jobs that might not be well suited to working remotely from a hotel conference room. A few members brought small children with them to Chicago, Hinojosa told me, and some of those children will probably have to be back in school soon. “We've seen it before,” Rottinghaus said. “The biggest pull for members to come back isn't always the politics; it's most often the personal.”

Read: A Democrat for the Trump era

When I asked Texas Representative Ana-María Rodríguez Ramos how long she was willing to stay in Chicago, she told me that she understands the burden this puts on families; her own daughter is recovering from a liver transplant. “Am I prepared for two weeks? Three weeks? What is the alternative?” she asked. “If this is a sacrifice that we need to make, then it's the sacrifice that has to be made.” But two or three weeks probably won't be enough. (It's possible, Rodríguez Ramos suggested, that the state's 11 Senate Democrats, who remain in-state, could take their own turn breaking quorum; only one chamber needs to do so to stop legislation from being passed.)

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's threats complicate the picture. This morning, he suggested that if Democrats “don't start showing up,” Republicans will add a few more GOP seats to the new map. He has promised to fine the runaway Democrats $500 each for every day that they're gone, and to go after any groups raising money for them. Abbott has also suggested that he'll kick the Democrats out of their seats in the legislature—although experts say he does not have the power to do so directly. Earlier this week, the state house issued civil-arrest warrants for the rogue Democrats, and yesterday, Cornyn announced that the FBI had agreed to “locate” them. Although FBI involvement might seem far-fetched, “there's very little that restricts” the agency, Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former FBI agent, told me. The bureau could share information with local law enforcement, he said.

A single one of these variables is not likely to shatter the Texas Democrats' resolve, but over time, the pressure adds up. After making headlines for a few weeks, Democrats will probably be squeezed dry, emotionally and financially. A few will return home, and then, eventually, they all will. The new GOP district map will pass, perhaps in a slightly altered form, and Republicans will have what they've been fighting for: a few more GOP congressional districts, perhaps just enough to preserve the party's narrow hold on the House of Representatives through what might be a tough midterm election.

But Texas Democrats aren't willing to entertain that possibility just yet. In Chicago, members are reassessing the situation each day, Hinojosa told me. To sum up the general attitude, she paraphrased former Texas Governor Ann Richards. “All we have is the here and now,” she said, “and if we play it right, it's all we need.” A more realistic view of the situation might be that Democrats are seizing the moment because they know it's fleeting.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

On climate, the U.S. and the rest of the planet are now in “completely separate worlds.”

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Last month, the world's highest court issued a long-awaited opinion on how international law should regard climate harm. The International Court of Justice concluded, unanimously, that states have binding legal obligations to act to protect the climate system, and failure to do so—by continuing to produce, consume, and subsidize fossil fuels—may “constitute an internationally wrongful act.” In other words, curbing greenhouse-gas emissions is not merely voluntary in the eyes of the court; failure to do so is illegal.



A week later, the U.S. government proffered an entirely opposite picture of legal responsibility. It announced a plan to rescind one of the most important legal underpinnings of the federal effort to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, from 2009, says quite simply that these emissions endanger the public and qualify as harmful pollution; they can therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act. This finding is the legal basis for power-plant rules, tailpipe-emissions regulations, and almost every other action the executive branch has taken to curb the release of carbon dioxide and methane. And the U.S. EPA would now like to throw it out.

The United States and the rest of the planet are now in “completely separate worlds” in terms of legal understanding of climate responsibility, the human-rights attorney Lotte Leicht, who works as the advocacy director of the nonprofit Climate Rights International, told me. “I think almost nothing could have painted a starker picture,” Nikki Reisch, an attorney and the Climate and Energy Program director at the Center for International Environmental Law, agrees.

The ICJ opinion was the first time the world court has expressly addressed climate obligations under international law, and it did so with unusual clarity. It removed what Leicht described to me as a legal fog that the world has existed in for decades by rebuking two of the main arguments that high-emitting countries and companies have made to avoid liability. The first is that the climate crisis is simply too big and complex to attribute to any particular entity, rendering individual accountability impractical and unfair. “The court made clear that that is not an excuse that holds up anymore,” Leicht said. Thanks in part to attribution science, a particular country or company's contribution to the climate crisis can be assessed, and the fact that many entities are at fault is not an excuse to evade individual liability.



The second argument—that only special climate accords, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, could dictate their climate obligations, and that even then those pacts were by and large voluntary—was also struck down. In its opinion, the court wrote that climate action is not, in fact, voluntary at all: Instead, because climate change threatens lives, degrades health, and deprives people of their home, both domestically and across borders, climate agreements are legally binding, and states can be sued for failure to uphold them.



In fact, according to the court, even if a state is not party to a climate treaty, or if a treaty agreement is too weak to prevent the climate harm that country is enacting, that state is still legally liable, thanks to customary law—well-established fundamental legal principles that all countries must comply with, such as the general duty to protect basic human rights.



An advisory opinion such as this one is not in itself legally binding. But the international laws it is meant to interpret are. In some countries, including the Netherlands and Kenya, international law is incorporated into domestic law at the point of ratification. In others, it can take precedence over domestic law; elsewhere, it may become domestic law through an act of legislature. Reisch told me that she expects this opinion to be used to support climate lawsuits against countries and companies going forward, and to justify new legislation in statehouses and local governments. Leicht, who is also the chair of the Council of the European Center for Constitutional Human Rights, told me the opinion would figure in one of her own cases: She is representing four residents of Pari, a tiny Indonesian island, who are suing Holcim, a major Swiss cement company, arguing that its outsize share of greenhouse gases is contributing to Pari's disappearance.



The U.S., famously, does not make much of international laws. In prior international climate negotiations, America has tried to minimize its responsibility as the largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gases. Margaret Taylor, the U.S. legal adviser to the State Department under Joe Biden, presented commentary at the ICJ in December in which she argued that current human-rights laws do not provide for a right to a healthy environment, nor should countries be financially responsible for past emissions, both of which the ICJ ultimately disagreed with in this new opinion. The State Department has said it's reviewing the opinion; whether or not the country acts on it, it does open the U.S. to new climate lawsuits and will strengthen those already under way, including two separate suits brought by youth in Montana and California, arguing that the Trump administration's actions on the environment threaten their rights. (The State Department did not reply to a request for comment.)



The Trump administration, meanwhile, seems ready to simply ignore, if not outright reject, any responsibility the U.S. might have for climate change. Its intent to roll back the endangerment finding is at odds with recent domestic legal opinion. After the EPA announced its intentions, various legal experts spoke, almost in chorus, about the slim chance this plan had of making it through the likely court challenges. Jonathan Adler, a conservative legal scholar and professor at William and Mary Law School, said in a column that he agreed with it on policy grounds but called the move legally “foolish”—the Bush administration tried a similar strategy in 2007, only to have the Supreme Court affirm that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants. The EPA, in an emailed response to questions, acknowledged the 2007 decision, but noted that it “did not require EPA to make an endangerment finding and did not review the logic or conclusions of the 2009 Endangerment Finding because it hadn't been issued yet.” It also added, hopefully, that there have been two more recent decisions in which the Supreme Court pulled back aspects of the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases.



By attempting to abdicate any legal responsibility to provide for a healthy environment, the U.S. is running in the opposite direction as the global legal community. Last month, prior to the release of the ICJ opinion, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights also declared that the climate crisis qualifies as a human-rights violation, triggering rights-based obligations for countries and companies in that region. And last year, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea issued an advisory opinion qualifying greenhouse gases as marine pollution, triggering similar legal obligations for countries to mitigate them. This trend, Leicht reminded me, will likely outlive the current American political moment.



I found myself struck by the clarity of the final paragraph in the ICJ's opinion, which reminds lawyers that climate change is bigger even than the law. “A complete solution to this daunting, and self-inflicted, problem requires the contribution of all fields of human knowledge, whether law, science, economics or any other,” the court wrote. “Above all, a lasting and satisfactory solution requires human will and wisdom—at the individual, social and political levels—to change our habits, comforts and current way of life in order to secure a future for ourselves and those who are yet to come.”



Indeed, rights apply not just to the people who exist now, but to future generations. As the U.S.'s climate liability comes into sharper focus, so does the fact of its growing burden on that group. The question is how long the country will disavow that charge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","So, About Those Big Trade Deals","https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/08/trump-trade-deals/683796/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

If you read the fine print, the “concessions” from America's trade partners don't add up to much.

If there's anything Donald Trump loves more than tariffs, it's a deal. So you can understand his excitement lately. Over the past few weeks, the president has announced tariff-related deals with three major trading partners—the European Union, Japan, and South Korea—that have been hailed as major victories for the United States. In each case, America's partners agreed to accept 15 percent tariffs on their exports to the U.S. while lowering trade barriers on American goods and promising to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. economy—in essence paying Trump to impose trade restrictions on them. “Europe Caves to Trump on Tariffs” read a representative New York Times headline.

In the days following the European Union deal announcement, the White House released a fact sheet quoting all the positive coverage. On Thursday, Jamieson Greer, Trump's top trade official, published a New York Times op-ed boasting that, with the completion of these deals, the administration had successfully “remade the global order.” But upon closer inspection, Trump's trade deals aren't nearly as impressive as they sound. In fact, they aren't really trade deals in the traditional sense, and they might not benefit the U.S. at all.

Trump did prove the doubters wrong in one important way. When the president originally announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, other countries threatened to respond in kind, leading many economists and journalists (myself included) to conclude that the tariffs would lead to a spiral of retaliation. With a few exceptions (notably China and Canada), that didn't happen. Instead, Trump has gotten key trading partners to back down.

But simply avoiding retribution was never the goal of tariffs. The whole point of Trump's dealmaking strategy was supposedly to get foreign countries to lower their existing trade barriers—the classic purpose of a trade agreement. In his Liberation Day announcement, Trump complained at length about what he considered to be the excessive restrictions that other countries had imposed on American goods—including not only tariffs but also currency manipulation, value-added taxes, and subsidies to domestic firms—and vowed not to back down on tariffs until those countries lowered them.

Scott Lincicome: What the U.K. deal reveals about Trump's trade strategy

The announcements of the new deals purport to have delivered on this promise, giving Americans “unprecedented levels of market access” to Europe, “breaking open long-closed markets” in Japan, and making South Korea “completely OPEN TO TRADE with the United States.” But the details of the deals, which remain sparse, tell a very different story. None include agreements by trading partners to meaningfully reform their tax or regulatory codes, strengthen their currencies, or reduce the barriers that have long been major sticking points in prior trade negotiations. Instead, the announcements are full of vague statements of intent—“The United States and the European Union intend to work together to address non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural products” (my emphasis)—and references to things such as “openings for a range of industrial and consumer goods.”

The main concrete action that the EU agreed to was to eliminate its tariffs on American industrial products. This sounds impressive unless you're aware that the average EU tariff rate on nonagricultural goods prior to the deal was just 1 percent. The main difficulty in trade negotiations with the EU has long been its barriers on agricultural products, which appear to have been untouched by these deals. South Korea and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to allow more American-made cars into their markets—which also sounds great until you realize that the main reason American companies don't sell a lot of cars to those countries is the fact that almost nobody wants to drive a truck or SUV in Tokyo or Seoul. Lower trade barriers won't change that.

What about the investments? According to the announcements, South Korea, Japan, and Europe have respectively pledged to invest $350 billion, $550 billion, and $600 billion in the United States (In an interview with CNBC, referring to the EU investment, Trump claimed that “the details are $600 billion to invest in anything I want. Anything. I can do anything I want with it.”) The EU has also agreed to purchase an additional $750 billion of American oil and gas. Those are big numbers, but they might not add up to much in the real world. The EU has no authority to require European companies to invest in the U.S. or buy its products. What the Trump administration touted as “commitments” were mostly rough numbers based on what European companies were already planning to invest and buy. “We can't force the company to do anything, nor will be able to pretend that we can, but we can talk to them, we can get their intentions, and we can transmit that as a faithful indication to our partners in the U.S.,” Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's trade-negotiation body, said after the deal was announced.

The “investments” from Japan and South Korea, meanwhile, might not be investments at all. Shortly after the deal with Japan was announced, the country's top trade negotiator said that he anticipated only 1 or 2 percent of the $550 billion fund would come in the form of direct investment; the rest would mostly consist of loans that would need to be repaid with interest. South Korean officials have made similar statements. “These numbers bear no relation to any conception of reality,” Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as a trade adviser to the Biden administration, told me. “Everyone has figured out that Trump really likes big numbers to sell his trade deals and doesn't need much substance to do so.” Recent history supports this view. As part of Trump's first-term trade deal with China, Beijing agreed to increase its annual purchasing of American goods by $200 billion. In the event, it didn't increase its purchasing at all.

If America's trading partners didn't agree to meaningfully lower barriers to U.S. imports, and if their promises of investment are likely vaporous, then the only real concession that Trump's tariffs have won is … the right to impose tariffs. This means that the value of the deals comes down to the value of the tariffs.

Tariffs can help domestic producers by making their foreign competitors' products more expensive. But tariffs can also hurt them, by raising the costs of the inputs they import to make their products. Several studies of the tariffs imposed during Trump's first term, which were much smaller and more targeted, found that manufacturing employment either stayed level or actually fell as a result. The ultimate result of the current wave of tariffs is yet to be determined, but so far, since Liberation Day, the manufacturing sector has shed tens of thousands of jobs and investment in new factories has fallen. A quarterly survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers in May found that optimism among manufacturing firms had fallen to its lowest point since the height of the coronavirus pandemic; trade uncertainty and raw-material costs were cited as top concerns.

Rogé Karma: The mystery of the strong economy has finally been solved

The new deals should at least give companies some much-needed certainty about tariff rates, which will help them make investment decisions. But in other ways, the deals actively undermine key American industries. Foreign cars, which represent the single largest American import from Japan and South Korea and the third largest from the EU, will face 15 percent tariffs. That is far lower than the rate American car companies have to pay to import car parts, which are tariffed at 25 percent, and crucial car-building materials like steel and aluminum, which are tariffed at 50 percent. As Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said in a recent interview, foreign competitors such as Toyota now have a $5,000 to $10,000 cost advantage over American-made vehicles. Ford projects that it will lose $2 billion in profits this year alone because of higher tariffs; General Motors forecasts losses of $4 billion to $5 billion by the end of the year.

The deals announced so far are only the beginning. The Trump administration is currently in the midst of negotiations with several trading partners, including China, Mexico, Switzerland, and Taiwan, and just yesterday implemented a new round of tariffs on about 90 countries, the ostensible goal being to bring those nations to the bargaining table too. If recent events are an indication, any future pacts will be framed as historic milestones in the quest to remake the global trade system in America's favor. The White House will issue pronouncements of eye-popping investments, drastically reduced foreign-trade barriers, and major concessions to American industry. When that happens, remember to look closely at the details.

The fact that we regularly float six or seven miles above the Earth is worth our fascination and attention.

The modern air-travel industry goes to great lengths to prevent passengers from having to think about what they're doing. When everything goes right, the airlines' practiced, cheerful funneling and cajoling, plus the snacks and in-seat entertainment, make the experience feel anodyne and efficient. When delays stack up, luggage gets lost, or unexpected turbulence hits, passengers get antsy—and the more anxious among them may start to dwell on the mortal risk inherent in flying, at least until flight attendants provide fresh beverages. Air carriers' reliance on distraction is a shame, because the fact that we regularly float six or seven miles above the Earth is worth our fascination and attention. A better way to dispel anxieties about flying might be to explore the feat of aviation. The six books below explain the art and science of piloting, and riding in, aircraft from a range of perspectives: poetic and technical, celebratory and cautionary. Together, they elucidate the marvel that is the contemporary air-transport system and bring to life the remarkable people whose struggles and triumphs brought it to fruition. Yes, flying is safe—but it's also much more interesting than that.

Wings: A History of Aviation From Kites to the Space Age, by Tom D. Crouch

People dreamed of the sky, and made plans to reach it, long before they figured out how to do so; the word aeroplane dates back to the 1870s. Even after the Wright brothers finally cracked the nut in 1903, the development of aviation remained as much a story of imagination as of technology. Crouch, formerly a senior curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., chronicles the hazardous and thrilling journey from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to the stratosphere. In this sweeping yet human-scale book, he profiles the many different personalities of early flight and the machines that they willed into being, beginning with primitive early contraptions and moving on to barnstormers, trophy racers, mail planes, clippers, and ultimately the airliners of today. In Crouch's telling, aviation has never been a simple forward march: Instead, it's a field that has been filled with promising starts that turned into dead ends, acts of bravery that led to tragedy, and wild ideas that somehow managed to work.

West With the Night, by Beryl Markham 

The early decades of powered flight were dramatically dangerous—but all the more romantic for it; the dramatic pursuit of freedom above the clouds seemed to attract a certain kind of reckless, poetic soul. Markham was one of those people—and she was determined not just to soar, but also to capture the essence of the voyage in words. Born in England and raised in British East Africa, Markham became what today we'd call a bush pilot, spotting big game from a rickety, underpowered biplane. Her narrative in West With the Night flips back and forth between her grown-up exploits, such as landing in the dark on a crude, remote airstrip marked by rows of torches, and her memories of growing up with playmates from the Nandi tribe, who taught her how to hunt with their traditional spear. Unflappable and impossibly glamorous, Markham wowed Ernest Hemingway, who averred that she “can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves writers.”

The Right Stuff, by Tom Wolfe

Wolfe loved big, colorful characters, and he found plenty of them in the cadre of postwar American fighter pilots who helped develop supersonic flight—and, later, manned spaceflight. Wolfe's subjects risked their lives in the skies over the California desert in military planes, then went on to join NASA's Mercury program, becoming the first Americans in space. They quickly became Cold War celebrities whose virtues embodied a particular vision of heroism: competent, courageous, ready to lead the world to a new and limitless frontier. But in his account of the early space race, Wolfe contrasts their boy-band glamour with a more laconic aeronautical hero: Chuck Yeager, who broke the sound barrier while secretly nursing broken ribs and later pushed a juiced-up supersonic fighter beyond the edge of the atmosphere, barely surviving the ensuing crash. Skilled, relentless, and taciturn, Yeager embodied “the right stuff”—that hard-to-define quality that the boundary-breaking pilots and astronauts ended up prizing above all else.

The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed, by John McPhee

Pilots get most of the public credit for a flight's successes—but they couldn't go anywhere without the behind-the-scenes heroes: engineers. McPhee has a rare gift for stepping into the astonishing obsessions of seemingly ordinary working people; here, he uses it to immerse the reader in a decades-long quest to build an entirely new type of aircraft. That potential vehicle, shaped like the titular pumpkin seed, was imagined as a combination of dirigible and airplane. Its siren call, as McPhee shows, was sometimes all-consuming, even life-destroying. In a saga that reaches from the Civil War to the 1970s, one acolyte after another grew convinced that he (this affliction appears to target men exclusively) would be the one who conquered the engineering challenge that had theretofore led only to ruin. Did anyone finally succeed? The fact that you aren't reading these words in the passenger compartment of a dirigible-airplane hybrid gives you a clue, but McPhee's storytelling makes readers hope that the mission will somehow pan out.

Flying Blind: The 737 Max Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing, by Peter Robison

Modern aviation is far removed from its ramshackle origins: Today, it is a complicated intermeshing of technology and training, backed by a level of expertise that has made it the world's safest form of mass transportation. But humans and machines are still fallible, and peril lingers. A pair of surprising crashes in 2018 and 2019, both involving the same new model of Boeing airplane, shook the international airline industry out of its complacency. Robison, a longtime journalist for Bloomberg, tells the story of a trusted airplane manufacturer that switched its focus from engineering to profits and, in so doing, set off a domino chain that ended with the deaths of hundreds of passengers. The question that lingers unanswered at the book's end: Will the company, and the industry, learn their lesson? Three years after Flying Blind was published, a door plug that had been incorrectly installed in a Boeing 737 operated by Alaska Airlines blew out at 16,000 feet, suggesting that the manufacturer was still vulnerable to alarming mistakes.

Skyfaring: A Journey With a Pilot, by Mark Vanhoenacker

Although the practice of operating aircraft is best done in a rigorously routinized and automated manner, its practitioners still share a sense of wonderment and reverence at their calling, just as they did in Markham's day. Vanhoenacker, a 747 pilot with British Airways as well as an avid air passenger and a talented writer, interweaves a practical account of his professional experience with philosophical ruminations about the experience of swooping through the sky. As a pilot, he's constantly tickled by the quirky details that he encounters in commercial aviation—such as the fact that, when pilots start up their plane, the altimeter will indicate that it's 10 feet underground. As a passenger, Vanhoenacker is an unabashed fan of window seats, forever agog at the landscape that unfolds beneath him, describing the endless snow of the Siberian taiga and the blueness of the Sea of Japan. “We see place more clearly than ever” in the sky, he writes, “unmoored and frictionless in the world made by airplanes.”

How the right-wing network PragerU could fill the void left by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's defunding.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced last week that it would shut down after Congress voted to claw back over $500 million of federal funding from the organization. The announcement imperils local PBS and NPR stations around the country that have provided news and educational content for kids for nearly half a century.

Amid the stripping of these federal funds, last month, the White House debuted a new educational partner at its launch event for its new Founders Museum exhibit: PragerU, a nonprofit organization that specializes in creating right-leaning educational short videos for adults and children. Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon introduced the partnership, followed by PragerU CEO Marissa Streit.

For the White House exhibit, PragerU created AI-generated videos of the Founding Fathers delivering patriotic accounts of the Revolution. In one, an AI-generated John Adams borrows a catchphrase from conservative pundit Ben Shapiro and tells the viewer, “Facts do not care about our feelings.”

Since its founding in 2009, PragerU has become a juggernaut in the conservative educational media space, with their videos reaching millions of followers across social media. The organization has helped launch the media careers of right-wing figures like Candace Owens. Their popular videos elevate narratives that have been sharply criticized as climate denialist, Islamophobic, and “misleading” about slavery.

PragerU's partnership with the Department of Education is not the first time the conservative content mill has partnered with the government. Over the past few years, the organization has partnered with states and superintendents throughout the country to make their educational material widely available to public school children and teachers.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram spoke with Laura Meckler, national education writer for the Washington Post, about how PragerU partnered with states to bring its content to the classroom and if the organization is poised to fill the educational void left by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Who's behind PragerU? Is there, like, a Mr. Prager? A Mrs. Prager?

There is a Mr. Prager; it's Dennis Prager. He's a conservative talk show host who started this whole thing. It was founded in 2009. His partner was the screenwriter named Allen Estrin, who you may have never heard of. Their goal really was both educational and political. They viewed the educational system we have now as being too liberal and too dominated by those ideas. So, they were going to counter it.

But, at first, they were for college students, and then, in 2021, it started to expand into younger students.

Can you give us an example of a PragerU video that seems to be explicitly trying to provide a conservative narrative in response to a preexisting liberal one?

I think a good example is the New York Times 1619 project, which was published to mark the 400th anniversary of the first slaves brought to what became the United States. The 1619 project really centered slavery in the American story and said that this was an essential to understanding American history. And a lot of conservatives objected to that — to the idea of framing American history in such a negative way. They were saying, “Why are we saying all of American history is shaped by this? Why not talk about how we got rid of slavery? Why not talk about abolitionists? Why not talk about, you know, freedom and all of the other things that were behind the Revolution and all of that.”

So that was the conservative pushback, and what we see in these PragerU videos, in sort of subtle ways, is a bit of a counter to that. There's a video with Christopher Columbus, who is talking to some modern-day kids who are saying, basically, “I heard bad things about you.” And he says, “You have to judge me by the standards that were true at the time.”

The upshot of this video and other Prager videos is to — I think it's fair to say — minimize the role of slavery or how much we should focus on it or how upset we should be about it from our past and to try to look on more, shall we say, uplifting ideas from American history.

What states are buying into this variety of educational material, if you can call it that?

There are about eight states that have some sort of partnership with Prager U, which — keep in mind — that these partnerships do not mandate that schools use this material. It makes it available to them as approved content from the state. So, it doesn't require it, but it puts it on a list of available material, and we're not really sure exactly how many are using it.

That said, about a year ago, when we first reported on this, there were a half dozen states that had partnerships of one sort or another, which included Louisiana, Florida, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Montana, and Arizona. And then South Carolina and Idaho — maybe those are less surprising [partners]— have since formed partnerships with PragerU as well. In Oklahoma, they actually are quite excited about it. Now, Ryan Walters is the very controversial and very conservative education commissioner in Oklahoma, and he actually recently said that he wants to use PragerU material to evaluate teachers who are coming from other blue states—

Wow.

—to make sure that they are, actually, not bringing indoctrination — at least indoctrination from the left — with them.

It sounds like PragerU has the attention of the White House, but the White House wants to give education back to the states. So, are the states a crucial part of the PragerU plan?

Well, I think the states are the heart of the PragerU plan. Despite the fact that Donald Trump says on a very regular basis that he wants to, quote, “return education to the states,” the fact is that education is already at the states. Doesn't mean there's not a federal role, but you know, education is run by states and school boards, so they are really the ones who decide whether this material is available or not.

[PragerU] does have quite a few followers on their social media — millions of followers when you add it all up together. I think last year, when we totaled it, it was [roughly] over 11 million across platforms. So, they do make their material available directly to viewers — anybody who wants it. None of this is secretive; this is very much out there. They want people to see these videos; they want people to get their content. They think it's an important contribution to our overall culture and education. This is not something that you need to pay money for or that's being hidden.

It's funny to think of the preponderance of PragerU in state curriculum or even just online at the same time as the federal government just defunded PBS, essentially. Do you think that's a coincidence?

Yes and no. I don't actually think these two decisions are directly related in any way — at least that I'm aware of — but I do think that they maybe both reflect a larger worldview, which we very much are seeing from this administration: an effort to stamp out what they would call “woke ideology.”

They see that in lots of different places, and they're going after it in all sorts of different ways, whether it be pressure on universities to diversify their faculty, [or] whether it be defunding PBS and NPR, which they think are overly liberal. All of these are examples of using the power of the federal government to try and essentially diminish or change institutions that are not ideologically aligned [with them]. And that has happened across schools where you saw bans on conversations about race in classrooms in a bunch of different states. You're not allowed to talk about quote-unquote “divisive topics.” [There is] a lot of concern that topics like slavery were not going to be properly taught anymore, or the civil rights movement, or all sorts of other things that get at the various elements of systemic racism in our country.

That said, let's not give it more power than it has. If you go to most education in this country, most classrooms have teachers who are doing their best to present a fair-minded read of history. The best teachers are challenging their students to look at it from multiple points of view and to understand that there is more than one way to read history. And I think that if it's presented in the context of, “There are [different] ways of viewing American history,” [then] I don't think that material that isn't factual should be taught. But I don't think that's most of the criticism of the PragerU stuff. I think the criticism of most of it is the ideology behind it. But if students are being challenged to consider things from multiple points of view, that's not a bad thing necessarily.

﻿Athletics for kids have gotten seriously intense.

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

When Aly was a little kid, “sports” consisted of playing on a playground or maybe standing in a hockey goal in the driveway while her big brother shot pucks at her face.

The latter might have served as “organic training,” she told me. Aly became a multi-sport athlete — running, swimming, and, ultimately, playing Division I college lacrosse in the early 2000s. But her early sports experience “was all play-based,” she said. Maybe it wasn't always fun (I, for one, would prefer hockey pucks stay out of my face), but it definitely wasn't serious.

Today, Aly, who asked that I use only her first name to protect her family's privacy, has three kids who are starting to play sports themselves. What they're experiencing is a world away from the casual driveway games of her youth, she told me.

Over the last few decades, youth sports in America have become big business. Free park- and community-based teams have increasingly been replaced by private pay-to-play options, which can be expensive. A survey by the Aspen Institute's Project Play initiative found that the average family spent $1,016 on their child's primary sport in 2024, up 46 percent since 2019. Some families spent nearly $25,000.

The stakes have changed, too, with more families viewing sports as a child's ticket to college and a comfortable life, rather than just a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon. And as pay-to-play programs crowd out other options, families can find themselves priced out — or sucked in — even if they'd prefer a more relaxed approach.

The result is bad for kids, both those excluded by the expense of the pay-to-play system and those whose families succumb to its pressures, putting them at risk of depression, anxiety, and overuse injuries. It's bad for parents, whose lives increasingly revolve around shuttling kids to sporting events. And it's bad for all of us if youth sports becomes a culture-war obsession and a decidedly imperfect substitute for a working safety net.

“Sports are not that important,” said Linda Flanagan, author of Take Back the Game: How Money and Mania Are Ruining Kids' Sports—and Why It Matters. “The idea that athletics should be the organizing principle of family life is crazy.”

The professionalization of youth sports, as many observers call it, began in the 1970s, as inflation led municipal recreation departments to cut their budgets and get rid of free sports programs, Flanagan said. Private companies and nonprofit organizations filled the void, often charging fees.

At the same time, the cost of college was going up, and admissions were becoming more competitive. Parents were increasingly desperate for an edge.

Sports offered that edge in two ways, said Jessica Calarco, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of Negotiating Opportunities: How the Middle Class Secures Advantages in School. Talented athletes whose families couldn't afford college could aim for athletic scholarships, and middle-class kids who couldn't get in to the college of their choice could lean on sports as what Calarco calls “an underdiscussed form of affirmative action.”

What parents are buying when they shell out thousands of dollars for kids sports is “a chance to help their child get into a school that they couldn't get into on their academics alone,” Calarco said.

As it turns out, sports are different when they're a means to an end, rather than just a fun activity. Today, kids are encouraged to specialize in a single sport, and to play it year-round, rather than in a single season, Aly said. The pressure can start as young as 4 or 5 years old.

Youth sports are also more focused on winning and skill development instead of recreation and enjoyment, Flanagan said. In some cases, rest, unstructured play, and even practice time give way to constant competition. “There's literally just play, play, play as much as you can,” said Luka Ojemaye, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford who has studied athletes' mental health.

Essentially, kids' sports have gone from “child-driven to adult-driven,” Flanagan said.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the shift to an adult-driven model of youth sports has not been good for kids. Injuries are on the rise — the result of “playing too much in a structured setting,” Flanagan said. ACL tears, which are particularly concerning because they can lead to arthritis, increased 25.9 percent between 2007 and 2022, according to Project Play, with girls especially at risk.

Young athletes' mental health has also suffered. Sports can be protective for kids' mental wellbeing, providing opportunities for physical activity and being with friends, Flanagan said. But those benefits are squandered when young people are under too much pressure. Anxiety in high school athletes has been increasing over the last decade, and one study found that more than half of such athletes reported stress, with 15 percent saying they were “very” or “extremely” stressed.

Enjoying multiple sports helped Aly stay grounded as a student athlete, she told me. “I played lacrosse in college, but I never put all my self-worth into that sport, because I played so many other sports that brought me joy,” she said.

Aly worries for kids who are encouraged to choose one sport to play year round when they're in kindergarten. She wants her own kids to have the same relaxed, play-based experience she did, but her 7-year-old loves lacrosse. If year-round teams are where her peers are, it's going to be hard to say no. “We're all getting sucked into it,” Aly said.

The professionalization of youth sports is bad for young athletes, but it's also bad for kids who never get the chance to play at all. Pay-to-play teams have crowded out many of the remaining park- or community-based leagues, making it harder for families to find affordable options. “It's a self-reinforcing cycle,” Calarco said.

The result is a class divide in sports participation and physical activity that's been growing wider over the last 10 years. One study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 70 percent of kids from families making over $105,000 a year participated in sports in 2020, compared to just 31 percent of kids living at or below the poverty line. In short, lower-income kids are losing access to the physical and mental benefits that sports once provided, and they're missing out on the pathway to college that sports can (sometimes) provide today.

The transformation of youth sports into a serious, adult-driven concern is part of a larger shift in American life, experts say. “We live in a society without a sturdy safety net,” Calarco said, which “creates a lot of precarity and a lot of inequality.” Parents, fearful their kids will fall down a rung on an increasingly rickety class ladder, are ever more obsessively seeking ways to maintain a sense of security.

That's getting even harder now that the Trump administration is chipping away at funding for higher education, Calarco said, including attempting to reduce the size of Pell grants for low-income students (something Congress has blocked so far). With education increasingly uncertain and unequal at every level, excelling in sports may seem like a more reliable ticket to a good life.

The focus on youth sports as a way to get ahead may be part of why Republicans have had so much success stoking fear around young trans athletes, some say. “If families can use these sports as a tool to help give their kids an edge in a highly competitive, highly unequal society, then it can feel like a threat if it seems as though someone is cutting in unfairly,” Calarco said, likening concerns over trans athletes to lawsuits by white students over affirmative action.

Given the forces behind the rising professionalization of youth sports, it's hard to imagine turning back the clock. But some parents are getting tired of the expense of pay-to-play teams, Flanagan said.

The reality is that these teams probably aren't a good investment. Only about 6 percent of high school athletes go on to play in college, and only some of those get scholarships. If what families care about is college, they might be better off investing the money they spend on sports in a 529 account, Calarco said.

Ideally, changes in youth sports would come from a collective understanding that all kids deserve access to fun, low-pressure physical activity. But failing that, maybe sports can be fun again if more parents recognize that they are not, in fact, a particularly good way of safeguarding class position. As Flanagan put it, “parents are going to have to vote with their feet.”

Ohio and other states are working to give young children with disabilities better access to child care centers, but cuts to Medicaid could complicate those efforts.

Medicaid cuts could also hamper K-12 schools' ability to offer services like counseling and speech therapy to kids.

On a happier note, an “Intergenerational Summer Camp” in Fullerton, California, brought 8- to 14-year-olds together with volunteer grandmas to help combat loneliness.

We were promised flying cars. We got Instagram brain rot.

Of all the many famous Steve Jobs stories that tech industry folks like to share, perhaps the single most famous is his 1983 pitch to then-Pepsi president John Sculley to join Apple: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?”

Like many things Jobs said, the pitch was wildly arrogant, self-important and self-aggrandizing, but ultimately correct. What Sculley did at Apple (mostly after firing Jobs) to sell the Macintosh and popularize personal, graphics-centered computing changed the world more than his invention of the Pepsi Challenge had. There really was a huge difference between selling Macs and selling sugar water.

After listening to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lay out his vision of how AI “superintelligence” would change the world, though, my main reaction was: man, this guy just wants to sell us sugar water.

In an Instagram video (of course) posted last week, Zuck explains that Meta's goal is to develop “personal superintelligence for everyone,” accessed through devices like “glasses that can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day.”

“A lot has been written about the scientific and economic advances that AI can bring,” he noted. “And I'm really optimistic about this.” But his vision is “different from others in the industry who want to direct AI at automating all of the valuable work”: “I think an even more meaningful impact in our lives is going to come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, be a better friend, and grow to become the person that you aspire to be.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

The main reaction to this pitch I've seen from smart AI observers is: are you kidding? “Superintelligence,” by definition, means a system that performs better than a human, sometimes vastly better, across most if not all domains. And the most ambitious thing Zuck can think of to make with that is… VR glasses? As Fortune's Sharon Goldman put it, while Steve Jobs called his computers “a bicycle for the mind,” “Zuckerberg, by contrast, imagines superintelligence as a pair of Ray-Bans that help you…be a better friend?”

The lack of ambition in Zuckerberg's rhetoric is all the more striking when one considers the extreme ambition of his spending on AI. This year alone, he's hired former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and veteran AI founder Daniel Gross; Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang (as part of a quasi-purchase of Scale, a massively important company whose training data is used by just about every AI company); Apple AI chief Ruoming Pang; and ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, among several others.

His hiring spree, and the gargantuan amounts he's willing to pay top talent, have roiled the sector for weeks now. At one competitor (former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab), Zuckerberg reportedly sent offers to more than a dozen of the company's 50 staffers, one of which was for over $1 billion over a few years, while the rest ranged from $200 million to $500 million over four years.

Even for a company as rich as Meta, billion-plus offers for talent are unheard of. ($1 billion is how much Zuckerberg paid for all of Instagram in 2012.) It's a pretty vivid sign that Zuckerberg sees AI as the future of his business.

But what does that future look like?

One could, very charitably, reason that Zuckerberg knows that a world of vastly superintelligent AI systems would lead to massive, far-reaching social ramifications that are not adequately summarized as “you get smart sunglasses,” but he has concluded that most of his investors and customers aren't in a place to understand the gravity of those changes. Hence, talk about glasses.

That could be what's happening, and I have some sympathy for his position if so. Trying to game out what a post-superintelligence world looks like is in fact extremely difficult, not least to those of us limited to mere human intellects. And it's usually scary — even if the changes ultimately prove positive.

For all the uncertainty, there is no plausible world where people have access to “personal superintelligence” and they and businesses do not use that to automate huge numbers of tasks, and there are a number of conceivable scenarios where that leads demand for human wage labor to totally collapse. Other scenarios see wages skyrocket. It's a tough situation for a CEO to message.

But it's also worth considering the possibility that Zuckerberg means exactly what he's saying: that the AI systems his team is building are not meant to automate work but to provide a Meta-governed layer between individual human beings and the world outside of them. Facebook and Instagram are, in a sense, very crude versions of that layer, synthesizing and compressing the outside world into a digestible and addictive form people can consume throughout their days, and Zuckerberg's earlier obsession with the metaverse seemed a logical continuation. This approach has been immensely profitable. (Though, not so much the metaverse.) Imagine how much more profitable it'd be if a digital mind much smarter than Zuck's was designing it.

Conversations like Zuckerberg's with the business writer Ben Thompson in May give credence to this interpretation. Zuckerberg sees four opportunities with AI: improving his products' recommendation algorithms to better target advertising, driving greater engagement on “consumer surfaces” like Instagram Reels, “business messaging” (i.e., businesses doing transactions through WhatsApp and Messenger, using AI), and lastly direct AI use à la ChatGPT.

The promise of AI, to Zuckerberg, is that it can help him sell you more ads and convince you to spend more time watching Instagram brainrot. My reaction to that pitch was the same as AI writer Zvi Mowshowitz's: “It was like if you took a left wing caricature of why Zuckerberg is evil, combined it with a left wing caricature about why AI is evil, and then fused them into their final form. Except it's coming directly from Zuckerberg, as explicit text, on purpose.” At least the sugar water from Pepsi tastes good.

That the sixth largest company on Earth is devoting billions of dollars toward this vision is not, y'know, great. But it has a silver lining.

One thing I've learned from talking to AI researchers over the years is that most of them are driven by a conviction that this thing they're building is really, really socially important. Sometimes that comes with a safety tinge (“this thing could kill us, and we need to make it so it doesn't”), sometimes with an accelerationist tinge (“this thing could liberate mankind from economic scarcity”), but either way it's usually stated with real conviction. If they only wanted money they'd go work for a hedge fund. But they also want to build something they're proud of.

That character trait will, I think, cause the “throw money at smart people until they all join” strategy that Zuckerberg is attempting to fail. If superintelligence is built, it will be built by a team that is productive due to a passionate, shared, optimistic vision for what a world with superintelligence will look like. It will be made because its makers want to change the world, not sell sugar water. A team of researchers joining primarily for the money, under a leader whose boldest vision is “what if we sold more ads on sunglasses,” is not going to make it.

When curing disease is bad for the federal budget.

Last summer, the Congressional Budget Office released a report under the unassuming name “Budgetary Effects of Policies That Would Increase Hepatitis C Treatment.” I read it because I am the type of person who is interested in the budgetary effects of policies that would increase hepatitis C treatment.

Embedded in the report, though, was a point that will be important for just about anything the federal government tries to do to save the lives of Americans.

Hep C is a nasty viral infection whose effects are, for a virus, unusually long-lasting. Untreated, it causes serious liver damage over the course of decades, leading to much higher rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer, all of which is very expensive to treat.

But in the 2010s, a number of extremely effective antivirals, which randomized trials show cure upwards of 95 percent of chronic infections, came on the market. Like most new drugs, these antivirals are under patent and quite expensive; as of 2020, the cost of an eight-to-twelve week course of the drugs, usually enough to cure an infection, was between $11,500 and $17,000.

Yet CBO concludes that the drugs are so effective, and the costs of treating patients with hep C who haven't been cured are so massive, that expanding treatment with these drugs reduces federal spending on hep C treatment and associated complications overall. Doubling the number of Medicaid patients getting the drugs would increase federal spending by $4 billion over 10 years. But over the same decade, the federal government would save $7 billion through reduced need for treatments like liver transplants and ongoing care for chronic cases.

Put like that, this starts to sound like one of the rarest discoveries in federal budgeting: a free lunch. That means a policy that is good on its own merits (saving lives and preventing debilitating chronic disease) but also saves the government money.

But the most interesting part of the report to me comes at the end. “An increase in hepatitis C treatment could also affect the federal budget in other ways—for example, by leading to improved longevity and lower rates of disability,” the authors note. The latter point is pretty straightforward: If hepatitis C leads to disabilities that make people eligible for disability insurance and subsidized health coverage, then reduced hep C means lower spending on those programs. But (and this is me speculating, so blame me and not the CBO if I'm wrong) that effect is probably swamped by that of “improved longevity.”

Simply put: curing hep C means people live longer, which means they spend more years collecting Social Security, Medicare, and other benefits. That could mean that whatever cost savings the actual hep C treatment produces might be wiped out by the fact that the people whose lives are being saved will be cashing retirement checks for longer.

I like to call it the Grim Reaper effect. The US runs a large budget deficit. It also provides far more generous benefits to seniors than to children or working-age adults. Per the Urban Institute's regular report on government spending for children, the ratio of per capita spending on senior citizens to per capita spending on children is over 5 to 1. Put together, the deficit and the elder-biased composition of federal spending implies something that is equally important and macabre: helping people live longer lives will, all else being equal, be bad for the federal budget.

In an increasingly aging country, hep C is not the first place where the Grim Reaper effect has been felt, and it won't be the last. I don't have an easy fix for the situation, but it feels important to at least understand.

One of the first and clearest cases of this longevity dilemma in budgeting came with cigarettes.

The history of mass cigarette smoking in the US is surprisingly short. Per the CDC, American adults were only smoking 54 cigarettes annually per capita as of 1900. By 1963, that number had grown to 4,345. The development of automatic rolling machines, milder forms of tobacco, and mass marketing meant millions of working and middle-class Americans became pack-a-day smokers.

But while the per capita average floated around 4,000 from the late ‘40s to the early ‘70s, it then began a precipitous decline. In 2022, the most recent year for which the Federal Trade Commission released data, Americans bought 173.5 billion cigarettes, or 667 per adult, less than a sixth of the peak, while fewer than 12 percent of American adults now smoke.

Cigarettes are, of course, deadly, but they kill with a lag, usually after decades of regular smoking. That meant that in the late 1980s and 1990s, the US started to hit peak cigarette deaths, as adults who came of age during the smoking era started to get lung cancer and emphysema en masse, at numbers that less-addicted subsequent generations wouldn't match. The male death rate from lung cancer peaked in 1990, and the female death rate peaked in 1998.

A flurry of economic research at the time tried to make sense of what this meant for the federal budget. Smoking harms your health. But it also shortens your lifespan. A useful 1998 Congressional Budget Office report noted that most research found that, over their lives, smokers spend more in health care costs (including more that goes on the federal tab) than non-smokers, even accounting for their shorter lifespans.

But that picture changed once you added in pensions and other non-health spending. Economists John Shoven, Jeffrey Sundberg, and John Bunker in 1989 estimated that the average male smoker saved Social Security $20,000 (about $60,000 today) in benefits not paid. The figure for women, who live longer than men on average but earn less in wages and thus in Social Security, was about half that.

“It seems likely that the Federal budget currently benefits from smoking,” two Congressional Research Service researchers concluded in 1994, when the “benefits” of early death to Social Security and Medicare were included. Malcolm Gladwell, in a thoughtful 1990 treatment of the problem in the Washington Post, was catchier: “Not Smoking Could be Hazardous to Pension System.”

Decades later, the CBO did a fuller analysis of the budgetary consequences of smoking in the aftermath of the large cigarette tax increase President Obama signed in early 2009 and proposals for further hikes. At first blush, the revenue raised from a cigarette tax should be easy to estimate: multiply annual cigarette sales by the amount of the tax. But obviously raising the price of the good will reduce the amount people buy; one major reason for cigarette taxes, after all, is to deter smoking. The CBO used a price elasticity of -0.3, meaning that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices reduces the number sold by 3 percent.

But the 2012 report was meant to go a step or two further, according to then-director Doug Elmendorf, who explained the backstory in a recent conversation with me. “The effects of making people healthier are good for those people, obviously, but also perhaps good for the federal budget because the federal government pays for a lot of health care. If you're healthier, you don't need so much health care.” But at the same time, “It was clear that if people were healthier, they would live longer, and that could have budgetary costs. It wasn't obvious offhand what the balance of those effects would be.”

The 2012 CBO report tried to put all these effects together: the effect of lower smoking on reducing health-care spending (including government-funded spending) due to a healthier population, the effect on Social Security and other benefit spending from resulting longer lifespans, the effect of lower smoking rates on wages, and tax revenue from those wages. (The latter is often not included in formal CBO scores, as it tips closer to “dynamic” scoring where the effect of legislation on the overall economy is included.)

Over the first 10 years after a hike in the cigarette tax, they found that having a healthier population was more of a blessing than a curse, budget-wise. The health effects of a cigarette tax hike reduced federal health spending by over $900 million over a decade, even after accounting for people living longer and claiming more years of Medicare. By contrast, retirement programs only spent $183 million more because people lived longer. Swamping all that was a $2.9 billion increase in tax revenue from a healthier population capable of working and earning more.

But that's just the 10-year effect. As the decades pass, the effect of longevity would grow and grow. First, Medicare costs would start to rise, as the cost of a longer-lived population began to swamp the cost savings of that population being healthier overall. (Even people who've been healthy for a long time can run up major health spending at the end of their now longer lives.) Social Security costs would keep rising, too.

Fifty years in, these costs would overwhelm the benefits, and the cigarette tax's health effects would start costing the budget, on average.

The point isn't “cigarette taxes are good” or “cigarette taxes are bad.” The point is that even a policy that saves lives isn't necessarily a slam dunk from the hard-eyed perspective of budget policy.

Recent years provided a possibly even darker example. In 2022, the Medicare Trustees pushed back the date they expected the program's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to be depleted by two years. They had several reasons, but a major one was that Covid-19 had killed hundreds of thousands of Medicare patients prematurely. Not only that, but “Medicare beneficiaries whose deaths were identified as related to COVID had costs that were much higher than the average Medicare beneficiary prior to the onset of the pandemic.” Put another way: Covid killed off Medicare's sickest, and most expensive, enrollees. That meant the program was left with an overall healthier population, which by itself lowered medical costs by 2.9 percent in 2021.

Similarly, a paper by a team of health economists earlier this year estimated that the 1.4 million excess deaths in the US due to Covid had the net effect of boosting the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $156 billion. That represented $219 billion in benefits that no longer needed to be sent, minus $44 billion in lower payroll tax revenues and $25 billion in new benefits to surviving family members.

It all reminds one of Logan's Run, in which people are killed off upon hitting age 30 lest they take up too many of society's resources. That movie is a dystopia — but as a budget proposal, it'd score very well.

The economists and agencies doing this math are, of course, only doing their jobs. We need to know what government programs will cost over the near- and long-run. These effects on health and life and death matter to those calculations.

“Members of Congress regularly thought that we were ghoulish for talking about how, if people live longer, there'll be higher benefits for Social Security,” Elmendorf recalls. “But it's not ghoulish. Obviously, we want to live longer and members of Congress should try to help all Americans live longer. CBO's job — an analyst's job in general — is just to be honest about the likely effects.”

But the fact that increased human longevity on its own worsens the budget picture should lead to some reflection. For one thing, it suggests that sometimes we should embrace policies simply because they're the right thing to do, even if they don't pay for themselves. Recall the hepatitis C treatments that prevent expensive long-term expenses for Medicaid, but might add on new costs by extending the benefits' lifespans. It's possible that, upon taking the latter into account, expanding access to hep C drugs costs the government money on net. It's a free lunch no longer.

That's not a reason not to embrace the policy, though. Lots of things the government does cost money. The military doesn't pay for itself. K–12 schools don't pay for themselves. Smithsonian Museums don't pay for themselves. That doesn't mean those aren't important functions that it makes sense to put some of our tax dollars toward. Hep C treatment, I think, fits in that list, even if it's not literally free from a budget standpoint.

Congress should also allow agencies like the CBO to do more to symmetrically account for the positive budgetary effects of longevity, along with the negatives. People who live longer, after all, often earn wages in those new years of life, wages that generate income and payroll tax revenues for the federal government. Moreover, people at the end of their careers are earning more money and hence paying more taxes than young people, meaning life extension helping people in their 50s and 60s might be especially good for tax revenue.

The problem is that the CBO generally considers “how many workers paying taxes are there” to be an economic effect and only considers it in special “dynamic” scores of legislation, in which the economic consequences of them are taken into account. Dynamic scoring has been a topic of great controversy for decades, going back at least to the Bush II administration, but the rule Congress sets for CBO on when to use dynamic scoring results in CBO applying dynamic scoring very rarely in practice.

A middle ground option, though, would be something called “population change” scoring, in which CBO considers the direct effects of a change in the population (through longer lifespans, say, or immigration) on the level of employment and tax revenue, without doing a full, more complicated dynamic score. That would make its accounting of the effects of longer lives less biased: the budgetary benefits would be counted alongside the costs.

We should also consider the aspects of our budget situation that make the longevity effect a reality. One is the US's long-standing, bipartisan choice to run massive budget deficits, even during relative boom times. One arithmetic consequence of that choice is that it makes the continued existence of every American a net loss for the country's books. That's not the main reason to avoid large deficits during booms, but it's a somewhat toxic byproduct all the same.

The other aspect driving this effect is the choice to invest government resources very heavily in seniors relative to other age groups. This is due in large measure to the US choice to provide universal health care for seniors but not other age groups, and due to our lack of investment in very young children and working-age adults compared to other rich nations.

There is no law of nature saying the US has to weigh its priorities that way. As long as we do, the numbers will imply that it's better for the budget for people to die before they get old.

Whisper networks apps are a bad idea, and not just because they make guys mad.

It sounds like the plot of a Black Mirror episode. Single, straight women log into a dating app, but not to meet men. Instead, they can screen local guys, using photos and user-reported “red flags.” The app is designed to make the experience of finding a partner less risky, but it quickly culminates in disaster.

This is already the trajectory of the Tea app, which experienced a recent surge in popularity. It reached No. 1 on the Top Free Apps chart late last month in the App Store and remains in the top 10. The app currently boasts over 6 million users, per its website. Exclusively designed for women, the “dating safety tool” is a cross between safety network Citizen and review hub Yelp, allowing users to post anonymous reviews of men, reverse image-search their photos, and run background checks. Some of these features are paywalled, including unlimited searches for $15 a month. Its founder, Sean Cook, a former Salesforce product manager, created the app in 2023 after witnessing his mother's “terrifying experience with online dating,” from being catfished to unknowingly meeting men with criminal records.  

Predictably, a review app for human beings has not been universally popular, drawing criticism from both men who feared having their information posted online and experts who identified serious privacy and defamation concerns, both in and out of the app.

While Tea prohibits screenshots, TikTok users have managed to post their screens while scrolling through the app. Men, whether through word-of-mouth or accessing the app themselves, have also been able to see and respond to their reviews. In addition to collecting data to potentially share with advertisers, Tea's privacy policy states that the company may share users' information to “respond to lawful requests and legal processes.” As reporter Amanda Hoover wrote for Business Insider, this caveat “could open women who think they're posting in good faith to defamation suits by disgruntled men whose reputations suffer by what has been posted about them, even if it's accurate.” It was almost too predictable when Tea reported a cyberattack on July 25 that exposed users' personal information, direct messages, and selfies. As a result, its messaging function has been suspended.

Ultimately, the “name and shame” premise of the app has drawn the most controversy online, including some bad-faith takes. It's the sort of panic and debate that occurred when the “Shitty Media Men” spreadsheet leaked in 2017 and following the launch of the now-shuttered dating app Lulu in 2014, which crowdsourced information about men in a similar way as Tea.

While there are, as Cook's reasons for creating the app imply, serious and justifiable reasons why women who date men online might seek to protect themself by learning more about the guys they meet, arguably, an app like Tea is problematic. The biggest issue is that a commercially available app misunderstands the value, as well as the limits, of whisper networks in keeping women safe. While these resources have proven to be necessary in workplaces and the wider social world, they become a lot more complicated and misused once they're commodified.

It's easy to read Tea as a cynical attempt to capitalize on the distraught and dystopian landscape of dating right now.

“Men and women are approaching dating assuming that other people are out to mislead them,” relationship expert Rachel Vanderbilt says. “This includes what they're looking for in a relationship, what their values are, or whether they are seeing other people. An app like this really feeds into insecurities and mistrust.”

At the same time, surveillance and informal snitching have become normalized in the process of finding (or maybe just eliminating) a potential partner. People regularly post their negative or simply awkward communications on dating apps like Hinge for their followers to dissect. A large swath of storytime videos on TikTok are dedicated to users discussing bad dating experiences, sometimes revealing the culprit's name and turning them into notorious figures.

A dishy posture is common in this realm, and Tea made the choice to capitalize on that by having a name that's queer slang for gossip. As one TikTok user pointed out, the fact that the dating safety app, which donates a portion of its profits to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline, uses such salacious marketing feels a bit odd and inconsistent. It implies a level of frivolousness. Additionally, an image on Tea's website shows one woman whispering to another woman, who has a shocked — not exactly distressed — expression on her face.

Similarly, the app's use of “red flags” to denote behaviors that would compromise a woman's safety has been equally problematic, given how loosely the term is used online. A red flag could mean anything from stalking behavior, emotional abuse and manipulation, and physical danger to a man not texting back by a certain time. How, exactly, should users decide what kind of behavior warrants listing? How expansive should a red flag be? Isn't it a problem if it can encompass everything from serious physical abuse to regular, human mistakes?

Things become even more unreliable with the app's criminal background checks. Experts have historically criticized these types of screenings on dating apps, like Tinder, explaining that gendered violence is often unreported. As a result, abusers aren't often interacting with the criminal justice system. App users are buying into an idea of security that may be little more than a mirage.

In many ways, Tea is specifically a poorly made product. Still, the broader failure of apps of its type, despite the demand, demonstrates how tackling social issues like gendered violence can be antithetical to the goals and strategies of consumer capitalism.

A company that “gender washes,” or leverages feminism for marketing, might well hold equality as a true goal, says Natasha Mulvihill, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Bristol. But, she explains, “profit and marketing logics can mean these aims become distorted, contradictory, and potentially harmful.”

The distortion here is obvious in the marketing: to spread widely and collect users, the app has to present a serious issue as fun, light, gameable — a similar experience as swiping through Tinder, for example. Tea is not alone in this; Lulu shared many of the same problems. Kicky marketing and loose, user-driven definitions of bad behavior make the app more appealing, even as they obscure the gravity of the central concern.

They also remove the context and conditions that beget whisper networks in the first place. A 2023 study, surveying women between the ages of 18 and 64, found that whisper networks helped “participants make sense of their experiences and find support” in workplaces where “sexual harassment is not taken seriously, and reporting sexual harassment is risky.” On an app used by millions of strangers, the solidarity you might have with a colleague dealing with the same creepy boss, or even the inherent trust you'd have with a friend warning you about a sketchy guy, is missing. The only thing that unites the users is their heterosexual womanhood, leaving lots of space for different experiences, perspectives, and intentions.

“There is no guarantee that the information you are receiving is good information or is truthful,” Vanderbilt says. “Are you getting genuine advice from someone who has good intentions, or are you getting vindictive advice from someone who has been hurt before?”

The premise seems partly based on a notion that's been frequently disputed in a post-girlboss culture — that women, simply by virtue of being women, are always looking out for each other's best interests.

There are even deeper contradictions, too: While Tea intends to foster community among women, it also implies that their exposure to dangerous men is something they can personally manage.

Mulvihill says Tea purports a “neoliberal” idea of women's safety as an “individual issue of risk management,” as opposed to a “social and public policy issue that everyone must be engaged in.”

“On the surface, this looks to be creating ‘community' and ‘safety in numbers,' but paradoxically, risk management approaches can lead to responsibilizing individual women for managing men's violence,” she says. “If they are harmed, then they might feel they ‘ought to have known better' or ‘ought to have managed the risk better.'”

Additionally, knowledge is not always a reliable defense against violence or other harmful behavior. Mulvihill relates this issue back to “red flags” discourse online in her 2025 study called “The New Experts of Online Dating: Feminism, Advice, and Harm” on Instagram, co-authored with Joanna Large: “efforts at consciousness-raising and education are necessary, but it is important also to recognize that ‘knowing' is not enough.”

These overarching problems — that information, even when it's accurate and trustworthy, can likely never be complete, and worse, that even perfect knowledge still may not be enough power — are inherent to all whisper networks. It's just that much more complicated when there's a company, not your colleague, fostering the murmurs.

Inevitably, it's women who face repercussions for wanting to engage with these resources, whether it's apps like Tea or spreadsheets about problematic men, when they backfire. Already, disgruntled men online have countered the Tea app with suggestions for apps that would ridicule and humiliate women. Law firms are issuing guidance on how men who have been posted about on the app can legally retaliate.

If the Tea app accomplished anything, it showed that women's experiences with misogyny can't be solved with a consumer product, and sisterhood can't be sold at scale. If women could protect themselves by scrolling their phones, wouldn't we have discovered it already?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","PwC is training junior accountants to be like managers, because AI is going to be doing the entry-level work","https://www.businessinsider.com/pwc-ai-training-changing-the-job-accountants-jenn-kosar-2025-8","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Think you can do your boss's job? If you're a junior accountant, you might soon find out.

New hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in an interview.

""People are going to walk in the door almost instantaneously becoming reviewers and supervisors,"" she said.

PwC, one of the ""Big Four"" accounting and consulting firms, is deploying AI to take over tasks like data gathering and processing. This is leaving entry-level employees free to focus on ""more advanced and value-added work,"" Kosar said.

""Three years from now, we will feel like the first years are functioning more like fourth years,"" she said. ""We will look back and say, 'Okay, these young people feel more like the managers of my day.'""

Kosar said the technology meant PwC was changing how it trains its junior employees, adding that entry-level workers have to know how to review and supervise the AI's work.

Where the Big Four firm once focused on teaching young employees to execute audit tasks, it's now focused on more ""back to basics"" training and the fundamentals of what an audit should do for a client, she said.

There's more time in the programming to teach junior employees deeper critical thinking, negotiation, and ""professional skepticism,"" she said, adding they previously would have been trained in these soft skills later in their careers.

AI is rapidly pushing the industry in new directions. Kosar was a partner in its digital assurances and transparency division before her role as AI assurance lead was created in July 2024. PwC's ""assurance for AI"" product, which works with clients on ensuring the AI they use is operated responsibly, has only existed since June.

For all its potential, AI is challenging the Big Four's long-held business models, organizational structures, and day-to-day roles.

Firms are having to consider outcomes-based pricing models based on results instead of billing clients by the hour.

Alan Paton, a former partner in PwC UK's financial services division who's now CEO of a Google Cloud solutions consultancy, previously told Business Insider that automation could increasingly cause clients to question why they should pay consultants big money when they can get answers ""instantaneously from a tool.""

While AI is already transforming more junior roles, Kosar said the technology would eventually affect senior ones.

Partners and managers will have to adapt to new types of requests from clients, who are asking how AI can fully take over certain business tasks, she added.

""It's a shift in how we serve clients as opposed to accelerating progression of capabilities,"" Kosar told BI.

Kosar acknowledged there was fear AI would reduce critical thinking capabilities and replace jobs, but she said she thought AI would lead to better-informed, faster-developing professionals.

""We will actually get to a better place in terms of how auditing works, how consulting works, and be able to focus on higher value insights and information,"" she added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Apple wants to buy startups. Here's what Tim Cook should have on his shopping list, according to bankers, VCs, and analysts.","https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-companies-apple-should-acquire-according-to-analysts-2025-8","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Apple, which has historically been the quietest of the Big Tech companies when it comes to dealmaking, set off a guessing game in Silicon Valley last week when CEO Tim Cook said he was on the hunt for deals.

""We're very open to M&A that accelerates our road map,"" Cook said on the company's earnings call, referring to mergers and acquisitions. ""We basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested.""

Apple's stock is down about 10% this year, partly out of investor concern that it has fallen behind in the AI race.

""There's a lot of pressure on Apple's leadership to do something,"" said Gil Luria, head of technology research at DA Davidson. ""That's a lot of what we were hearing on the earnings call, is the leadership team acknowledging, we understand you want us to do something, we hear you, and if that means more investment or if that means making an acquisition, those are both things that we are looking into.""

With about $133 billion of cash on hand, Apple can afford to spend big, but it has generally preferred to be thrifty. Cook hinted that strategy could change, however.

""We are not stuck on a certain size company,"" he said.

Cook said Apple has bought seven smaller companies this year from ""all walks of life"" and was doing a deal once every few weeks. Its last sizable deal was over a decade ago, when it bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014.

What would be an AI version of this now? One tech banker who asked to remain anonymous mentioned AI-powered media-creation startups such as Runway AI, Eleven Labs, and Pika AI.

Apple's core is all about consumer experiences, creativity, and media, so it would be better for the company to focus acquisitions on AI startups that help it make progress in these areas, the banker said.

That would probably rule out startups such as Anthropic and Cohere, which focus more on enterprise users.

The obvious company here is OpenAI, which currently ranks at the top of Apple's App Store. This banker said that Apple should have bought OpenAI, but with the startup's valuation potentially headed toward $500 billion, that ship has very likely sailed.

There are also regulatory concerns if a company is too big, according to Luria.

""For most intents and purposes, large M&A right now is off limits for these companies,"" Luria said, pointing to Meta's Scale AI investment as a blueprint for how Apple might proceed with a partnership and investment rather than an acquisition.

So, what should be on Apple's shopping list? BI asked these sources:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","She pitched a new department at Google. Here's her advice on selling big ideas to leadership.","https://www.businessinsider.com/google-studio-how-to-pitch-big-ideas-management-2025-8","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 05:43:00 GMT","

Just over two and a half years ago, Mira Lane was asked during an informal discussion with someone at Google what she wanted to do with her life. Unsure of how to respond, she said, ""Let me get back to you,"" and went home to think about it.

She told Business Insider that she put together a ""one-pager"" about an AI prototyping lab that explores the impact of tech innovation on society, and sent it to the Googler who would eventually become her boss.

The gamble paid off and she was brought on to spearhead Google's Envisioning Studio, an AI innovation prototyping lab made up of creative strategists, philosophers, and researchers dedicated to exploring technology at Google.

Though Lane's career transition appears seamless in retrospect, the vice president of Google's Tech and Society told Business Insider she has a long history of pitching new ideas.

""I just have a bit of a scrappy history of starting things,"" she said.

These are Lane's tips on pitching ideas to management:

Lane's first piece of advice is to get into a mindset where you feel OK with rejection.

""You have to be willing to have people say 'no' to you and be OK with that,"" Lane said.

The Google executive said the idea you're pitching shouldn't be a ""part of your identity,"" but you should still be attached to it to some degree and believe in it.

""If you really like your idea, you can have a bunch of people say 'no' to it, and that's fine,"" Lane said.

Lane said that when she pitched the Envisioning Studio to Google, the document she created was about three-quarters of a page. She said she knew that the leader reading it wouldn't have time to read an essay or a slide deck, so she made sure the tone was direct and to the point.

Lane said she wrote the shortest pitch possible, and sweated over ""every single word,"" to make sure each pushed her message forward.

""Know the mindset that they're likely to be in, "" said Lane and make sure to tailor your message.

Lane said it's important to anchor your pitch into a problem — and that the problem has to be ""big enough.""

When she was pitching the Envisioning Studio, she said she felt like there was a societal issue where people were feeling like they didn't have control over the future of technology.

""It has to be something that when people read it, they're like, 'Yeah, I feel that problem, and it resonates in some way,'"" Lane said. ""It can't be so abstract, or niche, where people are like, 'well, that feels like a small thing. I don't know if I want to invest in it.'""

Lane said she usually pitches a solution that she knows people want or need.

""I do a lot of research on the people I'm interacting with,"" Lane said.

Lane said she was asked unusual questions in her Google interview, like about how she wants to make the world better. That gave her an idea of the kinds of questions executives were thinking about. She said others should aim to understand the audience they're pitching to, as well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A Meta manager explains how she thinks about hiring: curiosity and constant learning matter more than a degree","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-manager-ai-changing-how-she-hires-2025-8","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 00:06:00 GMT","

Meta manager Cindy Tan says earning a college degree is just the bare minimum for landing a tech job.

Instead, Tan says it's the micro-credentials you earn from bite-sized courses that will impress employers.

""I'm not saying that we should all not do our degrees anymore. But I think there's more to it, whether that's your social experiences or being more entrepreneurial,"" Tan said in an interview with Business Insider last month.

Tan, 47, joined Meta in 2021 and is a managing director overseeing the social media giant's clients in Asia Pacific.

Before Meta, Tan was a regional director overseeing advertising sales at BBC News and a global vice president for retail at TripAdvisor. She is also the author of a careers book, ""Own Your MAGIC.""

""The traditional setup of education, where you get a degree, is table stakes,"" she said. ""The real opportunity is in micro-programs.""

Tan cited her experience taking a short course on generative AI through a Singapore government initiative to supplement her learning.

""I work for Meta, which is at the forefront of AI. But there is still so much that I could learn,"" Tan said.

Tan compared learning how to use AI to her experience of picking up baking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I can look at YouTube videos, read the recipes, but you are not going to learn as fast unless you actually practice it,"" Tan said.

""When it comes to AI, there are so many different tools, so many different applications. The only way to learn is to try to practice and experience that for yourself,"" she added.

Tan said people looking to level up can take classes — some of them free — on massive open online course providers like Coursera.

Such courses will help candidates distinguish themselves and ""set them up for success,"" Tan said. She added that continuing to pick up new skills even after graduating from college demonstrates one's curiosity, inquisitiveness, and passion for learning.

Tan said she has been applying AI in the workplace and at home. Tan said even her daughters use AI, whether as a private tutor or to create comics.

""At work, it's more like a partner,"" Tan said, adding that she uses AI to summarize long videos or to conduct research.

""On the personal front, I use it for travel. Last year, I was on a two-week trip to the US, and I just asked the agent, 'Hey, give me a two-week itinerary plan from the east coast to the west coast,'"" she continued.

Tan isn't the only business leader who values job seekers who love to learn new things.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet says she always asks interviewees what they have learned recently. Sweet said this question gives her a quick and practical way of gauging a candidate's interest in learning new things.

""We say, 'What have you learned in the last six months?'"" Sweet told the ""In Good Company"" podcast, in an episode that aired in January.

""If someone can't answer that question, and by the way, we don't care if it's 'I learned to bake a cake,' if they can't answer that question, then we know that they're not a learner,"" she added.

A federal appeals court threw out a judge's finding of “probable cause” to hold Trump administration officials in criminal contempt of court for sending accused Venezuelan gang members to an El Salvador prison despite his order to halt the deportations.

The 2-1 order on Friday means US officials no longer face a further contempt investigation or the possibility of prosecution under that previous ruling. In April, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington concluded in a blockbuster opinion that officials acted in “willful disregard” of his orders on March 15 to turn around planes carrying Venezuelans to El Salvador.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Chinese President Xi Jinping is glad to see the US and Russia talking, he told Vladimir Putin in a phone conversation on Friday.

Xi set out China's position on Ukraine to the Russian leader, describing it as a set of complex issues with no simple solutions, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The report comes shortly after China defended its imports of Russian oil as justified and legitimate, resisting threats of secondary tariffs by the US for any country that trades with Russia.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan addressed ""misinformation"" about his previous roles after President Donald Trump called for his resignation and raised ethical concerns.

"" I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I've built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,"" he wrote in a memo to employees on Thursday.

Tan said Intel is working with the White House to address the situation and that he supports the president's dedication to ""advancing U.S. national and economic security."" He said Intel's board is ""fully supportive"" of the company's transformation plan.

Tensions hit a boiling point Thursday when Trump told Tan to step down as CEO ""immediately"" in a post to Truth Social and called him ""highly CONFLICTED."" Intel shares fell 3% for the day.

Trump's demand coincided with questions from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., over the CEO's connection to Chinese companies and the potential ramifications for U.S. security.

""Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,"" Cotton wrote. ""Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.""

In his letter, Cotton also highlighted a criminal case at Cadence Design Systems involving illegally shipping products to China and asked whether Intel made Tan liquidate investments in chipmakers tied to the Chinese Communist Party. Tan worked at Cadence for over a decade and served as CEO.

Tan was appointed CEO of Intel in March, replacing Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by the board in December after struggling to turnaround the embattled chipmaker.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Thursday that the firm does not believe Tan is ""conflicted,"" but his connections to China depict an ""increasingly bad look"" considering who is currently in the White House. 

""Unfortunately, unlike other tech CEOs Lip-Bu does not appear to have cultivated the kind of personal relationship with Trump that would help to assuage his ire,"" Rasgon wrote. Trump may also be disappointed by recent decisions at the company, which included axing some foundry projects.

President Donald Trump on Friday warned U.S. courts against blocking his tariff policy, citing its ""positive impact"" on the stock market and saying such a move could cause a severe economic downturn.

""If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Friday morning.

""It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION,"" he added.

Trump's comments come as a federal appeals court is hearing arguments on how to handle his tariff policy. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC this week that the Supreme Court could end up disqualifying the duties that have been ordered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act enacted by Congress in 1977.

""If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy,"" Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. ""There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy.""

Legal challenges to the imposition of higher U.S. tariffs by the White House have centered on arguments that they may exceed emergency powers granted to the President by Congress in the 1970s. However, Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a report this week that these levies being struck down would lead to a ""massive amount of red tape"" around who would receive refunds.

""This is a bell that cannot easily be fully unrung,"" Wolff said.

Trump said the tariffs have had a ""huge positive impact"" on the stock market. Markets this year have appeared to respond positively whenever the White House has dialed back on tariffs, and have reacted negatively when Trump has pressed the case for higher duties on imports to the U.S.

For example, when Trump suspended the initial ""liberation day"" tariffs in early April for the next 90 days, the Nasdaq Composite soared 7% in just a few minutes, with other major market averages also posting large gains that week. Since then, the market has seen specific sectors jump whenever Trump backed off targeted threats, such as those against semiconductor imports. Companies such as AMD and Marvell, as well as Apple, then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add manufacturing in the U.S.

The rallies, however, have often proven short-lived as the president has frequently changed gears on his tariff rhetoric. Markets lately have been more stable around tariff news, with investors viewing the president's views as continuously subject to change.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday said the artificial intelligence company should prioritize growth and its investments in training and compute ""for a long time,"" even if it delays its path to profitability.

Last year, OpenAI expected about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is now on track to pass $20 billion this year, but the company is still losing money.

""As long as we're on this very distinct curve of the model getting better and better, I think the rational thing to do is to just be willing to run the loss for quite a while,"" Altman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in an interview Friday following the release of GPT-5.

GPT-5 is the company's latest and most advanced large-scale AI model and was released on Thursday.

The model is available to everyone, including free users, and OpenAI said it's smarter, faster and ""a lot more useful,"" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care.

Earlier this week, OpenAI released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019. Those models were built to serve as lower-cost options that developers, researchers and companies can easily run and customize.

These models are expensive to develop and build. But investors don't seem to mind.

OpenAI is currently in talks with investors about a potential stock sale at a valuation of roughly $500 billion, as CNBC previously reported. Thrive Capital, an investor in OpenAI, could lead the potential round.

Altman said if OpenAI wanted to, it could become profitable sooner than he originally thought. But for now, since the private company remains free from the pressures of the public markets, it will continue to spend on training and compute.

""It's nice not to be public,"" Altman said.

U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine expires on Friday, as markets watch whether the White House will proceed with steep penalties on Moscow's oil clients.

Increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin, Trump has pledged ""secondary tariffs"" of ""about 100%"" on Russia's trade partners, if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, setting an initial 50-day timeline that was later shortened.

Bloomberg News reported Friday that U.S. and Russian officials, citing sources familiar, are working toward a deal that would stop the war and allow Russia to occupy the territory it took during its yearslong invasion.

Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a key foreign policy objective of his second presidential mandate, reversing course on an initial thawing of White House relations with Moscow to now pile on pressure on the Kremlin for the lull in diplomatic progress.

Earlier in the week, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travelled for an eleventh-hour meeting with Putin, which Trump hailed as ""highly productive.""

""Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,"" he said Wednesday.

In a Friday statement, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump's top priority remains finding a negotiation to end the war.

""At the President's direction, Special Envoy Witkoff once again met with President Putin to discuss potential paths to peace, and the President and his national security team are discussing those paths with both the Ukrainians and the Europeans,"" Leavitt said. ""Out of respect for our sensitive diplomatic discussions with Russia, Ukraine, and our European allies, the White House will not comment on alleged details in the news media.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an X post that he thought the U.S. was ""determined"" to get a ceasefire. In another social media post, he blamed Russia for the delay on action toward peace.

At the heart of Russia and Ukraine's inability to strike a ceasefire to date have been differences over Putin's maximalist demands that the war can only end if Kyiv gives up its ambitions to join the NATO military alliance and if Moscow retains four Ukrainian regions annexed during the latest conflict. Russia also seeks a final conclusion to the war and has previously called for new elections in Ukraine.

Trump's optimism appeared to have dwindled by Thursday, despite suggestions that the U.S. president could meet his Russian counterpart over the coming days.

Asked Thursday whether he stood by the Friday deadline to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said, ""We're going to see what he has to say. It's going to be up to him. Very disappointed.""

At risk for Russia is the potential dissolution of its scant remaining client base for its crude and oil products volumes, which countries within the G7 are no longer permitted to take on a seaborne basis. Under a G7 scheme, nations outside of the coalition retain critical access to Western shipping and insurance mechanisms as long as they only purchase Russian supplies under a price cap.

Russia's sanctions-sapped economy heavily depends on its crude sales, amid increasing isolation on the international stage and dwindling growth expected near 1.4% this year, from 4.3% in 2024, according to the World Bank's June forecasts.

If it presses ahead, the introduction of the so-called secondary tariffs and Trump's increasingly heated rhetoric would in turn strand Moscow's buyers with a choice between continuing with cheap oil purchases or engaging with the U.S. on favorable trading terms. A first use of U.S. secondary tariffs is set to come in place on Aug. 27 by way of an additional 25% in duties for frequent Russian oil consumer India.

""It's very significant that Trump has decided, though, to turn up the heat on his friend Narendra Modi in India, and not on Putin himself,"" Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.

""It tells us, really, that President Trump is very reluctant to actually put the pressure directly on Putin. And so much so he's willing to jeopardize this relationship with India, which is a hugely important ally within the wider context of U.S.-China relations.""

In this article

Bitcoin's historical ""cycle"" is showing signs that it might be breaking as a changing profile of investors and supportive regulation reshapes market dynamics.

If this often predictable pattern is broken, it would have significant implications for the way investors assess the cryptocurrency's price action and the potential timing of when to invest in bitcoin.

""It's not officially over until we see positive returns in 2026. But I think we will, so let's say this: I think the 4-year cycle is over,"" Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC.

Generally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code.

The halving happens roughly every four years, with the last one taking place in April 2024 and the one before that was in May 2020.

When the halving occurs, the rewards in the form of bitcoin that are given to so-called miners — entities that keep the bitcoin network functioning — are cut in half. This reduces the supply of bitcoin into the market. Therefore, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence.

Typically, bitcoin would rally in the months after halving to eventually reach a fresh all-time high. Then bitcoin would plunge, dropping roughly 70% to 80% from its peak leading to the onset of a ""crypto winter,"" a prolonged period of depressed digital coin prices. The price of other cryptos would also fall dramatically in this period. Bitcoin would then trade within a range for a while, and as the next halving approaches, it generally sees its price appreciate. Then the cycle repeats.

There was unprecedented market reaction around the last halving as bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of above $73,000 in March 2024, about a month before the halving, rather than reaching new heights after the celebrated event as expected.

""In every previous cycle, new all-time highs came 12-18 months after the halving,"" Saksham Diwan, research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC.

The main factor was the U.S. approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds which began trading in January 2024. ETFs track the price movement of bitcoin without an investor actually having to own the cryptocurrency itself.

Big inflows into ETFs, and the hope that this could bring more traditional institutional investors who had previously stayed away from crypto, helped boost the price of bitcoin.

""This time, spot Bitcoin ETF demand essentially front-ran the typical post-halving price discovery. This was indeed the first clear indication that institutional flows could alter traditional cycle dynamics,"" Diwan said.

The ETF was the first major factor that disrupted bitcoin's four-year rhythm. It brought in investors with deep pockets who were interested in holding the cryptocurrency longer term.

But a number of other market factors have changed.

Bitwise Asset Management's Hougan points to ""blowups in crypto"" that often preceded the crypto winters. He referenced the crash of so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, in 2018 and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022.

Meanwhile, the macroeconomic environment and regulation are becoming more supportive.

""Interest rates are more likely to go down than up in the next year, and the fact that regulators and legislators are now willing to engage with crypto rather than steadfastly refusing to deal with it will dramatically reduce the risk of future blow-ups,"" Hougan said.

Gary Gensler, former leader of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had cracked down on the sector and opened a number of cases against crypto firms. Those in the industry said they were being unfairly targeted. Under the current administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the SEC has dropped some cases against crypto firms. Washington has looked to introduce new laws around crypto and has even launched a bitcoin strategic reserve.

Meanwhile, public companies are accumulating cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, as part of a new strategy.

""With increasing market maturity, long-term holder accumulation at all-time highs, and dampened volatility, the traditional 4-year rhythm is being replaced by more liquidity-sensitive, macro-correlated behavior,"" Ryan Chow, co-founder of Solv Protocol, told CNBC.

One key point to note is that historically the most significant price appreciation for bitcoin occurred between days 500 and 720 post-halving, according to Diwan of CoinDesk Data. Bitcoin peaked during this window in the 2016 and 2020 cycles, Diwan noted.

""If this pattern was to repeat, then we should watch for potential acceleration between Q3 2025 and early Q1 2026,"" Diwan said, adding that ""price action [in] this cycle has been notably subdued compared to previous post-halving periods.""

Hougan, of Bitwise Asset Management, said the four-year cycle is over, but for it to officially be dead, bitcoin would need to have a good 2026, which he expects will happen.

""I don't think we've repealed volatility, but I think a) the forces that have historically created the four-year cycle are weaker than they were in the past and b) there are other very strong forces moving on a different timeline that I think will overwhelm our four-year tendency,"" Hougan said in an emailed comment.

Bitcoin's latest record high was hit on July 14 as it pushed above $123,000.

One prominent feature of previous cycles is that bitcoin would plunge roughly 70% to 80% from its record high following the halving.

Crypto industry insiders told CNBC this won't happen anymore, given the reasons they've outlined to support a changing four-year cycle.

""We believe the era of brutal 70–80% drawdowns is behind us,"" Chow, of Solv Protocol, said.

He noted the largest correction this cycle has seen was around 26% on a closing basis compared with around 84% post-2017 and 77% post-2021 all-time highs.

Long-term holders of bitcoin as well as ""steady institutional inflows are contributing to greater downside absorption, Chow said. He added that there may be corrections in the range of 30% to 50% ""in reaction to macro shocks or regulatory surprises, but they're likely to be shorter and less violent than in previous cycles.""

Hougan also said that 30% to 50% falls are possible but: ""I bet 70% pullbacks are a thing of the past.""

In this article

South Korea has tasked some of its biggest companies and promising startups to build a national foundational AI model using mainly domestic technology, in a rare move to keep the country apace with the U.S. and China.

The project will feature South Korean technologies from semiconductors to software, as Seoul looks to create a near self-sufficient AI industry and position itself as an alternative to China and the U.S.

South Korea's approach sets it apart from the way other nations and regions are approaching AI, according to analysts.

""While sovereign AI is a growing trend, South Korea's approach is distinct,"" Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. ""The country aims to combine its dominance in memory chip production with the development of indigenous AI.""

The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) for Korea announced that five consortia have been selected to develop the models. One is led by SK Telecom, a telecommunications giant in Korea and includes gaming firm Krafton and chip startup Rebellions among other companies.

There are other teams led by some of the country's other prominent firms including LG and Naver.

""We are going through an important juncture in terms of our technological development. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness,"" Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC.

""Korea has many entities that would excel at creating a big AI industry. And we could clearly see the possibility that we are very capable of creating a good AI stack,"" Kim added.

A ""stack"" refers to various technologies that make up a product or other technology.

The initiative aims to draw on the strategic position of some of South Korea's firms and the technology they develop that are crucial to AI.

For example, SK Hynix makes high-bandwidth memory (HBM) which is critical to Nvidia's products. Samsung is also another major memory player. SK Telecom has been expanding its business into data centers. While Rebellions, which is part of SKT's consortium, is developing chips designed to handle AI workloads.

Samsung, meanwhile, has its own chip manufacturing business, also known as foundry.

""This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents,"" The Futurum Group's Patience said.

Given the intricacies of technology supply chains, no one country can do it alone. The consortia will still rely on graphics processing units (GPUs) from American firm Nvidia which have become the gold standard for training AI models.

Meanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon.

SK Telecom is not new to the AI model game. The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called ""A."" which is pronounced ""A dot."" Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot.

SK Telecom's consortium plans to release its first model by the end of the year, Kim said. It will be initially focused on the market in South Korea, but could be used globally. The model will be open-source, meaning it will free for developers to use and build on, potentially with some licensing requirements.

Any AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek.

Creating an AI model won't be a problem, given SK Telecom and other companies' already-proven track record in doing so.

The bigger challenge will be putting forward models that can compete with those coming out of frontier AI labs, which are pouring billions of dollars into research and development. Another issue will be getting traction among developers to build upon these models. That has what has made a success of other open-source models, like those from Alibaba.

SK Telecom's Kim said the goal is to create models that can rival these other companies.

""Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic,"" Kim told CNBC.

He added that there will be models of different sizes that can be used by different industries.

An open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.

Meanwhile, South Korean AI models could be positioned as an alternative to U.S. and Chinese-developed systems.

""Beyond domestic benefits, a proven sovereign AI model presents significant export potential. Just as Korea excelled in memory chips, this could become a valuable product for other nations seeking alternatives to U.S. or Chinese systems, strengthening Korea's position in the global AI landscape,"" Patience said.

Underpinning this push from South Korea is the concept of ""sovereign AI"" that has gained traction with many nations.

This is the notion that AI models and services, which governments see as having strategic importance, should be built within a country and run on servers located domestically.

""All major nations are increasingly concerned about AI sovereignty as the US and China vie for AI dominance,"" The Futurum Group's Patience said.

""Given AI's growing influence on critical sectors like healthcare, finance, defense, and government, countries cannot afford to cede control of their digital intelligence to foreign entities.""

Other countries are taking different approaches to their AI development. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are relying heavily on American technology to develop AI. In Europe, a lot of hope is pinned on French startup Mistral AI to emerge as the region's leading company in the tech. However, Europe will also need to heavily rely on American chips and other technology.

South Korea is attempting to tackle more parts of the technology supply chain itself as it builds out its AI capabilities, even though it will still rely on some infrastructure from companies like Nvidia as well as Amazon and Microsoft.

""This comprehensive, full-stack approach positions South Korea to stand out in the global race for sovereign AI,"" Patience said.

U.S. gold futures hit a record high on Friday amid uncertainty over whether country-specific U.S. import tariffs would apply to the most commonly traded sizes of gold bars.

Spot prices, meanwhile, eased but remained on track for a weekly gain.

Washington may place the most widely traded gold bullion bars in the United States under country-specific import tariffs, according to a ruling on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service's website, which would be a major blow to global supply chains for the metal.

December U.S. gold futures rose 1.2% to $3,494.10 per ounce after hitting a record $3,534.10 earlier in the session, when the Financial Times first reported the news.

""Gold's panic ascent shows that even safe haven assets are not immune to the volatility unleashed in the confusion of the tariff age,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown.

""If there is follow through and no intervention, this could threaten New York's dominance in the gold futures market, given prices have risen sharply compared to other trading centers,"" she added.

The spread between U.S. gold futures and spot prices widened, and currently sits at $100. Spot gold dipped 0.1% to $3,394.26 per ounce, but was up 0.9% for the week.

Analysts broadly noted that they are awaiting further clarity on the issue, adding that a U.S. tariff on gold deliveries could significantly affect Switzerland, given its status as the world's leading hub for gold refining and transit.

Swiss goods are subject to U.S. import tariffs of 39%, and the country is continuing discussions with the United States about reducing the levies.

The Swiss Precious Metals Association voiced concerns about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry, and said it is in active dialogue with key stakeholders.

""Longer term, the new tariffs could likely mean a jamboree for U.S. refiners transforming large 400-oz bars into retail units,"" said Adrian Ash, head of research at online marketplace BullionVault.

Elsewhere, spot silver rose 0.1% to $38.35, platinum fell 0.5% to $1,327.79 and palladium was down 1.1% at $1,139.67.

Top insurers fear the climate crisis could soon outpace industry solutions, effectively threatening to make entire regions around the world uninsurable.

Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz, one of the world's biggest insurers, recently outlined how the world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for financial services, such as mortgages and investments.

In practice, this scenario implies some may face difficulty being able to afford home insurance cover, which is typically a prerequisite for getting a mortgage.

In a LinkedIn post published in late March, Thallinger made the case for rapid decarbonization, pointing out that entire asset classes were ""degrading in real time"" as extreme weather events take their toll. Perhaps most strikingly of all, he warned the worsening climate crisis appears to be on track to destroy capitalism.

Insurance, which is regarded as the invisible lubricant of the global economy, has a unique role to play in addressing climate-related risks. As professional risk managers, insurers routinely allow investors to take on calculated risks, protecting individuals and businesses against financial losses.

Thallinger, who is responsible for investment management and sustainability at Allianz, told CNBC that approximately two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are currently uninsured, indicating a ""major societal problem.""

The so-called protection gap means that the financial burden of these disasters often falls on individuals, businesses and governments, rather than insurance firms.

""If this volume just grows even more, we simply have a societal situation that is not bearable anymore because it is just too much risk that is no longer covered,"" Thallinger told CNBC by video call.

""The logic is not ours or mine. No, absolutely not. There are many people who are actually talking about how you cannot insure certain assets. It's very, very difficult to deal with these assets as an investor.""

The warning comes at a time when the world is on course for a temperature increase of as much as 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century, according to the United Nations, a level that would trigger ""catastrophic"" consequences for the planet.

Scientists have repeatedly warned that global average temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst of what the climate crisis has in store.

This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because so-called tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.

""We can really talk about adaptation. How to build our infrastructure, our houses, our streets, our pipelines, our grids in such a way that they can withstand certain forms of weather phenomena. This is something that we can do with a very, very easy economic case behind it,"" Thallinger said.

Allianz estimates that the cost of economic losses from natural catastrophes is typically around 10 times higher than the cost of adaptation, noting that this provides a clear economic incentive for policymakers to invest in preventative measures.

""If we continue, however, with the policies that we have out there, we are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. This is just what it is. We cannot protect Amsterdam from sea level rise of three meters. This is just not doable,"" Thallinger said.

It's not just Allianz's Thallinger fearing the worst. Zurich Insurance Group, Europe's fifth-largest insurer, said in April alongside a research paper assessing climate resilience that the outlook looks ""alarmingly bleak.""

The Swiss insurer cited the Los Angeles wildfires at the start of the year as a stark reminder that even the world's wealthiest economies are unprepared for the impact of increasing climate risks.

Zurich also found that global insured losses have grown at a much faster rate than the global economy over the past three decades.

On an inflation-adjusted basis, Zurich said that average insured losses rose by 5.9% per year between 1994 and 2023, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.7% annually over the same period. The findings suggest that insured losses have more than doubled relative to global growth over the past 30 years.

""If insured losses continue to grow at this rate, premiums for climate risk coverage will need to increase to reflect the additional risk,"" Zurich Insurance Group said in the paper. ""This in turn, will affect the level of protection that individuals and businesses are willing and able to purchase, with potential consequences for the overall functioning of the market.""

For insurers and reinsurers, the increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events has coincided with astronomical growth in the catastrophe bond market.

First created in the 1990s, so-called CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake.

Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, said in a recent report that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down.

For Allianz's Thallinger, however, the climate crisis threatens to push a long-standing relationship between more risk and more business for insurers to breaking point. At some stage, this could have implications for financial markets, he said.

Steve Evans, owner and editor-in-chief at specialist data provider Artemis.bm, warned the insurance industry won't just keep bearing the brunt of economic losses from natural disasters.

""Unless resilience is increased and protection is put in place, then the more disasters impact regions and the more expensive their insurance is going to get. And that could be a terrible spiral to be honest with you,"" Evans told CNBC by video call.

""If the losses keep escalating, it just becomes uneconomic for insurers and reinsurers and even the capital markets. So, something has to be done to really bring together both resilience and protection.""

Not everyone is convinced the insurance industry will struggle to function amid rising global average temperatures.

""Will the world become uninsurable? Well, I'm a bit hesitant on that,"" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at German reinsurance giant Munich Re.

""It's all about the question of price. We have appetite still to offer — not cut — insurance given that there are healthy market conditions, and we get risk adequate premium on that.""

Grimm told CNBC that since Munich Re's business offers reinsurance on a one-year basis, rather than a multi-year basis, the question of insurability is not typically something that comes up.

""The underlying problem is that we still develop properties in high-risk areas, and we have seen with the example of Californian wildfires where many of these rich villas in the outskirts of the Los Angeles suburbs were hit first,"" Grimm said.

""So, that's the issue. We can counter them by encouraging loss prevention and thinking about land use management schemes, these kinds of things,"" he added.

CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter offers a view into the business of space exploration and privatization, delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to receive future editions.

It's a brave person who calls a market closed or open, particularly for listings — you'll forgive me if I'm not the one to make that plunge. But the gentle trickle of space IPOs since the start of the year, after a dearth of listings in recent years, isn't going unnoticed.

Trive Capital-backed Karman Holdings, maker of defense and space systems, went public back in February with a valuation of nearly $4 billion as shares soared during their debut. Voyager Technologies clinched a $3.8 billion valuation two months ago, as the defense and space company's stock opened 125% higher on Wednesday at $69.75 apiece, above its $31 offer price.

On Thursday, Northrop Grumman-backed Firefly Aerospace — whose Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down on the Moon earlier this year — surged in its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol FLY.

This might seem like a small step for some industries, but it's a giant leap for traditional offerings for the space sector, where for some time players such as Intuitive Machines, Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile listed by way of mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC)  — shell firms that pool their IPO proceeds to consolidate with a private company and take it public, bypassing some of the typical regulatory scrutiny. SPAC deals seemed on the decline after an initial 2020-2021 flurry, but are trending once more Stateside. To that end, reusable rocket maker Innovative Rocket Technologies has said it will go public through a $400 million merger with BPGC Acquisition, a SPAC backed by former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

The broader IPO landscape has been in flux. EY found that the global listings market ""demonstrated resilience"" in first-half 2025, with China now accounting for one-third of global IPO proceeds, while the U.S. led the pack with 109 IPOs and its strongest January-June performance since the peaks of 2021.

But recent geopolitical volatility triggered by the conflict in the Middle East and by Washington's protectionist trade policies have cast a shadow over global appetite for dealmaking and going public, bankers have mentioned anecdotally. For its part, U.S. space research and tech-oriented M&A picked up to four deals totalling $280 million in the second quarter, according to Dealogic data shared with CNBC.

""A global IPO market rebound hinges on more cooperative trade frameworks, accommodative monetary policy, controlled inflation and geopolitical de-escalation,"" EY noted. ""Companies aligned with national priorities and innovation, and those able to present a credible equity story with realistic valuations and flexible timing, are likely to succeed in navigating this complex environment."" 

Space companies, by definition, tick at least some of those boxes.

Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPOX, qualified this is ""definitely a good time for Space IPOs,"" with initiatives like the U.S.' push for the Golden Dome missile interception system fueling high valuations.

""American space companies are well-insulated from tariffs on the revenue side, especially when predictable income streams are provided by U.S. Government contracts - a common feature for defense-adjacent firms,"" he told CNBC by email. ""Still, most firms in the sector are dependent on foreign-made satellite components, creating a vulnerability to cost increases and deployment delays caused by trade disputes."" 

He nevertheless warned that the ""intensifying"" competition in the private launch market — where companies are looking to reduce costs, particularly by deploying reusable tech and infrastructure — could create ""downward pressure on costs.""

""This will be a key factor in lowering the sector's high entry barriers, making a new generation of space-based business models commercially feasible,"" Muehlbauer noted.

The timing is also ripe, with space ventures generating a fair bit of hype over their growth potential. Last month, a report from Seraphim Space found investment in space startups soared to $3.1 billion over the April-June period, up sharply from $2.1 billion over the January-March stretch. 

""Investors understand the risks in this sector, but they also understand the scale of what is being built. These companies are not being valued on near-term cash flow, but on their ability to deliver long-term strategic infrastructure,"" Cristiano Dalla Bona, who heads North America ECM analysis at Mergermarket, said in emailed comments. ""What we are seeing now is an enthusiastic public investor base. Still, the credibility and visibility on growth of each new candidate will likely be scrutinized.""

The sector has also been firmly in the public eye, with headlines ranging from NASA layoffs, Elon Musk's vocal involvement with — and later explosive exit from — the White House and Trump's push for the Golden Dome missile interception system. And, talking about going  public, NASA's even infiltrated civilian households and began streaming on Netflix this summer with the recent live broadcast of the SpaceX Crew-11 launch.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets rose sharply after news emerged that U.S. and Russian officials are working on a deal to stop the war in Ukraine.

Bloomberg, citing sources familiar, reported that a potential agreement would allow Russia to occupy the territory it took during its invasion of Ukraine.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended the day up 0.3% and France's CAC 40 rose 0.4%.

Germany's DAX and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 provisionally closed flat, pulled down by declines in defense stocks.

Shares of European defense contractors slipped into the red after news emerged that U.S. and Russian officials are working on a deal to stop the war in Ukraine.

Bloomberg, citing sources familiar, reported that a potential agreement would allow Russia to occupy the territory it took during its invasion of Ukraine.

Shares of Germany's Rheinmetall were trading lower by 1.2%, Hensoldt declined by 6.4% and Renk fell 5% at 4 p.m. in London.

London-listed BAE Systems and Babcock also gave up gains from earlier in the day. Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales were also down by 3.9% and 0.8% respectively.

The companies are expected to benefit from renewed spending in Europe's defense rearmament.

Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges has told CNBC he sees a more competitive environment in Germany, but that the country still has huge bureaucracy.

His comments came after Deutsche Telekom raised its core profit guidance for 2025 on Thursday, but flagged weak demand in its home market.

Hottges told CNBC the company is looking to defend its position in a price war, saying ""we are defending our positions in areas where we are highly attacked with lower prices."" He also called for greater support from the government to build out the network more cheaply and quickly, claiming that ""the approvals are still very complicated"".

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC on Thursday that the path for U.K. interest rates is still downward, but policymakers are facing a more ""finely balanced situation"" as inflation, a weaker labor market and U.S. tariffs create uncertainty.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, reducing rates to 4%.

The MPC was divided in its vote, with the cut being passed on a 5 to 4 split between members.

In an interview with CNBC's Ritika Gupta, Bailey said the division between committee members reflected ""what a finely balanced situation we're currently in,"" but insisted he still believed ""the path will be further downwards.""

""But I think we've got more uncertainty about the precise … course of that path,"" he said. ""So I think there is more uncertainty about exactly what we'll be doing at the meetings immediately to come.""

Bailey said there are lingering risks around inflation, which hit a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June, and noted that the U.K. labor market was showing signs of weakening.

He added that the MPC was monitoring new U.S. tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration, although he stressed that domestic considerations were having a bigger impact on its decisions right now.

""The world is still in an uncertain place, and we have to factor that in, and I would also say that … yes, there's a whole series of sort of settlements on tariffs going on, but of course, it is leaving overall tariff levels and [the] overall impact on trade at a larger level than it has been for a very long time,"" he told CNBC.

""I think we have to bear that in mind as well … we spend a lot of time looking at the world, because the U.K. is a very open economy.""

Munich Re shares have tumbled toward the bottom of the Stoxx 600 this morning, after the reinsurer cut its revenue guidance for the year.

The company's chief financial officer, Christoph Jurecka, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the tariff environment is not affecting its commitment to the U.S., and warned of an upward trend in large losses from natural disasters.

We're around 30 minutes into Friday's trading session, and stocks are broadly marginally higher.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen trading around 0.1% higher. London's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 are up 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, while Germany's DAX is down by 0.2%.

Shares of German reinsurer Munich Re are down 7.3% after the company trimmed its insurance revenue forecast, citing currency headwinds and business developments.

Markets are now pricing in a more-than 90% probability the Bank of England keeps rates where they are at its next meeting.

Some analysts disagree. Capital Economics says it expects the central bank to keep cutting at every meeting until it reaches a 3% base rate next year because it disagrees with its inflation forecasts, and says ""it's only a matter of time"" before labor market weakness leads to wage growth and inflation coming back down toward the Bank's target.

But the firm says it's ""less confident that the next cut will come in November after the Bank's change in tone.""

Economists at Santander UK are firmly in the opposite camp, with the lender citing ""ugly inflation optics"" and Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming budget as reasons it doesn't see another cut before the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Barclays has a November cut as its base case, flagging the risk of Reeves' potential budget measures dragging on GDP growth and pulling inflation lower.

— Jordan Butt

Shares of Munich Re are lower in pre-market trade, after the reinsurer lowered its insurance revenue forecast for 2025. The group cited foreign exchange and business developments, but second-quarter net profit still came in above expectations. 

— Michael Considine

The U.K. government is loathe to admit it, but economists say it's highly likely that the Treasury will have to hike taxes in the fall if it is to bung a black hole in the public finances that it has effectively created for itself.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the latest economic think tank to warn that taxes would have to rise later this year if British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed ""fiscal rules.""

Markets have still got that loving feeling despite U.S. tariffs coming into effect. On Thursday, President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs hit dozens of countries, with those not named in the list subject to a 10% baseline levy.

Thursday marked the culmination of quite a few deadlines the world has faced, as it rides the rollercoaster of Trump's tariff strategy. And while this deadline has been enforced, the tariffs are not really set in stone. Negotiations, of course, will keep happening, and countries could see some reprieve.

Remember, Trump walked back on ""Liberation Day"" tariffs a week after all the pomp and ceremony in the Rose Garden, and the July 9 deadline was pushed to Aug. 1, and then to Aug. 7. Steep tariffs announced on China have been on hold, with the deadline of Aug. 12 expected to be postponed.

So, while these might be the highest tariffs the world has seen since the Smoot-Hawley Act in the 1930s — are they here to stay?

Now, if you'd excuse me, the taco shop downstairs may be opening for business.

— Lim Hui Jie

The full list of U.S. tariffs around the world. After months of threats, deals, and posts on Truth Social, dozens of key U.S. trading partners were hit Thursday with ""reciprocal"" tariffs on their exports to the country. The U.S. has said that besides the list of countries here, all other exports to the U.S. will face a baseline 10% tariff rate.

Markets are mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back gains and closed lower on Thursday as investors pocketed some of their profits in a volatile session. In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced, and the S&P 500 was down marginally. In Asia, gains were led by Japan's Topix, which crossed the 3,000 threshold for the first time.

SoftBank at record high. Shares of SoftBank Group surged over 13% Friday to hit a fresh record, following the company's higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter profit. The stock extended gains to a fourth session, and was on course to clock its best day in five years.

OpenAI launches new GPT-5 model. OpenAI on Thursday announced GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large-scale artificial intelligence model. The company is making GPT-5 available to everyone, including its free users. OpenAI said the model is smarter, faster and ""a lot more useful,"" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care.

Sam Altman has dismissed longtime rival Elon Musk's warnings that OpenAI is set to dominate Microsoft, after the companies announced that OpenAI's latest AI model will be incorporated into Microsoft products.

On Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that OpenAI's GPT-5 service would be launching across platforms including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI Foundry — prompting a response from Musk that ""OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive.""

Nadella sought to downplay the issue. ""People have been trying for 50 years and that's the fun of it! Each day you learn something new, and innovate, partner, and compete,"" he said on X, also expressing excitement for Musk's own Grok 4 chatbot, which is available on Azure on a limited preview.

OpenAI CEO Altman shared his own repartee on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Friday, saying, when asked of Musk's input, ""You know, I don't think about him that much.""

He went on to question the meaning of Musk's statements, also noting of the tech billionaire, ""I thought he was just, like, tweeting all day [on X] about how much OpenAI sucks, and our model is bad, and, you know, [we're] not gonna be a good company and all that.""

CNBC has reached out to Musk-owned X for comment.

Altman and Musk have frequently exchanged barbs as part of a long-storied feud that dates back to their disagreement over the ultimate mission of OpenAI, which they co-founded in 2015 as a nonprofit AI research lab.

OpenAI has since been seeking to convert into a for-profit entity and capitalize on meteoric demand for its viral ChatGPT product, with Microsoft stepping in as a top backer. Musk previously filed — and has since dropped — a lawsuit against the company, citing breach of contract.

Earlier this year, the Tesla boss also led a consortium that offered to acquire the nonprofit that controls OpenAI for $97.4 billion. Altman declined the proposal with a curt ""no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want"" on social media. He separately told CNBC at the time that he thought the takeover offer was an effort to ""slow down a competitor.""

In this article

Shares of SoftBank Group ended Friday 10.39% higher at 13,865, paring gains from its record of 14,390 earlier in the session following the company's higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter profit.

SoftBank shares have extended gains to a fourth straight session, and closed at a record high on Thursday, before the company released its earnings.

SoftBank's profits for the April to June quarter came in at 421.8 billion yen ($2.87 billion), substantially overshooting LSEG consensus estimates of127.6 billion yen.

This the group's second consecutive quarter of profit and a sharp reversal from the 174.28 billion yen loss it posted in the same period a year ago.

The Japanese giant announced on Thursday that the value of its Vision Funds rose $4.8 billion, its largest gain since the June quarter of 2021.

Profit for the Vision Funds segment, which also captures factors such as expenses, hit 451.4 billion yen in the fiscal-first quarter ended June, a reversal from losses in the same period last year.

The Japanese giant attributed this to gains from private investments as well as listed companies such as the Singapore-headquartered ride-hailing firm Grab Holdings, and Indian food delivery firm Swiggy.

""We were particularly impressed by pretax profits at the SoftBank Vision Funds segment of 451.4 billion yen beating our forecast by 281.0 billion yen thanks to rises in share prices of listed equities, Daisaku Masuno, a research analyst at Nomura wrote in a Thursday note.

Nomura has a buy rating on the investment firm at a price target of 14,120 yen, giving it around 1.84% potential upside.

Masuno added SoftBank's collaboration with chip designer Arm Holdings, and plans to acquire semiconductor design startup Ampere Computing, could reduce the gap between its stock price and its net asset value.

Arm Holdings is among the companies that have received investments through SoftBank's Vision Funds. Other portfolio companies include game software player Animoca Brands and internet technology giant ByteDance.

A few of the investment firm's portfolio companies are expected to go public this year. Among them is Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart which filed for an initial public offering on July 29, which includes the issue of fresh shares worth 21.5 billion rupees ($247.58 million).

Other companies set to list soon include Japanese mobile payment service operator PayPay, Swedish financial services player Klarna and travel app Klook.

SoftBank is a ""unique vehicle to invest in a portfolio leveraged to internet and artificial intelligence themes,"" Morningstar's senior equity analyst Dan Baker wrote in a Friday note.

""Apart from Arm, SoftBank's next biggest investment is in OpenAI, having already invested USD 7.5 billion and expecting to increase this by a further USD 22.5 billion within a year,"" he said, adding that the sum is separate from what was committed in the Stargate Data Center Project.

Stargate is a $500 billion joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle and MGX Fund Management in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S.

However, Baker said that SoftBank Group is overvalued, and gave a fair value estimate of 9,400 yen.

""We believe SoftBank Group's shares are overvalued at current levels, mainly due to the market's overvaluation of Arm,"" Baker added.

In this article

The launch of an Instagram feature that details users' geolocation data illicited backlash from social media users on Thursday.

Meta debuted the Instagram Map tool on Wednesday, pitching the feature as way to ""stay up-to-date with friends"" by letting users share their ""last active location.""  The tool is akin to Snapchat's Snap Map feature that lets people see where their friends are posting from.

Although Meta said in a blog post that the feature's ""location sharing is off unless you opt in,"" several social media users said in posts that they were worried that was not the case.

""I can't believe Instagram launched a map feature that exposes everyone's location without any warning,"" said one user who posted on Threads, Meta's micro-blogging service.

Another Threads user said they were concerned that bad actors could exploit the map feature by spying on others.

""Instagram randomly updating their app to include a maps feature without actually alerting people is so incredibly dangerous to anyone who has a restraining order and actively making sure their abuser can't stalk their location online…Why,"" said the user in a Threads post. 

Instagram chief Adam Mosseri responded to the complaints on Threads, disputing the notion that the map feature is exposing people's locations against their will.

""We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,"" Mosseri wrote on Thursday. ""We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).""

Still, some Instagram users claimed that that their locations were being shared despite not opting in to using the map feature.

""Mine was set to on and shared with everyone in the app,"" said a user in a Threads post. ""My location settings on my phone for IG were set to never. So it was not automatically turned off for me.

A Meta spokesperson reiterated Mosseri's comments in a statement and said ""Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on.""If you do, only people you follow back — or a private, custom list you select — can see your location,"" the spokesperson said.

 Trump's move may change US retirement plans. Bitcoin could soon be part of your 401(k), and Wall Street is getting ready. 

Trump's forthcoming executive order could open the $9 trillion US retirement market to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The order aims to give 401(k) providers legal protection when offering crypto investment options.

Major asset managers like BlackRock and Apollo are reportedly developing crypto retirement products in anticipation of regulatory clarity.

Financial providers may move cautiously, but the regulatory shift signals growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets.

If you've spent decades building your nest egg the traditional way, through your 401(k), stocks, bonds, and maybe a little gold, then you're not alone. According to Gallup, about six in 10 Americans have a well-defined retirement plan. But change may be on the horizon.

US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that could open the doors for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies to enter the $9 trillion US retirement market.

Now, if the word Bitcoin sounds like something from a sci-fi movie or a fad for tech-savvy youngsters, don't worry, you're not alone. But here's the thing: Bitcoin and other digital assets are becoming more mainstream, and this new executive order could make it easier and legally safer for Americans to include them in their retirement portfolios.

This guide will walk you through what this executive order is, what it means for your savings and how you could legally and securely invest in Bitcoin through your 401(k). 

Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that could change how Americans save for retirement. This executive order is part of a broader pro-crypto strategy that aligns with what he has called his mission to “bring financial freedom back to the people.”

According to the Financial Times, the executive order would direct Washington regulatory agencies to explore the best course of action for 401(k) plans to begin investing in cryptocurrency and examine any remaining barriers to making it a reality. 

The order will also direct the US Department of Labor to update the rules regarding the types of assets that can be included in retirement accounts. Currently, most 401(k) plans limit your choices to things such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and sometimes gold. But this order could open the door to what are called alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

The order is also expected to encourage employers and plan providers to offer more flexible investment options, without fearing legal trouble for stepping outside the traditional menu of funds. Of course, this doesn't mean your 401(k) will suddenly be full of Bitcoin overnight. The details still need to be worked out, and financial providers may move cautiously.

Crypto is no longer just a side bet for tech bros and Reddit threads. It's a trillion-dollar industry, and Bitcoin has earned its stripes as “digital gold”. Allowing Bitcoin in retirement plans means millions of Americans could start dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into BTC every paycheck, without needing to open a separate crypto exchange account.And this isn't just theoretical. In May, Trump's Labor Department reversed a Biden-era policy that discouraged 401(k) providers from offering crypto. That move paved the way for this order and showed that the administration was preparing the foundation. 

Did you know? If the order is passed, the savings plan may not include just Bitcoin, but potentially stablecoin investment 401(k) products too.

If the Trump $9 trillion Bitcoin retirement order goes into effect, what would you need to do to add Bitcoin to your 401(k)? 

Here's a simplified step-by-step guide to add crypto to your retirement plan:

Not all 401(k) plans will offer crypto right away. Your provider, whether it's Fidelity, Vanguard, or another, has to enable this option first. Look out for announcements or updated plan menus.

When reviewing the options, you might see direct Bitcoin exposure, a BlackRock Bitcoin retirement fund or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some providers may offer a digital asset sleeve in a managed portfolio.

Crypto is volatile. Starting small may introduce you to the digital assets while providing more long-term growth. 

According to VanEck's study, a strategic allocation of up to 6% in crypto, within a traditional 60/40 portfolio, provides the highest risk-adjusted returns, while risk-tolerant investors may benefit from crypto allocations as high as 20%.

Once available, you'll be able to allocate part of your 401(k) into Bitcoin, just like you would with stocks or bonds. 

If the Trump crypto tax-free law is passed in parallel, it could mean tax exemptions on small crypto transactions or specific types of retirement contributions.

The retirement world has long been dominated by the old guard: stocks, bonds and a handful of mutual funds. A Bitcoin retirement account could soon be a reality in the US, designed to be both compliant and integrated into existing infrastructure.Legislators from North Carolina filed proposals in the House and Senate in March 2025 that would allow the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of several state retirement funds in cryptocurrencies.

According to the Financial Times, big asset managers like Blackstone, Apollo and BlackRock have been preparing for this moment. They've already struck partnerships and developed products designed for retirement plans, waiting for the green light.According to a Bitget Research report, the public is open to diversification, revealing that up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are amenable to getting pensions in cryptocurrency. 

One reason crypto hasn't made it into most retirement plans is risk; fiduciaries feared getting sued if crypto went sideways. Trump's order is expected to include a “legal safe harbor,” meaning these administrators won't be held liable for offering Bitcoin.

While much of the crypto community was occupied with the improved regulatory clarity, memecoin mania, and Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a radical change to the network's base layer. 

Amid the falling revenue and base layer activity on Ethereum, he suggested switching the network from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode with the RISC-V architecture. In Vitalik's words, it would “greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks.”

Ethereum remains by far the strongest network for DeFi with robust security, a large developer base, and the Surge roadmap. However, Vitalik's suggestion reveals that the network is dealing with high gas fees, slow transactions, and user frustrations—and that it needs a fix.

Though the base layer of Ethereum has vastly improved over the last few years, scaling to meet the skyrocketing demand requires splitting the computational loads. If you look at the stack, there's a consensus layer, an availability layer, an execution layer, and on top of them sits the settlement layer.

These layers are decoupled from one another in modular tech stacks, meaning different projects can specialize in different layers based on their area of expertise, enhancing the overall performance of the network. As a result, they offer superior flexibility and segmentation compared to monolithic stacks.

In monolithic architecture, there's a single stack performing the functions of all those different layers. There's little room for developers to specialize in or improve specific layers because they don't have the optionality to design their vision with monolithic stacks.

Different use cases benefit from different layers. While Ethereum's base layer might work well for simple use cases, complex applications such as exchanges with multiple features are more suited for app-specific chains. 

Web3 games could be another example of an optimal use case suited for app chains rather than the base layer of Ethereum. Supporting the imagination of game developers so they can compete with centralized AAA games requires high computational power. 

Running them directly on Ethereum becomes costly and inefficient. This bottleneck diminishes the incentive for Web3 builders and players alike. 

One of the biggest strengths of Ethereum is that it arms developers with the necessary tooling to innovate, experiment, and push the limits of what's possible on-chain. Cartesi—one of the first Ethereum Layer-2s—recently announced that it has renewed its focus on strengthening Ethereum's execution layer. 

It's a well thought out move to address what Cartesi sees as core technical requirements to power Ethereum's future.

Over the last seven years, Cartesi was focused on the belief that general-purpose computation could radically expand what's possible onchain. And it supported builders, funded radical experiments, and welcomed innovation across the tech stack. That exploration not only laid the groundwork, but also clarified where Cartesi could add the most value. 

Notably, the Cartesi Machine has been leveraging RISC-V for years, allowing dApps to operate in a sandboxed Linux OS. With its familiar programming languages like C++, Rust, and Python, even traditional Web2 developers find it easy to transition to Web3. 

Vitalik Buterin's open support for RISC-V strengthens Cartesi's renewed alignment with Ethereum. 

RISC-V not only bridges the divide between blockchain and traditional software development, but also opens doors to onchain AI inference, rich data analytics, and cryptographic proofs. This makes RISC-V capable of thriving in rapidly evolving environments that Ethereum needs to be prepared for.

Years of investment and exploration has helped Cartesi build high-impact components like Cartesi Rollups, a fraud-proof system, and the Cartesi Machine. 

Now that it's becoming a core technical contributor to Ethereum's execution layer, these Cartesi technologies will allow Ethereum to scale without sacrificing decentralization or security.

Recently, Cartesi's fraud-proof system PRT-Honeypot became one of the only two rollup projects to earn L2BEAT's Stage 2 classification. That means Honeypot maintains the highest standard of security recognized by the industry. It's protected entirely by its automated, on-chain, fraud-proof algorithm. 

Moreover, the PRT-Honeypot has a public prize pool of CTSI tokens as a bounty for anyone who can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying Cartesi Rollups technology.

Cartesi gives Ethereum builders the infrastructure they need to build complex applications economically and at scale. It fits naturally within the modular architecture, enabling developers to choose execution environments and build without the limitations of monolithic chains.

If there is ever going to be a “common standard” for crypto, Ethereum is the most promising candidate. The network has undergone several upgrades such as the transition to PoS, Proto-Danksharding, and more, making Layer 2s and sharding more efficient. 

As Ethereum scales for mainstream adoption, strengthening its infrastructure is essential. Cartesi has aligned itself to the common vision. Its years of innovation and exploration would further strengthen Ethereum's execution layer, accelerating mainstream adoption.

Ethereum network transactions rose to a record high as levels of staked ether (ETH) climbed to a record high, lifted by a regulatory boost for liquid staking.

The seven-day average of daily transactions on the blockchain touched 1.74 million earlier this week, overtaking the previous record of 1.65 million set on May 12, 2021.

The activity surge comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance said certain liquid staking activities and “staking receipt tokens” do not constitute securities under the 1933 Securities Act, provided they meet a strict set of assumptions.

Such a stance is bullish. It reduces legal uncertainty, making it safer for institutions and platforms to offer liquid staking products. That can boost demand for staked tokens like ETH, lock up more supply and support higher prices by reducing selling pressure.

More than 36 million ETH, or almost 30% of supply, is now locked in staking contracts, data from Dune Analytics shows. That's a signal that holders are willing to forgo liquidity for yield as prices make a push toward $4,000, a level not seen since December.

ETH's price action has also been supported by the growing footprint of public “crypto treasury companies,” or firms that buy and hold tokens directly or through dedicated vehicles.

Those holding ETH now control $11.77 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency, led by BitMine Immersion Technologies with 833,100 ETH ($3.2 billion), SharpLink Gaming with $2 billion, and The Ether Machine with $1.34 billion.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin backed the trend in a Thursday podcast, saying treasury vehicles give investors more options, particularly those with different financial constraints. Still, he warned, excessive leverage could backfire.

“ETH just being an asset that companies can have as part of their treasury is good and valuable … giving people more options is good,” Buterin said.

“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH … my guess would be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” he told the Bankless podcast, outlining a scenario where forced liquidations cascade into deeper price losses.

Buterin expressed confidence that ETH investors would avoid such pitfalls, quipping, ""these are not Do Kwon followers,"" referring to the founder of the failed Terra project.

ETH has rallied 163% from April's low of $1,470 to trade near $3,909, narrowing its performance gap with larger rival bitcoin BTC$116,459.51 and and Solana's sol (SOL).

More than 500,000 ETH — valued about $1.8 billion — was staked in the first half of June alone, according to CryptoQuant's Onchainschool, which said the trend signals “rising confidence and a continued drop in liquid supply.”

Ethereum's scaling roadmap is entering a faster phase, and the network's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, wants the clock to tick in seconds, not days.

In an X post on Aug. 6, the Ethereum co-founder said that many major Layer 2 (L2) networks have now reached “Stage 1,” a milestone that marks their operational maturity on the network's scaling roadmap.

According to analytics platform L2Beat, as of this week, all six rollups affected by recent Stage 1 requirement changes — Base, Optimism, Unichain, Scroll, Inco and Kinto — have completed the necessary upgrades and are now fully compliant.

The next objective, Buterin argued in his X post, should be to cut withdrawal times to under an hour in the short term and about 12 seconds in the medium term, changes he called more important than advancing to Stage 2.

Stage 1 is part of a multi-step framework for Ethereum rollups, a type of L2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The three-stage framework was first outlined in late 2022 on the Ethereum Magicians forum and later formalized by L2Beat, starting from experimental deployments, dubbed Stage 0, through operational but still improving systems, Stage 1, to fully trustless, fully verified rollups, known as Stage 2.

Buterin says achieving near-instant withdrawals requires replacing optimistic proof systems, which take multiple days to finalize, with validity, or zero-knowledge proof systems. As L2s develop faster withdrawal options, many users still seem to prefer cross-chain bridges to avoid lengthy delays.

DefiLlama data show that Ethereum's bridged TVL — the total value locked in bridge contracts moving assets across chains, not including Ethereum-based tokens — at around $500 billion, roughly twice the size of Ethereum's native on-chain TVL, which measures assets locked directly in Ethereum's own smart contracts such as DeFi protocols, staking, and lending, totaling about $245 billion.

The gap shows just how important bridges have become for moving liquidity around. It's worth noting, however, that the bridged total includes multiple counts of the same assets, due to wrapped tokens and repeated transfers, which inflate the overall value.

Additionally, cross-chain bridges still come with risks, as Buterin has often highlighted. In a January 2022 Reddit post, he explained that bridges connecting independent networks inherently increase risk because they rely on assumptions that may fail during network issues. 

“The fundamental security limits of bridges are actually a key reason why while I am optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem (there really are a few separate communities with different values and it's better for them to live separately than all fight over influence on the same thing), I am pessimistic about cross-chain applications,” Buterin wrote.

For instance, if one blockchain suffers a 51% attack or undergoes a ledger reorganization, assets bridged to other chains could suddenly lose their backing or value. Buterin illustrated the problem by describing a scenario where moving 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to receive 100 Solana-WETH becomes risky if Ethereum suffers a 51% attack, leaving the Solana-WETH contract undercollateralized.

Now, Buterin proposes a “2-of-3” approach combining ZK proofs, optimistic proofs, and trusted execution environments to enhance both the speed and security of L2s in a bid to make them efficient enough that users won't need to rely on cross-chain bridges.

Over the longer term, he envisions aggregating proofs from multiple rollups into a single submission on Ethereum's mainnet, enabling near-instant cross-L2 asset transfers and solidifying Ethereum as the “default place to issue assets, and the economic center of the Ethereum ecosystem.”

Ethereum has surged over 15% in just six days, now trading close to the all-important $4,000 level.

Its impressive climb is turning heads, not just because of the price action, but because $ETH's strength is often seen as the spark that lights up the broader altcoin market.

Many in the crypto space are asking the same question: is this the beginning of the next major alt season?

According to him, Ethereum's recent momentum “is the first step forwards to a more risk-on appetite.”

As $ETH warms up the altcoin markets, this could be the best time to load up on promising tokens, which haven't yet reached their full potential.

To help you out, we've rounded up the best altcoins to buy right now that could ride this wave alongside Ethereum.

Fueling the bullish sentiment, the ETH/BTC ratio, a key indicator of Ethereum's strength relative to Bitcoin, has climbed 32% over the last four weeks.

This signals a clear shift in investor interest from Bitcoin to Ethereum and altcoins, reinforcing the idea that a broader rally may already be underway.



Not everyone is fully on board yet, though. While the start of Q3 has been explosive – ETH is up over 60% already – historical data suggests that the third quarter tends to be one of Ethereum's weakest, with average returns of just 6.48%, according to CoinGlass.

That said, if this trend is being broken, it could be a powerful signal that we're in a different kind of cycle altogether.

One major technical catalyst: if Ethereum breaks decisively above the $4,000 level, over $817M in short positions could get liquidated.

That kind of short squeeze could send ETH skyrocketing and ignite a massive altcoin rally as well.

Adding to the bullish case, X user and crypto trader Wolf likened $ETH's trajectory to Tesla's historic price surge, boldly projecting that $16K might be in the cards long-term.

A bit audacious? Maybe. But if crypto has taught us anything, it's that the improbable can become inevitable, and fast.

And if there were any lingering doubts about how bullish the big players are, consider this: on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked DeFi entity, recently scooped up 77,226 $ETH at an average price of $3,294.

When Ethereum leads, altcoins follow, often with sharper gains and quicker upside. If history repeats itself, this could be one of the most profitable entry points for altcoins we've seen in a while.

Here are 3 top cryptos you should be watching right now to ride the $ETH-led rally.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new presale crypto aiming to build the first proper Layer 2 for the Bitcoin ecosystem, supercharging the otherwise slow and expensive network with Solana-like speeds, low fees, and Web3 compatibility.

Think of $HYPER's Layer 2 as a fast side lane on Bitcoin's busy highway, offering a quicker route without any extra tolls. Its secret weapon? Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration.

Simply put, the SVM lets developers build smart contracts and dApps on Bitcoin, unlocking high-speed DeFi trading, NFT, lending and staking, DAO and governance, and blockchain gaming – all that was previously impossible on the network.



How does $HYPER work?

According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token can surge by up to 2,500%, potentially hitting $0.32 by year-end.

So, follow our $HYPER buying guide to grab yours now for just $0.012575 apiece. The presale is on fire, with over $7.6M raised in early investor funding so far.

Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a top new altcoin that's perfectly positioned to benefit from the piping-hot crypto wallet market, which is growing at a CAGR of 31.9%.

The $BEST token powers Best Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet giving users full control over their private keys, safeguarding their precious digital assets from prying eyes.

Moreover, it comes with state-of-the-art encryption tech and a plethora of 2FA options, including biometric login, and protection against hacks, scams, and phishing attacks, so you get complete peace of mind.



Best Wallet also stands out as the ONLY crypto wallet on the market right now, allowing direct in-app purchase of new meme coins on presale.

In other words, you don't have to visit any external presale sites to buy tokens – they're all available inside Best Wallet's app.

Why buy $BEST? Well, in addition to letting you ride Best Wallet's success story – with the potential for gains of up to 2,300% by the end of 2026 – it also unlocks a range of exclusive perks, including:

Best Wallet Token is currently in presale, where it has already raised an eye-popping $14.5M. And each token is available for a low price of $0.025455.

Check out $BEST's official presale website.

If, aside from low-cap presale cryptos, you're also looking to add listed, proven performers to your portfolio, it's worth checking out Dogecoin ($DOGE).

This Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin is as legendary as they come. It launched way back in 2013 but has since evolved into the biggest meme coin by market cap, powered by viral hype, a passionate community, and high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk.



Currently trading around $0.2202, $DOGE is up a solid 30% over the past month, perfectly in step with the broader bullish momentum that swept through the altcoin market in July.

Looking ahead, $DOGE stands to benefit from a potential spot ETF approval and upcoming tech upgrades, including the integration of a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system.

The technicals look bullish, too. July's rally kicked off from a major upward trendline, and the latest intraday bounce comes from roughly the 61.8% Fib level. Together, these point to the potential for explosive upside.

With Ethereum setting the stage for potentially explosive altcoin gains in the coming weeks, now's the perfect time to load up on low-priced, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and Dogecoin ($DOGE).

However, kindly note that none of the above constitutes financial advice. The crypto market is highly volatile, and you must only invest after doing your own research (DYOR).

Trader Michaël van de Poppe predicts 200–500% altcoin gains in the next 2–4 months.

Ethereum's latest price strength may be more than just a standalone move. According to analysts, the second-largest cryptocurrency is laying the groundwork for a major altcoin surge, potentially delivering gains of up to 500% in the coming months.





Michaël van de Poppe, co-founder of MN Trading Capital, believes Ethereum's recent price action is the first clear signal of a shift in investor sentiment. In a post on X, he said he is “all-in” on altcoins and expects “200-500% to be made in the next 2-4 months.”

He linked the move in Ether to a broader risk-on environment. According to van de Poppe, this rally marks the beginning of altcoins playing catch-up after a long period of underperformance.

Ethereum has risen more than 6% in the past 24 hours, climbing to $3,896 at the time of publication, according to Nansen data.

Adding to the bullish outlook, the ETH/BTC ratio has climbed 38.5% over the past 30 days, according to TradingView. Traders often watch this ratio to gauge whether altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio typically suggests growing appetite for more speculative assets.

As Ethereum gains momentum, many traders see it as a leading indicator for the rest of the altcoin market. When ETH leads, historically, smaller-cap tokens tend to follow with outsized moves.

Despite the enthusiasm, some analysts are urging caution. Trader Ash Crypto pointed out that the third quarter has typically been a weak stretch for Ethereum, especially between August and September. “I would be cautiously bullish,” he said, referencing Ether's seasonal performance.

According to CoinGlass data, Ethereum's Q3 has delivered an average return of just 6.48% since 2016, making it the coin's weakest quarter historically.

Other market watchers are already questioning the sustainability of the recent pump. Trader Muneeb shared that he believes “this leg is done for now,” suggesting short-term exhaustion in Ethereum's rally.

Still, some are betting against historical trends. Trader Cas Abbe argued that this time could be different, citing falling ETH exchange balances and rising institutional interest. “This is the perfect time for ETH to rekt the bears,” he posted on Thursday.

Meanwhile, a move toward $4,000 would threaten to liquidate over $800 million in ETH short positions, based on current market data. But if ETH continues to climb, many believe altcoins could soon follow with explosive gains. 

At the time of writing, ETH is sitting at $3,896.81.

When I first heard someone suggest blockchain for enterprise cybersecurity, I nearly rolled my eyes. At the time, I was knee-deep in helping a Fortune 100 company drive a cloud security transformation. Our focus was on hardening IAM policies, tightening perimeter controls and aligning with frameworks like NIST and CIS. What did a decentralized ledger (known for Bitcoin) have to do with protecting and securing an enterprise infrastructure?

Then I started noticing a pattern.

Security incidents were happening not only because of a compromise but also because we couldn't prove what had happened. Privileged access logs were missing. SaaS audit trails weren't trustworthy. Supply chains were compromised, and we had no way to validate what we had actually deployed.

That's when I began to look more seriously at blockchain not as a cryptocurrency enabler, but as a security primitive that could help us solve real-world problems security practitioners face today: tamper-evidence, data integrity and verifiable trust.

Let's start with the basics. At its core, blockchain is a system of records shared across multiple nodes. It's not just for cryptocurrency. It's a distributed ledger that enables multiple parties to record transactions in a tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable and transparent way.

Each block contains a timestamp, which is nothing but a list of validated events or transactions, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. The blocks are chained together in a way that makes backdated data alteration computationally impractical.

From a security lens, this architecture offers unique benefits:

According to Gartner, 20% of large enterprises will use blockchain for digital trust initiatives by 2025. That's not hype — it's movement.

As a security practitioner, I've been following blockchain's move from theory to serious consideration, especially when dealing with persistent gaps in audit integrity, access verification and software provenance.

Logs are only as trustworthy as the systems that store them. In environments where insider threats, shared SaaS infrastructure or privileged access are concerns, immutable logging becomes critical. 

Audit logs are foundational to incident response and compliance, but they are also vulnerable. A malicious insider can alter logs, and some SaaS platforms offer only limited access or retention. 

To solve these problems, more security teams are now exploring blockchain-based audit layers, anchoring hashes of critical events (like privilege changes or API calls) into an immutable ledger. This creates a verifiable record that enhances the credibility of traditional logging systems. 

Estonia's KSI Blockchain is a powerful real-world example. Their entire public sector uses blockchain to protect the integrity of legal, medical and identity records, which ensures that unauthorized changes are detectable.

Traditional identity systems are centralized and hence, vulnerable. Breach one identity provider, and you compromise everything downstream. 

Blockchain enables self-sovereign identity (SSI), where individuals or devices present cryptographically signed credentials without relying on a central source of truth. This aligns well with zero trust architecture, where every identity must be continuously verified and validated. 

Projects like Sovrin showcase how decentralized identity models can reduce attack surface while maintaining strong verification without overexposing sensitive data.

We all remember how the software supply chain attacks like SolarWinds and Log4j vulnerabilities revealed the fragility of our systems, when trust is assumed but not verifiable. 

Blockchain provides a tamper-proof way to log each stage of the CI/CD pipeline, tracking who committed code, what tools were used to build it and what passed (or failed) review. It can support software artifact tracking, including anchoring hashes of containers, building metadata and committing signatures into a shared ledger.

Initiatives like SBOM are evolving quickly to improve software supply chain transparency and security, and blockchain may play a crucial role in anchoring or timestamping these software records in a tamper-resistant format.

Like all technologies, blockchain is only useful when applied to the right problems. It shines when we need verifiable trust, but it's not well-suited for high-speed processing or dynamic data-heavy applications.

Choosing the right blockchain type:

Most enterprise security use cases align best with private or consortium chains, which strike the right balance between control, performance and privacy.

As AI adoption grows, so does the need to track model provenance. Many organizations today don't really know who trained their models, what data was used or how decisions are made. As regulatory pressure builds, this lack of transparency is becoming a risk. 

Blockchain is emerging as a tool to record this AI lifecycle metadata, creating transparent histories of model versioning and access. Projects like Ocean Protocol are already building frameworks for decentralized data exchange with embedded governance and auditability. 

In a future where AI regulations will demand explainability and accountability, blockchain may become a key enabler: not of performance, but of proof.

I'm not advocating blockchain as a replacement for existing security tools. But I do believe it's time for CISOs and security teams to start evaluating blockchain's potential in specific, high-value areas where today's trust models fall short. 

Here's how to begin: 

As security practitioners, we are constantly asked to secure systems we do not fully control, defend data we do not directly store and establish trust in a digital ecosystem that was never designed with trust in mind. The attack surface is growing, the supply chain is increasingly complex and the stakes have never been higher. In this environment, trust cannot be assumed. 

It must be verifiable. 

That is why blockchain deserves a serious second look. Not as a buzzword or a passing trend, but as a foundational technology with the potential to redefine how we approach digital trust. I am not suggesting it is a universal solution, nor do I believe it will replace our existing security frameworks. But I see its potential to enhance what we already have. 

Blockchain offers a new model for trust. It brings transparency through shared ledgers, integrity through immutability and assurance through decentralization. Whether it is used to secure identities, preserve audit trails or protect software supply chains, blockchain enables us to shift from assumed trust to provable assurance. 

We do not need to become blockchain experts. But we do need to understand where and when this technology can help solve problems that traditional models cannot solve. That is the mindset shift I am advocating for. As security leaders, our responsibility is not to follow hype but to challenge assumptions, evaluate emerging technologies early and prepare our organizations for what is coming. 

Blockchain may not be the answer to every challenge we face. But in a world where trust is fragile and constantly under threat, it is increasingly part of the solution. It belongs on every CISO's strategic radar.

 Web3 AI projects often force blockchain integration to access capital, harming innovation by prioritizing ecosystem compatibility over practical AI solutions. 

Opinion by: Samuele Marro, PhD student in machine learning at the University of Oxford

The Web3 AI space has fallen into a trap. Somewhere along the way, “decentralized AI” became synonymous with “blockchain AI.” This false equivalency actively harms innovation. 

Excellent decentralized AI projects contort themselves into blockchain frameworks, not because it makes technical sense, but because that's the only way to access Web3 funding, expertise and communities. The blockchain-first mentality isn't just limiting what decentralized AI could become; it's cannibalizing it.

Web3 ideals emerged from cypherpunk: trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance and user ownership. The industry has forgotten a critical distinction: Web3 philosophy differs from blockchain technology. BitTorrent is Web3. Tor is Web3. IPFS is Web3. And now that Web3 AI is at the center of the hype, many find blockchains are often ill-suited. 

Jump into any Web3 AI space, and you'll see the same pattern repeating: brilliant teams building distributed learning networks, peer-to-peer (P2P) AI marketplaces and distributed training systems, all awkwardly explaining why they need a token or how their onchain settlement works.

As a counterexample, consider federated learning, where multiple nodes collaborate to train a shared AI model while keeping their raw data private. This is a prime example of decentralized AI: No tokens are required.

That isn't to say blockchain is never useful. Onchain settlement can simplify payments between AI agents, cryptographic proofs can improve reputation systems, and tokens can align incentives in collaborative training. But those are specialized tools, not one-size-fits-all solutions. For many decentralized-AI problems, blockchain overhead only adds latency, complexity and cost.

Why do projects make these decisions? The answer lies in how the Web3 ecosystem has evolved. Projects that don't integrate blockchains aren't considered “Web3” and thus can't access Web3 funding pipelines, expert networks or community resources. In their thesis, venture funds with “Web3” built investment criteria around blockchain integration. Web3 AI spaces treat non-blockchain projects as out of scope. 

These incentives drive teams to adopt blockchain not for product reasons but for ecosystem access. In other words, they're making architectural decisions based on fundraising requirements rather than optimal user outcomes. There's nothing wrong with playing the game, but it means that many opportunities for genuine (and profitable) applications of decentralized AI are being overlooked.

The industry must recognize that three distinct concepts have been artificially bundled together.Related: Can blockchain supply the guardrails to keep AI on course?

Decentralized AI includes distributed computing, federated learning, P2P networks and edge computing, none of which inherently require blockchain infrastructure.

Crypto-integrated AI involves token incentives, cryptographic proofs, digital asset management and legitimate use cases that can be implemented using blockchains.

Web3 AI represents user ownership, permissionless innovation and community governance, which can be achieved through multiple technological approaches.

These concepts can work together beautifully, but they don't need to. A federated learning network can use cryptographic privacy guarantees without touching a blockchain. A distributed AI marketplace can implement reputation-based validation without smart contracts. Incentive systems can operate through consensus mechanisms that don't require the overhead of a whole blockchain infrastructure.

True innovation in decentralized AI requires technological pluralism, with blockchain being a tool in the toolkit, not a religious requirement. The most successful projects of the next decade will be those that choose the right architecture for their specific challenges, not those that conform to current ecosystem expectations.

Web3 funding and community support must evolve to embrace non-blockchain decentralization. Venture funds can get substantial returns on decentralized and aligned projects with Web3, even if their funding model is not token-based. 

Communities should celebrate permissionless innovation regardless of its technical substrate. For example, numerous decentralized AI ecosystems exist beyond crypto, both nonprofit and for-profit. Prime Intellect has trained large language models at scale while preserving decentralization. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's NANDA is building a decentralized internet of agents. LAION is democratizing AI research.

These systems achieve genuine decentralization; they don't carry a blockchain badge and are invisible to much of the Web3 community. Even in the more traditional Web3 AI space, however, there are positive signals from projects that use blockchains only when it makes sense. 

Numerai uses the chain to manage stakes for models developed by the community, rewarding the best-performing ones. Torus Network distributes token rewards transparently to the agents that contribute the most to its long-term growth while capturing the network value in the token. Render Network's token-based payment means that anyone, anywhere, can provide compute to its render farm. All of these applications are already here.

The current blockchain-first approach is constraining innovation in decentralized AI precisely when it's needed the most. As AI systems become more powerful and centralized, there's a desperate need for decentralized alternatives. But they won't be achieved if the ecosystem keeps forcing every solution through the blockchain bottleneck. The projects that shed this inefficient mindset today will dominate the ecosystem tomorrow.

Web3 AI faces a choice: continue cannibalizing decentralized AI with blockchain requirements or liberate it to achieve its full potential. The technology is ready. The question is whether the ecosystem is ready to evolve and who can capitalize on this change.

Oops, something went wrong

Full Alliance Group's subsidiary Qubitera Holdings is developing a new technology platform, Quant Blockchain, designed to enable healthcare systems and hospitals to securely and instantly share patient data.

The initiative comes in response to the costly challenge faced by hospitals due to incompatible computer systems, which results in approximately $77.8bn being wasted annually.

With federal mandates requiring healthcare systems to integrate their systems by January 2027, the demand for solutions such as Quant Blockchain is becoming increasingly urgent.

Full Alliance Group chairman Bill Heneghan said: ""Every hospital in America must upgrade their systems by 2027 to follow new federal rules.

""We're giving them a solution that makes them more efficient while keeping patient data secure.""

Quant Blockchain is set to serve as a secure digital conduit, allowing disparate hospital computer systems to share information related to patients instantaneously while complying with all healthcare privacy laws, including HIPAA.

The technology is designed to interface with existing software, negating the need for hospitals to overhaul their current systems.

It also offers rapid transfer of patient records and compatibility with AI tools that support clinical decision-making.

As part of its market strategy, Qubitera Holdings is targeting growth areas such as healthcare data sharing, blockchain technology, and hospital AI systems.

Qubitera Holdings president Jay Archer said: ""We're fixing a massive problem in healthcare.

""Instead of building another cryptocurrency, we're creating the digital infrastructure that hospitals actually need to work better and save money.""

In preparation for the 2027 deadline, Qubitera Holdings is collaborating with select hospitals for the system.

The company anticipates forming partnerships with healthcare systems as more hospitals begin to comply with the upcoming federal requirements.

""Full Alliance Group's subsidiary to develop Quant Blockchain technology"" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.

- Animoca Brands acquires majority stake in Cool Cats Group, a strategic move to integrate blockchain gaming with NFT projects.

- The partnership combines Animoca's metaverse expertise with Cool Cats' established brand, aiming to unlock new utilities and market opportunities.

- This acquisition reflects a shift in NFT markets toward utility-driven value, prioritizing community engagement and long-term IP development over speculation.

- Future plans include play-to-earn games, exclusive merchandise, and geographic expansion, though challenges like technological adaptation remain.

Animoca Brands, a leading blockchain gaming developer and investor, has acquired a majority stake in the Cool Cats Group, marking a significant strategic move in the NFT space. This investment highlights a strong endorsement of Cool Cats, one of the most iconic NFT collections, and underscores the growing integration between blockchain gaming and digital asset projects. The partnership with Coin Operated Group aims to drive growth, enhance community engagement, and explore new market opportunities for the Cool Cats NFT collection [1].

This collaboration is not merely a financial transaction but a strategic alliance designed to elevate the project's long-term vision. Animoca Brands brings its extensive network and expertise in the blockchain and metaverse sectors to the table, while Cool Cats contributes its established brand and loyal community. The combined strengths of both entities are expected to unlock new utilities, partnerships, and experiences for NFT holders. These include potential integrations into blockchain games, metaverse environments, and physical activations, broadening the scope of the Cool Cats NFTs beyond static digital assets [1].

The decision to invest in Cool Cats aligns with Animoca Brands' broader mission to drive the open metaverse. Cool Cats, known for its distinctive art style and robust community, offers a solid foundation for expansion within the Web3 ecosystem. Animoca Brands sees the potential to leverage this brand for blockchain gaming applications and metaverse experiences, further cementing its role as a key player in the future of digital assets [1].

This acquisition reflects a shift in the NFT market from speculative trading to strategic, long-term investments focused on intellectual property, community engagement, and utility-driven value. Cool Cats is now positioned to move beyond its current use cases and evolve into a more interactive and functional asset within the digital economy. This development also signals to the market that major players are increasingly prioritizing projects with clear roadmaps and strong community foundations [1].

The partnership will face challenges such as maintaining community engagement, delivering on ambitious plans, and adapting to technological changes. However, the combined expertise of Animoca Brands and Cool Cats Group is well-equipped to navigate these challenges and drive innovation. Future opportunities include the development of play-to-earn games featuring Cool Cats, the creation of exclusive merchandise, and the expansion of the brand into new geographic markets [1].

This strategic move by Animoca Brands underscores the importance of collaboration in the Web3 space. It not only strengthens the Cool Cats NFT project but also contributes to the broader maturation of the digital collectible investment market. As more industry leaders pursue similar strategies, the NFT landscape is expected to evolve into a more interconnected and utility-focused ecosystem [1].

Animoca Brands and affiliates make strategic investment in Cool Cats Group

​​​

8 August 2025 - Animoca Brands, the company driving digital property rights to help establish the open metaverse and its associated network effects, and its affiliates (collectively, referred to as “Animoca Brands”) today announced the completion of its strategic investment in Cool Cats Group, owner of the iconic Cool Cats NFT brand. Following the investment, Animoca Brands and Coin Operated Group own a majority interest in Cool Cats Group. Animoca Brands and Coin Operated Group aim to foster innovation and growth, enhance community engagement, and develop new market opportunities for Cool Cats within the rapidly evolving NFT landscape.

Cool Cats is a collection of 9,999 randomly generated and stylistically curated NFTs on Ethereum, and originates from the beloved comic character ""Blue Cat"" created in 2013 by artist Colin Egan (also known as Clon).

 

Since April 2025, NFTs have experienced a significant increase in market valuation, reaching a global market capitalization of around US$7 billion (source: CoinGecko), with monthly sales volumes of around US$600 million (source: CryptoSlam). Cool Cats is one of the most historic and recognizable NFT collections, having traded over US$410 million to date, which ranks it 19th among the top NFT collections by all-time trading volume (source: CryptoSlam).

 

Following the investment, Animoca Brands will appoint two new board members to advance Cool Cats: Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, and Kenneth Shek, project lead of Mocaverse and Moca Network.

 

Animoca Brands plans to create synergy between the two popular NFT collections, its Eastern-origin Mocaverse and the Western-origin Cool Cats, uniting both communities through shared intellectual property, utility, and rewards. In addition, Moca Network, the Animoca Brands project that is building the world's largest chain-agnostic decentralized identity network, is also planning a collaboration with Cool Cats. The collaboration will bring the two brand ecosystems closer and facilitate the growth and expansion of Cool Cats via the interoperability enabled by Moca Network's digital identity infrastructure. 

 

Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said: “We are thrilled to welcome Cool Cats to the Animoca Brands ecosystem. NFTs thrive on the strength of their communities, and by integrating Cool Cats into Mocaverse and Moca Network, we're deepening these global connections and offering communities a robust ecosystem that delivers value to its stakeholders. Cats have always been the darlings of the Internet, and Cool Cats is one of the most recognized digital brands out there, perfectly exemplifying the global appeal of digital felines.”

 

""This investment marks an expansion of the strategic partnership between Cool Cats and Animoca Brands,” said Ken Cron, chairman and CEO of Coin Operated Group. “We share a vision for a future where Web3 fuels creativity and community. With Animoca Brands' global reach and leadership in the space, Cool Cats is positioned to bring its characters and stories to fans across the world.""

 

""Partnering with Animoca Brands is a dream come true for Cool Cats,"" said Clon. ""Blue Cat has always been a character with a global heart, and I've long believed his story was destined to connect with audiences in the East. With Animoca Brands' reach and passion, we can bring that vision to life on a truly global stage.""

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

The physical knitted beanie associated with the iconic photo of Achi, the Shiba Inu dog behind the Dogwifhat memecoin, sold via auction on Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace Ord City for 6.8 BTC ($794,074) on Thursday night.

The winning bid came from ""Finn,"" the pseudonymous founder of Solana memecoin launchpad Bags, on behalf of the platform, beating strong competition from two other bidders in particular during the 48-hour event.

""I'm excited to announce that Bags has made its first acquisition,"" Finn said on X following the auction, adding the hat to the Bags avatar. ""We've acquired a $1B hat for just $0.7M. Get ready for what's coming next.""

The auction had to be paused at one point during the proceedings after a slew of fake bids were submitted, including one for an impossible amount of bitcoin, equivalent to the total 21 million BTC supply. ""We massively underestimated your degeneracy,"" Ord City said in response, raising the auction's collateral requirement to rectify the issue.

Bags' model enables token deployers to share trading fees with users on X. Finn claimed he used the fees received from one such Bags-deployed token called ""BUY THE HAT"" to help fund the winning bid, adding that he would ""make sure the hat goes back to the community in some way"" — potentially linking the token to the hat.

The token has gained more than 700% over the past 24 hours, rising to a market cap of $7.8 million, according to DEX Screener.

The Dogwifhat meme became popular on platforms like Reddit and Twitter in 2020, inspiring the Solana-based WIF cryptocurrency of the same name in late 2023. The pink hat, originally handcrafted as a Christmas decoration, was first photographed on Achi in November 2018, and the image went viral when uploaded to Instagram. To verify the authenticity of the hat, Ord City provided high-resolution photos and a video detailing the meme's origin and the hat's provenance from Achi's owners.

""This hat has been a lucky charm for us and a piece of internet culture that has traveled across chains, timelines, and communities, carrying our story along the way,"" the owners posted on X, congratulating Finn on the winning bid. ""It has sparked conversations, inspired memes and connected people who share the same love for the dog wif hat. We hope it brings you and everyone around you the same luck, fun, and serendipity it brought us.""

Though substantial, the winning bid for the knitted hat falls far short of the amount the owners raised from the sale of the Dogwifhat meme's original iconic photo as an NFT.

Following a three-day auction on NFT marketplace Foundation in March 2024, crypto trader Gigantic Rebirth Ventures ultimately made the winning bid of 1,210.8 ETH, worth around $4.3 million at the time and $4.7 million at current prices.

Dogwifhat is currently trading at $0.92, according to The Block's WIF price page, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours. Following a collapse in memecoin hype, the token is down over 70% since peaking around the time of the NFT sale, though it still commands a market cap of nearly $1 billion.

- XRP Ledger's TVL surged from $20M to $100M in 8 months, driving institutional interest as DeXRP targets Q4 2025 full launch.

A new decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the XRP Ledger, DeXRP, has raised over $4.1 million through its initial coin offering (ICO) as of August 8, 2025. The project, which is designed to unlock the full potential of DeFi on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), reported that nearly 80% of its IDO tokens have already been sold, with over 4,500 participants contributing to the presale [1]. The platform is currently in the ongoing phase of its token offering, with the listing of its native token $DXP expected to be announced soon.

DeXRP aims to serve as a central trading hub for the XRPL community by integrating both automated market maker (AMM) and order book trading systems. The platform is built with a focus on liquidity aggregation, governance participation, and customizable yield multipliers for liquidity providers, offering a flexible and transparent framework for users to optimize their returns [1].

Investors can purchase tokens via Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or USDT on supported networks. Additionally, the platform supports purchases through bank card transactions [1]. The tokenomics model is designed for long-term sustainability, with 25% of the total supply allocated to the presale, 15% reserved for liquidity provision, and 10% dedicated to staking rewards [1].

Abu Dhabi, UAE, August 8th, 2025, Chainwire



Summer 2025 shows that more institutional investors are choosing cryptocurrency as a main investment focus. Bitcoin and Ethereum have already hit new ATH, but the asset XRP, showed over 60% growth in the last 60 days.

XRPL with all latest updates and EVM side chain integration shows results of over $200 million in RWA and a 34% monthly growth rate.

The XRPL is undergoing developments aimed at enhancing its capacity for scalable, secure, and compliant decentralized finance (DeFi). As part of this ecosystem, DeXRP is introduced as the first high-performance decentralized exchange designed specifically for the XRPL.

After just a few months of presale activity, DeXRP has already raised over $4.1 million, with nearly 80% of IDO tokens already sold. ICO is ongoing on: https://dexrp.org/CbPKdKhd2Ec 

What is DeXRP



DeXRP is aiming to become a go-to trading hub for the XRPL community, combining AMM and Order Book trading with an advanced LP system and transparent voting system for holders.

With the token listing scheduled for launch soon, over 4500 investors have already participated in the IDO. The DeXRP team announced unique features for early investors like a Dynamic Fee mechanism, access to premium Liquidity Pools, an Auction for discounted trading slots, and premium pairs. 

The current $DXP token price is $0.05285, and the listing price will be $0.35. Users can purchase $DXP tokens via Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or via USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions.

$DXP Utility and Tokenomics 



DeXRP is focused on a utility-first approach to provide a stable ecosystem for liquidity providers, traders, institutional investors, and XRPL DeFi platforms. 

The protocol features optimized liquidity aggregation, giving LP token holders access to fee auctions, governance rights, and early access to exclusive trading pools. The platform introduces customizable yield multipliers, allowing providers to adjust rewards in line with their selected lock durations and risk preferences, offering a flexible framework for yield optimization.

DeXRP's tokenomics are built for a sustainable, long-term ecosystem growth: 

While XRPL onchain TVL rose from 20M to 100M in 8 months, DeXRP is planning a $DXP listing and project launch by Q4 this year.

The US Congress is debating the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a digital form of the dollar issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a CBDC would be government-controlled.

Facing concerns about potential government overreach, Republican lawmakers are advocating against a US CBDC through the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.” Sponsored by Congressman Tom Emmer, the bill aims to prevent the government from monitoring citizens' financial transactions.

Emmer argues that a CBDC could be weaponized for surveillance. The House Financial Services Committee recently passed the bill with a 27-22 vote, signaling significant opposition to the concept within Congress. The future of a US CBDC remains uncertain as lawmakers grapple with balancing innovation and privacy concerns.

- Ukraine's NBU supports crypto legalization but prohibits its use as legal tender, calling it a ""red line"" to preserve monetary control and regulatory oversight.

- The bank is developing an e-hryvnia CBDC through a pilot project, emphasizing alignment with international standards like the Digital Euro initiative and global central bank collaboration.

- A proposed law allows Bitcoin inclusion in national reserves, though the NBU prioritizes regulatory compliance and risk mitigation over crypto adoption as fiat alternatives.

- The NBU advocates transparent legal frameworks to ""de-shadow"" digital assets, aiming to strengthen Ukraine's financial reputation while maintaining stability under martial law.

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has indicated a willingness to support the legalization of cryptocurrencies, but with clear limitations. NBU Governor Andriy Pyshnyy has stated that virtual assets should not be recognized as a means of payment in the country, calling it a “red line” for the central bank [1]. He emphasized that the use of crypto as legal tender could undermine the effectiveness of monetary instruments and erode the bank's regulatory oversight [1]. Pyshnyy reiterated that any legal framework for digital assets must align with international standards, including those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and European Union regulations, to ensure financial integrity and prevent circumvention of currency controls [1].

Despite these restrictions, the NBU is actively exploring the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bank is currently in the process of designing the e-hryvnia and preparing for a pilot project in collaboration with a technological partner [1]. Pyshnyy highlighted the importance of learning from international CBDC initiatives, particularly the Digital Euro project, and noted that the NBU is engaging with major global central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bundesbank, and Bank of France [1]. The pilot aims to generate sufficient insights to inform the broader implementation of the e-hryvnia, which is viewed as a strategic step in Ukraine's digital financial transformation [1].

Governor Pyshnyy also emphasized the need for the ""de-shadowing"" of digital assets, suggesting that a transparent legal framework could enhance Ukraine's reputation within the international financial community [1]. However, he made it clear that the NBU does not see cryptocurrencies as a substitute for fiat currency or as a tool to bypass existing financial regulations, particularly under the country's current martial law [1]. The central bank's cautious approach reflects a broader trend among central banks globally, which are seeking to harness the benefits of digital currencies without compromising financial stability [1].

The NBU's stance is further supported by a recent legislative proposal from Ukrainian lawmakers, which would allow the central bank to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in its national reserves [1]. This development indicates a growing recognition of crypto's potential role in the financial system, though the NBU's official position remains focused on ensuring regulatory compliance and minimizing risks associated with digital asset volatility [1].

As the e-hryvnia pilot moves forward, the NBU will continue to monitor developments in the global crypto and CBDC landscape, seeking to balance innovation with oversight. The bank's approach suggests a preference for a stable, government-backed digital currency over the decentralized and speculative nature of private cryptocurrencies, aligning with its broader mission to maintain monetary stability and financial security [1].

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published yesterday a Fintech Note that examines technology solutions for enabling CBDC operations in environments with limited or no connectivity. A key take-away is that solutions using virtual secure elements, such as Crunchfish Digital Cash, are secure and scalable, whereas hardware-based solution are challenging to scale. As the IMF Fintech Note gives only a light touch on many other aspects that make an offline solution implementable, two of the co-authors of the IMF Fintech Note have also published a follow-up note that describe Crunchfish Digital Cash as an implementable layer-2 solution for CBDC systems.



 



The IMF published yesterday a Fintech Note that examines technology solutions for enabling CBDC operations in environments with limited or no connectivity. Like many other papers that cover offline payments, the IMF Fintech Note focused mainly on wallet-to-wallet considerations and gives only a light touch to other aspects that determines how implementable a solution is in practice. The IMF Fintech Note did establish in Table 2 that offline payment solutions using virtual secure elements are secure and scalable, whereas hardware-based solutions are costly and challenging to distribute and upgrade. 

 

Two of the co-authors of the IMF Fintech Note, have also published an add-on note that describes Crunchfish Digital Cash Layer-2 solution as a viable augmentation to any CBDC payment system with its novel packet-switched architecture delivered by a secure, scalable, interoperable, and cost-effective architecture. 

 

“It is very encouraging to see many respected payments professionals warming up to the merits of Crunchfish Digital Cash as a layer-2 solution augmenting the underlying layer-1 CBDC payment system with desired features. It is designed to respect the roles and responsibilities of payment networks and service providers. Whereas payment service providers equip users with Wallets to initiate and make payments, payment networks need Terminals and Gateways to receive and accept payments. This clear separation allows for flexibility, scalability, and healthy market competition by ecosystem participants and protects the integrity of the CBDC payment system from Wallet transactions initiated off the central ledger”, says Joachim Samuelsson, Crunchfish CEO.

A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump will allow retirement accounts to include alternative investments, including cryptocurrency. This could mean employees making elections in their 401(k) could soon see an option for digital currency investments.

“What this may do is allow a plan sponsor to include some of these riskier asset classes in the 401(k),” said Barry Glassman, president of Virginia-based Glassman Wealth Services.

Glassman said with the executive order, the Department of Labor would redefine what asset classes are acceptable.

“In the past, we've seen stocks, we've seen bonds, U.S. foreign, large cap, small cap, and some alternative strategies, but nothing as different as private equity and cryptocurrency,” he said.

For those unfamiliar with crypto, Glassman said it should be thought of more as “a collectible” than something like a stock.

“It's more similar to things like gold and silver and bottles of wine than it is to stocks and bonds,” Glassman said.

But some of the allure of the digital asset is its utility, meaning it doesn't present the same difficulties of moving gold around with you. With crypto, such as Bitcoin, it lives on the blockchain and can be used anywhere around the globe.

Glassman said for the companies that roll out the crypto options, your choices will probably be the big players, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

“I doubt plan sponsors will go deep into ‘meme coins' or anything like that,” Glassman said.

For those who may choose to put a portion of their retirement into the digital realm, Glassman said he believes younger investors in their 20s and 30s will lead the charge.

“They're used to it, and the idea that their retirement account may build up over time, and may, in fact, be their largest asset at some point,” he said. “It behooves them to have it available in a retirement account.”

One benefit for those who want to invest in crypto is there may be tax advantages for including them in their 401(k), because, like stocks, you would only face taxes when you pull your money out.

“So, if people invest in Bitcoin and it goes up in value and they sell within their 401(k), they're not taxed on it,” Glassman said.

If available down the road to employees, Glassman said he doesn't believe everyone will go in heavy on cryptocurrency in their retirement accounts.

“The amount of crypto owned within retirement accounts, in my opinion, will still be relatively small compared to the amount of crypto out there in nonretirement accounts,” he said of the future under the executive order.

Glassman said there is another concern — people not waiting until the right time to invest in crypto.

“My concern is with crypto trading near all-time highs, there's a far greater chance that people are interested and if this was available today, in 401(k)s, they would plow into it today, versus maybe a time when it dips,” Glassman said.

On July 18 the GENIUS Act, with bipartisan support, was signed into law by President Trump. The law reinforces U.S. soft power by securing dollar-pegged stablecoins as the dominant reserve and transactional digital currency.

But as we embrace this latest digital innovation, we cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: Cash remains vital to America's economic stability, individual freedom and national security. While digital payments offer convenience, preserving cash is a matter of inclusion, resilience, privacy and choice. 

Over the last 50 years, Americans have gradually transitioned from cash to digital payments — without fully considering the costs. Credit cards entered the mainstream in the 1970s, transforming what had once been cost-free transactions into exchanges resulting in third-party fees. Today, roughly 85% of consumer purchases in the U.S. involve digital transactions — using credit and debit cards and payment apps — which often come with swipe fees, processing charges and high interest rates.

Additionally, the collection and sale of consumer data from these digital payments has become a lucrative secondary industry. We've sleepwalked into a system where we not only pay more to use our own money, but in the interest of convenience, we also relinquish a degree of privacy and control over our financial lives. 

Digital payments involve serious risks, too. They depend on a vulnerable infrastructure: power grids, internet connectivity, cloud servers and telecommunications. Software failures and natural disasters can, and regularly do, disrupt this system. And both credit card fraud and identity theft — vulnerabilities that cash payments mitigate — continue to rise. Finally, increasing incidents of state-sponsored cyber-attacks that impact our digital payment infrastructure present a grave concern.

Under these scenarios, if retailers no longer accept cash, Americans would be unable to access food, fuel or medicine while digital payment systems are inoperable. Several countries have already acted to avoid this risk. Norway, Belgium and France require retailers to accept cash. Others like the Netherlands, Ireland and Australia are advancing similar protections. 

But cash is also essential even in normal times. According to Federal Reserve data, a higher percentage of rural households are unbanked compared to urban areas. Many more lack reliable broadband to access banking services. Nationwide, over 25 million households are unbanked or underbanked, disproportionately affecting minorities, seniors and low-income communities. For them, cash is not a preference — it's a necessity. 

Cash also offers privacy protections and more control. It facilitates anonymous, permissionless transactions. There's no tracking, no algorithms and no surprise fees. Another benefit is that cash helps consumers avoid overspending and debt traps, including the mounting risks associated with “buy now, pay later” plans and high-interest credit products. 

According to the Federal Reserve's 2025 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, cash makes up 14% of retail transactions, which translates to about $683 billion worth of retail purchases in cash. Also, over 90% of Americans still want the option to use cash.

This broad support spans political lines, regions, ages, ethnicities and income levels. And it means that even people who rarely use cash do not want to see “Cash Not Accepted Here” signs at stores, restaurants and, most recently, even at our National Parks.  

While 12 states and several cities have passed laws to protect cash, the result is a confusing patchwork with unintended consequences including compliance challenges and costs. That's why, together with Rep. Donald Norcross (D-NJ), I introduced the bipartisan Payment Choice Act in the House. On July 17, Senators John Fetterman (D-PA) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) introduced the Act in the Senate.

This legislation would create a consistent national standard, requiring retailers to accept cash for purchases under $500, with a few appropriate exceptions. 

Protecting the right to use cash isn't about resisting innovation. It's about ensuring freedom, fairness, privacy, preparedness and choice while we also adopt creative digital payment options like stablecoins. Supporting cash is also not ideological — it's practical, principled and something nearly all Americans want.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","What's fueling the current buzz around crypto payroll and tech workers?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/whats-next-for-bitcoin-and-ether-breaking-resistance-levels-and-the-future-of-crypto-payroll","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 16:32:50 GMT","

With the ongoing surge in crypto prices, tech workers are increasingly requesting to be compensated in Bitcoin and other digital currencies, leading to speculations about the future of salary structures in the industry. Some companies are now offering the option to receive salaries in digital assets, a trend likely to gain traction as the crypto market evolves.

The desire for cryptocurrency payments stems from several factors. Firstly, many tech workers are early adopters and investors in digital assets, making them eager to align their earnings with their investments. Secondly, some employees see this as a hedge against inflation and traditional financial systems. Lastly, the allure of crypto's rapid growth and potential for significant returns is undeniably appealing.

Crypto payroll solutions promise reduced transaction costs, faster processing times, and flexible payment options for employees. By leveraging stablecoins, these platforms can ensure that employees are compensated in a stable currency, thereby mitigating the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies.

The trend of tech workers opting for crypto payroll has the potential to further drive demand for digital currencies, especially if a significant portion of workers begins to receive their salaries in these assets. This could lead to increased buying pressure, positively impacting market prices.

Despite the advantages, there are challenges to consider. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as more companies adopt these solutions, and managing the technical infrastructure to support crypto payroll can be complex. Furthermore, navigating the tax implications of receiving salaries in cryptocurrencies can be tricky for both employers and employees.

As more companies adopt crypto payroll systems and the infrastructure supporting them improves, it's likely that the trend will continue to grow. However, the sustainability of this trend will depend on the broader market conditions and regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Overall, the future of crypto salaries remains uncertain but undoubtedly intriguing.

North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals have harnessed artificial intelligence (AI) tools to develop an upgraded Python malware variant targeting technology, finance and cryptocurrency industry workers through elaborate fake job interview schemes, according to a new cybersecurity report.

In a blog post published on Wednesday by cloud-based malware analysis service ANY.RUN, threat intelligence analyst Mauro Eldritch assessed that the North Korean threat group Famous Chollima introduced new malware dubbed “PyLangGhost RAT” designed to steal sensitive data and cryptocurrency wallet information from browser extensions.

Hip-hop artists flip samples, hustle new business moves, and showcase innovation as an art. Creativity and creation is in its DNA, so it should come as no surprise that hip-hop is at the forefront of digital payments and cryptocurrency now as both integrate into daily life. ""New money"" has a new meaning, and hip-hop is shaping trends and showing the world how to rake in the money. What could it mean for the future?

The hip-hop community brings street smarts into the boardroom, and these days that is reflected in everything from Cash App shout-outs in lyrics to exclusive NFT drops. They are using this new technology for the old game of connecting with fans and getting paid, but digital wallets and peer-to-peer transfers are about ownership and independence. It's not just convenience; many users view it as a method of bypassing old-school gatekeepers so they can keep more of the pie.

You've probably seen headlines about Nas, Snoop Dogg and Megan Thee Stallion's crypto investments and partnerships. Some have dropped albums as NFTs so fans can share in the rewards. Digital money is infiltrating streaming royalties, brand endorsement and funding for independent artists. In some cases, you can see it changing how the deals get done in the first place.

Sure, crypto is influencing music sales, but it's also affecting live ticket sales, fashion drops and how fans engage with artists across all genres and platforms. Once you understand how blockchain technology works, you can see that its transparency and security are helping artists control their work in new ways. Blockchain can be helpful for tracking royalties, fighting piracy, and ensuring accountability in payments.

Crypto is helping hip-hop artists find new ways to make money off their brand, which also helps them take their brand to the next level. Think virtual concerts, digital collectibles and exclusive fan clubs that are supported by blockchain technology. For readers interested in the crypto's influence beyond music, bitcoin casinos show how crypto is revolutionizing entertainment platforms. Blockchain truly can connect fans wherever they are—in the virtual world or the real world—and turn connections into transactions.

The lines between entertainment, finance, and tech are dissolving so quickly that knowledge is the real currency. Consumer tips for cryptocurrency usage are essential reading for artists and fans alike. They need to understand the hype, risks, and rewards of crypto and blockchain technology so they don't get left behind.

It's an innovation in hip-hop, but it's not a passing trend. Some might even say digital payments and crypto are blueprints for the future. This technology enables artists to build wealth and fan bases more effectively while also protecting their work. They expect hip-hop to continue embracing digital money and hustling in the digital era.

XRP smashed resistance barriers as trading volume hit 300 million during peak institutional buying surge, with bullish chart patterns and a landmark legal resolution fueling upside bets.The rally combines technical breakout pressure with a significant shift in the token's fundamental narrative. The SEC settlement eliminates a multi-year litigation drag, potentially unlocking greater institutional participation in U.S. markets.

Price action shows heavy accumulation above $3.10, followed by consolidation above $3.30 — suggesting strong conviction among buyers even after the initial spike. The ETF filing from SBI adds a parallel demand driver, positioning XRP for higher beta moves if spot Bitcoin ETF inflows continue.

XRP explodes 11% higher in the 24-hour period ending August 8, rocketing from $2.99 to $3.30 in a blistering rally. The digital asset accelerates most aggressively between 19:00-22:00, obliterating multiple resistance levels. Trading volume erupts past 300 million at 21:00 alone. The session spans a $0.35 range, marking 12% volatility from $2.97 lows to $3.33 peaks. New resistance forms at $3.33. Strong demand emerges above $3.10 in the session's final hours.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have jointly ended their appeals in the high-profile XRP lawsuit, concluding a multi-year legal battle that has clouded the token's outlook since 2020.

In a Thursday filing, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the dismissal, with both sides agreeing to bear their own costs and fees.

“Following the Commission's vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple's chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on X.

The resolution removes a major regulatory overhang for XRP, coming alongside other bullish developments such as Japan's SBI Holdings filing to launch a Bitcoin-XRP ETF.

Another Hong Kong company is adding crypto to its treasury, but it wants to do more than passively hold it.

IVD Medical Holdings has purchased $19 million (HK$149 million) of ether (ETH), positioning the asset at the center of its real-world asset tokenization strategy. 

The company is building ivd.xyz, a platform for tokenizing pharmaceutical intellectual property and other healthcare assets, which will run entirely on Ethereum smart contracts.

In a statement to CoinDesk, Chief Strategy Officer Gary Deng said Ethereum was chosen as the core asset because it is “the world's most mature smart contract platform” with “extremely high liquidity” and growing institutional recognition, pointing to the U.S. SEC's approval of a spot ETH ETF.

IVD plans to use ETH for on-chain ownership confirmation, automated revenue distribution, and compliance governance of tokenized assets. 

It will also serve as the settlement layer for the company's planned IVDD stablecoin, enabling cross-border transactions within Hong Kong and U.S. compliance frameworks. Revenue from RWA transactions will be automatically converted into ETH and deposited into the treasury.

IVD also intends to deploy ETH into staking, re-staking, and on-chain derivatives to boost returns and liquidity while adding downside protection. The move puts IVD alongside a small group of HKEX-listed companies with crypto treasuries, most of which favor bitcoin BTC$116,475.75. 

Boyaa Interactive (0434.HK) holds more than 3,100 BTC worth over US$300 million after converting nearly all of its ether to bitcoin. Meitu (1357.HK) bought about 31,000 ETH and 940 BTC in 2021 before exiting those positions. 

Other smaller bitcoin holders include Yuxing InfoTech (8005.HK) with 78 BTC, Moon Inc. (1723.HK) with 18.88 BTC, and Walnut Capital (0905.HK) with 10 BTC from a shareholder donation.

IVD's move was made as part of a broader partnership announcement with HashKey Group, which operates the Hong Kong-licensed HashKey exchange.

Global risk appetite strengthened on Friday, with crypto, equities and gold futures all pushing higher, while oil headed for its steepest weekly decline since June.

Traders are balancing the tailwind from easing U.S.–Japan trade tensions against signals of cooling bitcoin BTC$116,490.80 demand and heavier hedging in crypto options markets.

In broader Asian markets, The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.5%, set for its fifth straight day of gains. Japan's Nikkei-225 jumped 2.3% after chief trade negotiator Hiroshi Suzuki said the US had agreed to end stacking on universal tariffs and cut car levies concurrently.

Oil prices slipped toward a weekly drop of more than 4%, with Brent and WTI under pressure from rising US inventories and weaker Chinese import data, per Bloomberg.

The total crypto market cap rose 3% to $3.76 trillion over the past 24 hours, led by major altcoins. Ether (ETH) gained 7.3% to $3,935, XRP XRP$3.2677 jumped 12% to $3.36, Solana SOL$177.66 added 4.7% to $175.19, and dogecoin DOGE$0.2261 climbed 8.8% to 22 cents. Bitcoin lagged with a 1.9% rise to $116,781 on $38.8 billion in daily volume.

FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said the rebound aligns with “growing appetite in the stock markets,” but warned that BTC is “trapped in a narrow range” between $112,000 support — the 50-day moving average and recent lows — and $120,000 resistance, defined by July highs and a psychological round number.

Meanwhile, Glassnode data signaled that BTC market sentiment has shifted from “euphoria” to “cooling off.” Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have fallen nearly 25%, network activity is down, and transaction fees have dropped.

Options positioning points to increased hedging for BTC below $100,000 into late August, which could act as insurance amid expectations of a continual summer lull.

 Trump's executive order opening 401(k)s to crypto has drawn a mix of praise, caution and criticism from industry leaders and skeptics alike. 

United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday opening the door for Americans to include crypto and other alternative assets in their 401(k) retirement accounts and other defined-contribution plans, a policy shift that has sparked optimism and caution from the crypto industry. 

Trump's executive order directs the US Labor Department to reevaluate restrictions on alternative assets like crypto, private equity and real estate in 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans.

As of the first quarter of 2025, US retirement assets totaled $43.4 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute and the Federal Reserve Board. Defined-contribution plans, including $8.7 trillion in 401(k)s, accounted for more than $12 trillion.

With billions of dollars potentially flowing into crypto, industry stakeholders shared their opinions and reactions to the executive order. 

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said that the change could transform the crypto markets by introducing a “slow, steady, consistent bid” from retirement contributions. “The result is higher returns and lower volatility,” Hougan added. 

Hougan also said that crypto belongs in the 401(k)s for some investors. “It's been the best-performing asset class in the world over the past decade, and it's well-positioned for the decade to come,” Hougan added. 

Crypto Council for Innovation CEO Ji Hun Kim said the decision affirmed digital assets' place in the US financial system. “Americans should have the opportunity and freedom to include these investments within their retirement plans,” Kim said.

Kim added that the CCI applauded the administration's continued commitment to clear policies to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.”

Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of compliance-focused blockchain platform ZIGChain, said the executive order will help build the infrastructure needed to support tokenized investment vehicles at scale. 

“The reason why this is important is because it connects with the broader regulatory clarity coming from Chairman Atkins's SEC leadership,” Gadit said. “We're starting to see a unified framework emerge.” 

Michael Heinrich, co-founder and CEO of 0G Labs, said the executive order is a “watershed moment” for crypto's integration into the financial system. However, he cautioned that the development could go both ways. 

“Done right, this could unlock trillions in retirement capital for Bitcoin and other compliant assets,” he said. “Done poorly, it risks political and financial backlash.”

Heinrich also highlighted that the details, such as which tokens would qualify, how custody is handled and what guardrails will be in place, are crucial. 

Joshua Krüger, head of growth at the dEURO Association, said the main short-term beneficiary is likely to be Bitcoin (BTC). With BTC having the strongest institutional acceptance, he predicts that it will be the first to be integrated into regulated pension products. 

“Asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton are already lined up with corresponding offerings,” Krüger said. 

He said altcoins and smaller crypto projects will likely only benefit in the medium term as they require resilient structures, including regulated products, reliable standards and increased trust from institutions. 

Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman agreed that the scale of the US retirement market could set a precedent for legitimizing crypto, but also warned of potential pitfalls. 

While Breitman supports giving savers more investment choices, he added that many investors could make poor allocation decisions. 

“Private assets could trade off illiquidity for higher returns, which fits the long horizon of a retirement account,” Breitman said. 

“However, in practice, it rarely plays that well — high fees, hard-to-determine pricing, and manager manipulation to mask volatility are common problems.”

Not everyone in the financial world welcomed the news. Gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff warned that the development could worsen what he sees as a dire retirement savings gap in the US. 

“Most Americans have saved far less than needed to have any hope of retirement,” Schiff wrote on X. “By allowing Americans to gamble what little retirement savings they have in their 401(k)s on Bitcoin and other cryptos, Trump just made this problem much worse!”

 Bitcoin's energy-based “fair value” sits at $167K, 45% above its current price, as record hash rate data shows BTC trading at a deep 31% discount. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is heavily undervalued vs its “fair” price based on miner output.

The Energy Value metric calculates that BTC should be trading at almost $170,000.

Bitcoin is further from its energy value now than when it passed $10,000 for the final time in September 2020.

Bitcoin (BTC) should trade at as much as $167,800 per coin if price matched its “energy value,” said the founder of crypto asset manager Capriole Investments.

In an X post Thursday, Charles Edwards calculated that Bitcoin's true value is about 45% higher than its current $116,000.

Bitcoin miners hold the key to a hyper-bullish BTC price prognosis that calls for BTC/USD to rise almost 50%.

Bitcoin's “Energy Value” metric, created by Capriole in 2019, argued that Bitcoin's correct price, or “fair value,” is “a function of energy input, supply growth rate and a constant representing the fiat dollar value of energy.”

While this means that BTC/USD should be zero if miners were to stop participating in the network entirely, current record hashrates show that Bitcoin is anything but worthless.

Data from onchain analytics platform Glassnode put the current hashrate — the combined processing power dedicated to the network by miners — at 1.031 zettahashes per second (ZH/s), with its latest all-time highs coming on Aug. 4.

“Hash Rates are flying and Bitcoin Energy Value just hit $145K,” Edwards said, referring to the metric's simple moving average (SMA). 

Bitcoin's Energy Value has reached as much as $167,800. Network fundamentals now contrast considerably with price, which has dipped by almost 10% since its record peak last month.

“We are trading at a deeper discount to value today at $116K, than when Bitcoin was at $10K in September 2020,” Edwards added.

As Cointelegraph reported, many market participants have said the current Bitcoin bull run has just months to go.

This gives BTC price precious little time to match its Energy Value rating, which would fall if miners were to reduce the amount of energy they employ.

“Consistent energy input represents a balance between supply and demand. Rising market prices incentivize increased energy input via hash power growth and technology improvements which result in greater energy efficiencies,” Capriole said in an introduction to the metric. 

Bitcoin's Hash Ribbons metric continues to reinforce a healthy outlook for both miners and price performance after its latest “buy signal” flashed in late July.

Positive climate action can have cascading effects.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

To live in an era of anthropogenic climate change is to be constantly reminded of the warming threat to our planet. One way scientists illustrate this threat is by using climate tipping points, also known as planetary boundaries, which showcase around nine critical ecological thresholds that could have devastating effects for life on Earth once crossed. These include things like biosphere integrity, ozone depletion, ocean acidification, and a relative newcomer known as “aquatic deoxygenation.” 

Although these thresholds are discussed with deadly seriousness, scientists wonder if the reverse of these doom-and-gloom thresholds—positive tipping points, if you will—could help encourage people, communities, and countries to adopt more aggressive green policies. In a new study, published in the journal Sustainability Science, experts from the University of Exeter in the U.K. explain these positive tipping points would be moments in society's adoption of green technologies or behaviors that could perpetuate a cascade of positive outcomes. 

The goal of this new paper is to design a methodology for identifying possible positive tipping points, understand how close we are to achieving these tipping points, identify what factors (both positive and negative) can influence them, and suggest what actions could be done to trigger them.

“The challenge now is to identify potential positive tipping points, and the actions that can bring them forward—while avoiding wishful thinking about their existence, or oversimplification of their nature, drivers, and impacts,” Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter said in a press statement. “The global economy is decarbonizing at least five times too slowly to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius.”

The good news is that we're not starting from zero. Thankfully, we're already well on our way to achieving some of these tipping points. For example, the widespread adoption of wind and solar energy over the past few decades has both increased renewable energy generation and driven investment into those industries, which in turn has lowered the once pricey costs of these technologies. The study also mentions that things like the widespread adoption (at least, in the U.K.) of heat pumps may be considered a tipping point more broadly, and that even certain changes in societal behaviors could be under consideration. 

“Other transformations—such as a major shift away from meat consumption—might also be more likely than they appear,” Steve Smith from the University of Exeter said in a press statement. “In other sectors there is little sign of approaching tipping points and in a few, such as nuclear power and concrete production, we should not expect there to be tipping points at all.”

The researchers invite other scientists to help refine the parameters of these positive tipping points—what the team called “antidotes” to the gloomy atmosphere that typically pervades the climate change conversation. While the planetary red flags are immensely important for us to keep our eye on, it also helps to put in place actionable climate goals that can help us make the planet a healthy one for generations to come.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New “evolution engine” creates super-proteins 100,000x faster","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250807233038.htm","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:00:45 GMT","

In medicine and biotechnology, the ability to evolve proteins with new or improved functions is crucial, but current methods are often slow and laborious. Now, Scripps Research scientists have developed a synthetic biology platform that accelerates evolution itself -- enabling researchers to evolve proteins with useful, new properties thousands of times faster than nature. The system, named T7-ORACLE, was described in Science on August 7, 2025, and represents a breakthrough in how researchers can engineer therapeutic proteins for cancer, neurodegeneration and essentially any other disease area.

""This is like giving evolution a fast-forward button,"" says co-senior author Pete Schultz, the President and CEO of Scripps Research, where he also holds the L.S. ""Sam"" Skaggs Presidential Chair. ""You can now evolve proteins continuously and precisely inside cells without damaging the cell's genome or requiring labor-intensive steps.""

Directed evolution is a laboratory process that involves introducing mutations and selecting variants with improved function over multiple cycles. It's used to tailor proteins with desired properties, such as highly selective, high-affinity antibodies, enzymes with new specificities or catalytic properties, or to investigate the emergence of resistance mutations in drug targets. However, traditional methods often require repeated rounds of DNA manipulation and testing with each round taking a week or more. Systems for continuous evolution -- where proteins evolve inside living cells without manual intervention -- aim to streamline this process by enabling simultaneous mutation and selection with each round of cell division (roughly 20 minutes for bacteria). But existing approaches have been limited by technical complexity or modest mutation rates.

T7-ORACLE circumvents these bottlenecks by engineering E. coli bacteria -- a standard model organism in molecular biology -- to host a second, artificial DNA replication system derived from bacteriophage T7, a virus that infects bacteria and has been widely studied for its simple, efficient replication system. T7-ORACLE enables continuous hypermutation and accelerated evolution of biomacromolecules, and is designed to be broadly applicable to many protein targets and biological challenges. Conceptually, T7-ORACLE builds on and extends efforts on existing orthogonal replication systems -- meaning they operate separately from the cell's own machinery -- such as OrthoRep in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and EcORep in E. coli. In comparison to these systems, T7-ORACLE benefits from the combination of high mutagenesis, fast growth, high transformation efficiency, and the ease with which both the E. coli host and the circular replicon plasmid can be integrated into standard molecular biology workflows.

The T-7 ORACLE orthogonal system targets only plasmid DNA (small, circular pieces of genetic material), leaving the cell's host genome untouched. By engineering T7 DNA polymerase (a viral enzyme that replicates DNA) to be error-prone, the researchers introduced mutations into target genes at a rate 100,000 times higher than normal without damaging the host cells.

""This system represents a major advance in continuous evolution,"" says co-senior author Christian Diercks, an assistant professor of chemistry at Scripps Research. ""Instead of one round of evolution per week, you get a round each time the cell divides -- so it really accelerates the process.""

To demonstrate the power of T7-ORACLE, the research team inserted a common antibiotic resistance gene, TEM-1 β-lactamase, into the system and exposed the E. coli cells to escalating doses of various antibiotics. In less than a week, the system evolved versions of the enzyme that could resist antibiotic levels up to 5,000 times higher than the original. This proof-of-concept demonstrated not only T7-ORACLE's speed and precision, but also its real-world relevance by replicating how resistance develops in response to antibiotics.

""The surprising part was how closely the mutations we saw matched real-world resistance mutations found in clinical settings,"" notes Diercks. ""In some cases, we saw new combinations that worked even better than those you would see in a clinic.""

But Diercks emphasizes that the study isn't focused on antibiotic resistance per se.

""This isn't a paper about TEM-1 β-lactamase,"" he explains. ""That gene was just a well-characterized benchmark to show how the system works. What matters is that we can now evolve virtually any protein, like cancer drug targets and therapeutic enzymes, in days instead of months.""

The broader potential of T7-ORACLE lies in its adaptability as a platform for protein engineering. Although the system is built into E. coli, the bacterium serves primarily as a vessel for continuous evolution. Scientists can insert genes from humans, viruses or other sources into plasmids, which are then introduced into E. coli cells. T7-ORACLE mutates these genes, generating variant proteins that can be screened or selected for improved function. Because E. coli is easy to grow and widely used in labs, it provides a convenient, scalable system for evolving virtually any protein of interest.

This could help scientists more rapidly evolve antibodies to target specific cancers, evolve more effective therapeutic enzymes, and design proteases that target proteins involved in cancer and neurodegenerative disease.

""What's exciting is that it's not limited to one disease or one kind of protein,"" says Diercks. ""Because the system is customizable, you can drop in any gene and evolve it toward whatever function you need.""

Moreover, T7-ORACLE works with standard E. coli cultures and widely used lab workflows, avoiding the complex protocols required by other continuous evolution systems.

""The main thing that sets this apart is how easy it is to implement,"" adds Diercks. ""There's no specialized equipment or expertise required. If you already work with E. coli, you can probably use this system with minimal adjustments.""

T7-ORACLE reflects Schultz's broader goal: to rebuild key biological processes -- such as DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein translation -- so they function independently of the host cell. This separation allows scientists to reprogram these processes without disrupting normal cellular activity. By decoupling fundamental processes from the genome, tools like T7-ORACLE help advance synthetic biology.

""In the future, we're interested in using this system to evolve polymerases that can replicate entirely unnatural nucleic acids: synthetic molecules that resemble DNA and RNA but with novel chemical properties,"" says Diercks. ""That would open up possibilities in synthetic genomics that we're just beginning to explore.""

Currently, the research team is focused on evolving human-derived enzymes for therapeutic use, and on tailoring proteases to recognize specific cancer-related protein sequences.

""The T7-ORACLE approach merges the best of both worlds,"" says Schultz. ""We can now combine rational protein design with continuous evolution to discover functional molecules more efficiently than ever.""

In addition to Diercks and Schultz, authors of the study, ""An orthogonal T7 replisome for continuous hypermutation and accelerated evolution in E. coli,"" are Philipp Sondermann, Cynthia Rong, Thomas G. Gillis, Yahui Ban, Celine Wang and David A. Dik of Scripps Research.

Scientists have discovered that jewel wasps can slow down their biological rate of aging.

A study of jewel wasps, known for their distinctive metallic colors, has shown that they can undergo a kind of natural 'time-out' as larvae before emerging into adulthood with this surprising advantage.

The groundbreaking study by scientists at the University of Leicester, has now been published in the journal, PNAS. It reveals that this pause in development within the wasp dramatically extends lifespan and decelerates the ticking of the so-called ""epigenetic clock"" that marks molecular aging.

Aging isn't just about counting birthdays, it's also a biological process that leaves molecular fingerprints on our DNA. One of the most accurate markers of this process is the epigenetic clock, which tracks chemical changes in DNA, known as methylation, that accumulate with age. But what happens if we alter the course of development itself?

To find out, a team at the University of Leicester including first author PhD student Erin Foley, Dr Christian Thomas, Professor Charalambos Kyriacou, and Professor Eamonn Mallon, from the department of Genetics, Genomics and Cancer Sciences, turned to Nasonia Vitripennis, also known as the jewel wasp.

This tiny insect is becoming a powerful model for aging research because, unlike many other invertebrates, it has a functioning DNA methylation system, just like humans, and a short lifespan that makes it ideal to study.

The researchers exposed jewel wasp mothers to cold and darkness, triggering a hibernation-like state in their babies called diapause. This natural ""pause button"" extended the offsprings' adult lifespan by over a third. Even more remarkably, the wasps that had gone through diapause aged 29% more slowly at the molecular level than their counterparts. Their epigenetic clocks ticked more leisurely, offering the first direct evidence that the pace of biological aging can be developmentally tuned in an invertebrate.

""It's like the wasps who took a break early in life came back with extra time in the bank,"" said Evolutionary Biology Professor Eamonn Mallon, senior author on the study.

""It shows that aging isn't set in stone, it can be slowed by the environment, even before adulthood begins.""

While some animals can slow aging in dormant states, this study is the first to show that the benefits can persist after development resumes. What's more, the molecular slowdown wasn't just a random effect, it was linked to changes in key biological pathways that are conserved across species, including those involved in insulin and nutrient sensing. These same pathways are being targeted by anti-aging interventions in humans.

What makes this study novel and surprising is that it demonstrates a long-lasting, environmentally triggered slowdown of aging in a system that's both simple and relevant to human biology. It offers compelling evidence that early life events can leave lasting marks not just on health, but on the pace of biological aging itself.

Professor Mallon added: ""Understanding how and why aging happens is a major scientific challenge. This study opens up new avenues for research, not just into the biology of wasps, but into the broader question of whether we might one day design interventions to slow aging at its molecular roots. With its genetic tools, measurable aging markers, and clear link between development and lifespan, Nasonia vitripennis is now a rising star in aging research.

""In short, this tiny wasp may hold big answers to how we can press pause on aging.""

Fatty diets and obesity affect the structure and function of astrocytes1, the star-shaped brain cells located in the striatum, a brain region involved in the perception of pleasure generated by food consumption. What is even more surprising is that by manipulating these astrocytes in vivo in mice can influence metabolism and correct certain cognitive changes associated with obesity (ability to relearn a task, for example). These results, described by scientists from the CNRS2 and the Université Paris Cité, were recently published in the journal Nature Communication.

These discoveries reinforce the idea that astrocytes (long neglected in favour of neurons) play a key role in brain function. They also demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of astrocytes to restore cognitive function in the context of obesity, opening up new avenues of research to identify their exact role in energy metabolism.

These conclusions were reached using a combination of ex vivo and in vivo approaches in rodents, including chemogenetic techniques3, brain imaging, locomotion tests, cognitive behaviour and measuring the body's energy metabolism.

Chinese researchers have recently challenged the long-held belief that ""all life depends on sunlight."" In a study published in Science Advances, the researchers identified how microbes in deep subsurface areas can derive energy from chemical reactions driven by crustal faulting, offering critical insights into life deep below Earth's surface.

The research was led by Prof. Hongping he, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and Prof. Jianxi Zhu, both from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry of CAS.

Long regarded as inhospitable to life due to the absence of sunlight and organic matter, the deep subsurface has in recent years been found to host a large-scale, highly active biosphere teeming with diverse microorganisms. These microbes derive energy from abiotic redox reactions during water–rock interactions. Hydrogen (H2) serves as their main energy source and oxidants are also essential for metabolic activities, but their origins were not previously well understood.

To tackle this mystery, the research team simulated crustal faulting activities and discovered that free radicals produced during rock fracturing can decompose water, generating both hydrogen and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These substances create a distinct redox gradient within fracture systems, which can further react with iron (Fe) in groundwater and rocks—oxidizing ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺) or reducing ferric iron (Fe³⁺) to ferrous iron (Fe²⁺), depending on local redox conditions.

In microbe-rich fractures, hydrogen production driven by earthquake-related faulting was found to be up to 100,000 times greater than that from other known pathways, such as serpentinization and radiolysis. The team demonstrated that this process effectively drives iron's redox cycle, which in turn influences the geochemical processes of elements like carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur—sustaining microbial metabolism in the deep biosphere.

This study sheds new light on the energy sources and ecological diversity of the deep-subsurface biosphere. Profs. He and Zhu also noted that fracture systems on other Earth-like planets could potentially provide habitable conditions for extraterrestrial life, offering a new avenue for the search for life beyond Earth.

The study was financially supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars and the Strategic Priority Research Program of CAS, among other sources.

One morning in 2009, Jacqueline Tabler woke up with the solution to a laboratory problem that had been plaguing her for months. She got out of bed, grabbed her notebook, and started sketching out an experiment that had come to her in a dream.

Tabler, then a developmental-biology PhD student at King's College London, was struggling to reproduce data using methods from previous work in the lab that had shown the function of an enzyme, called PAR-1, in the development of frog embryos. She had the idea to perform a grafting experiment, taking a layer of cells expressing excess PAR-1 from one embryo and transplanting them onto an embryo that does not express the enzyme. By comparing these grafted embryos with control grafts expressing typical levels of PAR1, Tabler hoped to see what happened to the cells as the embryos created neurons.

“It was a fantastical answer,” she says. “I knew what I had to do was graft from one embryo to another embryo, follow the tissue, and then I would figure it out.”

Tabler, who now leads a group at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, ran the grafting experiment and noticed that there was a higher-than-expected amount of PAR-1-expressing cells in certain layers of the embryos. From this, she and the lab team realized that PAR-1 had a previously unknown function controlling the orientation of cell division. The results were published in 2010 in Development1.

Tabler says that she took a risk approaching her supervisor with the idea for a different experiment when she was meant to be running those that she had been assigned, but now sees how this kind of creative risk-taking can make you a successful lab leader. “I had to learn that what set me apart — my curiosity and creativity — was positive,” she explains. In other words, it “was a feature, not a bug”.

Learning how to be creative while an early-career scientist is important, Tabler says. However, she acknowledges that as a PhD student or postdoc, often working on a predefined project with strict timelines, deliverables and reports, it can be hard to see where the space is for creativity.

Tabler spoke about her experiences of creativity in science at the (In)Credible Research Conference 2024. The two-day event in Berlin last October discussed whether creativity is a valued aspect of scientific work, and how it can be nurtured at the early-career stage.

 From the discussions, “the most striking result is the disparity between how important creativity is for science versus how much opportunity and value is given to it within the research environment”, says Ian Erik Stewart, a neuroscientist at the Free University Berlin, and part of the team of early-career researchers who organized the conference. When attendees were polled, the majority regarded creativity as essential for research breakthroughs. But 81% reported encountering barriers in pursuing creative or unconventional ideas owing to a variety of structural issues, including publication, funding and supervisor pressures.

Biomedical scientist Itai Yanai, at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, thinks that the scientific culture has sidelined much creativity in favour of getting “the right fellowships and good publications”.

“The system of science is not really rewarding creativity,” says Yanai. “We have this situation, in which to advance your career as a scientist, creativity becomes a liability. It does pay off eventually, but that assumes you can survive in the business long enough.”

But defining creativity is hard. There was agreement at the Berlin conference that creativity in science is the intersection of something that is new and also worthy of pursuit, as theorized by science philosopher Julia Sánchez-Dorado in a 2023 study2.

Shunichi Kasahara, a computer scientist at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo and at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, thinks that creativity in research is “the ability to observe, iterate and extract meaningful insights from experiences”.

Whatever the definition, it's widely agreed that personal experiences shape creativity. Tabler attributes her creative breakthrough to embracing a non-linear way of approaching problems, and to discussions with a postdoc in her lab at the time who was running a similar experiment. “Creativity, for me, is drawing from my own experience with my environment and my colleagues, as well as using the way my brain processes information,” she says.

“The biggest takeaway from the talks, in terms of individual activities that you can undertake to improve or engage your own creativity, is to experience very widely,” says neuroscientist and conference co-organizer Leandre Ravatt at the Charité – Berlin University of Medicine and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Berlin. “A lot of early-career researchers feel that they're often pigeonholing themselves into a specialization,” Ravatt explains, “often focusing really strongly on the literature of their field.”

“What we learnt from the conference is that if you do this, you're actually blocking out a lot of avenues for creativity. The biggest recommendation was to read from other fields; go to talks from other fields,” she says.

Investing in her science-communication skills — for example, by writing and editing for a student science magazine — has also taught Ravatt “a lot of different ways to look at the same problem”. When communicating your own science, try “to find a new creative angle, and play around with the conceptual models that are in your work”, suggests Stewart. Or keep it simple, and “just go to the beer hour in your institute”, he advises. “Meet people and then try to inspire them about what you're doing. By doing so, you'll make everything way more fun for yourself as well,” says Stewart.

Time pressures on early-career researchers mean that there is a limit to how much they can do. Ravatt says that if institutions “want to encourage more interdisciplinary or creative thinking, they need to create the spaces for these sorts of transdisciplinary encounter”.

Martin Lercher, a computational cell biologist at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany, thinks that creativity should be a focus of university curricula. “Implicitly, of course, a lot of people get some training on creativity from interactions with their supervisors during their PhD,” says Lercher. “But it's just so much more efficient if there is some formal background to that, some theory, some structure,” he says.

Yanai and Lercher think that it is useful to see the creative side of science as distinct from the rest of it, a dichotomy nicknamed night-and-day science. The concept was originally outlined by French biologist and Nobel prizewinner François Jacob3. “Day science is the executive part. You have the idea and to test it, you do controlled experiments,” says Yanai. “Night science is the world of creativity, the world of ideas. In night science we don't talk about the specifics of the experiment, instead, we use the language of metaphors and anthropomorphisms,” he explains. “We're advocating to first of all recognize that there's a night-science world. Once you recognize that, you realize we need training just as much in this world,” Yanai says.

Yanai and Lercher have created a website containing free materials for educators to help them teach the importance of the creative process, with tips and tricks that stimulate creativity. One of Lercher's favourite questions to ask is, ‘why would the cell do something so crazy?'.

Abubakar Salim has a lot of beef with Hollywood—and he's getting it off his chest in his latest video game. The actor, known for his roles as Alyn of Hull on House of the Dragon and Father in Raised By Wolves, has been balancing his time between the big screen and gaming, two industries that have been affected by a slew of similar issues: long hours, shrinking jobs, abuse of power, and, more recently, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence use and generative AI.

Salim's sophomore game, Dead Take, is a story of Hollywood, ambition, and exploitation, dressed up as a horror game that takes aim at his industry's problems, from corruption to AI use. “Hollywood is pure horror,” Salim says.

Dead Take is a firm departure from his debut game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau. Where Zau told a vibrant, heartfelt story about grief, Dead Take is a psychological thriller set in the dark rooms of a Hollywood mansion. After his friend Vinny goes missing, struggling actor Chase breaks into the home of the industry's hottest director, Duke Cain, in search of clues. The game is an escape room by way of home invasion; room-by-room puzzles unlock more areas of the house, whether that means digging through bedrooms and closets, or navigating a poolhouse. Duke's domain is littered with clues about a lost child and a failed marriage, along with hints about how far he's willing to push actors in his films.

Salim likens writing the game to an exorcism. “You hear these stories,” he says of whispers about headline-making abuse and bad behavior. “It is horrific. To then make a game that explores that felt like ‘oh fuck you' to the industry and the machine. It really is mad what people get away with, the amount of toxicity that exists on an industry level.” Dead Take lets players piece together these sorts of stories, much as you would in real life, through emails, notes, and context. An actress caught in a MeToo-like scandal. A director pitting his actors against each other, or pushing them beyond their limits.

Throughout their search, players find flash drives containing video clips of the game's actors. Salim made the unusual choice to let these scenes play out as real-life footage instead of as animation. Although the use of full-motion-video in games has enjoyed newfound popularity, thanks to titles like Immortality, it's still uncommon. Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33) and Neil Newbon (Baldur's Gate 3, Date Everything) act as the game's leads, Chase and Vinny. Both actors have worked for years, but it's only recently that they've had the spotlight, thanks to more prominent roles in popular games. “They're fucking good and I wanna show that, rather than putting them behind a character,” Salim says.

As a creative professional, there's a lot for Salim to dislike about AI use—and he certainly does dislike a lot—but one fear stands out to him: images or videos being “bastardized” in ways actors and artists have no control over. “I think that's disturbing and disgusting,” he says. “The last thing I want is someone to generate a horrific image of myself and then my daughter to stumble upon it as we're older. That would be horrible.”

It's a fair concern in our current world. Actor Pedro Pascal is currently being smeared via AI-generated videos, which falsely show him groping fellow actresses. In May, players turned a digital Darth Vader, voiced by an AI replica of James Earl Jones in Fortnite, into a swearing, slur hurling foe in a matter of hours.

In the game, these found video clips are key to unlocking the story. Players can use a computer bay inside Duke's mansion to edit film, “splice” together clips, and create new footage. An interview of a single actor, for example, becomes a tense conversation when combined with another's. With each new clip, players are given an alternate view of the game's characters, allowing them to draw new conclusions. Each unlocked clip triggers a new series of puzzles.

The machine, which Salim describes as “cheaper than an editor, but expensive as hell,” isn't so far off from what a modern AI-powered editing suite can realistically produce. “It's all about cutting corners,” Salim says. “Furthering human evolution—it isn't about that.” AI may be able to do some tasks more quickly than humans, but comes with its own costs of job loss and climate impact.

“It's a threat,” Salim says of AI. It's currently being used across entertainment in different ways, whether it's for writing, animation, or video editing. Still, he doesn't believe it will ever be able to replace actors. “The biggest threat is the content people are going to be taking in is just so fucking bad…to have this idea of a generation being brought up on computer generated, weird AI slop, it's terrifying. You're all gonna start thinking the same.”

Devon Powers says there is one significant data point no one has considered in the debate around 2025's Song of the Summer, or rather, why there doesn't really seem to be one this year: Donald Trump.

As media has become less centralized—music streamers replaced radio stations, TikTok killed the music video, and so on—how people consume music, and who they listen to, has become even more fragmented. But today, Trump represents a reawakened avatar of cultural togetherness. He may be the closest thing in our society we have to a monoculture. In the US, he is the one thing a majority of people have all fervently rallied around, be they for or against what he stands for.

His influence reaches far beyond the fractured political arena of Washington, DC, Powers says, and he could be having an effect on even the music charts. One of the reasons there is no song of the summer this year “may have to do with Trump in a weird way,” a figure whose shadow looms large and has everything “to do with the changing cultural dominant.”

“There was a lot of discussion towards the end of the election season and right after Trump got elected about did country music sort of predict Trump. And I think that there is something to that. There are now more conservative touch points in culture that people can't really ignore the way that they were before,” she says, mentioning the Paramount+ show Yellowstone, the return of trad wives in pop discourse, and the MAHA movement. “It all fits into that.”

But there are also other culminating factors—a perfect storm of circumstances—that have contributed to an unpredictable summer for music.

For one, listening habits are again shifting on streaming services like Spotify and SoundCloud, where tastes are growing more eclectic, people are venturing outside their comfort zones, and loyalty to any one genre seems to be a dying trend. The industry is also suffering from what has amounted to an authenticity crisis over creative authorship as streamers are being inundated with AI slop, which has become a genre all its own. Then there's the Trump of it all, whose domineering influence may represent a new version of monoculture that not even the music industry can evade.

Powers, who is a professor of media studies at the University of Michigan and author of On Trend: The Business of Forecasting the Future, says his influence could, in fact, be having an effect on the music charts. She's not far off either. According to Luminate's midyear survey on music trends, released last month, more music is being streamed than ever before, but overall growth has slowed globally.

In spite of that, Christian music is on the rise. The genre is evolving fast, both in how it's defined and how it's discovered.

“Traditionally, it existed in a fairly closed ecosystem, with limited distribution, niche promotion channels, and a very specific audience, especially in radio and retail,” says JJ Italiano, head of global music curation and discovery at Spotify. “But as younger, streaming-native listeners have become more dominant, there's been room for a new wave of Christian and faith-driven artists to explore a broader sound.”

While the full MAGA-fication of music is still far off—rap and rock remain the most popular genres in the US by a wide margin—there has been a noticeable tide shift in consumer listening habits overall. Trump isn't the only reason we don't have a song of the summer, just the one nobody is talking about, Powers says.

Billboard launched its Songs of the Summer chart in 2010, and it entered the zeitgeist in 2012. The phrase itself is a “relatively recent vintage,” Powers says. The title has become a business proposition more than anything, a way of “branding music and our relationship to the summer season.”

Currently sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 is “Ordinary” by Alex Warren, a YouTuber and founding member of Hype House, the former collective of Gen Z TikTok stars. The song is a choir-heavy ballad about love that echoes the rising wave of Christian music. But where Carly Rae Jepsen's “Call Me Maybe” and Wizkid's “Essence” once defined the breezy, irresistible atmospheres of summers past, “Ordinary” is not necessarily what you'd consider song of the summer material. Songs like Warren's, despite their chart dominance, don't really capture the spirit of the season. It's a change that may forecast the future of the industry.

“It's harder to find cultural consensus overall,” says Dan Charnas, associate professor at New York University and author of The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop. Summer isn't as vital to the actual business model of the music industry as summer movies have been to the film industry, he says, which may explain why record labels aren't necessarily jockeying for chart dominance in the same way they do in the fall. “Which doesn't mean it's impossible. Last year, Sabrina Carpenter defied the odds and created some seemingly ubiquitous musical moments. But convergence around one song is much harder in the streaming era when everyone is pretty much programming their own playlist.”

That could be natural evolution. Today, streaming accounts for 92 percent of all music consumption in the US. Evolutions are the only guarantee in music, and “the idea of a single ‘mainstream' is expanding,” says Wyatt Marshall, senior director of music intelligence at SoundCloud. He believes listeners are becoming more “genre-agnostic.”

You've probably noticed some of that too. Despite a string of chart-worthy summer releases from acts as varied as HAIM, Burna Boy, Lorde, The Clipse—and even a surprise drop from Tyler, the Creator—listeners haven't been able to reach a unified accord.

Some of that is due to ongoing genre fermentation, which has become a new constant. AI slop, for example, is overwhelming streamers, flooding platforms with bizarre song titles like “Make Love to My Shitter” and “Grant Me Rectal Delight,” mirroring the sounds of jazz and doo-wap with a terrifying proficiency. AI-generated bands like Velvet Sundown, which surpassed 1 million streams on Spotify, are finding substantial audiences online even as they raise legitimate questions about creative authorship. In June, an AI song landed on the US charts for the first time, reaching No. 44 on the TikTok Viral 50. The new genre of sound is posing questions over authenticity and authorship.

SoundCloud's Marshall says he has also noticed a subtle shift in listening behavior. According to data the company shared with WIRED, only 43 percent of plays in the US have been to tracks released in the past 18 months—slightly down from the two previous summers. “It suggests listeners may be revisiting favorites or balancing discovery with nostalgia a bit more this summer,” which may also explain “recession pop,” the current resurgence of pop songs from the late 2000s.

TikTok and Instagram have been a huge factor in lasting relevance, or reigniting old favorites, as viral sounds help create long-term staying power. Before 2020, no tracks spent more than 40 weeks in the top 10 of Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Then the pandemic forced everyone inside and on TikTok. According to The Wall Street Journal, eight songs have since cleared that 40-week benchmark, including “Levitating,” by Dua Lipa, and “Lose Control,” by Teddy Swims.

One reason there may seem like there is less consensus this summer is because what's actually happening is a “backlash to the last few summers,” Powers says. The explosion of social media in the 2010s and the rise of streaming—large cultural shifts that reengineered how people communicate, share, create, and come together—killed monoculture. That was the argument. But “those theories are incomplete,” Powers says. Last year was all about the neon punk spirit of Charli XCX's Brat. Before that was Barbenheimer, 2023's joint box-office push behind summer blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both were major marketing campaigns that “undercut the fragmentation argument because people will say, ‘Oh, we weren't fragmented last summer.' No, we were super fragmented last summer. All the same technologies that existed then exist now. Maybe we were a little less focused on AI, but we had that moment of togetherness.” She says young people may have lost some faith in larger music movements tied to political campaigns, like Brat Summer, and be in search of something new this year.

In an age where mass consensus is dying out and divisions seem to be growing, fandoms ebb and flow, and often new genres, or even ones once relegated to niche audiences, grow in popularity. “Genres are more porous than ever,” Marshall says. “Listeners are more omnivorous, and fandom isn't siloed to one style of music.”

On Spotify, Italiano says country music is also on the rise, which is finding a wider base. It is “indicative of a younger generation being far more open to listening to music across a variety of genres as well as the constraints around what is considered country music continuing to fall away.”

“It's not a complete changing of the cultural guard,” Powers says. “But I think that we're still figuring out how to talk about this cultural moment.”

US President Donald Trump has ordered regulators to investigate the alleged refusal among US banks to supply accounts to customers on the basis of their political or religious beliefs.

In an executive order signed Thursday, Trump accused federal banking regulators of presiding over an unlawful discrimination campaign under the guise of risk management, echoing allegations leveled previously by members of conservative groups and the cryptocurrency sector.

“Bank regulators have used supervisory scrutiny and other influence over regulated banks to direct or otherwise encourage politicized or unlawful debanking activities,” the order states. “Such practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that the provision of banking services should be based on material, measurable, and justifiable risks.”

The order requires banking regulators to conduct an investigation into instances of politically motivated discrimination. If banks are found to have discriminated in this manner, regulators are to levy fines, consent decrees, and other unspecified “disciplinary measures,” the executive order states.

To prevent similar alleged discrimination recurring in future, the order also demands that regulators disallow banks from considering “reputation risk” when fielding applications from prospective customers. In anticipation of this measure, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulatory agencies responsible for the stability of the US banking system, had already moved to drop reputation risk as a component of their examination processes.

The order is the latest in a series of steps taken by Republicans since Trump returned to office to end the alleged discrimination by banks. In February, congressional subcommittees held multiple hearings on the topic of debanking. The following month, Republican members of the Senate sponsored the FIRM Act—which has not yet been put to a vote—aiming to prohibit banks from factoring in “reputation risk” when making decisions about customers. Trump has also appointed Jonathan Gould, former counsel to crypto firm Bitfury, as head of the OCC, and long-time regulator Travis Hill as acting chairman of the board of directors of the FDIC.

Although the executive order does not refer explicitly to crypto, it has been interpreted in corners of the industry—which has formed a profitable alliance with Trump of late—as a long overdue concession to its own banking struggles.

For years, the crypto industry has complained about US banks refusing to provide them with loans and checking accounts. Without a US bank account, crypto firms cannot readily accept dollars in exchange for services, store and earn interest on funds raised from investors, pay employees or vendors, or perform other fundamental business activities.

In early 2023, following the lead of crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter, industry figures began to allege foul play. Under the Biden administration, they claimed, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC pressured banks into refusing to serve the crypto industry. They did so by issuing informal guidance, thereby skirting the public consultation process required to instate formal policy, crypto figures have alleged.

Carter termed this alleged discrimination campaign Operation Chokepoint 2.0, in reference to an Obama-era antifraud program under which US officials reportedly discouraged banks from dealing with pornography, payday lending, and other disfavored industries. On the campaign trail ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Trump adopted the terminology himself.

“I'm glad the Trump administration is taking up this fight, and I hope they can create a framework for fairer banking overall,” says Carter, speaking to WIRED.

The FDIC and Federal Reserve declined to comment. “It is unacceptable for banks to discriminate against customers or prospective customers based on political or religious beliefs,” says Gould, comptroller of the currency at the OCC. “I intend to assess the size and scope of this problem and take appropriate action to depoliticize the federal banking system, and ensure banks provide fair access to financial services as required by law.”

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Trump claimed to have experienced debanking firsthand: Both Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, he alleged, have previously either withdrawn accounts or refused to accept his deposits. “The banks discriminated against me very badly,” Trump claimed.

“We don't close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” says Patricia Wexler, managing director of corporate communications at JP Morgan. The Bank of America declined to comment, but pointed to a subsequent interview in which its CEO, Brian Moynihan, said, “We bank everybody.”

According to Donald Trump Jr., the banks' behavior helped to awaken the Trump family to the supposed promise of crypto, as the basis for a parallel financial system in which everybody has custody over their own funds. “We got into crypto not because it was, like, hey this is the next cool thing. We got into it out of necessity,” he told CNBC in June.

Since Trump's return to the White House, crypto companies are already finding it easier to secure accounts with US banks, as WIRED previously reported. But while the recent vibe shift is welcome, there remain questions about the practicalities of enforcing the executive order—and potential unwanted side effects tied to restricting the terms on which a bank may decline to serve a customer.

“Simply demanding that banks provide services to all clients is not workable because banks should be allowed discretion over whom they serve,” says Carter. “The challenge is to install a supervisory regime that allows banks the discretion to derisk unprofitable or risky clients through the ordinary course of their business while ending the practice of debanking clients because of their politics.”

One step towards achieving that, Carter proposes, might be to pare back the doctrine of “confidential supervisory information,” under which banks are prevented from disclosing to the public the details of certain discussions with their regulators.

“Despite Swan getting debanked in 2022 with no explanation and no recourse, I believe in the right of private enterprises, even banks, to assess risk and decide who they want to do business with,” says Cory Klippsten, CEO at bitcoin services company Swan Bitcoin. “This looks more like political theater and payback for crypto campaign donations than a real attempt to solve the problem.”

The White House declined to comment.

The crypto industry can only be confident of its long-term security in the US market once its access to banking has been enshrined in law, beyond an executive order that could be readily rescinded by a future administration.

“Even though there is a more friendly administration in place at the moment, there still hasn't been anything codified into law,” said Azeem Khan, founder of crypto startup Miden, speaking to WIRED earlier in the year. “[We need] new laws that allow us to be sure the pendulum won't swing based on who is sitting in the chair.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","It Looks Like a School Bathroom Smoke Detector. A Teen Hacker Showed It Could Be an Audio Bug","https://www.wired.com/story/school-bathroom-vape-detector-audio-bug/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A couple of years ago, a curious, then-16-year-old hacker named Reynaldo Vasquez-Garcia was on his laptop at his Portland-area high school, seeing what computer systems he could connect to via the Wi-Fi—“using the school network as a lab,” as he puts it—when he spotted a handful of mysterious devices with the identifier “IPVideo Corporation.”

After a closer look and some googling, Garcia figured out that a company by that name was a subsidiary of Motorola, and the devices he'd found in his school seemed to be something called the Halo 3C, a “smart” smoke and vape detection gadget. “They look just like smoke detectors, but they have a whole bunch of features like sensors and stuff,” Garcia says.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

As he read more, he was intrigued to learn that the Halo 3C goes beyond detecting smoke and vaping—including a distinct feature for discerning THC vaping in particular. It also has a microphone for listening out for “aggression,” gunshots, and keywords such as someone calling for help, a feature that to Vasquez-Garcia immediately raised concerns of more intrusive surveillance.

Now, after months of reverse engineering and security testing, Vasquez-Garcia and a fellow hacker he's partnered with who goes by the pseudonym “Nyx,” have shown that it's possible to hack one of those Halo 3C gadgets—which they've taken to calling by the nickname “snitch puck”—and take full control of it.

At the Defcon hacker conference today, they plan to show that by exploiting just a few relatively simple security vulnerabilities, any hacker on the same network could have hijacked a Halo 3C to turn it into a real-time audio eavesdropping bug, disabled its detection capabilities, created fake alerts for vaping or gunshots, or even played whatever sound or audio they chose out of the device's speaker. Motorola said it has since developed a firmware update to address those security flaws that will automatically push to cloud-connected devices by Friday.

Many of the hackers' tricks are on display in a video demo below, which the Vasquez-Garcia and Nyx made ahead of their Defcon presentation:

The Halo 3C's vulnerabilities would have potentially allowed a teen hacker on a school network to take control of a Halo 3C for epic mischief or abuse. The sensor's capabilities also ignite fears that school administrators or even police could have done the same to eavesdrop on unsuspecting students in a school bathroom. Schools are increasingly subject to all sorts of surveillance technology, from AI-powered weapons detectors, to “face analytics” cameras, to keystroke loggers on student computers.

One concern of the researchers is that technology like the Halo 3C could be turned against a student speaking about seeking an abortion, for instance. In marketing material, Motorola says the Halo 3C sensor “is ideal for observing health and safety in privacy-concern areas, such as restrooms and changing facilities, where video and audio recording is not permitted.” (Motorola said that the sensor is programmed with wake words, such as “Help, 911,” and does not record or stream audio.)

“To the credit of the company, the microphones sound great,” says Nyx. “From up on the ceiling, you could totally listen to what somebody was saying, and we've made this happen.”

Motorola told the hackers in an email that it has worked on a new firmware update that should fix the vulnerabilities. But the hackers argue that doesn't, and can't, address the underlying concern: that a gadget loaded with hidden microphones is installed in schools around the country. Motorola also advertises its Halo sensors for use in public housing—including inside residents' homes—according to marketing material.

“The unfortunate reality is there's a microphone connected to a computer that's connected to the network,” says Nyx. “And there's no software patching that will make that not possible to use as a listening device.”

Motorola pitches the Halo 3C as an “all-in-one intelligent security device” in its marketing material. Its notifications “enable security teams at schools, hospitals, retail stores and more to respond to potentially critical events faster, helping to establish a safer environment,” it says.

After Vasquez-Garcia got curious about the Halo 3C two years ago, he and Nyx—an older hacker he met at his local hackerspace—bought one on eBay and took it apart. Their physical teardown revealed the Halo 3C is essentially a Raspberry Pi micro computer with a bunch of sensors attached, including one for temperature or humidity, an accelerometer, and others for air quality that detect different gases. One feature jumped out: a couple of microphones.

“Seeing this device is getting put into buildings and having microphones in it,” says Nyx, “it's kind of a huge red flag.”

A disassembled Halo 3C smoke and vape detector found to include microphones.

To hack the Halo 3C, they found that if they could connect to one over the network it was installed on, they could brute-force guess its password with virtually no rate limitations due to a flaw in how it tried to throttle those guesses. “It's trivially possible to guess passwords as quickly as the thing can respond to you,” says Nyx. That meant they could guess roughly 3,000 passwords a minute, and crack any insufficiently complex password relatively quickly.

Once they had administrator access to a Halo 3C, they found they could update its firmware to whatever they chose: Despite its security measures that attempted to require those firmware updates to be encrypted with a certain cryptographic key, that key was in fact included in firmware updates available on the Halo's website. “They're handing you a locked box where the key is taped to the underside,” Nyx says. “As long as you know to look down there, you can open it up.”

A Motorola Solutions spokesperson said in a statement: “Motorola Solutions designs, develops and deploys our products to prioritize data security and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. A firmware update is available, and we are working with our customers and channel partners to deploy the update together with our additional recommendations and industry best practices for security.”

Marketing material available online says the Halo 3C uses a “Dynamic Vape Detection algorithm” which can sense nicotine, THC, and when someone is trying to mask their vaping with aerosols. Halo can also “alert security teams to motion after hours” and includes a “spoken keyword feature.”

“The HALO Smart Sensor can detect specific spoken keywords that immediately alert security to a potential issue. Pre-defined keywords like ‘help' are particularly valuable in environments such as schools, where bullying is a concern, or for teachers in need of assistance, as well as nurses and hospital patients,” the marketing material adds. Another section says the sensors can be used to detect “bullying or aggression” in schools.

The marketing material also says Halo sensors have been used in public housing units in New York. “The sensors helped SSHA [the Saratoga Springs Housing Authority] reduce risks, enforce nonsmoking rules, and protect vulnerable residents, with plans for further installations across the housing authority,” it says.

Nyx argues that the notion of requiring public housing residents to keep a hackable device that can become an audio eavesdropping tool in their apartment may represent the most disturbing application of the Halo 3C. “That kind of took it up a notch as far as how egregious this entire product line is,” Nyx says. “Most people have an expectation that their home isn't bugged, right?”

As sensors like the Halo 3C proliferate across schools and even homes, Vasquez-Garcia says the biggest takeaway from his and Nyx's findings ought to be that putting microphones and internet connections into every device in our lives as simple as a smoke detector is a decision that carries real risk. “If people remember one thing from this, it should be: Don't blindly trust every internet of things device just because it claims to be for safety,” Vasquez-Garcia says. “The real issue is trust. The more we accept devices that say 'not recording' at face value, the more we normalize surveillance without really knowing what's inside or bothering to question it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside Dylan Field's Big IPO—and His Even Bigger Plans for Figma","https://www.wired.com/story/figma-ipo-dylan-field-interview/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

When Dylan Field pops up on my Zoom screen, his face is a mixture of giddiness and fatigue. He's back at work, after a whirlwind trip to New York City where he launched his company Figma on the New York Stock Exchange, bucking the trend of multi-billion-dollar startups staying private. Even before it became clear that this might be the wildest public launch in years, the Figma world—fans of the app, employees (known as Figmates), and investors—had already turned Wall Street into a block party, handing out swag, serving free pizza, and blasting music from a DJ that shook the caverns of mammon. But the sweetest music played out on the Big Board, as the opening $33 share price skyrocketed to $142 before settling down at a comfortable $90.

By the time Field flew back to California, he was worth more than $5 billion. But he doesn't want to talk about that. The story, in his mind, is not about a company going public, but the IPO of design itself. “What I care most about is what our product will be in 5 years, 10 years,” he says. “Are we progressing design forward?”

Not focusing on the money is probably a good idea. On the day we are speaking, Figma's stock price dropped 27 percent, cutting its valuation from around $60 billion to just over $40 billion. That's still way higher than anyone expected. While Figma's IPO celebrates design, it isn't the only company hoping to revolutionize the field. AI will initiate a new era in design. Figma, like its competitors, will be defined by how it handles that technology. Ultimately, it's still not clear whether AI will help its business or blow it up.

Every time I talk to Field, it seems like something monumental is happening to Figma, the company he cofounded as a 19-year-old Thiel fellow and a dropout from Brown University. From the start, Figma's browser-based app allowed people to collaborate and brainstorm about design online. It grew a loyal following, threatening the giant in design tools, Adobe. During our first meeting in 2022, I pressed Field on that David and Goliath trope—and whether he might pull an Instagram and sell out to a bigger company. Field nobly talked about how he was in it for the long haul. In fact, he had a secret he couldn't share: Adobe had just offered $20 billion for his company, and he was going to take it. The news broke weeks after our conversation. When I confronted him about that at the WIRED conference in San Francisco last December, he apologized. “I felt so bad about that,” he told me.

The next time we talked, in December 2023, that deal had just fallen apart, because former President Joe Biden's Department of Justice indicated it would object to the merger. Field was clearly shaken but determined to carry on with his original plan to build a company that would change the way people create apps, websites, docs, and decks. It wasn't easy, as months of momentum had been squandered preparing to merge with the bigger firm.

Over the next two years, Figma expanded its offerings and kept winning fans. Its 13 million users only hint at its ubiquity: work produced on its app is seen by billions of people. Among Fortune 500 companies, 95 percent use the product. Figma turns a profit. And post-IPO, even after its stock leveled off, the company is worth more than twice what Adobe was going to pay for it.

Still, I was a bit baffled that Field felt it necessary to IPO when startups these days can reach stratospheric valuations without the mishigas of accountability that comes from becoming a public firm. Field cites the virtues of community ownership, the corporate hygiene of following the reporting rules, and how the option to buy shares in Figma will lead people to understand its business better. Ultimately, he says, “If you're going to go public eventually, why not do it now?”

As is custom for many tech leaders going public, Field wrote a founder's letter in the prospectus in which he pledged higher values than profits. (Those vows typically wind up haunting their authors as the scrappy entrepreneurs morph into yacht-seeking profit-hounds.) Essentially, the letter is an argument that design now has a central place in peoples' lives. It's not just an important factor in the way people build products and express themselves: it's the factor. “Design,” he wrote, “is bigger than design.” When I ask what he meant by that, he doesn't unpack the koan too easily. “It's something that can mean a lot of things,” he says. “It's the rise of design going from pixel level craft to more general problem solving, to how you win or lose.”

He explains that in the early 2000s, design was about making things pretty. By the 2010s, people were emulating Steve Jobs' philosophy that design was about function. Now, Field says, design is not only both those things, but our means of communication—who you are, what your brand stands for, how you engage with the public. Our world is built on software, Field says, and the more software is created, the more design becomes the core differentiator. It's our new language, and Figma wants to be the Duolingo for those striving to master it.

Figma reports that two-thirds of its users are not designers. New AI tools—which essentially add robots to your design collaboration team—will accelerate the ability of non-designers to produce professional-looking creations that previously only the RISD crowd could produce. So non-designers are … designers? “That's the right question,” Field says. “People won't necessarily change their titles, but responsibilities get blurred.” He insists, though, that talented designers will still thrive. “Others will provide an improved baseline, but there will still be people who excel at their craft,” he explains. In that vision, AI tools raise both the floor and the ceiling for design.

But what happens if AI improves so much that the floor is sufficiently high to discourage companies from hiring real designers? Will giving everyday people the ability to churn out “good-enough” designs obviate the need to hire pricey design specialists? Field doesn't think that will happen. “There are areas where good enough is not enough,” he says. “My view is design, craft, point of view, marketing, and brand are what set you apart and make you win.”

Figma's rocket start as a public company doesn't assure success. The AI technology it's betting on is a work in progress. Tech giants who own their own powerful AI models may wind up as competitors. (In a briefing for its new GPT-5 model this week, OpenAI demoed how a single prompt could result in a pleasant-looking app within seconds, which a user could then tweak to make it look even slicker.) Even Adobe is still out there.

And now Field has to deal with the prosaic chores that come with owning a public company. One thing he doesn't seem to be prone to is manically following the market. When I mention that after the stock price dip that day, he lost over a billion dollars, there's a brief silence. “I did?” he asks, genuinely surprised … Now that's focus.

GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter, and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory.

Loopr, a Seattle-based startup that sells computer vision quality control software to manufacturing firms, raised a new round of cash.

A regulatory filing shows that the company raised $5.4 million. Loopr declined to confirm the exact dollar amount but said the new round was led by Growth Warrior Capital, with participation from Stellar Ventures and Tacoma Venture Fund.

Founded in 2021, Loopr's software helps manufacturers detect defects and quality issues. Unlike legacy vision systems that rely on fixed cameras and custom installs, Loopr is hardware-agnostic and can run on tablets. 

The company uses AI to analyze inspection data and surface insights that help manufacturers identify trends and improve traceability. 

Loopr targets sectors including aerospace, automotive, and chemical manufacturing. It is working with 10 Fortune 1000 companies. 

The company is led by founder and CEO Priyansha Bagaria, who was previously chief revenue officer at InViz AI, a machine learning development company based in India. 

Part of the inspiration for starting Loopr came from working for her family's insulation sheet manufacturing business in India, where she developed software to help alert workers of anomalies during production. 

Loopr competes against a growing number of startups and industrial tech companies using AI for factory monitoring, inspection, and compliance. 

Loopr employs more than 20 people. Growth Warrior Capital partner Promise Phelon is joining the company's board.

Meta has acquired AI voice startup WaveForms for an undisclosed sum, The Information reports. It's the company's latest buy to strengthen its new AI unit, Superintelligence Labs, and Meta's second major AI audio acquisition in the last month after it bought PlayAI. 

WaveForms, founded just eight months ago, raised $40 million from Andreessen Horowitz in a round that valued the company at $160 million pre-money, per PitchBook data. 

Two of the startup's co-founders — former Meta and OpenAI researcher Alexis Conneau, and former Google advertising strategist Coralie Lemaitre — have reportedly joined Meta. While at OpenAI, Conneau co-created GPT4-o Advanced Voice Mode neural networks. 

TechCrunch has reached out to WaveForms to find out if its third co-founder and chief technologist, Kartikay Khandelwal, will also join Meta, as well as the outcome of the deal for the roughly 14 other staffers (per LinkedIn) at the company.

WaveForms appears to have taken down its own website, but the company's LinkedIn page describes its mission as solving the “Speech Turing Test,” which tries to measure if a listener can distinguish between human and AI-generated speech. WaveForms was also developing “Emotional General Intelligence,” which focuses on understanding individual self-awareness and management.

Pinterest CEO Bill Ready told investors on the company's second-quarter earnings call that the social app and inspirational bookmarking site could be considered an “AI-enabled shopping assistant.” However, he thinks that the agentic web, where AI agents shop on users' behalf, is still far in the future.

The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey — around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases.

Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users' interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest.

“I think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything—,” Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. “I think that's going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,” he noted.

Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn't talk about it that way, usually, because it's not how users think of it. 

“But when users say things like ‘Pinterest just gets me,' it's because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they're really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,” he said. 

The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a “Cambrian moment,” and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies. 

Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch a new set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out Gen AI Pins. The discussion also omitted mention of mass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn't say if that's the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including on Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr.)

On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that's used for good and used “responsibly.” 

“On the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,” the exec explained. “Both in terms of what we're doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what's happening in the rest of social media,” he said.

Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted), fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

Google announced on Friday that it's giving Google Finance, its tool that provides financial information and business news, an AI update. Users will now be able to research their financial questions with AI, access advanced charting tools, and get real-time data and news. 

With the update, users can now ask detailed questions about finance and get a comprehensive AI response that includes links to relevant sites. Instead of having to look up individual stock details, users can ask complex questions in one go.

As for the new charting tools, Google says these “will help you visualize financial data beyond simple asset performance. You can view technical indicators, like moving average envelopes, or adjust the display to see candlestick charts and more.”

Google Finance is also getting additional market data, including commodities and additional cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there's a new live news feed that lets you see real-time headlines.

With this update, Google is looking to take on platforms like Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha. The company also likely hopes that by supercharging Google Finance with AI answers and charts, people are less likely to leave the service and go to an AI chatbot like ChatGPT for answers to complex questions. 

The tech giant says the new AI-powered Google Finance is rolling out over the coming weeks in the U.S. Users will have the option to toggle between the new and old design.

Openvibe, an app that allows you to follow open social networks like Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, and Nostr in one place, is now expanding its functionality so you can follow your favorite news sites and blogs, too. To do so, the startup is adding support for RSS (aka Really Simple Syndication or news feeds), an open standard that allows you to subscribe to automatic updates from websites, like new articles or blog posts.

The addition makes Openvibe more useful for keeping up with your interests and other important information without having to switch between multiple newsreaders, websites, or social networking apps.

The new feature also puts Openvibe in more direct competition with other social media and content aggregators that track updates from across the open web. These competitors include Tapestry, the new app from the company that once built a popular Twitter client known as Twitterific; Feeeed, an RSS reader that supports tracking social profiles on Mastodon, YouTube and other platforms; and Surf, a new open social app and browser from the makers of Flipboard.

Openvibe CEO Matej Svancer says RSS support was always part of the app's longer-term roadmap since its launch last year. However, the feature was heavily requested by the user base, so the team prioritized its development, he says.

To use the feature, you can choose to add RSS sources one by one, check the app's suggested sites and tap “follow” on those you want to track, or import your entire OPML file from another news reader. After more people adopt RSS, Openvibe will introduce a leaderboard that shows the most added feeds to help direct users to popular sources. 

Once added, you can track the RSS updates in the app's combined home feed, in the dedicated “RSS” feed, or you can add the RSS feeds to your own custom feed. 

While RSS can also be used to track podcasts and YouTube channels, Openvibe isn't yet focused on those formats, Svancer tells TechCrunch. It may be technically possible to add them in the app today, but it won't offer a good user experience, he explains — unless you don't mind having to open each item in a browser.

With news and blogs, however, Openvibe opens content directly within the app using a clean, distraction-free reading mode. If you prefer to visit the websites in a browser, you can change this setting.

Plus, the app offers a “Performance Mode” toggle that will turn off image loading in the timeline previews to make the feature even less resource-intensive.  

The company has been testing the RSS feature ahead of launch with just over 100 people who have, combined, added over 4,000 feeds. 

RSS support is now available in Openvibe's iOS and Android apps. The app itself remains free to download without in-app purchases for now, but the company plans to introduce a subscription offering in the future.

The startup is currently backed by a small amount of funding from Czech Founders VC, Tensor Ventures, and Automattic — the parent company to WordPress.com, Tumblr, Beeper, and others.

I can already hear the screams from the rafters telling me how terrible of a choice Python is - but in my case, I valued modularity, extensibility, hackability over raw performance.

Nodes can then be spawned and linked programmatically or in the graphical editor. Synchrotron handles the rest at runtime.

Most of them, though, are simply comments you and I disagree with. It's an open-access site, people are going to write things you disagree with, and there isn't going to be a moderation rule saying, for instance, that only anti-carceral comments are allowed on the site.I spend a weird amount of time watching for specific patterns of nasty shit on HN (use the search bar to see if I've missed a race/IQ in the last year) and my experience has been the moderators are as repulsed by toxicity as I am, and they're quick to act.You're not the first of us to express concerns that the specific moderation principles HN uses are too accommodating to toxic edgelordism (another long-timer once noted that they appear to function as a kind of grooming academy for hateful rhetoric, allowing in almost any sentiment expressed coolly and without vitriol). But improvements aren't as easy as they look. A good exercise: if you think comment moderation is failing because the rules aren't right, propose the next guideline that would fix it.I've been doing that for years, and some of my guideline proposals have made it in (can't see everyone else's comment scores: you're welcome). Most of the ones that haven't, though, I've come to see would have been unworkable.

Of all the lower-cost, pick-up-and-play controllers I tested for the Nintendo Switch 2, 8BitDo's $60 Ultimate 2 easily felt the best in hand. At a steep discount from Nintendo's now-$90 Switch 2 Pro Controller, it's an easy recommendation. What else do you need? When we take a step up and look at the $70 Pro 3 wireless controller, we should consider just what we gain and what we're still missing. No, unfortunately you can't wake the Switch 2 from sleep with the Pro 3. What you get instead is one of the best-feeling gamepads with the latest stick, trigger, and button technology that neither Nintendo nor any other major console maker still dares to touch.

8BitDo Pro 3 Controller

The 8BitDo Pro 3 controller is great for Switch or PC, and it's one of the few you can change the button layout for your preferred system.

Pros

Cons

As much as I may enjoy the modern PS5 DualSense controller, I wonder what could have been if Sony had kept iterating on its older DualShock design. 8BitDo's Pro 3 tells us there was so much more to give. The peripheral maker's Pro series controllers bear a look that somehow combines the DualShock's thumbstick layout with an old-school, flat-bodied SNES gamepad. If its squishy start and select buttons don't spark nostalgia, I don't know what would. The 8BitDo Pro 3 has twin arms that fit adult-sized hands better than any old PlayStation controller. And just like the 8BitDo Pro 2 from 2021, you can get the gamepad in a Famicon-style off-white, a calming GameCube purple, or a PlayStation gray, but now it comes with an Ultimate 2-style dock, which doubles as a charging mount and easy 2.4GHz connection port for playing on PC, Mac, or Steam Deck.

Any controller that wants to call itself “pro” needs a 2.4GHz connection for lower latency. Back buttons and a toggle switch to clicky “haptic” triggers are now so standard it's hard to go back to a basic Xbox controller. But you're not reaching for a company like 8BitDo first if you want to outperform opponents in Call of Duty. Instead, the 8BitDo Pro 3 operates as a switch hitter between Nintendo's Switch and Switch 2, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. Really important to note: the Pro 3 doesn't connect with PlayStation or Xbox consoles. The Pro 3's A, B, X, and Y face buttons are all magnetic. The controller comes with a small rubber doohickey tool with a magnet you use to swap your buttons around however you choose. This means you can use the 8BitDo Pro 3 in both Nintendo Switch or Xbox layouts without having to rely purely on muscle memory. The Pro 3 isn't nearly as modular as the $200 Turtle Beach Victrix Pro BFG, which lets you completely reconfigure the controller layout with magnetic modules, but for $70 there are few controllers that are nearly as customizable.

The removal tool and extra buttons are found in the bottom hatch of the charging mount. Removing the buttons simply requires you to press the suction cup to each switch, then tug them out one at a time. With the new buttons reseated, I wasn't able to pry them out with my fingernails no matter how hard I dug. What's more, you can also remove the thumbstick caps. 8BitDo included two ball caps like you might find on a Japanese-style arcade stick. You need a fair bit of finger strength to release and attach the thumbstick caps, but once they were on, I didn't feel any amount of loose rocking on either the regular or arcade attachments. I would honestly be amazed if anybody used these for anything, let alone fighting games, but they look extra cute jutting out of the controller, as if combining three eras of gaming into one input device.

Compared to the Hall effect joysticks on the last-gen Pro 2 controller, the Pro 3 uses TMR, or tunnelling magnetoresistance sticks. Hall effect uses a magnetic field to detect the stick's orientation. These sticks are far more resistant to the inevitable drift caused by older designs with more contact points. TMR is more of an evolution of Hall effect, though so few controllers are making use of the technology, and promises to be more accurate than Hall effect while consuming much less power. What all this means in practice is the Pro 3 should last longer, both in terms of battery life and long-term use. The controller houses a 1,000mAh battery, which is technically less than what you'll find on controllers like the PlayStation DualSense. Sony's PS5 controller normally lasts little more than three to four hours, at best. The 8BitDo Pro 3 powered through a three-hour session of Switch 2 gaming plus several more hours of tests on PC before the battery indicator turned red. The addition of the charging dock means you shouldn't have to worry much about running out of juice, so long as you keep it plugged in and close by.

What matters more than the joystick technology is how the sticks actually feel on your thumbs. They're more stiff than some early, twig-like Hall effect joysticks. Each snaps back to center without a twinge of accidental input you get on cheaper controllers, which tend to “rubber band” when released. In games on Switch 2 like Donkey Kong Bananza, running around feels effortless and snappy. If you plan to take this controller into Call of Duty multiplayer, just know there are other high-end controllers that may offer more for truly competitive gaming.

The D-pad and Hall-effect triggers are similarly exemplary. Every direction on the D-pad feels snappy, and I didn't have any issue with missed inputs depending on where I hit the buttons. The L2 and R2 buttons include a switch to change from clicky triggers to analog triggers. For the sake of Switch games, they feel even better than the Switch 2 Pro controller. Its six-axis gyro controls are just as precise as Nintendo's $90 Pro device and the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 gamepad. The dock uses USB-C and includes the USB-C 2.4GHz dongle inside. You don't even need to remove the dongle from the dock for faster connection speeds, making playing on PC seamless. If you plan to use a 2.4GHz connection on Switch, you can enable the option if you hold the select and LB buttons for a few seconds, but it makes the experience worse since doing so disables motion controls and rumble. If you're using it for Switch, you'll inevitably opt for Bluetooth, and you'll still be able to use the controller from far away. The stated distance is 10 meters, and I could still connect to a Switch 2 on the other side of my apartment through several walls and doors.

The rest of the buttons have an oomph and a clickiness that may turn off some people who don't want to annoy their partner reading beside them on the couch, but I'm a gamer who prefers to feel every button press. The 8BitDo Pro 3 is every bit the high-end controller it claims to be, except for its software. The “8BitDo Ultimate Software” is rudimentary but useful for setting dead zones on the sticks or mapping your buttons on up to three profiles accessible from a button between the two thumbsticks. However, installing the software and getting it connected to the controller on PC or mobile can be a pain.

Just like with the Pro 2, it's again disappointing there's no version of the controller compatible with either Xbox or PlayStation. The Rare 40th Anniversary Ultimate 3 is 8BitDo's first Xbox wireless controller, so there may be hope for future console-specific versions. If I had any more options, this controller could easily be my go-to for both Switch 2 and PC. But until 8BitDo finds a way to help it wake the Switch 2, it can't truly be my one and only.

Elon Musk has always thrived on bold claims and the contradictions that follow. On July 23, he joined Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, the standard ritual in which executives talk up their company's performance and future. Musk was in full visionary mode.

That day, he painted a glowing picture of the future of Dojo, Tesla's ultra-ambitious, custom-built supercomputer designed to train the neural networks for Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus. He called the next generation of Dojo “really spectacular,” spoke of a new “AI factory” with “a lot of potential,” and laid out plans for Dojo 3.

His tone and detail suggested Dojo was one of Tesla's most important projects, an active, thriving pillar of the company's identity as an AI leader.

Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped a bombshell: citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet reported that Tesla had terminated its Dojo project entirely. Peter Bannon, the project's leader, was leaving the company, roughly 20 Dojo team members had recently departed for a new startup called DensityAI, and the remaining staff were being reassigned to other projects.

The speed of the reversal is hard to overstate. In the space of weeks, Tesla appears to have gone from publicly championing Dojo's “spectacular” potential to quietly dismantling the team. If Bloomberg's reporting is confirmed, it would mark the end of a program Musk once pitched as central to Tesla's technological edge.

The Dojo project had already endured turbulence. It was widely seen as Tesla's attempt to reduce reliance on Nvidia's GPUs by building its own custom chips and training hardware. It was an expensive and technically risky strategy in a market dominated by chip giants. Losing talent to DensityAI, including key leaders, suggests mounting internal headwinds long before Bloomberg's scoop.

On the July call, Musk fielded a question about whether his AI startup, xAI, might use Dojo. His answer was brimming with specifics and confidence. “Dojo 2. We expect Dojo 2 to be operating at scale within the next year. At about 100 kh, 100 equivalents,” Musk said.

He went on: “And then AI Five, which is also really spectacular. I don't use those words lightly. We hope to have the AI factory in production towards the end of next year. But that has a lot of potential.”

Musk even looked further ahead, discussing an “intuitive” convergence between Dojo 3 and chips used in Tesla's cars and Optimus robots: “Thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI six in the first chip, it seems intuitively that we want to try to find convergence there. It's basically the same chip that's used when you say two of them in a car or Optimus and maybe a larger number on a five-twelve count on a card or something like that, if you want high-bandwidth communication between chips. That seems sort of intuitively the way to go.”

Critics quickly seized on the Bloomberg report to attack Musk's credibility, pointing out the contradiction between his recent hype and the reported shutdown. The Tesla community on X (formerly Twitter) lit up with debate. “As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years now, I'm well no stranger to his missed ambitious deadlines,” one user wrote. “But I think his commentary on FSD, Optimus, and Dojo over the past couple of years goes beyond that. It's misleading, but he knows it needs to continue given the collapse of Tesla's car business.”

Another replied: “As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years, taking a Bloomberg article about Tesla as entirely correct from day 1 is a bold choice. Could be true, but still bold. I suspect a specific part of Dojo has been canceled.”

As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years taking a Bloomberg article about Tesla as entirely correct on day 1 is a bold choice.

For longtime Musk watchers, this isn't new. In October 2015, Musk declared: “Tesla will have a car that can do full autonomy in about three years.” Three months later, he repeated: “We're going to end up with complete autonomy,” adding: “And I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.” Nearly a decade later, Tesla cars still aren't fully autonomous.

The pattern—extreme optimism followed by abrupt course changes—is a hallmark of what's often called a “reality distortion field,” a term first made famous in reference to Apple's Steve Jobs. Musk has wielded it to set aggressive deadlines for robotaxis, Boring Company tunnels, and humanoid robots, often without delivering on time or at scale.

If Dojo has indeed been scrapped just weeks after being presented as a near-future reality, the fallout could be significant. Investors may question whether Musk knowingly misled them in July, or whether a sudden, serious issue forced him to abandon what he once described as a cornerstone of Tesla's AI strategy.

Either way, if confirmed, the shutdown would deal another blow to Musk's credibility, and deepen the question of where his vision ends and reality begins.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The Altafit af28 smartwatches have been recalled, according to a press release Thursday from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The problem? The watches can overheat on their chargers and even ignite into flames.

The smartwatches were sold on the Home Shopping Network from March 2025 to May 2025 for $50, marked down from $100. There have been 39 reports of the watches melting, burning, and catching fire with at least six reports of consumers' hands being burned along with property damage. And it's all attributed to the smartwatch's wireless charging pad.

The watches were manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. by Deale International LLC, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Altafit af28 was sold on HSN.com as a smartwatch that looked like a piece of jewelry while having all the latest smartwatch features.

“Consumers should immediately unplug the smartwatch's charging pad and stop charging the recalled smartwatch,” the CPSC said in a statement posted online. “Consumers can contact Deale International for instructions on how to receive a free replacement. Consumers will be asked to cut the unplugged charging pad's power cable and email a photo of the charging pad with the cut cable to [email protected].”

The screen measures 1.68 inches and the watch came with two bands, bejeweled and mesh. The versatility of having something that wasn't “too sporty” for “an evening out” was a major part of the marketing pitch, according to promotional videos posted to YouTube.

“This is one that's going to do all the things we want a smart watch to do,” the HSN host says in a video. “Even reads your oxygen levels, your sleep, your heart rate, all the different sports modes that we love from running to yoga to cycling, and you can get credit for them all.

The host went on to explain the watch is “IP67 water resistant rated, and you can even receive your phone calls, your texts, you get app notifications, and that's kind of just the beginning of it.” The watch was billed as being able to measure blood pressure, though smartwatches are notoriously bad at that.

The watch wasn't really on Gizmodo's radar until we saw the recall notice, and it looks like the company only sold about 2,900 of them. But now we're curious how it performed. Did you have an Altafit af28? How did it work? Here's hoping that if you do own one it didn't catch on fire and you can get your refund.

Jordan Peele teases the horrors of Him. It's bad news for Disney+'s Goosebumps show. Plus, Sebastian Stan is set to star in his own ‘Frankenstein' adaptation. To me, my spoilers!



Jeff Sneider's latest Insneider Report newsletter claims that Robin plays a significant role in Matt Reeves' The Batman sequel, with its script described as a “big swing” from Reeves and co-writer Mattson Tomlin.

During a recent interview with Cultura la dubă (via World of Reel), director Radu Jude (Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World) revealed Sebastian Stan is attached to star in his upcoming adaptation of Frankenstein set on “CIA black sites on Romanian soil.”

I had the idea to develop a story that would begin with the reality of CIA black sites on Romanian soil from 20 years ago, and then merge that with another cinematic myth—the Frankenstein monster. I pitched it to Sebastian, and he said yes. So I've started writing the script, but it'll take some time.

According to a new report from What's On Netflix, the film adaptation of Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan's The Boy in the Iron Box is scheduled to begin filming this October.

World of Reel additionally reports that the Hand That Rocks the Cradle remake, starring Maika Monroe and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, will now premiere on Disney+ this October.

Bloody-Disgusting reports The Black Phone 2 has been officially rated “R” for “strong violent content, gore, teen drug use, and language.”

Elsewhere, Fangoria has a poster for Good Boy, the upcoming horror movie told entirely from the perspective of a dog.

Jordan Peele teases the “terrifying places” Him is willing to go in a new featurette.

According to Variety, Disney+ has canceled the new Goosebumps series after two seasons.

Finally, Starz has released a new clip from Outlander: Blood of My Blood ahead of tonight's premiere.

A secretive group founded by Palantir mogul Peter Thiel is planning to expand its influence in Washington, D.C., according to a report from Axios. The group, called Dialog, wants to establish a permanent physical campus in the capital, where it can carry on its invite-only meetings involving major power players.

Working off information provided by a source with knowledge of the group's activities, Axios claims that Dialog—which it says is “often compared to a tech-era Bilderberg”—has plans for a “major expansion” that includes the new physical hub in D.C. It reports:

Dialog leaders are in active discussions to buy a physical venue in Virginia, just outside Washington, to serve as a permanent hub for its off-the-record meetings, the tipster says. The decision to buy land, then build, within commuting distance of the capital shows the group isn't just kissing President Trump's ring, but plans to be engaged in Washington long after this term.

As you might expect, there's not a whole lot of information available about Dialog or what it's all about. Online descriptions make it sound like a pared-down, less transparent, Intellectual Dark Web-tinged version of Davos—where well-connected folks sit around and discuss naughty ideas that the American peasantry just wouldn't get. Axios writes that a source invited to participate in the event described it as “offering global elites the chance to talk candidly across ideological lines, away from their phones and the pressures of social media, the news media, and their stakeholders.” Simone Collins, one half of that notorious pronatalist couple that had an unfortunate media glow-up a while back, previously worked as the managing director of the group.

A website that appears to belong to Dialog lends itself to the group's secretive vibe. There is pretty much nothing on the site except an email address and the tagline: “leaders join Dialog to discuss topics off-the-record.” We used that email to ask about the group's plans. Gizmodo also reached out to Thiel via Palantir.

The rich and powerful have always used exclusive, secretive clubs to advance their own agendas, so it definitely tracks that the newest band of tech oligarchs would want their own forum from which to plot world domination, or whatever it is that they're plotting. The group's founder, Thiel, is a major player in business, tech, and politics, and has flitted in and out of the spheres of influence connected to the current administration. Many of his associates and friends currently have positions in the government, and Palantir continues to work for the Trump White House while making money hand over fist. Dialog was also founded by Auren Hoffman, another tech bigwig and angel investor.

It's unclear how Dialog matches up in terms of “coolness” to other secretive groups. Yale's Skull and Bones Society (also known as the “Brotherhood of Death”), where multiple presidents have been members, and Prescott Bush, according to legend, helped steal Geronimo's skull, obviously ranks pretty high. Then there's the Bohemian Grove, the weird California retreat where powerful dudes get together to pee in the woods, wear ceremonial robes, and reportedly worship a giant owl statue. Your mileage may vary on how cool (or not) that is. The Bilderberg Group itself, while ominous, has always just seemed like a boring, albeit nefarious, business meeting, where the world's leaders get together to discuss how best to keep the globe's winners winning. Given that Dialog is staffed by a cadre of professional nerds, it seems unlikely that it's particularly cool—but there's no way to tell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Honda Is Giving Up on the All-Electric Dream","https://gizmodo.com/honda-is-giving-up-on-the-all-electric-dream-2000640532","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:16:44 GMT","

Honda just dealt a huge blow to the all-electric dream. In a stunning reversal, the Japanese auto giant has announced it is rethinking its electrification strategy, signaling that battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are no longer the holy grail of its future.

The move is a major setback for the EV industry, which is already reeling from the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits that made electric cars competitive with their gas-powered counterparts. For years, the auto industry, mesmerized by the success of Tesla, has been in an arms race to go all-electric. Now, one of its biggest players is pumping the brakes. Hard.

“BEVs are not the goal, better electric vehicles are a pathway to achieving carbon neutral, not necessarily the only pathway,” Honda Australia president and CEO, Jay Joseph, recently told the publication Drive. “BEVs will continue to improve, we're working on solid-state batteries, but our goal is carbon neutral, not battery electric vehicles.”

His statement confirms a dramatic strategic shift that Honda executives laid out during an August 6 press conference. They are no longer betting the farm on an all-electric future.

The reason for the pivot is simple: Honda's EV strategy has been a financial nightmare. During the press conference, Honda Managing Executive Officer Eiji Fujimura admitted that they are “not very optimistic” about the EV market, citing the impact of the expiring Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits and a general “cooling down of the market.” The company is “struggling with the sales of EV this year series,” Fujimura said, and needs to “expedite actions” to meet consumer expectations.

The financial results tell the real story. Honda's latest quarter was hammered by a one-time charge of 113.4 billion yen ($780 million) directly linked to its EV business. This included losses on EVs sold in the United States and a massive write-off of assets for EV models the company is now scrapping from its future lineup. The company now expects its full-year EV-related expenses to hit a staggering 650 billion yen ($4.47 billion).

Honda currently sells two EV models in the U.S., the Honda Prologue and the Acura ZDX. To sell them, the company has been forced to offer massive incentives. According to industry data from Motor Intelligence cited by Automotive News, Honda spent an average of more than $12,000 in promotions on each Prologue and an eye-watering $21,000 on each ZDX it sold last quarter.

Even with these huge discounts, the company's market share has declined.

These struggles are compounded by the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, a subsidy that helped convince many consumers to make the costly switch. Without it, the high sticker price of EVs and the lack of reliable charging infrastructure in many parts of the country become even bigger obstacles.

Faced with this brutal reality, Honda is turning to a strategy that, until recently, was mocked by EV purists. To achieve its carbon neutrality goals, the company will now lean heavily on hybrid vehicles, joining Toyota, whose cautious, hybrid-first approach was seen as outdated just a few years ago. Now, it looks prescient. A recent report from GlobalData indicated that between 2025 and 2035, virtually every popular Honda model in America would be offered as a hybrid.

“I think at some point we're going to be all-hybrid, all-electrified, but this is just another step in that particular transition,” Joseph confirmed to Drive.

Honda is also exploring hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), which convert hydrogen into electricity onboard. While FCEVs face their own infrastructure and cost challenges, they produce only water vapor as emissions.

Just a few years ago, BEVs were the industry's obsession and the clear symbol of the race to decarbonize. Now, Honda's retreat marks a new reality: the path to carbon neutrality is looking more complicated, and the BEV-only strategy is no longer sacred.

Honda's move doesn't just affect its own lineup. It sends a warning signal across the auto industry that the EV growth story is hitting limits. If one of the world's largest automakers is hedging its bets, other companies might follow, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels at a critical moment for climate goals.

Set to increase reliance on AMD and Nvidia hardware for now.

Tesla's custom Dojo wafer-level processor has always been an ambitious and promising hardware project, but despite early success with the company's bespoke chip, Musk has still used Nvidia GPUs in addition to Dojo. Today, this reportedly comes to an end as Tesla has decided to dismantle its Dojo supercomputer program, reassign its remaining staff to other computing projects, and turn more heavily to outside technology providers like AMD or Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Tesla has not formally confirmed the Dojo shutdown. 

Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, has recently ordered the Dojo effort to be entirely wound down, according to the report. As a result, Peter Bannon, the head of the Dojo project at Tesla, is reportedly set to leave the company. In fact, about 20 members of the team have left to join DensityAI, a startup created by former Tesla executives, in recent weeks, according to Bloomberg. Those who remain will be moved to other internal data centers and computing roles within Tesla, if the information is accurate. 

The company reportedly plans to deepen its partnerships with major suppliers of AI processors for data centers: Nvidia will keep supplying GPUs to Tesla, but Tesla will increase reliance on AMD. TSMC will produce the AI5 processor for next-generation Tesla vehicles starting in 2025, whereas Samsung Foundry will produce its successor, the AI6 processors, sometime towards the end of the decade.



Tesla officially started its Dojo supercomputer project in 2021 and attempted to build wafer-scale processors for AI training. The company planned to use its own cluster built on its own proprietary hardware to train AI powering the full self-driving (FSD) capability of its cars and the Optimus humanoid robot. However, Tesla never completely relied on Dojo supercomputers and used third-party hardware as well.

""We are pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo,"" Musk said at an earnings call in 2023. ""But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It is a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high."" 

However, Dojo had its own limitations when it came to memory capacity, and servers based on a wafer-scale processor were hard to produce as they used a lot of proprietary components. In fact, the roll-out of Dojo 2 hardware has been pretty slow, and the company expected to have a cluster equivalent to 100,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs up and running in 2026. Essentially, this meant that Tesla would run a cluster equivalent to xAI's Colossus in Fall 2024, but two years later. Recently, Musk implied that he would like Tesla cars' hardware and Dojo supercomputer hardware to run on the same architecture. 

""I think about Dojo 3 and the AI6 as the first [converged architecture designs],"" Musk said in a July 23 earnings call (via Investing.com). ""It seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there where it is basically the same chip that is used where we use, say, two of them in a car or an Optimus and maybe a larger number on a on a [server] board, a kind of 5 - 12 twelve on a board or something like that. […] That sort of seems like intuitively the sensible way to go.""

If Tesla follows Musk's direction, it will continue developing its own hardware for both edge devices and data centers, this time based on a converged architecture that avoids relying on exotic design decisions and proprietary components. Then again, this has not been formally confirmed yet.

Spice up your boring SSD with a cool M.2 cooler.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you have one of the best SSDs but find the cooler somewhat dull, Thermalright's latest HR-10 2280 Pro Digital could be just what you're looking for. The cooler, specifically designed for M.2 2280 drives, features an ARGB digital display that shows important information about your SSD.

The HR-10 2280 Pro Digital, available in white or black, builds on the existing HR-10 2280 Pro, with the primary difference being a digital display. This display shows the SSD's operating temperature, sequential read and write speeds, or the drive's utilization. Consequently, the HR-10 2280 Pro Digital requires a connection to your motherboard via a standard USB header, and you must install the Thermalright Control Center (TRCC) software.

The HR-10 2280 Pro Digital measures 3.56 x 1.02 x 2.01 inches (90.3 x 26 x 51 mm). It's roughly 16% taller than the original due to the addition of the digital display. Nonetheless, it should easily fit into your motherboard's primary M.2 slot, usually located between the graphics card and CPU cooler. However, it's wise to double-check the clearance space if either of these components is larger than usual or if your motherboard has a more compact layout.

The cooler has four 5 mm copper heat pipes that transfer heat from your SSD to the aluminum heatsink. Thermalright provides its Extreme Odyssey II silicon thermal pad, rated at 14.8 W/mk thermal conductivity, to fill the gap between the SSD and the cooler's cold plate. When the heat reaches the heatsink, a 30mm fan spinning between 3,500 and 6,500 RPM helps dissipate it. It's a PWM fan, so it'll require a 4-pin fan header on your motherboard.

Thermalright sells the HR-10 2280 Pro Digital for $19.36 in the Chinese market. It's a very reasonable price, considering that it's less than $3 more expensive than the regular HR-10 2280 Pro, which retails for $16.90 on Amazon. However, the HR-10 2280 Pro Digital is not yet available on Amazon, so if you want to be an early adopter, you'll have to pay a premium and purchase it through AliExpress for $32.53. We would recommend you wait, though, since it shouldn't take long before Thermalright lists the new cooler on Amazon and other stores in the US. The HR-10 2280 Pro Digital, like Thermalright's over M.2 coolers, comes with a limited one-year warranty.

$30 covers up to 10 machines for one year

Windows 10 will reach its end-of-life by October 14, 2025, meaning it will no longer receive new features, security updates, bug fixes, and technical support after this date. Users who do not want to abandon Windows 10 yet but want to keep their systems secure must pay $30 to enroll in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program from the company, although you can also redeem it for 1,000 Microsoft Reward points, or use it for free if you're backing up your PC settings.

However, the ESU program will not offer a lifetime of security updates to your old Windows 10 device. Instead, it just delays the inevitable and gives you a one-year extension until October 13, 2026. Furthermore, you do not get anything else with it, like technical support, so if something goes wrong with your system, you're on your own. Should you choose to enrol in the ESU, you also need your device to be running Windows 10 22H2 with the latest update installed and a Microsoft account.

Microsoft says that the ESU is tied to your Microsoft account, so you can use one $30 payment to keep up to ten Windows 10 computers updated for a year. However, this is also likely contentious among users who refuse to install Windows 11 because of its Microsoft account requirement. Redmond has been trying hard to get Windows users to sign up for a Microsoft account, with the company closing loopholes that let you use Windows 11 without signing up for its services. Thankfully, we still have a few available options to create a local Windows 11 account, so you don't have to give the tech giant your information.

So, unless you're willing to give Microsoft your information and create an account, you have no choice but to leave Windows 10 behind by October 14. This also applies to users who do not have eligible hardware, as Windows 11 refuses to support computers that do not have TPM 2.0 — but they at least have another year of security updates, if they choose to create a Microsoft account and pay the $30 fee (or redeem their Microsoft Rewards points).

The letter was sent to all Intel employees and subsequently made available via its newsroom

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has written a letter to the company's employees after the U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to step down, pointing to alleged conflicts of interest linked to his past financial involvement with Chinese chipmakers, reports DigiTimes. In the letter, he reassured the Intel staff that he has always operated 'within the highest legal and ethical' principles and that the company is working with the U.S. gov't to address the 'misinformation' matters.

According to corporate filings transpired earlier this year, Lip-Bu Tan controls more than 40 companies in China and holds minority stakes in over 600 others through investment firms he owns or manages, with a total value of at least $200 million. Some of these businesses supply or contract with the People's Liberation Army, and in many cases his stakes are co-held with Chinese state-owned enterprises or regional government-backed funds. While questions over Tan's background were already present when he became chief executive in March 2025, earlier this week Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board warning about national security risks that stem from Tan's investments while being the head of Walden International, the venture capital firm he founded in 1987 and still chairs, as well as two Hong Kong-registered entities — Sakarya Limited, which he owns outright, and Seine Limited, which is controlled by Walden.

Intel responded by stressing both the company's and Tan's alignment with U.S. strategic interests. The company reminded the U.S. government, and the nation, of more than half a century of domestic manufacturing. This includes the ongoing large-scale spending on R&D and semiconductor production within the country and the latest fabs in Arizona that will produce chips on Intel 18A process technology, which is the most advanced production node available in the U.S. Intel also noted it remains the only American firm still investing in leading-edge process development.

In his own message to Intel staff, Tan emphasized his 40+ years connection to the U.S., his gratitude for opportunities in the country, and his commitment to guiding the company through a critical period. He rejected claims of misconduct and described his career as built on trust and adherence to strict legal and ethical principles. Tan said concerns of the Senator and Trump stem from 'misinformation,' which is why Intel is engaging with the administration to clarify the facts, reiterated support for national and economic security, and highlighted progress toward high-volume production of 18A-based processors later this year. He also stressed that the Intel Board fully supports his work.

Industry insiders have suggested to DigiTimes a few possible reasons for the timing of Trump's concerns. Some believe Intel's advancement of its 14A and 18A process technologies may not align with the administration's vision for reshoring production. Others note that since Tan took over, job cuts have been deeper than anticipated, which include foundry divisions previously spared from reductions, which could run counter to Trump's stance on domestic employment. Discontented mid-to-senior executives could have conveyed these concerns to Cotton, prompting his outreach to Intel's board and Trump.

Interestingly, President Trump did not call Lip-Bu Tan's Intel leadership a concern for national security. Instead, he cited conflict of interests, which may point both at his financial interests as the chairman of Walden International and other investment entities, and to his backing of multiple Chinese tech firms, including some currently on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List for alleged links to China's government, military, and intelligence services.

""The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,"" Trump wrote. ""There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!""

Patients in England with advanced head and neck cancers will be fast-tracked into a trial of a new cancer vaccine using mRNA technology.

The investigational vaccine is designed to help the immune system recognise and destroy cancer cells containing human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins. NHS England said more than 100 patients will be matched to the trial over the next year at 15 NHS hospitals.

This is the third cancer vaccine study run through NHS England's Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad (CVLP), a national programme that matches eligible patients with nearby trials. 

Other CVLP trials are investigating vaccines for patients with colorectal carcinoma and with melanoma. The initiative is coordinated by the University of Southampton's Clinical Trials Unit.

More than 11,000 new head and neck cancer cases are diagnosed each year in England. Despite improvements in care, the advanced form of the disease is difficult to treat and has high rates of recurrence, with 2-year survival rates below 50%.

The investigational vaccine, known as BNT113, encodes two oncoproteins commonly found in HPV16-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma — the most common type, accounting for 95% of these types of cancers.

The AHEAD-MERIT trial is an open-label phase 2/3 randomised study. It will assess BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, vs pembrolizumab alone as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic HPV16-positive head and neck cancers expressing PD-L1.

Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England's national clinical director for cancer, called the vaccine “potentially transformative” and said it offered “renewed hope of holding the disease at bay.”

Chris Curtis, who was diagnosed with HPV-related head and neck cancer in 2011 and founded the support charity The Swallows, said the vaccine could help people “get on with their lives and move forward.”

The CVLP is part of a strategic partnership between NHS England, the government, and BioNTech. NHS England said it has accelerated cancer trial activity, with faster site activation and enrolment compared with standard processes.

The programme aims to match thousands more cancer patients to vaccine and immunotherapy trials in the future.

In April, NHS England announced that patients with advanced melanoma would be fast-tracked into the SCOPE study, a clinical trial for a new cancer vaccine.

Dr Iain Foulkes, executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said the CVLP was “an important route to fast-track promising mRNA vaccine technology into clinical trials.” He added, “Research into personalised cancer treatments is vital.”

Restricted coverage of medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) was associated with a higher risk for relapse, a new study showed.

Patients with MS enrolled in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans (MA-PDs) with broader formulary coverage were 8%-12% less likely to experience an MS relapse, while those in broad-coverage stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs) had 6%-9% lower odds of relapse.

The findings highlight that cost-saving measures used by pharmacy benefit managers to exclude certain drugs from formularies can have tangible negative outcomes, especially for patients with complex or chronic conditions.

“Patients with MS may need to try multiple drugs to find what works best for them. Broad formulary exclusions ultimately undermine the individualized care these patients need,” said lead author Geoffrey Joyce, PhD, director of Health Policy at the Schaeffer Center and chair in the Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Economics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, in a news release.

The study was published online on August 1 in JAMA Network Open.

Part of the push to exclude certain medications or seek rebates is due to the increasing number of therapies within the same class, the investigators noted.

Competition among manufacturers allows pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate better prices via the exclusion of more costly drugs from their formulary. This can prevent some patients from getting their prescribed medication, such as drugs for relapsing-remitting MS, which are not protected by Medicare's Part-D classifications.

A 2024 study showed that Medicare Part-D plan formularies excluded an average 44.7% of brand-only compounds and that drug restrictions for this plan increased over the study period of 2011-2020.

To investigate whether such exclusions were associated with relapse episodes for MS patients, the researchers analyzed Medicare data of 50,162 beneficiaries in PDPs (mean age, 58.5 years; 74.9% women; 80.7% White) and 34,708 in MA-PDs (mean age, 58.2 years; 77.2% women; 75.5% White).

The study timeline was divided into quarters, starting in 2019 (2020 Q2 was left out as a result of COVID-19 disruptions). To gauge patient outcomes, the first four quarters were used as a baseline period and the fifth quarter as the follow-up period.

Beneficiary severity of MS was evaluated using the expanded disability status scale derived from the disability/impairment scores. The researchers looked at 15 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the market from 2018 to 2022. In their analysis, the Medicare plans were assumed to cover the five intravenous MS DMTs.

The amount of on-formulary MS DMTs was calculated to give a four-quarter moving average and DMTs were classified as on formulary if their generic name was covered by the plans.

Plans were deemed low coverage if the four-quarter moving average of DMTs was below the plan's median during baseline. For the follow-up portion, logistic regression models were employed for MS relapse episodes, and Poisson or negative binomial regression models were used for nonbinary dependent variables such as the number of relapse episodes. Multivariable regression models were used to control for patient characteristics.

PDPs typically covered only four of the 15 drugs across four classes, while MA-PDs covered double this across five classes.

Many oral and injectable DMTs were frequently not covered by plans particularly in stand-alone plans, such as teriflunomide (amount of plans without compound on formulary: PDP, 87.7%; MA-DP, 43.3%), ofatumumab (PDP, 99.6%; MA-DP, 86%), and interferon beta-1a (PDP, 86.5%; MA-DP, 41.4%).

The rate of any MS relapse was higher for low-coverage plans compared with broader coverage plans for PDPs (10.6% vs 9.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.85-0.91]) and MA-PDs (7.8% vs 6.9%; OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]).

MS is most commonly diagnosed between 20 and 40 years of age — a limitation of the study was that most Medicare beneficiaries are older than this cohort. Other limitations were potential administration errors inherent in health claims data and that quarterly periods might not be sufficient to fully evaluate the relationship between formulary coverage and relapse episodes.

The researchers noted that the effect of such restrictions might be exacerbated for Part-D beneficiaries, thanks to the new $2000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug expenses.

“Innovative new treatments have made it possible to slow or prevent symptoms for some of the most complex diseases, but costs remain a challenge,” Joyce said. “We must find sustainable ways to ensure all patients can access these potentially life-changing treatments.”

Barbara Blaylock reported receiving contractor fees from the University of Southern California during the conduct of the study. This research was supported by grants from the American Medical Association and the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health.

Having a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) score, blood loss exceeding 100 mL, and a surgeon with fewer than 10 years of experience were linked to poor postoperative outcomes in a cohort study of 421 patients who had surgery for cancer.

“Identifying prognostic factors that are predictive of postoperative mortality and morbidity for patients in surgical units may help identify high-risk patients and tailor admission to critical care in a resource-constrained setting,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Bhavana Kulkarni, MBBS, DNB, Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Silchar, India. It was published online on July 30 in JCO Global Oncology.

The study was limited by missing data on weight loss during neoadjuvant therapy and lack of records on smoking cessation duration before surgery. Additionally, as the study was based on real-world data from a resource-constrained setting, the findings may not be generalizable to other contexts.

The study was supported by the Collaborative Medical Oncology Group, Chennai, India, and Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Silchar, for training program costs associated with the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative.

The structured, progressive “Walk 'n Watch” exercise protocol, delivered by physical therapists to patients in Canada with subacute stroke, was associated with greater improvement in walking endurance, speed, balance, mobility, and quality of life than usual care in a new phase 3 trial.

“The Walk 'n Watch protocol resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in walking endurance in patients with subacute stroke in a real-world setting. The protocol can be readily implemented into practice with minimal additional resources,” the investigators wrote.

The study was led by Sue Peters, PhD, School of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Elborn College, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on July 16 in The Lancet Neurology.

Data collection and recruitment were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The intracluster correlation coefficient for 6MWT was greater than what was seen in the pilot study, possibly due to greater heterogeneity in the types of sites in this trial.

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canada Brain Research Fund, Michael Smith Health Research BC, Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé, Canada Research Program, and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. Several investigators reported having financial ties with various organizations, and one investigator reported serving as chair of the Rehabilitation Care Alliance of Ontario and co-chair of the March of Dimes After Stroke Advisory Committee.

What is a letter of interest? This is arguably the most important letter you are going to send when you are a medical student applying for a residency program in The Match. 

The letter of interest is one letter that you are going to be sending out to your top program. After you've interviewed at all of your different programs, you are going to rank onenumber one, and you are going to send a letter of interest. 

Mine was about five paragraphs, where I talked about all of the reasons why I thought I was a good fit at their program and why their program was a good fit for my life. Then, you send the letter of interest to that one program. 

It is crucial that you are only sending a letter of interest to one place because you are telling them that you're ranking them number one, and that you promise to do so.It looks very bad if you end up sending a letter of interest to more than one program or if you send a letter of interest and end up not ranking them number one. 

It is a really important decision that you should think long and hard about, but it can really be a great strategy to let them know that you are really serious about going to that program.

Individuals who adopted a healthier lifestyle after their first screening colonoscopy had a lower risk for both colorectal cancer (CRC) and major chronic diseases.

“Our findings support CRC screening as a valuable teachable moment for encouraging lifestyle improvements to not only enhance CRC prevention but also reduce the risk of other major chronic diseases,” the authors wrote.

The study, led by Markus Dines Knudsen, PhD, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, was published online in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Residual confounding could not be ruled out due to the observational nature of the study. Self-reported data on screening and risk factors may have introduced measurement errors. Stratification by risk level was not done owing to the small number of CRC cases. The participant pool mainly consisted of White health professionals, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings.

This study was supported by grants to various authors from the US National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, Norwegian Cancer Society, the German Research Foundation, the Astri and Birger Torsted Endowment, and the Throne Holst Nutrition Research Foundation. One author disclosed consulting for Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer, Inc. and receiving grant support from Pfizer, Zoe Ltd., and Freenome for work outside of this study.

Treatment with ruxolitinib cream resulted in significant disease control over 52 weeks in a subset of children with moderate/more extensive atopic dermatitis (AD) in a randomized trial that evaluated both 0.75% and 1.5% strengths of the topical JAK inhibitor.

“Ruxolitinib cream monotherapy demonstrated substantial disease control and was well tolerated out to week 52 in the subset of children with moderate and/or more extensive atopic dermatitis consistent with the full TRuE-AD3 study population,” the authors wrote. “These long-term results suggest that ruxolitinib cream may simplify topical regimens for patients with moderate and/or more extensive atopic dermatitis and provide a potential alternative to systemic therapy,” they added. (Topical ruxolitinib, approved for mild-to-moderate AD in children aged 12 years and older, is under FDA review for treating AD in children aged 2 to 11 years.)

Some reassuring news for patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists: Concerns that the drugs may cause retinopathy may be overblown.

A new analysis of nearly 160,000 people with diabetes taking four different GLP-1 medications for at least a year has found no increased risk for diabetic retinopathy associated with the drugs.

“We found no difference in the risk of sight-threatening retinopathy between GLP-1 agents among adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate cardiovascular risk, and this supports choosing the most appropriate agent for patients without consideration of potential difference in diabetic retinopathy complications,” Andrew J. Barkmeier, MD, a retina specialist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, reported at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) 2025 Annual Meeting in Long Beach, California.

Barkmeier presented data from a retrospective analysis of patients in a commercial and Medicare database from 2014 through 2021 who were taking semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or exenatide.

The 2016 SUSTAIN-6 trial, which evaluated cardiovascular outcomes in people taking semaglutide for diabetes, reported participants had a 76% greater risk for retinopathy complications. Since then, Barkmeier said, clinicians have been concerned about the potential for eye damage in patients taking GLP-1 agents, and more specifically, semaglutide. A 2023 meta-analysis found that specific GLP-1s, along with patient demographic and clinical characteristics, may also influence the risk for diabetic retinopathy.

But Barkmeier told Medscape Medical News the new study “reassures the physicians prescribing these medications and the patients taking these medications that they can choose the most appropriate GLP-1 medication for them without having to consider potential differences in diabetic retinopathy risk.”

He and his colleagues performed a three-way comparison of patients initially treated with exenatide, dulaglutide, or liraglutide, along with a two-way comparison of semaglutide and dulaglutide over the latter years of the study, “when both of those medications were prominently prescribed,” Barkmeier told attendees at the meeting. Neither comparison found any differences in the primary composite outcome, which was treatment for diabetic macular edema or proliferative retinopathy, between the drugs.

In the three-way comparison, the rate of probability of requiring retina treatment for patients was 0.4% for all three GLP-1 agents at 2 years and 0.6%-0.7% at 3 years. In the two-way comparison, the probability of treating for retinopathy outcomes for dulaglutide and semaglutide was 0.5% and 0.4% at 2 years and 0.8% and 0.7% at 3 years, respectively.

The three-way comparison was noteworthy, Barkmeier said, because the median follow-up time was around 2.5 years, and more than 12,000 patients have at least 5 years of follow-up.

“The systemic benefits of these medications are so large, and the risks of reducing cardiovascular events are so clear that any continued research related to eye complications has to be weighed in the context of all the benefits,” Barkmeier told Medscape Medical News.

Geoffrey G. Emerson, MD, PhD, a retina specialist with Retina Consultants of Minnesota and president-elect of ASRS, said Barkmeier's research answers questions about GLP-1 drugs and retinopathy raised in previous research.

“His large cohort gives us confidence that GLP-1 agents are similar in terms of their effect on diabetic retinopathy, with generally beneficial effects,” Emerson told Medscape Medical News.

Studies have found GLP-1 medications may exacerbate diabetic macular edema early in the treatment, “but usually this is short-term and manageable,” Emerson said. “We still caution that any treatment that rapidly lowers hyperglycemia can temporarily worsen diabetic macular edema.”

The study suggests that retina specialists “should stay in our lane” and take care of retinopathy in patients taking GLP-1 agents, Emerson added.

“This story is far from over,” he said. “These obesity and diabetes treatments impact the eye in various ways, including perhaps worsening macular degeneration and probably reducing the risk of retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion, and late-stage diabetic retinopathy. Overall, we think the ocular effects are mostly beneficial, but stay tuned; this is a hot topic.”

The study was independently supported. Barkmeier reported having no relevant financial relationships. Emerson reported having relationships with Roche, Eli Lilly & Company, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Novartis.

COMMENTARY

Maurie Markman, MD

DISCLOSURES August 08, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to discuss a very interesting and controversial topic. The paper I'm discussing is “Germline Pathogenic Variants Identified in Patients With Genitourinary Malignancies Undergoing Universal Testing: A Multisite Single-Institution Prospective Study,” published in the Journal of Urology. 

It has been well recognized for over a decade that patients with ovarian cancer need to have germline testing, independent of whether they have a family history of that particular cancer because we identified particular mutations — BRCA mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 — that may not be evident in the family by history but are very relevantpotentially for cascade testing of their family members later. Also, of course, in that setting, there are therapeutic implications for the use of PARP inhibitors. 

Increasingly, the discussion is about more universal testing for patients with breast cancer because of the incidences of BRCA and other mutations that are both relevant for treatment and for the question of genetic counseling for other members of the family.

What about other tumor types? What about genitourinary (GU) cancers, as identified here? Should one take patients with all different kinds of GU tumors — prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancers, typically — and say there's a role for universal germline testing when a patient has been identified as having one of these cancers? 

To address this question, the group at the Mayo Clinic undertook comprehensive germline testing, examining for pathogenic germline variants at several sites from April 2018 to March 2020. This was a greater than 80-gene panel that was offered to patients. Today, that testing may be really quite different, but at that point it was greater than 80 genes that were tested for potential abnormality. 

A total of 601 patients enrolled with GU cancers. Again, this was across the sites and with GU cancers, regardless of a family history. There were 358 patients with prostate cancer, 106 with bladder cancer, and 137 with kidney cancer. Surprisingly, a majority of these patients, 86%, were male.

Here is the important bottom line. Pathogenic germline variants, most with risk of high penetrance, were identified in 82 individuals, or 14% of the population. First, they were seen in almost the same percentage in kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer, and that 14% is not that far off. In fact, it's quite similar to the statement about ovarian cancer in terms of the overall population — 14% of the patients with GU cancer.

Importantly, at this time, based on these data, fully 67% (or 2 of 3) patients had abnormalities that were potentially actionable. ""Actionable"" could mean a variety of things. It could mean there may be a therapy involved. It could mean that we need to talk to members of the family. They were not like, “Oh, that's interesting, but there's nothing we can do about it.” For 2 out of 3, they could actually do something actionable. 

Importantly, of those 82 patients, 35% had at least one relative undergo cascade testing to examine for that variant. 

The bottom line here is that more than 1 of 8 patients in this unselected group of patients with GU cancers had a variant finding that was potentially pathogenic at the germline level. This would argue for — although there is going to be controversy and we need more data — universal testing, certainly of GU tumors, and one might ask for other tumor types. 

We need more data to confirm that. This would obviously be an extensive, new universal recommendation with costs associated with it, but this paper certainly raises that question that needs to be further examined. 

Thank you for your attention.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Cannabis and psychedelics were rated as the most effective drugs for symptom relief by survey participants with eating disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder (BED). On the other hand, patients perceived prescription antidepressants as mainly providing benefits for overall mental health.

“These findings highlight an important pattern: with traditional medications often falling short in treating eating disorders directly, while many individuals are self-medicating with substances they perceive as helpful,” lead investigator Sarah-Catherine Rodan, the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia, said in a press release.

The results also suggest that “more research, including large clinical trials, should be undertaken around the beneficial effects of cannabis and psychedelics for people with eating disorders,” she added.

The study was published online on July 22 in JAMA Network Open.

The study predominantly involved high-income English-speaking countries and participants with internet access, potentially introducing a selection bias. The sample may have also been influenced by novelty-seeking individuals or those with positive experiences with drugs. The reliance on self-diagnosis without formal assessment of EDs or comorbid conditions, along with potential recall bias in self-reporting of drug use and clinical features, limited the generalizability of findings. Some findings involved relatively small numbers of people with specific diagnoses using specific drugs, and the positive public perception of cannabis and psychedelics may have influenced ratings through expectation and placebo effects.

The study was funded by the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney. Several investigators reported having financial ties with various sources, and some reported holding share options, patents, and expert-witness roles with pharmaceutical and cannabis-industry entities. Full details are listed in the original article.

Ultraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public.

A new Science Advisory from the American Heart Association, ""Ultraprocessed Foods and Their Association with Cardiometabolic Health: Evidence, Gaps and Opportunities,"" summarizes current knowledge about UPFs and their impact on cardiometabolic health, and outlines opportunities for research, policy and regulatory reform to improve dietary intake and overall health. The manuscript published today in Circulation, the flagship journal of the American Heart Association.

The relationship between UPFs and health is complex and multifaceted. We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. And if certain additives and processing steps used to make healthier food like commercial whole grain breads have any health impact.""

Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory

The rapid rise in UPF consumption since the 1990s disrupted traditional dietary patterns, potentially contributing to adverse health effects. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. As detailed in a CDC report published yesterday, 55% of calories consumed by people ages 1 and older in the U.S. were UPFs. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. In addition, families with lower mean income had a higher percentage of UPFs consumed per day: 54.7% for the lowest income group vs. 50.4% for highest income group.

UPFs are relatively inexpensive, convenient for use and aggressively marketed, particularly toward youth and under-resourced communities, often displacing healthier alternatives. This shift resulted in lowering the overall nutritional quality of typical eating patterns in the U.S. and is misaligned with the American Heart Association's dietary guidance.

This new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to:

UPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Human diets are increasingly including more industrially processed foods, leading to various systems for classifying foods based on processing criteria. Multiple food classification systems exist currently; this Science Advisory focuses on the Nova framework for food classification. The Nova system, the most widely used, is based on the nature, extent and purpose of the food's industrial food processing. However, the Nova categorization does not consider the nutritional quality of foods. Certain types of industrial food processing are beneficial for preservation and safety, and/or lowering cost, such as techniques that extend shelf life, control microbial growth, mitigate chemical toxicants, preserve functional, nutritional and sensory (taste) qualities, and reduce food loss and waste.

Efforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers.

The writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as ""better-for-you alternatives.""

A meta-analysis of prospective studies cited in the advisory found a dose-response relationship between UPF consumption and cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, transient ischemic attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality. High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs-what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs.

Research has also found that there may be underlying mechanisms that affect eating behaviors and obesity for some people, and that UPFs may promote obesity. UPFs frequently contain combinations of ingredients and additives that are uncommon in whole foods to enhance palatability and reduce cost, and these may influence reward-related brain activity. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain.

Balancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs:

""More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. In the meantime, the Association continues to urge people to cut back on the most harmful UPFs that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium, and excessive calories and instead follow a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and lean proteins like fish, seafood or poultry-for better short- and long-term health,"" said Vadiveloo.

This Science Advisory was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; and the Stroke Council. American Heart Association scientific statements and advisories promote greater awareness about cardiovascular diseases and stroke issues and help facilitate informed health care decisions. Scientific statements outline what is currently known about a topic and what areas need additional research. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. American Heart Association guidelines provide the Association's official clinical practice recommendations.

Bone defects are a major challenge in regenerative medicine, often requiring advanced biomaterials to enhance the natural healing process. Traditional bone repair methods, including bone grafts, face limitations in terms of tissue compatibility and regeneration efficiency. The development of scaffolds that combine inorganic bioactive components with biocompatible polymers has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. Based on these obstacles, further research is needed to develop scaffolds that not only mimic the bone matrix but also provide therapeutic ions to enhance regeneration.

Published (DOI: 10.1093/burnst/tkaf028) in Burns & Trauma in 2025, this research presents a groundbreaking approach in bone tissue engineering. The study introduces a composite scaffold made from poly(lactic acid)/gelatin fibers and silica-strontium oxide (SiO2-SrO) nanofibers. These materials were electrospun to create a scaffold that promotes bone regeneration through the release of bioactive ions. The scaffold's performance was tested both in vitro and in a rat calvarial defect model, demonstrating its potential for practical application in regenerative medicine.

The researchers utilized a combination of poly(lactic acid) and gelatin fibers, blended with SiO2-SrO nanofibers, to create a highly porous, three-dimensional scaffold. The SiO2-SrO fibers were selected for their ability to release bioactive ions such as Si4+ and Sr2+, which are known to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In vitro tests revealed that the scaffold supported cell proliferation and migration, with the highest performance seen in the PG/SiO2-SrO-2 group. Moreover, the scaffold's mechanical strength was significantly enhanced compared to other control groups, supporting its potential as a reliable material for bone tissue engineering. In vivo studies in rat models demonstrated the scaffold's superior ability to promote bone healing, with significant bone regeneration observed at 12 weeks post-implantation.

Dr. Yuan Xu, one of the lead researchers, commented on the findings: ""The combination of SiO2 and SrO fibers with the poly(lactic acid)-gelatin matrix offers a novel solution for enhancing bone regeneration. The scaffold not only promotes bone growth but also accelerates the formation of new blood vessels, making it a versatile material for clinical applications in bone repair.""

This composite scaffold shows significant promise in advancing bone tissue engineering, particularly for applications involving bone defect repair. By mimicking the natural bone extracellular matrix and releasing therapeutic ions, the scaffold could be used for various clinical applications, including orthopedic surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Additionally, the scaffold's ability to promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis highlights its potential for broader biomedical uses, such as in tissue regeneration and wound healing.

Medicines have a unique chemical fingerprint, according to a new study from the University of Copenhagen. Researchers say this knowledge can be used to trace counterfeit or stolen medicine.

426,016. That's how many packages of illegal medicines EU agencies confiscated during an eight-month operation in 2024. During the operation, they managed to find counterfeit medicines worth 11.1 million euros. And it's an increasingly bigger problem. ""Pharmaceutical crime is a growing threat in the EU,"" Europol stated earlier this year.

Fortunately, a new weapon against pharmaceutical counterfeiting may be on the way. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen and Stanford University have shown in a new study that it is possible to distinguish seemingly identical medicines at the molecular level – both across manufacturers in different countries and even from the same manufacturer.

The specific study examines the approved drug ibuprofen, but the underlying technology can be used to trace the origin of all types of medicine, according to the researchers.

""All medicines have a unique chemical fingerprint that allows identification down to the specific factory where it was produced,"" says Else Holmfred, Postdoc at the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen and Stanford University, and lead author of the new study. She adds:

""Imagine a pharmaceutical company has a shipment of medicine stolen, which was discarded due to insufficient quality. Later, some criminals repackage the medicine with the intent to resell it. With this technology, it's possible to accurately determine where the medicine originally came from and thereby prove it was stolen.""

In the study, researchers focus on variants of chemical elements – so-called isotopes – when identifying medicines and their origin: isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

Stable isotopes are incredibly useful because they don't change over thousands or millions of years. And since all medicines are made from synthesized organic substances or substances derived from plants, they always contain something organic and thus carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. This could be, for example, corn starch or cellulose.""

Stefan Stürup, Associate Professor at the Department of Pharmacy and co-author of the study

The substances used in medicine are all produced under unique conditions, which affects their isotopic signature.

""The isotopic composition of a plant substance is determined by where in the world it comes from, what type of water it used, and what type of photosynthesis it performs. Depending on this, the ratio between carbon-12 and carbon-13 changes slightly. This ratio is unique to each plant. That's why it's impossible to fake isotopes,"" says Stefan Stürup.

The next step in the research is to demonstrate that specific counterfeits can be found. Else Holmfred is investigating this in an upcoming study.

""The follow-up study hasn't been published yet, but I'm currently working with data where we can clearly see examples of counterfeit medicines. We can see that the counterfeit medicine has a significantly different isotopic signature than the medicine from the manufacturer. The tablets look almost identical, so it's hard to document that they're counterfeit unless you can chemically prove they're different,"" she says.

Such analyses of medicines are also relatively easy to implement. It just requires the right equipment.

""If you have a suitable laboratory and want to analyze 50 samples, it takes about 24 hours,"" says Else Holmfred.

Researchers in Denmark show that every extra hour of daily screen use in kids and teens increases cardiometabolic risk, but getting enough sleep may help protect their hearts.

Study: Screen Time Is Associated With Cardiometabolic and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Childhood and Adolescence. Image Credit: vinnstock / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers leveraged data from two Danish longitudinal cohorts comprising more than 1,000 mother-child participants to uncover the impacts of screen time on concurrent cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents. The study revealed that increased screen time, an increasingly worrisome trend in today's society, is associated with higher cardiometabolic risk.

Encouragingly, however, longer sleep duration might help to weaken this association, with adequate sleep linked to a reduced strength of the relationship between screen time and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. Researchers also identified a novel blood-based ""metabolomic signature"" for high screen time that predicted screen time exposure across cohorts, and separately found that higher screen time in adolescents was associated with a higher predicted risk of future cardiovascular disease based on an NMR-derived CVD risk score.

These findings underscore the critical interplay between screen use and sleep in shaping early-life cardiovascular health, while emphasising that the results are observational and cannot prove causality, thereby shaping future public health policy.

Screen time impacted teen body composition differently by sex: While boys showed steeper increases in BMI, fat mass, and muscle mass with more screen time, girls saw weaker or non-significant changes.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the world's leading non-communicable causes of human mortality, with their origins traceable to exposures from childhood and even infancy. The accumulation of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, such as high blood pressure, adverse cholesterol levels, excess waist circumference, and insulin resistance during youth, sets the stage for adult disease.

Alarming, our increasingly sedentary world of today, dominated by screen time, exacerbates known CVD-associated risk factors, including obesity and unhealthy dietary patterns. While previous research has linked high screen time to these individual risk factors, the relationship is complex, and it is often difficult to untangle the effects of screen time from other lifestyle factors like physical activity and, most importantly, sleep.

CVDs' staggeringly high mortality rates (~19.8 million / 32% of all global deaths) and the fact that their global burden is rising necessitate the identification of early-life interventions that may safeguard our future generations from the dangers of heart disease.

Changes in screen habits mattered: When researchers tracked kids from age 6 to 10, the increase in their screen time over those years was more strongly tied to worsening insulin resistance than their starting point.

The present study aims to address this gap in the literature by leveraging two deeply phenotyped longitudinal Danish cohorts (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood [COPSAC2010 and COPSAC2000]) to provide a more comprehensive picture of how screen time, sleep, and cardiometabolic health are intertwined during critical early developmental periods.

The study dataset comprised socio-demographic and medical health records from more than 1,000 children (6-10 years) and adolescent (~18 years) participants. Screen usage (including screen time) was collected via discretionary reporting (parents) or from adolescents. The study's primary outcome of interest was a composite cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score, calculated from Z-scores of five key measures: 1. waist circumference, 2. systolic blood pressure, 3. high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 4. triglycerides, and 5. glucose.

Lifestyle factors, including sleep duration and physical activity, were objectively measured using accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X+) worn for 14 days. To explore the underlying biology of screen time-sleep-CVD risk associations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics of participants' blood samples was carried out, and a supervised machine learning model was trained to identify a ""metabolic signature"" of high screen time.

Linear mixed models assessed the association between screen time and CMR. In tandem with metabolic signature profiles, these were used to generate a 10-year CVD risk score for each participant.

The present study identified a distinct positive link between screen time (among children and adolescents) and concurrent cardiometabolic risk. Even after accounting for socio-demographic and medical confounders (age, sex, chronic disease), each additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a significant increase in the CMR score in both children (β=0.08, P=0.021) and adolescents (β=0.13, P=0.001).

Crucially, sleep duration was a powerful moderator of this risk. The association between screen time and higher CMR was significantly stronger in children and adolescents who slept less (P for interaction = 0.029 in children, 0.012 in adolescents).

Why might screens and sleep interact? The paper suggests evening light exposure from devices could disrupt natural melatonin rhythms, potentially explaining how late screen use worsens metabolic health.

In childhood, sleep duration also mediated about 12% of the association between screen time and CMR, and later sleep onset was linked to a higher risk. In adolescence, later sleep onset was independently associated with CMR, and sleep duration again moderated the relationship. This indicates that adequate sleep may help buffer against the metabolic effects of high screen time.

The metabolomics analysis identified a distinct ""signature"" comprising 37 individual biomarkers associated with screen time and predictive of screen time exposure. This signature, which included elevated triglycerides and altered lipoprotein profiles, was robust enough to be identified in the childhood cohort and then successfully validated in the adolescent cohort. Separately, adolescents were observed to be more vulnerable to the effects of higher screen time, which was significantly associated with a higher predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (β=0.07, P=0.017) based on an adult-trained NMR cardiovascular risk score.

In addition, no significant associations between screen time and anthropometric measures were found in children, while in adolescents, particularly boys, screen time was linked to higher BMI, fat mass, and other body composition measures.

Although some associations appeared stronger in boys, formal interaction tests showed no statistically significant sex differences.

The present study provides strong evidence linking increased screen time and poor cardiometabolic health in both childhood and adolescence, but as an observational study, it cannot prove causation. It demonstrates a dose-response association between these factors. Notably, sleep duration was found to potentially protect against the detrimental impacts of higher screen time. Finally, identifying a blood-based metabolomic signature for high screen time and a separate CVD risk score associated with screen time in adolescents offers mechanistic insights and opens the door for new biomarkers to identify at-risk youth and implement timely interventions.

The authors highlight that their moderation and mediation analyses are exploratory and that reported screen time data could be subject to bias. They recommend that future research use objective measures of screen exposure, sleep timing, and duration, and explore whether interventions targeting both screen use and sleep patterns can improve cardiometabolic outcomes.

The emerging role of SETD2 in regulating immune cell function is shedding light on potential therapeutic strategies for a range of immune-related diseases. As a key methyltransferase, SETD2 facilitates the trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3), a modification crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene transcription. Recent discoveries indicate that SETD2 not only influences tumorigenesis but also plays a pivotal role in the development, differentiation, and function of immune cells.

SETD2's involvement in the immune system spans across both innate and adaptive immunity. It has been found to be essential in the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), maintaining a balance critical for immune homeostasis. The loss of SETD2 in HSCs can lead to genome instability, increased differentiation towards progenitors, and HSC exhaustion. This disruption not only impairs immune function but also poses a risk of malignant transformation.

Within the innate immune response, SETD2 has a significant impact on macrophage polarization. It inhibits the M1 macrophage activation pathway by suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), thereby reducing inflammatory responses. Conversely, reduced levels of SETD2 are linked to increased M1 polarization and glycolytic activity, which could exacerbate conditions like acute lung injury and osteomyelitis. Furthermore, SETD2 expression in mast cells has been shown to mitigate systemic mastocytosis, where its loss can lead to advanced forms of the disease.

SETD2 also plays a critical role in the adaptive immune system, particularly within T cell development and function. The absence of SETD2 impairs T cell receptor (TCR) recombination, leading to developmental arrest and T cell lymphopenia. Additionally, SETD2 influences the balance between Treg and Th17 cell differentiation, where it promotes Treg stability while suppressing pro-inflammatory Th17 responses. Such regulatory effects are crucial for controlling autoimmune reactions and maintaining immune tolerance.

In B cell biology, SETD2 is indispensable for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, crucial for antibody diversity and adaptive immunity. Loss of SETD2 leads to defective V(D)J recombination, hampering B cell development and predisposing cells to lymphomagenesis. Moreover, germinal center B cells with reduced SETD2 function exhibit impaired DNA damage sensing, promoting B-cell lymphoma progression.

As research advances, understanding the mechanistic pathways regulated by SETD2 will unlock new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. Targeting SETD2 could potentially modulate immune cell functions, offering novel treatments for autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, and hematological malignancies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially designated Health Canada, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare/Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (MHLW/PMDA) of Japan, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom as WHO-Listed Authorities (WLAs), a status granted to national authorities that meet the highest international regulatory standards for medical products.

With these latest designations, WHO expands the growing list of WLAs, now involving 39 agencies across the world, supporting faster and broader access to quality-assured medical products, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

In addition, the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) – one of the first regulatory authorities to complete the WLA assessment for both medicines and vaccines in October 2023 – has had its listing scope successfully expanded, now covering all regulatory functions.

This recognition reflects the deep commitment of these authorities to regulatory excellence. Their designation as WHO-Listed Authorities is not only a testament to their robust regulatory systems but also a critical contribution to global public health. Strong and trusted regulators help ensure that people everywhere have access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical products.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

Around 70% of countries worldwide still face significant challenges due to weak or inadequate regulatory systems for evaluating and authorizing medical products. The WLA framework promotes regulatory convergence, harmonization and international collaboration, allowing WHO Prequalification Programme and regulatory authorities, especially those in LMICs, to rely on the trusted work and decisions of designated agencies. This collaboration supports efficient use of limited resources, enabling better and faster access to quality-assured life-saving medical products to millions more people.

""The principle of reliance is central to WHO's approach to regulatory systems strengthening and a cornerstone for effective, efficient and smart regulatory oversight of medical products,"" said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data. ""WHO-Listed Authorities are key enablers in promoting trust, transparency, and faster access to quality-assured medical products, especially in low- and middle-income countries.""

In a world where health threats, including substandard and falsified medical products, know no borders, WLAs also serve as critical pillars of preparedness and equity, making life-saving products available more broadly, rapidly and efficiently.

The designations follow a rigorous performance evaluation process carried out by WHO using its globally recognized benchmarking and assessment tools. These evaluations were reviewed by the Technical Advisory Group on WLAs (TAG-WLA), which convened in June 2025.

Canada, Japan and the UK's regulatory authorities were previously recognized as Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs). Their designation under the WLA framework marks an important step in moving beyond the old SRA system, while ensuring continuity and stability in global procurement processes of quality-assured medical products.

Launched in 2022 to replace the previous SRA model, the WLA initiative provides a transparent and evidence-based pathway for global recognition of regulatory authorities to facilitate regulatory convergence and reliance. It builds on decades of WHO leadership to help countries work together more closely on regulating medical products, speeding up access to safe, effective and quality-assured medical products for people around the world.

ZURICH, Switzerland -- The U.S. was knocked off the top spot in FIFA's latest women's rankings by world champion Spain.

Spain regained the No. 1 position despite losing to England in the final of the European Championship last month.

The U.S. held the top position since August last year after winning gold at the Paris Olympics. Spain was No. 1 from December 2023 to June last year after its World Cup triumph.

The latest rankings were released Thursday by world governing body FIFA.

England, which has won back-to-back Euros and lost to Spain in the final at the 2023 World Cup, moved up one place to fourth.

Brazil dropped three positions and is seventh despite successfully defending the Copa America to win its ninth continental title.

Sweden and France were big movers after impressive showings at the Euros.

Sweden rose three places and is third after being eliminated on penalties by England in the quarterfinals.

France moved up four places to sixth after also losing in the quarterfinals.

Another European club season is right around the corner, and it is the last one leading up to the 2026 World Cup. So which U.S. men's national team players have the most to prove in Europe? 

Here are five players to keep an eye on. And just like a power ranking, if you don't like it or if you disagree with it, that's fine. Get your own rankings!

5. Sergiño Dest | Defender | PSV Eindhoven

Dest is back on the field from his ACL injury and, so far, signs are good. I think beyond him proving that he can stay healthy this upcoming season, there are some interesting tactical questions when it comes to whether he is good enough to play defensively under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. But you take the good with the bad, and there's so much more good in terms of Dest going forward.

Whether it's Pochettino or anybody else, I think most of his coaches have come to the realization that you can't hold him back. When Dest wants to defend, I think he can do it. It's just a question of whether he wants to defend. 

I think it's hard to keep him off of the pitch. Whether it's four or three in the back, I think he's going to be somewhere on that right side and I think he is going to be potent. If Dest is healthy and ready to go next summer in the World Cup, that right side looks very, very different. And I'm a lot more bullish about this team in general. 

4. Tim Weah | Winger | Marseille 

I've also been bullish about Weah needing to start in that right wing spot and the ability to stretch the field. But you need to factor in the emergence of Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, and Christian Pulisic's ability to play on the right. So Weah is going to have a fight on his hands to hold on to a starting spot for 2026. 

But Weah has played six different positions. He's versatile and I still argue that over the last cycle he was the most consistent on the right-hand side. And that's where I want to see him now, playing on that side and doing good things. I think it's going to be hard for Luna or anybody else to come in and take that spot. 

It seems Weah feels very comfortable with the decision to go to Marseille after his time at Juventus. We want him playing, and I ideally would have him starting consistently over on that right-hand side.3. Yunus Musah, | Midfielder | AC Milan 

Musah has a tremendous amount to prove. Obviously, he wasn't involved again this summer with the USMNT at the Gold Cup. And we can surmise that, whatever the situation was, it wasn't ideal for Pochettino nor for this team.

I go back to when Musah first burst on the scene and was penciled into the USMNT midfield at a very young age. There were those moments where he would get the ball, playing alongside Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie, and he would push the ball and have an incredible burst of speed. He could get out of situations that would then send the U.S. team into a much more attacking type of mode.

What remains to be seen is whether we were already looking at Musah's ceiling and if that's as good as it gets. If that's the case, that's not good enough, especially when you're not playing. I still think there's something in the tank, maybe not a starter, but maybe he can start to ask some questions.

2. Folarin Balogun | Striker | Monaco

The reason why I put Balogun here is that this No. 9 position, the striker position, still has not been. And there are just over 300 days until the World Cup. 

We have seen Balogun do great things. He was the anointed one when he burst on the scene. But obviously it's been a long time since we saw him. He's endured injuries in his two years at Monaco, but luckily for him nobody has come along and taken that spot, even with Ricardo Pepi proving his worth.  

So if Balogun is playing, if he's scoring goals, he's right back in there when it comes to being the striker for the national team.

1. Gio Reyna | Midfielder | Borussia Dortmund

I know that there are people out there that roll their eyes because we talked about Reyna so much. But again, it's relative to the fact that this player is undeniably talented.

We don't know if he's even going to get called in going forward, and he's certainly not going to get called in if he can't change his playing situation. We still don't even know where he's going to end up after being linked with a move to Parma. But if he moves, or stays at Dortmund and things drastically change, then it would take very little for people to get right back on the Reyna train.

If he gets a run of games where he is productive, and obviously he is healthy, I think people are going to say Reyna is back, and he is absolutely in the mix for the USMNT. From where he is right now, the gap can close dramatically.

Streaming service Netflix (NFLX) has secured the exclusive broadcast rights for the FIFA Women's World Cup soccer games featuring the Canadian team that are to be held in 2027 and 2031.





Netflix had previously secured the same broadcast rights for the U.S. women's team. The deal with Canada and America marks a major change in how World Cup soccer tournaments are broadcast. Until now, the tournament, which is among the most widely watched sporting events in the world, has been shown on public television networks.

However, Netflix is pushing further into live sporting events in an effort to drive monthly subscriptions. The streaming giant already airs live football, boxing, and wrestling events. The Women's World Cup marks the streaming service's first foray into live soccer matches. 

Netflix is focused on building a global audience. “We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada — a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history,” said FIFA, organizer of World Cup events, in a written statement.

The 2027 World Cup will be hosted in Brazil from June 24 to July 25 and feature 32 teams from around the world. Netflix will air all the games at that tournament involving the Canadian women's soccer team. The host country for the 2031 tournament will be announced on April 30, 2026 in Vancouver, Canada.

FIFA has called the Women's World Cup the biggest women's sporting event in the world, saying that the 2023 tournament attracted more than two billion viewers across television, streaming, and social media platforms. Canada's women's soccer team won gold at the 2020 Summer Olympics and is a contender to possibly win a FIFA Women's World Cup. 

The stock of Netflix has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 37 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 25 Buy, 11 Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The average NFLX price target of $1,395.19 implies 21.55% upside from current levels.

The U.S. Travel Association is “raising concerns about a new cost” with which foreign travelers coming to the U.S. for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 L.A. Games will have to contend, according to Daniel Barnes of POLITICO. Under a new law, the Department of Homeland Security “must start charging visa applicants a $250 fee at the time their application is approved.” The fee will be “revised annually to keep up with inflation,” meaning it “could be higher by the time” of LA28. The Congressional Budget Office “estimated the fee would raise around” $28.9B over the next decade. The travel industry group on Friday announced the “launch of the America's Sports and Travel Mega Event Coalition,” a new effort to “support the president's focus on the mega sporting events” and urge administration officials to “delay implementation of the visa fee or lean on Congress to remove it altogether.” Monument Advocacy, which has worked with the U.S. Travel Association since 2006, will lead the lobbying efforts. The coalition, which includes Marriott International, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), American Airlines and others, also “plans to push for increased U.S. consular staffing and expanded hours of operation to make the visa process more efficient” (POLITICO, 8/7).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Many players are expected to depart Manchester City over the coming weeks. 

The Premier League club have found it hard to move on unwanted players so far during the current transfer window, but it is a necessity, as Pep Guardiola has made it clear that he wants to work with a smaller group of players throughout the 2025/26 campaign.  

One of the easier ways to achieve this is by loaning out younger stars, with Vitor Reis set to join Girona ahead of the new season, while Jahmai Simpson-Pusey has already completed a temporary switch to Celtic. 

There is another member of Guardiola's squad who is in high demand, and the 19-year-old recently received a phone call from a World Cup winner about leaving Man City to join his club. 

It was reported last week that Roma have joined the race for Claudio Echeverri, with the Italian club keen on signing the Argentina star on loan with the option of buying him in the future. 

Man City have rejected Roma's loan offer for Echeverri this week, which included a £29m (€33m) mandatory purchase clause, as the Premier League club have no intention of letting the midfielder leave permanently. 

According to Mundo Deportivo, Girona now look like the 19-year-old's destination for the upcoming season, as the La Liga club are Man City's preference for Echeverri after rejecting Roma's proposal. 

The Manchester club view the move as a perfect one for the midfielder as Girona fit into City Football Group's usual strategy: to acclimate the player to a competitive league in Europe, while the player joins a stable environment with a style of play similar to Guardiola's.

Echeverri would prefer a move to Roma as he is intrigued by their project and has received direct calls from fellow countrymen, Paulo Dybala and Matías Soulé, who have been trying to convince him to move to the Italian capital. 

However, that looks unlikely, as Manchester City have full control of the player and seem to have a plan in place for his development. 

Although Echeverri's future is complicated, one loan deal that has got over the line is Max Alleyne to Watford, with the Championship club announcing their new signing on Friday morning. 

Time to meet someone new. pic.twitter.com/nvFU7dgpUr

This move had been lined up for some time, with Alleyne signing a new Man City contract before joining the Hornets for the 25/26 campaign.

The Manchester club have a lot of faith in the talent of the defender, and gaining experience of first-team football will benefit the 20-year-old ahead of next summer, as the youngster will be hoping to break into Guardiola's plans.

International TV Co-Editor


	Game on – Netflix has acquired the exclusive rights to the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031 in Canada.


	The streaming deal is the first of its kind in Canada, and comes after Netflix secured U.S. rights to the tournaments. That deal marked the first time Netflix had bought up a sports competition in full.


	The tournament in two years will be held in Brazil, and will see Champions Spain looking to defend their trophy. Runners-up from the Australia and New Zealand 2023 tournament, England, got a modicum of revenge for narrowly losing that final by defeating Spain in the climax of this year's UEFA European Women's Championship over the summer. Four-time winners USA were knocked out of World Cup 2023 by Sweden in the round of 16.

	“We are thrilled that Netflix will be FIFA's exclusive partner in Canada for the Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031,” said Gabe Spitzer, Vice President, Sports at Netflix. “With under two years to go until the first match in Brazil, we are hard at work on planning and aim to give fans unparalleled access to the most prestigious competition in women's football.”

	FIFA's Chief Business Officer, Romy Gai, added: “Following the landmark agreement between FIFA and Netflix in the United States relating to the exclusive rights to the 2027 and 2031 editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup, we are pleased to extend the footprint of our partnership with Netflix to Canada. We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada – a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history.”


	Netflix's deals for the Women's FIFA World Cup have ramped up its efforts in live sports, which to date have included the likes of the recent Katie Taylor vs Amanda Serrano 3 boxing match – 2025's most-watched professional women's sporting event – and its predecessor last year, which drew an even bigger audience of 74 million live viewers. It also includes the derided but much-viewed Jake Paul v Mike Tyson boxing match, weekly WWE Raw programming from the sports entertainment world, NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming Saul Canelo v. Terence Crawford fight next month.

	











	On the soccer front, Netflix has counts on its slate the likes of Captains of the World, which was a partnership with FIFA, along with Under Pressure: The U.S. Women's World Cup Team, Neymar: The Perfect Chaos, Beckham, Sunderland 'Til I Die, Boca Juniors Confidential and upcoming documentaries on Vinícius Júnior and José Mourinho. 


	The Brazil World Cup in 2027 will run from June 24 to July 25 and feature 32 teams. The following 2031 edition, whose host is expected to be selected in the second quarter of next year, will feature an expanded 48 teams.

The Spaniard will get the reception he deserves when he returns to Old Trafford on Saturday, but that doesn't mean he should have been kept in 2023

When Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag in October 2024, there was the usual outpouring of tributes from his players. Bruno Fernandes wrote: ""Thank you for everything, boss! I appreciate the trust and the moments we shared. I wish you all the best for the future. Even though this last period hasn't been great for any of us, I hope the fans can hold on to the good things the manager did for our club."" 

Alejandro Garnacho chimed in: ""I will always be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity and the confidence to play for this club. It hasn't gone as well as we wanted, but I will remember the good times we had together, and I wish you all the best in the future.""

Luke Shaw said he was ""grateful for what we achieved together""; Kobbie Mainoo thanked Ten Hag ""for giving me the opportunity to play for my boyhood club""; Lisandro Martinez said ""we're really feeling it"". 

One former United player, however, had a different reaction to the news. Around three hours after United announced Ten Hag had been fired, David de Gea popped up on X. He had no words, instead posting an emoji of a cupped hand, a gesture famous in Italy to express disbelief or displeasure. While it is impossible to say exactly what De Gea was thinking or even if he was referring to Ten Hag, it certainly seemed like he was celebrating the Dutch manager's departure. And given how Ten Hag treated De Gea, who can blame him?

Saturday's friendly between United and Fiorentina will see De Gea return to Old Trafford for the first time since his acrimonious departure, giving the goalkeeper the chance to properly say goodbye to the supporters after being denied a proper farewell by the nature of his exit in the summer of 2023. 

And as well as regret about the way the club treated one of their greatest players, there is bound to be a lot of revisionism in the stands and a feeling that United should have kept hold of him rather than replace him so suddenly with Andre Onana. It is important, though, that United fans take off their rose-tinted spectacles and remember that the club were right to move on from De Gea; they simple chose the wrong successor.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Following in the footsteps of Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi, the midfielder is generating buzz in Catalunya ahead of his return

There are some clubs that are able to churn out young players and bed academy talent into the first-team squad more seamlessly than others. At the very top level, there is no club better at that than Barcelona.

Lamine Yamal is the latest graduate of La Masia to take the world by storm, but there are plenty of other examples, past and present, that demonstrate Barca's ludicrous ability to find talent within the confides of their own walls. During a period of their history where money is tight and they are consistently up against it to even register new signings, promoting youth has proven a handy workaround on their way back to ruling Spain.

Culers will, then, be looking forward to the return of 6'3 midfielder Marc Bernal this season after what was meant to be a breakout 2024-25 campaign was cut short by an untimely ACL injury. With the 18-year-old approaching full fitness again, excitement is brewing in Catalunya about his prospects in Hansi Flick's side.

So, who is Bernal and why exactly is there so much hype around him? Is he really the next success story out of La Masia? GOAL has everything you need to know on the midfield prodigy...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Newcastle United insist on signing AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw, who is strongly appreciated by the Rossoneri's new boss, Massimiliano Allegri. However, the Rossoneri would be open to discussion for a fee of around 40 to 45 million euros.

The Magpies are not having a great transfer window so far, as they have missed out on several targets already. Despite still pondering on getting a new striker, Newcastle are also looking to improve its backline for the upcoming season.

One of their main target to improve that defence is AC Milan's young defender, Malick Thiaw. The German international has already rejected an offer from Como earlier this summer, but might be open to accepting Newcastle.

Reports from Sky Sport Germany claim that Thiaw is open to joining the Premier League outfit, especially since they can offer Champions League football. However, Milan are not prepared to let him leave easily, especially since he has done well in pre-season.

Earlier this summer, the Rossoneri were open to letting the German leave for 25 million euros, but that's not the case anymore. Milan's new boss, Massimiliano Allegri, is happy with what Thiaw has shown in pre-season and would like to keep him.

The Rossoneri are also now keen on keeping Thiaw at the club, unless there's an offer way above his market value. The media, notably a renowned journalist, Matteo Moretto, suggests that Milan will only sell for 40-45 million euros.

Newcastle have reportedly made an offer, but only for around 30 million euros, a number which was rejected by Milan. Now, the Magpies must decide whether they will improve their proposal or move on to a different target.

Earlier signs seem like Newcastle will try to come up with another offer that can hopefully satisfy the Rossoneri. Milan are quite relaxed as they don't have to sell Thiaw, especially since Allegri is open to keeping the player.

Tennis

TORONTO — Ben Shelton, the American rising talent and world No. 7, made his first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2023 U.S. Open as a 20-year-old. Two years later, the box office showman has his maiden ATP Masters 1,000 title.

In front of 10,805 fans at Sobeys Stadium on Thursday night, Shelton outlasted world No. 16 Karen Khachanov in three sets 6-7 (5), 6-4, 7-6(3) to win the Canadian Open, in what his dad and coach, Bryan, called a “gutty performance.”

“I feel like it was a perfect storm for me this week,” Ben Shelton said. “A lot of tight matches, long matches, played some of the best tennis that I've played this year.”

There were so many instances throughout this 12-day tournament that Shelton could have gone out. He was down a break in the third set to Brandon Nakashima in the round of 32, before winning a third-set tiebreak. Against Flavio Cobolli in the round of 16, Shelton rallied from down 3-5, with Cobolli serving for the match, also capturing a third-set tiebreak. Shelton was most proud of his resilience throughout this tournament, and that fight ultimately earned him the biggest title of his career.

“I just continued to match him, and keep holding, and then played an unbelievable [third set] tiebreak,” Shelton said.

— ATP Tour (@atptour) August 8, 2025



After trading the first three service holds, it was Khachanov who secured the first break of the match thanks to an unforced error by Shelton. That gave Khachanov a 4-3 lead and put him two games from the set.

But as he's shown all tournament, Shelton never gives up. Down 5-4 with Khachanov serving for the set, the resilience was on display as Shelton connected on a 90 mph winner down 30-15. Back-to-back Khachanov errors gave Shelton the break, levelling the first set 5-5.

The first-set tiebreak was a display of Khachanov's natural power. He was hitting bigger from the baseline, pushing Shelton back and dictating the pace. At 5-5, Khachanov cranked an 86 mph forehand winner to move to set point. Another winner, Khachanov's third in a row, gave the Russian the first set.

The second set wasn't short of drama. For Shelton's second match in a row, there was a technical issue with the electronic line calling (ELC). At 2-2, 15-15, Khachanov served wide and the ball landed out. Because the audio wasn't working, chair umpire Fergus Murphy called it a fault. The players went to the net to get an explanation. In a classy gesture, Shelton gave Khachanov the first serve opportunity after learning that the audio had malfunctioned.

“It's Christmas,” Shelton said.

Shelton wasn't just giving first serves to his opponents. He began increasing the speed on his groundstrokes as the set progressed. After breaking to go up 5-4, Shelton was quickly faced with a 0-40 hole serving for the set. He didn't panic, connecting on back-to-back winners to force deuce. Facing his fourth break point, Shelton hit a 134 mph unreturnable serve. On set point, Shelton brought Khachanov to the net with a slice. Khachanov hit a backhand crosscourt approach before Shelton replied with a sliding forehand passing shot. Khachanov put the volley in the net, giving Shelton the second set. The American raised his right arm to the crowd as it roared, screaming his trademark “yeah” as the match was pushed to a third set.

Shelton got his right leg worked on before the final set began. It didn't impact his movement or ability to hit blazing shots.

Both players served exceptionally in the third, not giving each other any break points. This match was destined to end in a final-set tiebreak.

Shelton got off to an early mini-break and never gave up the lead. He saved his fastest, crushing shots until after the two-hour mark. No bigger than at 5-2 in the tiebreak, when Shelton unleashed a forehand clapper off the return down the line. He let out a loud grunt and roar as the finish line was near.

Three hours before the final, Shelton worked on his serve with his Dad and coach Bryan. They placed ball containers on the other end of the court so Shelton could practice serving his spots. Several times, Shelton connected with the container.

“Ping!” as the container launched backward.

According to Bryan, one of the areas Ben improved his serve this year is his command.

“He's a little bit more accurate,” Bryan said. “He's not willing to leave the ball hanging in zones where people can attack, even if he has to miss it. I'd rather him miss sometimes than give them confidence by putting it in their strike zone.”

It's fitting that Shelton hit his spot on match point with a 124 mph serve. A Khachanov unforced error gave Shelton the momentous victory.

“He served it out like crazy,” Khachanov said.

After the win, Shelton, fighting back tears, walked over to his team. He embraced his Dad, both with huge smiles.

“Let's go,” Ben said to Bryan.

Ben hugged his Dad after winning and later shouted him out during the trophy ceremony. There's a mutual respect, love and admiration between the two as coach and player, as father and son.

“I know that he has a great tennis mind, he respects my tennis mind, and my independence,” Shelton said. “He can let me go in the big moments and just let me play my game. But he does a great job of injecting little bits and pieces throughout the match that help me.”

After an entire tournament of practice, recovery and matches, Ben and Bryan could finally revel in this moment of jubilation.

“All of a sudden, you put your game face away, and it's just the raw emotion and the feelings that you have and the love that you have for one another,” Bryan said of the embrace with his son.

As Shelton raised the champion trophy, he was set to move to No. 6 in the ATP Tour rankings and No. 4 in the ATP Race to Turin, which counts ranking points won in 2025. As a true freshman at the University of Florida, Shelton clinched the Gators' first national championship. Now he is an ATP Masters 1,000 winner in Canada, with the potential to springboard to greater heights.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

After a rain-impacted Day 1 in Cincinnati, first-round action will continue on Friday at the ATP 1000 tournament. LWOT previews and predicts the exciting matches ahead of a star-studded weekend, with this set of matches featuring 2022 champion Borna Coric.

Head-to-head: First meeting

Quinn has battled through a steady 2025 season, though Kecmanovic's been a bit more consistent through the year, which won him an ATP 250 title earlier in February. Quinn will play at this tournament for the first time in his career, something that should be exciting for the home athlete, but Kecmanovic has to be the favorite based on his experience. The Serb is 1-1 against American opponents throughout the summer. 

Prediction: Kecmanovic in 3 

Head-to-head: First meeting

This should be a great all-American clash. Boyer had a breakout end of 2024 at the ATP Challenger Tour level, though his form has faltered since then. Holt's steady results have increased his ranking, as his ranking briefly crested the Top 100 earlier this summer, a career high ranking. Look for Holt to win this match with his consistent baseline game.

Prediction: Holt in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Neither player should feel like the heavy favorite in this match, with both Nardi and Tirante unable to make a big breakthrough on hard courts this season. Nardi fell in qualifying here and will make an appearance in this event as a lucky loser, while Tirante upset top-seeded Arthur Cazaux in qualifying earlier in the week. Such a win could give the Argentinian the confidence he needs to win his second career ATP 1000 match on hard courts.

Prediction: Tirante in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Coric's form has nosedived over the past few years, though he knows how to play well on these courts as the 2022 champion — a title win that saw him upset multiple Top 10 players, including Rafael Nadal. Nava is an exciting American to watch, however, and he's had some exciting runs on hard courts at tournaments such as Los Cabos. He also qualified for the main draw without dropping a set, giving him some always-needed matchplay ahead of this Center Court matchup. Unfortunately for Coric, he hasn't won a tour-level match on hard courts this season, and Nava's confidence at home might put heavy pressure on the former champion.

Prediction: Nava in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","'Grateful for everything.' Why a new version of Carlos Alcaraz is at the Cincinnati Open","https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/08/08/cincinnati-open-atp-carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-round-of-64/85576350007/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 17:07:10 GMT","

MASON, OH − Part of the Lindner Family Tennis Center's $260 million, state-of-the-art facelift has been the increase in total courts to 31 (up from 17) and additional seating for fans to watch some of the top stars in tennis practice.

If you're not early to a Carlos Alcaraz practice session, good luck getting a glimpse of the 22-year-old phenom.

Alcaraz, the World No. 2 behind defending Cincinnati Open champion Jannik Sinner, didn't put his best on display the last time he was in Mason.

Last summer, Alcaraz was upset by Gael Monfils in the Round of 32.

Alcaraz called it ""the worst match"" he had ever played in his young career and gave four hacks of his racket onto the Center Court surface during the third set that Paul Bunyan would've applauded. Alcaraz apologized one day later on social media.

Rest assured, fans in Mason won't see similar antics from the 21-time ATP tour champion.

Alcaraz showed composure beyond his years last month in a humbling loss at Wimbledon. Alcaraz was 5-0 all-time in Grand Slam finals, but was denied No. 6 by Sinner, who he had beaten in their previous five meetings.

No tantrums, no apology needed. Even on the biggest stage, after a loss in a rivalry that has encapsulated the ATP in recent months.

""It was new (losing in a Grand Slam final), but you have to be ready for that. I left the court happy, I left the court proud, and I left the court smiling,"" Alcaraz said in his pre-tournament press conference Aug. 6. ""At some point, I have to lose a Grand Slam final. Everyone has.

""There's obviously a lot I have to improve, but it took me hours, not even days, to be grateful for everything I've achieved.""

Alcaraz has matured a great deal in a short amount of time, in an ultra-personal sport where players have long pushed the boundaries of the game's holy etiquette and sportsmanship (Nick Kyrgios was fined $113,000 for his outburst with a chair umpire in Cincinnati in 2019).

""My goal is the same: to be happy, to enjoy my time on and off the court in the best tournaments we have in the world,"" Alcaraz said.

It's down to business now for Alcaraz, who admittingly avoided the gym like the plague in the three-week reset he enjoyed after the Wimbledon loss.

""When I'm off, I'm off,"" Alcaraz laughed.

He's on now and searching for an ATP 1000 title that has eluded him. With a bigger, 96-player field, the Cincinnati Open bracket is littered with ATP stars, but the possibility of another Alcaraz-Sinner showdown is hiding in plain sight.

Frankly, it's what the fans want. The last time the ATP's top 2 players met in the Cincinnati Open final, Alcaraz fell to Novak Djokovic in the longest match (3 hours, 49 minutes) in tournament history in 2023.

Mason enjoyed plenty of the sport's ""Big Four"" over the years. Roger Federer won a record seven Rookwood Cups, Djokovic reached the finals eight times (3-5) and Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray combined for three titles in a six-year span.

Alcaraz and Sinner are part of the next generation of tennis greats, and Cincinnati is ready for a showdown of superstars at its new-and-improved venue.

""I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik (Sinner). I think we've done great things in tennis in such a short period of time,"" Alcaraz said. ""A lot of people, I just let them talk about our rivalry or the things we have done for the history books in tennis. I'm thinking about the history we're making.""

Alcaraz will face either Mattia Bellucci or Damir Dzumhur in the Round of 64 over the weekend. Sinner matches up with Daniel Elahi Galan.","{'href': 'https://www.cincinnati.com', 'title': 'Cincinnati Enquirer'}","tennis"

The Hongkonger will face France's Ugo Humbert next after stunning upset of Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard

Hong Kong's leading tennis hope Coleman Wong Chak-lam has ranked his latest upset of a top-50 opponent alongside the best victories of his short career.

Wong made his mark at another ATP 1000 Masters event when he stormed into the second round of the Cincinnati Open, taking the scalp of world No 42 Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard by a comprehensive 6-3, 6-2 margin on Thursday local time.

The 21-year-old Wong, who now stands 177th in the world, had come through the qualifying rounds in confident mood, without dropping a set.

He duly proceeded to brush aside France's Perricard in what was his third ATP 1000 main-draw victory since joining the men's tour.

Aryna Sabalenka said it is “painful” to only be remembered for her Roland Garros outburst and that “everyone judges you” for a comment made in the heat of the moment.

Even two months and a whole other Grand Slam on from the event, Sabalenka feels she is still making up for her comments regarding Coco Gauff following her loss in the French Open final.

The backlash was fierce, prompting an apology from Sabalenka to Gauff, and the World No.1 has apologised plenty of times since the interview but even as she turns her attention to the Cincinnati Open, Sabalenka said she was still being judged for that moment.

“There are people who don't understand the intensity we bring to competition,” she said. “I went to the press very angry with myself and frustrated with the result. It's painful to see how, in the moment when you say something without thinking clearly, everyone judges you and completely forgets who you are and what you've done before.

“I was overexcited and made a complete mistake. It was hard to explain, but I've learned a lot from what happened; I think people can understand me better now. I'd like to think people realise that on the court I can scream and be very focused on achieving my goals, but that I'm also a fun, friendly, and easy-going girl who enjoys other things in life.”

After losing in the Wimbledon semi-finals, Sabalenka opted to skip the National Bank Open in Montreal meaning the upcoming Cincinnati tournament will be her first on the hard court ahead of the US Open.

Speaking of the break, Sabalenka said she felt she needed it to mentally refresh.

“The season has been really intense; it's impossible to be at my best every week. I realised after Wimbledon that I needed a break, and it's been great to do so,” the 27-year-old said. “Now I feel much fresher physically and mentally.

“I decided not to play in Canada because I consider it very important to manage the available energy as best as possible. The season is long and exhausting and now a key stretch for me arrives.

“I am defending the title in New York and I love approaching a Grand Slam in that way. I just hope that all the lessons I have learned from the last few Grand Slam tournaments will help me reach my maximum level.”

MASON, OH --The Lindner Family Tennis Center's $260 million transformation was made possible through the  combined efforts and investments of the City of Mason, Warren County and the State of Ohio. 

""I am so excited that fans from across the street to across the globe will get to see and experience the transformation our campus has undergone. Preserving this international asset was a huge win for Warren County and its partners, the State of Ohio and the City of Mason,"" said Warren County Commissioner Dave Young at the official ribbon cutting last week. ""I am thrilled that we are moving from proposing a plan that would retain the tournament to witnessing the opening of this world-class venue. The next chapter of this exciting story is just beginning, and I cannot wait for what happens next."" 

Now at more than 40 acres, the campus is twice as large as it was in 2024, making it  larger than the French Open site at Roland-Garros, according to the Cincinnati Open's Campus Transformation Fun Fact.

Some other fun fact are: 

 While the event, which began August 5th and runs until August 18th, draws players from all over the world, this year's tournament has 41 Americans competing in the main draws: 22 women and 19 men. Of those, seven of the women and six of the men are seeded.

One of the Americans competing in Mason this year is seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams. At age 45,  Williams continues her comeback as the oldest woman to win a WTA match in more than two decades last month in Washington, D.C. It was her first tournament in 16 months and her first win since the 2023 Cincinnati Open. On Thursday, she played against 22-year-old Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who wasn't yet born when Williams won her first four Grand Slam titles.

“As a foundational partner of the Cincinnati Open, the City of Mason welcomes world-class tennis players, volunteers and fans from around the world to this international stage in Mason, Ohio. This facility truly sets a new bar as part of our repertoire of community amenities and for the tennis world. We are proud that the Cincinnati Open calls the City of Mason home, and we invite everyone, even non-tennis/racquet sport fans, to visit this amazing venue. We look forward to a strong continued partnership with the Cincinnati Open and remain grateful for the support and dedication of our residents, fans, partners and players who contribute to making this internationally renowned event possible in the Mason community. Led by Bob Moran and Jansen Dell, we are proud of the efforts of the entire construction team to create this exceptional campus transformation,"" explained Mason's Mayor Diana Nelson at the campus' transformation ribbon cutting.

It took about 11 months of construction to complete the transformation of the Cincinnati Open Campus, which was led by Gensler, a global architecture, design and planning firm and Barton Malow, the lead contractor for the project.

""When we joined together to ensure the Cincinnati Open stayed in Ohio, we knew we were protecting something special. Even with that, I am overwhelmed by how incredible the new facility is, another gem for Warren County for now and the next generation,"" noted Ohio State Representative Adam Mathews during the campus' transformation ribbon cutting.

Other campus highlights include:

Beginning in 2026, the facility will be open for year-round public use and additional events outside of the tournament weeks.

“I am extremely grateful to all of the people who have been a part of this project. This was an ambitious scope and an aggressive timeline, but I couldn't be prouder of what the team accomplished. We feel this campus transformation will raise the bar for what it means to deliver exceptional fan and player experiences at a world-class tennis event. We look forward to welcoming everyone back this week and seeing their reactions as they take in thistransformed campus for the first time,"" said Jansen Dell, Cincinnati Open Chief Operating Officer.

Who is 18-year-old Victoria Mboko? Meet the Canadian tennis talent making waves on the WTA tour with her first career title at the 2025 Canadian Open. 

This article was originally published on 28 May 2025.

You will be hearing the name Victoria Mboko more often in tennis.

The 18-year-old from Canada is enjoying a breakthrough season like no other on the WTA Tour. Having begun the 2025 campaign as the world no. 333, she has since broken into the top 100 in the world at Roland-Garros 2025, and now the top 25 after a monumentous home tournament.

Mboko came from behind to beat a fourth major champion at the 2025 Canadian Open, defeating Naomi Osaka to claim a historic first title of her career — at WTA 1000 level and her home tournament in Montreal, no less. The last youngest female player to beat four Grand Slam winners en route to winning a tournament? Serena Williams, 26 years ago.

The Burlington native has also been in top form at the Grand Slams, making her first appearance in a major main draw at the French Open, having previously reached two junior major semi-finals as a teenager.

Mboko won on her Grand Slam debut against Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun in Paris, before defeating German no. 1 Eva Lys in the second round. She followed that up at Wimbledon 2025, going from a lucky loser to triumphing on her maiden SW19 main draw appearance.

Born to Congolese parents in the USA, while raised in Canada, Mboko was destined to be a tennis player.

At 18, she is the youngest by seven years of the four Mboko siblings (two boys, two girls), all of whom have played the sport throughout their lives.

Victoria's oldest brother, Kevin, competed at collegiate level alongside their other sister, Gracia. The fourth sibling and second brother, David, used to play tennis, but had to give it up due to problems with his vision.

""I just remember watching them from the sidelines and not wanting to be left out,"" Mboko told the WTA. ""I've actually never beaten any of them. I never like to lose a lot. I played my sister once in a tournament and I lost 0 and 0 [6-0, 6-0]. I was absolutely devastated. They still hold that over me to this day!""

A post shared by Vicky Mboko (@vickymboko)

Mboko's coach knows a thing or two about competing on the Grand Slam stage. As of the 2025 season, she has been accompanied on the world tour by former Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat, having previously worked together at Tennis Canada.

Tauziat, who represented France at three Olympic Games and reached the French Open quarter-finals, had a career-high ranking of no. 3 in May 2000 and reached the US Open women's doubles finals the following year.

Mboko's influence from some of the game's former players does not stop there. In the 2024 season, she spent a lot of time at Olympic gold medallist Justine Henin's academy in Belgium.

Her international experience came in handy on her Billie Jean King Cup debut for Canada in 2025, where Mboko sealed a debut victory against Romania's Miriam Bulgaru 6-1, 6-4 for her nation.

""I feel when I was a lot younger and watching tennis a lot on TV, I always saw Serena (Williams) kind of winning everything. It was just easy for me to just look up to her as a role model,"" she said during a recent press conference at Roland-Garros.

""I really loved the way she used to play, when I was younger I tried to hit like her and try to hit the ball hard. She's such an inspiration for so many girls out there, not just me.""

Among her role models is fellow Canadian Bianca Andreescu, who won the US Open in 2019: ""She was the first Canadian to do so, for a lot of us back home it was a really big deal and it was such an inspiring experience for everyone in Canada. It kind of changed a little bit the way things work there.""

The 25-year-old revealed that Andreescu is always happy to share advice with her: ""Sometimes I see her in the locker room and we have a quick chit-chat here and there. I always had her number, I know I could always reach out for advice, she's a really nice girl, she's very friendly and open.""

Comparisons to the greats of the sport can be overwhelming for an 18-year-old, but when one of the current top stars sees herself in you, that is a true compliment.

Mboko faced 2023 US Open champion Coco Gauff at the 2025 Italian Open in their first meeting, where the Canadian defied expectation to win the opening set before falling to the two-time singles major champion.

“I felt like I was playing myself,” Gauff said via Tennis.com of Mboko. “I think I move pretty well, and she moves very well…As far as the movement, I think she's up there with me on that... She's playing some top-level tennis.”

The Canadian got her own back in their second meeting, at her home tournament no less. This time, Mboko followed up a first-set triumph with a convincing victory, beating top seed Gauff 6-1, 6-4 at the 2025 Canadian Open fourth round.","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner captured his first Wimbledon crown a month ago, adding the fourth Major trophy to his growing collection. The Italian enjoyed a remarkable run at the All England Club.

However, he admits it nearly ended in the fourth round. Jannik faced Grigor Dimitrov Centre Court and dropped the opening two sets. The 23-year-old fell at the beginning of the duel and struggled to impose his strokes.

On the other hand, an inspired Bulgarian stopped the clock and showcased his A-game on the fastest surface. However, Dimitrov experienced a massive blow and retired at 2-2 in the third set after suffering a shoulder injury.

Sinner admitted he got lucky in that match. World no. 1 took it as a sign and raised his level ahead of his next duel. The outcome? Convincing victories over Ben Shelton, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz en route to his maiden Wimbledon trophy.

Jannik realized anything can happen and stepped up to overcome his next challenges in style and write history books. What could have been a crushing defeat became a pivotal moment. 

The Italian's resilience, combined with a touch of fortune, turned Wimbledon into his personal breakthrough. Sinner proved that in tennis, one moment can spark a champion's rise, even a lucky one. 

Dimitrov led 6-3, 7-5, 2-2 when he grabbed his right shoulder and started crying. He received a medical timeout outside the court and returned only to announce his retirement and experience the most heartbreaking moment of his career.

Grigor revealed a partial tear of the pectoral major muscle and withdrew from the US Open, skipping a Major after entering 58 in a row since 2011! The two rivals competed in front of Roger Federer.

The Bulgarian made a strong start and claimed the opener 6-3. The Italian erased the deficit in the second set before experiencing another break in the closing stages to find himself miles behind.

Dimitrov landed an ace in the fourth game of the third set to lock the result at 2-2 before stopping and expressing the pain while holding his shoulder. The veteran retired in tears, with Sinner helping him and carrying his bags.

""I got lucky against Grigor, but I took it as a sign. You never know what can happen, and that's how it is in tennis. You have to try to understand why and how certain things happen.

After that match, I stepped up my game and played at a high level in the remaining three rounds,"" Jannik Sinner said.

Bernard Tomic experienced a humiliating stumble during a Challenger event in Chicago, leading to an unexpected defeat against world No. 424 Stefan Dostanic.

The Australian player tripped over his own feet at match point and subsequently retired from the game. Elsewhere in tennis, Ben Shelton won the men's Canadian Open final on Thursday, with Victoria Mboko beating Naomi Osaka in the women's event.

Tomic has been grinding away on the ATP Challenger circuit for several years now. The 32-year-old, who was once a Wimbledon quarterfinalist and ranked as world No. 17, earned around $64,000 in prize money last year, which isn't an awful lot for a professional tennis player.

As recently as 2023, he was ranked outside the top 1,200. Despite this, Tomic is determined to retire on his own terms and continues to compete in lower-tier tournaments.

However, ahead of a probable entry into U.S. Open qualifying, Tomic suffered a significant setback in Chicago. After winning a challenging first set 7-6, he was leading 5-4 in the second set.



Tomic was at match point and seemed poised for a first-round victory. But while returning Dostanic's serve, he inexplicably tripped over his own right foot, falling flat on his back on the hard court with his arms covering his face.

With Dostanic leading 2-0 in the deciding set, Tomic chose to retire from the match, citing fatigue as the reason for his withdrawal.

Following the next rankings update, Tomic is expected to secure a spot in the world's top 200. He is likely to participate in the qualifying rounds of the upcoming U.S. Open.

Tomic once declared he had no passion for tennis and even sparked controversy by stating he was ""bored"" during his 2017 Wimbledon campaign. This admission came six years after the four-time ATP champion achieved his sole Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance at the prestigious All England Club.

Yet in a June interview, Tomic revealed a different perspective: ""Without tennis, I don't know what I would do. I'm sitting about 200 in the world, or whatever, and my goal is to be top 100, and then I can retire. It's more of a statement, that sort of thing, so let's see if I can do it. It's the only thing I'm good at.

""I've been good at it for almost three decades, so it gets me going. I can still play decent. I'm not in my prime like I was, but that's why I'm challenging myself to get back there one more time. And then retire happy and guilt-free.""

Amanda Anisimova has now had nearly a month to reflect on her heavy defeat to Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon final. 

Anisimova lost to Swiatek in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0, in what marked just the second double bagel in a women's Grand Slam final since the Open Era began. 

The American had enjoyed an impressive run in SW19 and advanced to the championship match at a major for the first time in her career, but was dominated by the Pole. 

Since then, Anisimova has featured at the Canadian Open, where she reached the round of 16 before falling to Elina Svitolina. 

Ahead of the Cincinnati Open, she recalled the aftermath of her Wimbledon final loss and shared how she was able to get over the ‘guilt' of it. 

Speaking to the Cincinnati press, Anisimova said: “It was really special to see how many people were sending me the sweetest messages.

“Lots of support from people, which I wasn't really expecting after the performance I had. 

“I felt really bad because I wish I could have put on a better performance, or could have competed harder, especially in a Grand Slam final.”

“There was definitely that side of guilt immediately after. To see what everyone was saying to me after really helped me get through that.

“It reminded me of just how far I've come and what it actually took to get to the final after those two weeks. It's not often that you get a lot of positive feedback on social media.”

“I've had a lot of incredible interactions. Everyone who has come up to me has been so sweet and has said the nicest words. I've enjoyed it a lot.

“Just being able to interact with people, having conversations and hearing how much they enjoyed watching me means the world to me. It's been a heartfelt few weeks.”

Anisimova kicked off her Wimbledon campaign with two comfortable straight-set victories over Yulia Putintseva and Renata Zarazua.

She then defeated Dalma Galfi in the third round, before overcoming the 30th seed, Linda Noskova, in round four. 

After besting Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarterfinals, Anisimova's semifinal opponent came in the form of world number one Aryna Sabalenka. 

Clinching the decisive third set against the Belarusian, she earned a statement victory and reached the first Grand Slam final of her career. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko will be ""the talk of the US Open"" following her stunning Canadian Open triumph, according to former British tennis player Annabel Croft.

Mboko took the tennis world by storm in Montreal, beating former world No 1 Naomi Osaka in the final, having already toppled fellow Grand Slam champions Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff - the top seed - and Sofia Kenin in earlier rounds.

""I think she will be the talk of the US Open, for sure,"" said Sky Sports Tennis pundit Croft.

""You always need those storylines going into a slam and there's no way that she's not one of the stories.

""She's earned that right to be talked about, which in itself creates pressure on the opposition because you feel like she has an aura - and she does have an aura.

""It's exciting but equally it does also create pressure for her, which she'll have to handle and which will be new territory for her.

""But, no question, this is a springboard for her.""

Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Congolese parents, but grew up in Toronto.

Won her first professional singles title at the ITF W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, which she successfully defended in 2023.

Won four consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour events to begin 2025, adding a fifth in March. In second place for most ITF World Tennis Tour women's singles titles won this year.

Began 2025 ranked at No 333,  but now projected to be No 24 when the rankings are updated on Monday following her victory in Montreal.

Qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, where she reached the third round

Coached by former world No 3 and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat.

Croft saw Mboko's considerable talent first hand when actually losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, before she ultimately earned a lucky loser spot and upset 25th seed Magdalena Frech in the first round.

""She had match points and she lost and I was just impressed with her whole attitude on the court,"" Croft said. ""She played beautifully and was so unlucky not to win that match.

""I have been even more impressed with how she rebounded after such a painful defeat and got into Wimbledon as a lucky loser, which I was so thrilled to see and now look what she's doing so quickly.""

Croft also believes Mboko is benefitting greatly from her choice of coach, former world No 3 and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat.

""She's got a very good coach, who actually I was on the tour with, in Nathalie Tauziat,"" Croft said.

""Mboko's very brave, smart and she backs herself. She goes for her shots, but I also read an article where she was talking about how Tauziat was a very creative artist, served and volleyed, had slices and did many different things.

""She said she was trying to equip her with other things like that which she might need to draw upon in matches. So you can hear by the way that she's talking, that she's very intelligent about the way she goes about her business and is not one-dimensional.

""She strikes me already, at such a young age, as being very astute and aware of what might be required.""

Sky Sports Tennis commentator Jonathan Overend:

""What a story, something that has really captured the imagination of the world outside of tennis, with the emergence of a new potential superstar.

""This is an 18-year-old wild card who has just won a top-tier tournament, at home in Canada, and by beating a four-time Grand Slam champion in the final. Such an exciting performance.

""She came back from a set down three times over the course of the event and in both of the last two rounds. She also beat four Grand Slam champions in total across the draw - Osaka, Rybakina, Gauff and Kenin.

""These things do not happen every day, so let's revel in it. What an achievement!

""She's got patience, she's got resilience, she is so good off both wings and moves so impressively. And she is so mature.""

If you weren't already aware, or if you hadn't seen all the weird fawning over Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu's new partnership and the media's strange desire to fabricate a relationship there, the US Open made the decision at the start of 2025 to completely overhaul their mixed doubles tournament.

Despite the debate that has been sparked over whether it actually is a good idea or not, I think, unfortunately, the organisers have made the right decision and have probably hit the jackpot, even with the pretty obvious issues that are lingering.

The mixed doubles will be moved to the Fan Week prior to the start of the main draw, and will take place on Tuesday, August 19th and Wednesday, August 20th, with a reward of $1 million to the winner.

Fan Week has always been a hugely popular period at the US Open, with players getting involved in little competitions. Last year's edition smashed attendance records, as 216,029 fans entered the gates - a 37% increase from 2023.

The format of matches has drastically changed too. They will be best-of-three sets, with each set going to just four games. There will be no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at four-all, and a 10-point match tiebreak in place of the third set. The final will have sets that are first to six, but everything else remains the same as the previous rounds.

16 teams will take part in the competition, with eight automatically qualifying based on their combined singles rankings, and another eight being awarded a wildcard. 

Some of the teams that have been confirmed for the mixed doubles are certainly funky and feel like a 13-year-old's fan fiction. In a way, that is what makes it such an interesting and fun prospect.

World number one Jannik Sinner pairs up with American Emma Navarro, and Iga Swiatek will play alongside Casper Ruud. Jack Draper will be on the same side of the court as Paula Badosa (much to the disappointment of Stefanos Tsitsipas), while Taylor Fritz links up with Elena Rybakina after their previous mixed doubles exploits.

Those are just a handful of the automatically qualified teams, while Serbian stars Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic, Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka, Raducanu and Alcaraz, and defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have received wildcards.

Two more wildcards are set to be announced soon, and frankly, I cannot wait to see what they have lined up! I have heard that Bill Ackman is available.

Instantly, there was a lot of backlash. Every single one of us fears change after all.

'Won't somebody please think of the doubles specialists?!'

And it is a fair question. With the new focus on trying to lure big-name singles players to the competition, doubles specialists have lost an opportunity to win a Grand Slam, as well as an avenue to make money.  

But unfortunately, that is looking at it purely emotionally and based on feelings. I feel incredibly harsh saying that, as sport is emotional, and it shouldn't be all about crunching the numbers. 

But the facts are, people just don't watch doubles. They just aren't attracted to the style of tennis that it produces, and supporters are only really drawn to their favourite singles player. The most excited fans get about doubles is when singles stars team up, like at the Olympic Games or on random occasions when a duo like Serena Williams and Andy Murray decide they want to get involved.

I still remember the incredible excitement that Rafael Nadal and Alcaraz garnered at the Olympics last year. I'm not sure any doubles specialists can ever generate that same thrill.

What is more complicated about mixed doubles is the fact that there aren't really any set teams that rock up to events every week. With men's and women's doubles, there are usually pairings that stick together and you can get behind, but in mixed, it just isn't the case.

I watch a lot of tennis, almost whenever it is on television. So that is pretty much every day, then.

I can say I watch singles 99% of the time and doubles 1% of the time, with mixed making up a healthy 0% of that. I do think that is the same for the majority of tennis fans, too.

Reportedly, of the prize money pot that is available on average every week at tournaments, doubles players receive 20% of that.

From a business point of view, taking all the emotion out of it, it doesn't really make any sense. They are earning a fifth of the prize money, but they're not being watched.

Not wanting to compare doubles to Silly Bandz, but if children's toys were costing lots of money to produce but no one was buying them, they'd just stop being made and be removed from the shelves. 

As a result, doubles has been coming under increasing scrutiny. 

So the US Open have finally taken action. They have made the dramatic overhaul. And despite the sceptics, the new tournament has been incredibly talked about since the announcement, and a lot of people will tune in, whether it is to watch the world's best players or just to observe how it will pan out.

There is a huge amount of hype around it. The US Open have succeeded in their goal and the promotion is working. It is exciting.

Who doesn't want to see how on earth Sinner and Navarro will get on? They hadn't even uttered a word to each other prior to deciding they'd play doubles together.

Venus will continue her return to tennis in New York, while Djokovic and Draper will use this as a proper warm-up for the singles, having missed Masters events in Toronto and Cincinnati.

Fritz - who is a self-proclaimed 'mixed doubles specialist' - seems the most excited and determined to win this competition and has won an Indian Wells exhibition tournament alongside Rybakina before.

Defending champions Errani and Vavassori will surely be unhappy with the revamped tournament and will want to make a statement and prove that a set of meddling singles players can't just come and steal their crown.

Furthermore, I am firmly in the camp that tennis has struggled to promote itself in recent years, with legends of the game like Roger Federer, Nadal and the Williams sisters retiring from the sport.

Tennis was just able to ride off the popularity and greatness of these icons, and didn't really need to try and reach new audiences, because the players were doing it themselves with their seismic gravitational pull.

But with this, they kind of now have their very own 'All-Star break', as seen in the NBA and MLB. I realise that this may sound like 'utter woke nonsense' to some, but as much as I do love tradition, sometimes change and evolution are necessary.

It could end up being a great way to let the personalities of the world's best players shine, while additionally actually bringing more eyes to doubles and perhaps bringing in more fans.

Look, even with my overall positive outlook on the whole thing, I do have some frustrations with the format, and can acknowledge the qualms that many have. It would be nice if they could balance the draw out a bit and have some more actual doubles specialists.

This is also being labelled an official Grand Slam tournament, despite the fact that half the field are wildcards, and sets are first to four games.

The vibes around it feel slightly more like an exhibition, and in a way, it kind of cheapens the idea of winning a Grand Slam.

But then again, I have heard no one else offer up any other options or good ideas. What else can they do to get a buy-in from the top singles players?

The calendar is already absolutely packed, and the world's best aren't going to participate if the mixed doubles were going on during the singles tournament, or if it were a week-long event.

It could be better, and I would like them to find a way where winning a Slam isn't diminished, but I truly don't know how you can have your cake and eat it too.

Honestly, I could even see a world - should this US Open event go well - where the Australian Open and Roland Garros follow suit.

This isn't a 'death to doubles' article or a hit-piece on doubles specialists. Of course, I have sympathy, but something had to give sooner rather than later.

I am just trying to look at this in as balanced a way as possible, and this seems like an inevitable outcome as doubles struggles to find a secure place in the tennis world. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

MASON, Ohio — The Cincinnati Open continues this weekend in Mason, bringing tennis greats to the Greater Cincinnati area. 

Since last year, tournament officials have doubled the Lindner Family Tennis Center's size and spent $260 million on upgrades. 

We met up with 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens on a newly improved center court as the tournament got into full swing — by practicing our own swings. 

""This might even be better than the US Open, with these facilities,"" said Stephens. ""Definitely seeing the clubhouse, obviously this was built in 11 months, which is like the craziest thing I've ever heard. Yeah I think the clubhouse is incredible, there's a new player area, services area, the food, the new gym."" 

While we were able to step onto center court with Stephens, players have to fight through nearly two weeks of match play to earn the ability to compete there in the finals. 

But the center court isn't the only competition space that's been enhanced for players. 

Watch as we try out the new facilities with Stephens:

""Last year we had 20 acres for our campus,"" said Maggie Brown, marketing and community relations manager for the Cincinnati Open. ""This year there's 40. So, we basically doubled in size. In 2023, we had 17 total courts. Now we have 31 courts, so there's just so much more space.""

More space means more players and more matches for fans to enjoy — the expansion has allowed the tournament to add 123 more matches. 

""We have more players this year,"" said Brown. ""In years prior, we had 56 players per singles draw. This year, it's 96. So we have basically doubled in size across the board."" 

For fans, the expansion also means more food options, a dedicated kids zone and just more space in general.

It's the most wonderful time of the year in New York City! No, Christmas isn't here already—you're not losing your mind or behind on your shopping—but it is August, which means that the US Open tennis tournament is about to take the city that never sleeps by storm.

From August 18 to September 7, players, coaches, and spectators from all over the world will flock to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens to watch the greatest international tennis players go head to head for the last Grand Slam of the year. Tickets are always a hot commodity—and any New Yorker, tennis fan or not, will tell you that Flushing is the place to see and be seen from late August through early September.

It makes sense: Not only is it a blast to sample the food and drinks (you must get a Honey Deuce cocktail), participate in the many on-site activations, and bobblehead your way through the matches, but it seems like everybody who's anybody will make an appearance at least once during the tournament—from pro athletes and Grammy winners to world leaders and beyond.

Planning to join in on the action this year? You should know that there's somewhat of a dress code when attending the matches, with patrons showing up in their tennis best while also attempting to stay cool in the late-summer heat. As someone who has attended the tournament almost every year since moving to NYC in 2017 (and fallen in love with the sport itself over the same period of time), I feel like I've cracked the code on what to wear to the US Open, and I'm spilling all the secrets here, for you. Read on, then get to shopping.

Athletic wear is more than acceptable at the US Open—just try to stick to pieces that look as appropriate on the street as they do at the gym. Athleisure made for tennis is always a good bet here, like pleated skirts, workout dresses, and sweat-wicking tees in flattering cuts. Brands like Lululemon, Wilson, Athleta, and Alo are great places to look for all of the above.

Late summer in New York is hot—like, might hit the 90s midday, hot. With that in mind, you're going to want to keep things easy and breezy when it comes to tops and bottoms. Opt for breathable materials like linen and and cotton, and styles that allow for maximum airflow, like wide-leg pants, loose-fitting tanks, and billowy skirts.

Airy summer dresses are perfect for watching tennis for a few reasons: you can catch a breeze under your skirt, you aren't constricted by any fabric, your bare legs never have to touch a hot seat, and you'll look super chic no matter the time of day. Solid colors and simple patterns are always classic, and blues, blacks, whites, and greens fit the sophisticated tennis vibe.

While the days are often hot, the temperature can drop at night. If you're an “I'm always cold!” type, you might want to consider bringing along a lightweight layer to throw on if things get cool, whether that be a windbreaker you can fold up and throw in your bag or a cashmere cardigan or cotton button-down you can tie across your chest or around your waist.

No matter whether you subway or Uber to the stadium, you will be walking…a lot. Trust me, now is not the time to be wearing those kitten heels or yet-to-be-broken-in flats, no matter how cute they may be. Prioritize comfortable footwear that you know will keep your feet happy no matter how many miles you put on them, whether that be sandals or sneakers. The kicks below are some of my personal favorites for long days on your toes.

Are these adorable accoutrements really necessary? No, they're not. But you'll certainly never regret donning a tennis-inspired key fob, coin purse, or jewelry piece to one of the biggest tennis tournaments on the planet. I, for one, love a theme, and am absolutely obsessed with these accessories.

There's nothing worse than getting to Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and being forced to check your bag in one of the lockers at the entrance because it doesn't meet the size requirements. For the US Open, the policy is that bags must not be larger than 12 inches in wide, 12 inches in height, and 16 inches in length. Keep this in mind when selecting your own carry-all—or just pick up one of the ones below, which fit the requirements and look good doing it.

Entering her Australian Open 2002 quarterfinal against Venus Williams, Monica Seles faced an opponent she'd never beaten, at a stage of a major tournament where she'd stumbled five times previously.

At the time Williams was the game's most impactful player, targeting her third consecutive Grand Slam title.

But in a match that recalled Seles' heady peak, the veteran upstaged Williams 6-7(4) 6-2 6-3 to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal since 1999.

It proved to be the last significant win of Seles' storied career at the Australian Open – a contest you can now watch in full on the tournament's YouTube channel.

Williams was the reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion and had won her past four tournaments, including the Gold Coast title to open the 2002 season. By reaching the quarters at Melbourne Park, she'd built a 24-match winning streak, winning 48 of her past 50 sets.

Despite being the tour's dominant player she was ranked No.3 and seeded second, her position impacted by her decision to shut her 2001 season down post-US Open to focus on study.

""Venus was definitely the it-girl,” recalled Suzi Petkovski, tennis writer and historian who covered Australian Open 2002 for Tennis Week.

“She was the uber-athlete versus the king-hitter in Seles. You see the greatness in both of them, in this match.”



Australian Open 2002 was a compelling event, especially on the women's side, where seven of the top eight seeds reached the quarterfinals. In the top half of the draw, defending champion Jennifer Capriati took on Amelie Mauresmo while Belgians Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters clashed. All four of those players are now Australian Open champions.

Yet Williams-Seles was the biggest blockbuster of all, and the only one of the four quarterfinals to extend three sets.

Seles was already a four-time AO winner and a fan favourite, especially considering the horrific circumstances she'd been forced to overcome when she was stabbed on court in 1993 and missed more than two years of competition.

She had also rediscovered form, scooping three consecutive titles in late 2001 and taking to the court against Williams unbeaten in 17 matches.

""She never looked uncertain what do to; she could be outplayed, but was never uncertain about what she was trying to achieve,” Petkovski recalled of the encounter, which she watched inside Rod Laver Arena.

“She was always on the front foot, and her body language was so positive, which I found fascinating, because she was 0-6 against Venus going into this [match].

“Again, it's why she was such a champion.”

Williams was physically compromised, playing with both wrists taped and tape under her knee – all to manage tendonitis – as well as leaving the court midway through the first set to get her upper leg strapped.

She nevertheless managed to snare the first set behind her monstrous serve, the biggest in women's tennis at that time.

""I was thinking back to when Monica won the epic AO 1993 final against Graf, when she's down in the second set and she fired a 164km/h ace down the middle, which was the fastest serve of the match,” said Petkovski, referencing another full match ausopen.com revisited.

“That was seen as a bomb in those days. And then [in this match] Venus is serving at 192km/h against Monica.

“Nine years on, it spoke to the new athletic level that the Williams sisters brought to the game. And to Monica's credit, even against the biggest serve that we'd seen, she was still standing inside the baseline to fire her returns.

“She knew she could not afford to be put on the defensive. Once her movement was involved, and she was forced to take a second hand off the racquet, then she was playing defensive ball and she wouldn't survive against Venus.”



Deep in the third set, Williams staged one final surge, arriving at 0-40 when Seles was serving with a 4-3 lead.

Seles erased all three break points to move ahead 5-3, then broke Williams to complete a famous triumph.

Martina Hingis ultimately ended her run in a thrilling semifinal, the last time Seles would advance that deep at a major tournament.

A few weeks later, Williams debuted at world No.1, and avenged her AO defeat to Seles at both Roland Garros and the US Open later that year. She also beat Seles at the 2002 WTA Finals, meaning this remains Seles' only victory against Williams in 10 career meetings.

By the time 2003 rolled around, Seles was contending with a foot injury, falling in the second round of the Australian Open to qualifier Klara Koukalova.

She then lost in the first round of Roland Garros to Nadia Petrova – the last professional match of her career.

""She picked her moment and did everything right when Venus was a little bit compromised,” Petkovski said of their AO 2002 classic.

""I think it makes it way more enjoyable watching it, knowing that was the last time she played so well here, and at a Grand Slam. It makes it more poignant – and there's already so much poignancy in Monica's career.

“It could be that she proved to herself she got back there at the top level, competing for big titles. Maybe that was the motivation she needed, because she always said she never played for No.1 or Grand Slam titles, but instead because she enjoyed playing.

“She proved to herself that she'd put all that past trauma behind her – which was not easy – and could compete, and was level pegging with the top women in the world again.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Chubb expands Australian Open sponsorship into multi-category global partnership","https://sportsmintmedia.com/chubb-expands-australian-open-sponsorship-into-multi-category-global-partnership/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 07:30:00 GMT","

Chubb will continue as the tournament's insurance partner while taking on three additional titles: life insurance partner, trophy insurance partner, & travel insurance partner.

The Australian Open has announced a major expansion of its partnership with the global insurance leader, Chubb, building on a relationship that began in 2020 and signalling both organisations' ambitions to extend their international reach.

Under the renewed agreement, Chubb will continue as the tournament's official insurance partner while taking on three additional titles: official life insurance partner, official trophy insurance partner, and official travel insurance partner of the Australian Open.

The broader sponsorship significantly amplifies Chubb's visibility at one of tennis's most prestigious Grand Slam events. Beyond traditional branding, the insurer will feature prominently during the “Close Call” electronic review segments – high-drama moments that draw peak engagement from fans both inside Rod Laver Arena and on global broadcasts.

Craig Tiley, Tennis Australia's Chief Executive Officer, welcomed the expansion and said, “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Chubb, a global leader in insurance. Chubb has been a key partner of the Australian Open since 2020, and we look forward to growing our already strong relationship.

“The company's global profile, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, makes it a natural partner for the Australian Open, one of the world's biggest sport and entertainment events.”

For Chubb, the deal reflects a deeper integration into the tournament's ecosystem. Marcos Gunn, Regional President APAC, added, “We are thrilled to announce the renewal and expansion of our partnership with the Australian Open, marking an exciting new era for Chubb as we deepen our connection to this iconic event. 

“The Australian Open continues to innovate and raise the bar, aligning strongly with our commitment to excellence in our service to clients and partners. We look forward to our continued partnership and shared success on the world stage.”

From a life insurance perspective, Bryce Johns, President of Chubb Life, continued, “Building on the successful partnership Chubb has formed with the Australian Open, we are proud to become the Official Life Insurance Partner.

“As one of the world's most popular tennis events, the Australian Open embodies the world-class standards we deliver to our customers, many of whom are passionate sports enthusiasts. Together, we look forward to creating unforgettable moments for our customers and partners, and celebrating the spirit of competition.”

The move reflects a growing trend in global sports sponsorship, where brands are moving beyond single-category deals to integrated, multi-channel partnerships that touch multiple aspects of the fan experience. For Chubb, it cements a year-round marketing asset embedded into the Australian Open's operations; for Tennis Australia, it secures a deeper commercial alliance with a partner aligned to its international growth strategy.

The 2026 Australian Open will run from 12 January to 1 February, with Chubb's expanded role set to take centre stage as the tournament serves up its next chapter.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool on Thursday became the first doubles team to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals.

The Britons guaranteed their place at the season finale by winning the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. It is the pair's sixth title of the season and first ATP Masters 1000 triumph together.

“Qualifying for Turin was one of our big goals in the offseason, so to have done it so early is obviously amazing,” Cash said. “I've never played there before, so really looking forward to it. But [we have] got some more things to do before the end of the season and then we'll push for that at the end.”

“It's an amazing achievement. Glad to be going back there, it's an amazing tournament, amazing city,” Glasspool said. “I think that just shows what a good year we've had and really happy to have qualified.”

Cash and Glasspool first competed together last September and quickly became a formidable force on the ATP Tour. In their first full season as a team, they have tallied a 47-11 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The new team has claimed glory at Brisbane, Doha, Queen's Club, Eastbourne, Wimbledon and now Toronto. By winning Wimbledon, Cash and Glasspool became the first all-British team to win a major men's doubles title since 1936.

With victory in Toronto, the Britons have won 19 consecutive matches dating back to the start of their run at Queen's Club in June. Glasspool qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals in 2022 with Harri Heliovaara, while this will be Cash's debut at the season finale.

The 2025 Nitto ATP Finals will take place at Inalpi Arena from 9-16 November. Carlos Alcaraz has already qualified for the singles field.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will return to his home country to defend his year-end championships title, which he claimed in 2024 without dropping a set. The Nitto ATP Finals will take place at Inalpi Arena from 9-16 November.

Sinner will compete in the event for the third consecutive season and the fourth time overall. He owns a 10-2 record at the tournament according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index and in the past two editions has only fallen to Novak Djokovic (in the 2023 final).

The Italian has enjoyed another standout year, lifting two major trophies for the second straight season and reaching an ATP Masters 1000 final in Rome. Sinner successfully defended his crown at the Australian Open and emerged victorious at Wimbledon for the first time. The World No. 1 also held three championship points in the Roland Garros final before suffering a heartbreaking defeat to Alcaraz.

The 23-year-old, the only player who has been No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings this season, has held top spot for 60 consecutive weeks dating back to his ascension last June. Sinner will battle Alcaraz for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours in a race that appears set to go down to the wire.

Sinner made his Nitto ATP Finals debut in 2021 as an alternate, when he replaced countryman Matteo Berrettini, pushed Daniil Medvedev to a final-set tie-break and defeated Hubert Hurkacz. He won nine of his 10 matches in Turin in his two appearances since.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool capped another dominant run this season at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers on Thursday, securing a dramatic victory over Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski in an all-British doubles final in Toronto. 

The second seeds demonstrated immense composure, edging Salisbury/Skupski 6-3, 6-7(5), 13-11 to win their maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy as a team. In doing so, they became the first all-British duo to win a title at the level. 

The British pair saved four championship points in the Match Tie-Break to capture their sixth title of the season. With the win, they extended their unbeaten streak to 19 matches, following victories at Queen's Club, Eastbourne and Wimbledon, leading up to Toronto. 

""It has been a long period for us,"" Cash said in the post-match interview. ""Both of us are probably a bit tired today, but I thought we brought the energy when we needed, and [this is] our maiden 1000 title, so it's an unbelievable feeling.""



Glasspool had a chance to serve for the championship at 5-4 in the second set, but was broken. Despite losing the second set and trailing 6/9 in the Match Tie-Break, Cash and Glasspool came up clutch in the final moments, with Glasspool erasing a fourth championship point with an ace at 9/10. The pair fired 15 aces and won 80 per cent (36/45) of their first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to take a 3-0 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Salisbury and Skupski.

""I didn't make any first serves that game. I was very disappointed with that, but I guess it's how you finish the match, not how you played in the middle. But we bounced back well,"" said Glasspool.

The British stars, who are currently ranked No. 1 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, also defeated Salisbury and Skupski in the Doha final and Eastbourne semi-finals earlier this year. By winning the title, they became the first team to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals.

Salisbury and Skupski were aiming to win their first title of the season. They are up one spot to No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

Ben Shelton has surged to a career-high World No. 6 and become the youngest American ATP Masters 1000 champion in two decades after a pulsating final victory over Karen Khachanov at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers Thursday night in Toronto.

The 22-year-old American has built a reputation as one of the game's best frontrunners, but Shelton's victory in his first Masters 1000 final was underpinned by his ability to rebound from adversity – and to come up clutch when it mattered in the tense 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3) victory. 

Shelton rallied from 0/40 to serve out the second set and then, serving from behind during a tense final set when Khachanov breezed through a string of service games, forced his way to his third third-set tie-break of the tournament, where he won his 14th consecutive point on serve to close it out. 

“It's a surreal feeling,” Shelton said. “It's been a long week, not an easy path to the final. My best tennis came out when it mattered most. I was clutch, I persevered, I was resilient. All the qualities I like to see in myself.”

Shelton becomes the youngest American ATP Masters 1000 champion since 21-year-old Andy Roddick won the 2004 Miami title. More importantly, he surges to fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin, boosting his chances of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals from 9-16 November.

Shelton defeated No. 8 Alex de Minaur and No. 4 Taylor Fritz to advance to his first ATP Masters 1000 final after earlier surviving third-set tie-break wins over Brandon Nakashima and Flavio Cobolli.

He collected his third title, adding to triumphs in Tokyo in 2023 and Houston in 2024.

The match was a nailbiter throughout. Both players won 49 points in the first set, 29 in the second before Shelton won 36 points in the third set to Khachanov's 31.

Khachanov blasted 10 forehand winners in the opening set and his power pinned Shelton deep behind the baseline. But on the advice of his coach and father Bryan, Shelton worked his way up the court in the second and third sets to take a more aggressive posture.

“He was right,"" Shelton said of his dad's advice. ""Karen was bullying me around the court. The way he hit his forehand tonight, the way he was cutting off the court, the way he was serving, it felt like I had a freight train coming at me. So it was uncomfortable to move forward. The ball was coming at me even faster. 

“But I started being able to redirect, get some big shots off of my own, and kind of flip the momentum of that match. So that was huge for me. I love the way that he coaches me. He usually leaves stuff up to me. He gives me a lot of suggestions. He knows me better than anyone in the world, so he's well qualified to give me those suggestions.”

Shelton now leads Khachanov 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, after also beating the 29-year-old in Indian Wells earlier this year. The players are seeded to meet in the Cincinnati Open quarter-finals.

Shelton is 32-16 on the year. Khachanov, who saved a match point against Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals, slips to 27-17. But he moves four places to No. 12 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Montreal champion Victoria Mboko and runner-up Naomi Osaka have both withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open, creating a special situation due to WTA Performance Bye protocol.

Montreal champion Victoria Mboko and runner-up Naomi Osaka have both withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open, which began on Thursday.

Mboko cited a left wrist injury that she sustained during her remarkable run as a wild card to her first Hologic WTA Tour title, while Osaka cited a change of schedule.

Cincinnati: Scores | Draws | Order of play

""I'm going to take care of my wrist,"" Mboko told wtatennis.com in her Champions Corner interview on Thursday night. ""Just do some prevention and recovery and prepare for what's to come.""

Both Mboko and Osaka were unseeded in Cincinnati, and received performance byes into the second round due to reaching the Montreal final. This has created a special situation due to WTA Performance Bye protocol whereby two first-round matches have been created using the top four signed-in lucky losers from Cincinnati qualifying.

Consequently, Cristina Bucsa and Yuan Yue replace Mboko and her performance bye in the draw, with the winner to face No. 14 seed Diana Shnaider. Solana Sierra and Iva Jovic replace Osaka and her performance bye in the draw, with the winner to face No. 20 seed Linda Noskova. The Bucsa/Yuan and Sierra/Jovic matches have both been scheduled last on Friday's order of play.

In a clash between the Top 2 Americans on the ATP rankings—Fritz is currently No. 4, Shelton No. 7—both men threatened to break early on, with Fritz fending off a break point to hold in the opening game of the match, then Shelton in turn fighting off two break points to hold in the second game of the match.That would be Fritz's final look at any break points.Shelton lost a total of just nine points in eight service games the rest of the way, never even being pushed to deuce in any of them.

Fred Vasseur reflects on his new Ferrari deal

Lewis Hamilton is experiencing a difficult phase at Ferrari, but his former boss Toto Wolff has spoken out in support.

Toto Wolff has given his take on Lewis Hamilton's recent self-criticism, arguing that the Briton remains “the greatest of all time” and should stay in the sport “for many more years”.

Hamilton made headlines over the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend when he reacted to a surprise Q2 exit by describing himself as “absolutely useless” and suggesting Ferrari “probably need to change driver”.

After starting and finishing 12th in the race, Hamilton added that he was “looking forward to going away” for the summer break, with “a lot going on in the background that is not great”.

Asked for his reaction to Hamilton's comments following last weekend's action at the Hungaroring, Mercedes boss Wolff said: “That is Lewis wearing his heart on his sleeve.

“It's what he thought very much when he was asked after the session. It was very raw. He was doubting himself.

“We had it in the past when he felt that he underperformed his own expectations. He's been that emotionally transparent since he was a young boy or a young adult. So, he's going to beat himself up.

“He's the GOAT and he will always be the GOAT, and nobody is going to take that away. For sure, no single weekend or race season that hasn't gone to plan. That's something he needs to always remember – he's the greatest of all time.”

Wolff and Hamilton worked together at Mercedes from 2013 to 2024, a period that yielded six of the 40-year-old's seven world titles – the other achieved with McLaren back in 2008.

Hamilton came close to adding an eighth crown in a fiercely contested 2021 season, which saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen triumph in dramatic circumstances at the Abu Dhabi finale.

“Lewis has unfinished business in F1,” Wolff continued, as he pondered Hamilton's future.

“In the same way that Mercedes underperformed over this latest set of regulations since 2022 and kind of never got happy with ground effect cars… in the same way it beats him.

“Maybe it's linked to driving style. He shouldn't go anywhere next year. Brand new cars, completely different to drive, new power units that need an intelligent way of managing the energy.

“That's absolutely on for Lewis and I hope he stays on for many more years. Certainly, next year is going to be an important one.”

Pressed on whether he believes Hamilton can still win an eighth title, Wolff commented: “I think if he has a car underneath him that he has confidence in, that does what he wants, then yes.

“If he has a car that's not giving him the feedback that he wants, and that was the Mercedes of the past few years, and that seems to be the Ferrari and even worse, then not.

“But you ask me whether he has it… he definitely has it.”

Fred Vasseur reflects on his new Ferrari deal

Lando Norris might be holding second place in the World Championship, but the McLaren driver feels that certain parts of his season so far were ""not good enough"".

Lando Norris has deemed the earlier part of his season as “not good enough”, with the Briton believing that, prior to the last couple of months, his performance was “pretty average”.

Norris' campaign initially looked to have started strongly when 2025 kicked off at the Australian Grand Prix in March, having won what turned out to be a chaotic wet-dry encounter.

However, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri claimed four victories across the next six rounds, Norris had to wait until Round 8 in Monaco to stand on the top step again.

A difficult moment for the team followed two races later in Canada when a late-race collision between Norris and Piastri – for which Norris took the blame – put the former out of the running while the latter managed to make it home in fourth.

But since Round 11 in Austria, the 25-year-old has bolstered his points tally by scoring three wins, with the most recent of these in Hungary seeing him cut Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points.

When asked ahead of the race in Budapest to assess his season and give an insight into what his area of focus will be during the next few weeks, Norris explained: “Just what I've been doing really over the last month, two months.

“Prior to that, [it was] not good enough, so in a harsh way, I would say I was pretty average before then. Since then, I think things have been a lot stronger.

“I still want more, still need to be a lot better and I'm not as good as where I would like to be, but a lot of improvements have been made.

“I think I'm in a much better place, I'm happier with the car – things like that. I've been working hard but I can do a lot more than I have been doing, so, for that reason, just more of the progress that I have been making.”

Earlier in the season, Norris spoke of how he had been spending time off social media, a move that he felt had allowed him to “do things that are productive”.

With this in mind, the nine-time race winner was quizzed on how different his 2025 summer break might look in comparison to previous years.

“It's not going to be that different,” he reflected. “I'm still on social media every now and then, I'm still going to go and have a good time with my friends in different places, and we're going to have a little golf trip and do different things.

“So really, it's not any different to what I've done the last few years, which is a good thing. It shouldn't be any different. There's no reason it should be any different.

“I still have the priorities of making sure I come back more prepared than ever and in a better way than I could possibly be, but for the same sake, I should treat it no different to how I have done before, which is that Formula 1 is the priority, and I make sure I'm in the best shape I can be for that.”

The beloved Hollywood big-screen theater and adjoining ArcLight multiplex have lain dormant since COVID. Their fate remains mysteriously in limbo — but not for lack of wealthy suitors.


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	Lights, camera … inaction. The historic Cinerama Dome on Sunset Boulevard and its adjoining ArcLight Hollywood multiplex have together become perhaps L.A.'s most iconic post-pandemic vacancies.


	The venues shuttered in March 2020, at the onset of COVID, prompting public lamentations from filmmakers ranging from Barry Jenkins and Lulu Wang to Edgar Wright and Olivia Wilde. Operator Pacific Theatres soon went bankrupt and liquidated all its locations. While many of the company's Southern California venues have since been snapped up by other exhibitors, its flagship movie mecca remains a white elephant.

					ArcLight Hollywood and Cinerama Dome Won't Reopen This Year		
			









	This zombie landmark is under the control of a real estate firm, Robertson Properties, which itself is owned by Pacific's corporate parent, Decurion. In June, a representative for Robertson Properties explained to the city's zoning administration at a public hearing that the ownership is “very committed to moving forward to continue redeveloping the site” yet didn't provide specifics. Neither Decurion nor Robertson responded to The Hollywood Reporter‘s inquiry about the stalled site.


	Robertson's vast regional real estate portfolio grew out of a constellation of postwar drive-ins. Today, these locations are mostly sprawling shopping malls and warehouse complexes along with other large commercial developments, such as a square-block buildout leased by Netflix along Vine Street, between the former ArcLight Hollywood and AMPAS' Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study.


THR has learned that several major exhibitors have made serious inquiries about both the Cinerama Dome, which from its construction in 1963 to its closure was a popular choice for studio film premieres, as well as the ArcLight. When the multiplex opened in 2002, it pioneered a now-standard array of offerings for upmarket cinemas, including reserved seating, reclining stadium-style chairs, in-house gourmet dining offerings and state-of-the-art picture and sound.

	











	Two factors are hampering interest among exhibitors. First, the crown-jewel Dome itself isn't being made available. (It was built by the grandfather of Decurion's current CEO, Chris Forman, who created the ArcLight chain; he may view it as an heirloom that can only be managed in-house.) Second, Robertson Properties doesn't appear interested in offering a long-term lease, which exhibitors would require to justify the improvement costs for refurbishing an already aging multiplex whose technology has been all but abandoned for half a decade. Records at the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety show that there's been little meaningful work done on the facilities in recent years, aside from an overhaul of HVAC systems.


	Decurion has long kept a low corporate profile. Its management culture has led to chatter that it is affiliated with Scientology; in a rare public statement, the company denied this in 2013. A grassroots campaign has emerged to advocate for Forman to either reopen the Dome or else lease it to another exhibitor. More than 30,000 people have since signed an online petition. Decurion's website has been taken offline.


	Decurion and Robertson Properties haven't been in a hurry to reactivate another notable holding, the Hollywood Pacific Theatre (originally developed by the Warner brothers in 1928 to showcase sound), which was later converted to the widescreen Cinerama format. The venue, a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument that's also recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, hasn't publicly exhibited films for more than three decades, since the 1994 Northridge earthquake damaged the structure.

	











	Some observers speculate that Forman and his lieutenants are keeping the spaces empty on purpose for tax breaks — like writing off losses, depreciating the buildings' value and adjusting how much profit that they'll owe tax on when the assets are eventually sold. Richard Peiser, a professor of real estate development at Harvard, doesn't think this is the case. “Nobody really makes money on tax strategy,” he says.


	Peiser, like others, believes that the unspoken endgame is redevelopment. Keeping the site unencumbered from a long-term lease allows for flexibility as market conditions — particularly for theatrical exhibition — evolve. Privately held real estate firms like Robertson Properties think in decades. The ArcLight-Dome complex was at the vanguard of neighborhood revitalization at the turn of the millennium, before film audiences abandoned cinemas for streaming. Now, perhaps sadly, the site may make more financial sense as just another high-rise mixed-use project with a big-box anchor retail tenant.

The Homeland boss responds to that brutal episode: ""Only the liberals and the extremists do that.""


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has fired back at South Park after the Comedy Central series rather brutally mocked her looks during its most recent episode.


	The second episode of the animated series' 27th season portrayed Noem — who has been dubbed “ICE Barbie” by detractors — as a puppy-shooting villain hellbent on rounding up Hispanics along with a team of beauticians who are constantly having to re-attach her melting face.




	Noem went on Glenn Beck's podcast and was asked about the show. “It's so lazy to make fun of women for how they look,” she said. “Only the liberals and the extremists do that. If they want to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can't. They just picked something petty like that.” Noem added that she didn't watch the episode personally.

					Former 'Superman' Actor Dean Cain Says He's Joining ICE: ""This Is the Right Thing""		
			









South Park, it should be noted, perhaps even more savagely mocked President Donald Trump‘s looks in the season premiere, using AI to show him obese and fully nude.


	During the interview, Noem also took issue with media criticisms of ICE raids, saying they've been inaccurately portrayed. “I'm shocked every day by the amount of stories that we have to refute that just are completely false,” Noem says. “There are so many stories shared, so many things said, so many narratives, that we spend half of our time over here at the Department of Homeland Security saying, ‘That's not true.' Even making up anecdotal stories about families that just never even happened. Somebody like [New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani] accusing ICE of kidnapping people, pulling up in unmarked trucks and [saying] they're wearing masks because they're Nazis … it's so dangerous.” 

	











	In the episode, titled “Got a Nut,” school counselor Mr. Mackay loses his job due to President Trump cutting the Department of Education's budget, so he decides to sign up to join ICE (“I'm proud to work for ICE,” declares one masked ICE recruiter, ironically). Mackay watches an orientation video from Noem in which she says, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face, because sometimes doing what's important means doing what's hard.” (Noem previously admitted to killing her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior.)


	This is followed by Noem shooting several other random puppies in the face, which becomes a running gag throughout the episode. Mackay and his ICE squad then descend on the Dora the Explorer live show to arrest people in the crowd. “Remember only detain the brown ones!” Noem shouts. “If it's brown, it goes down!” At one point, Krypto the Superdog from Superman swoops in to seemingly save the day — only to be shot dead by Noem as well.


	Earlier this week, Homeland Security posted an image on X from South Park‘s preview that depicted an ICE raid, along with a link to a recruitment site to join U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.


	The official South Park X account shot back: “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks.”


	The comment refers to the White House‘s official statement that was issued in response to the show's scathing 27th season premiere last month, which claimed: “Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.”

	











	The show's blockbuster 27th season return last month delivered nearly 6 million cross-platform viewers and the largest audience share for the animated comedy in 25 years. The episode also received more social media posts than any other in the show's history.

The Sony Pictures Animation film broke out on Netflix, has led Nielsen's streaming movie chart and racked up Billboard hits thanks to savvy pacts.


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	It's difficult to overstate how big a summer Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters is having. Netflix now has its biggest animated original film of all time, and with it, Universal Music Group's Republic Records and its now red-hot new record label partner Visva have what could go down as the biggest soundtrack of 2025. 


	Both the movie and its songs are on the cusp of a moment not seen since 2022, when Encanto's “We Don't Talk About Bruno” took over the world and became Disney's highest-charting song of all time. And as “Golden,” Demon Hunters' biggest hit thus far, has reached a new high at Number 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 this week, it's a moment that could be about to materialize.

	“I still have to keep pinching myself every morning when I wake up and look at the charts, we're a month in and this just isn't slowing down,” says Republic Records chairman and CEO Jim Roppo. 




			Related Video		







	The “Bruno” comparison is one Roppo has thought of frequently over the past few weeks, also harkening back to other major family-friendly film music moments like The Greatest Showman in 2017 and Frozen in 2013. But in Demon Hunters' case, it isn't just a song or two, but a whole collection of hits. By Aug. 4, the soundtrack had six of the top 10 slots on Spotify's U.S. chart and four of the top 10 on the global chart. 

	











	It's a major win for Republic and Visva, which have won the envy of the music business with one of the biggest records of 2025 in a stagnant chart year where new music is struggling to dethrone last year's hits. And while the film and the music are now undeniable, it wasn't a moment Republic may have been expecting even a few weeks ago. 


	“I think we all had pretty modest expectations, I'm not going to lie, you don't know when these things break,” Roppo says. “But as the music business and the movie business shows you time and time again, the universe speaks sometimes, and you just have to listen with your eyes and your ears and then move quickly and say lots of thank yous.”


	Republic got involved with the soundtrack last year, thanks to a partnership with JYP for K-pop phenoms Twice, and because of Republic's relationship with songwriter-producer Savan Kotecha. 


	Sony Pictures Music Group President Spring Aspers, who worked on other major musical moments like the Spiderverse films, had spent five years working on the film's music, tapping Teddy Parks' The Black Label, sister company Sony Music Publishing and the movie's executive music producer Ian Eisendrath among others to help with securing the talent to write and record the songs. 


	Aspers didn't give specifics when asked about other potential labels that may have been considered for the soundtrack, only stating that “for a lot of people not just on the music side but in movies too, this movie seemed a little out of left field, maybe a bit niche.” 

	











	Last fall, she'd connected with Kotecha, who she's previously worked with at Sony Pictures Animation, knowing that he was focusing on international music at his new record label Visva. At the time, Visva was closing on a deal for a joint venture with Republic (the paperwork was officially signed in the beginning of the year) and Aspers was looking for a K-pop act for a song for the end of the film. Twice expressed interest, making for a natural team. 


	“When Twice raised their hands, it was like, game over,” Aspers says. “You just can't get a bigger superstar act in a lot of ways. They're [with] Imperial, it just made a lot of sense.”


	As Kotecha says: “My deal was with Republic, and I thought Twice would be perfect. I thought I'd get the support quickly since [Republic] were my partners. They were the first people we asked, and they got it right away.”


	As Demon Hunters' global dominance continues, the songs are flirting with top spots in the U.S. too. For this week's Billboard 200 albums chart, the soundtrack came in second, still about 50,000 units shy of dethroning Morgan Wallen's chart monster I'm The Problem. But on the Hot 100, “Golden” hit a new high in second-place, just trailing Alex Warren's “Ordinary.” “Golden” outstreamed “Ordinary” by nearly 10 million streams, per Luminate data, with “Ordinary” holding on thanks to about 68 million more radio audience impressions. 


	Roppo says U.S. radio's got a “limited” history with K-pop but adds they've gone “very aggressively” at Top 40 stations as they try to lock up a coveted number one. 

	











	“We're the smallest percentage away, we're focused on increasing rotations, adding more stations, and that's global too,” Roppo says. “There's a tremendous amount of upside there.”


	As Demon Hunters continues to surge, the team hopes to make more moments beyond the screen too. Kotecha, Roppo and Aspers say Republic, Visva, Sony and Netflix are having active discussions “to figure out what a live music moment looks like, what pop up moments could look like,” though he wouldn't give details on what that would be.


	Twice, for their part, debuted Demon Hunters track “Takedown” at Lollapalooza over the weekend. There's plenty of potential options for live material, whether that's more typical live performances from the artists behind the songs, or more involved multimedia involving the film's IP. 


	“I can't say anything yet because it's so early,” Kotecha says, “But we're spitballing ideas, everything's on the table.”

The British star and her daughter Gaia, who also features in the Brian Kirk-directed movie, which world premieres at Locarno, also discussed the importance of gloves and filming in Finland.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Emma Thompson has gone from snowy landscapes to sunny pastures. The star plays a widowed fisherwoman who travels alone through snowbound northern Minnesota and interrupts the kidnapping of a teenage girl, portrayed by Laurel Marsden (Ms. Marvel), in her latest film, The Dead of Winter, directed by Brian Kirk (21 Bridges, The Day of the Jackal, Penny Dreadful). On Friday, though, she discussed the movie in summery Locarno, Switzerland during a press conference at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival.


	In the film, Thompson's character faces a huge challenge. “Hours from the nearest town and with no phone service, she realizes that she is the young girl's only hope,” explains a synopsis.

	“Why start this action thing when you're 66?! That's just stupid,” Thompson told the press in Locarno on Friday, earning laughter.


	The cold and action scenes meant she was trying to get ready by being in the best physical shape possible. “We spent a long time getting spent a long time getting used to the cold” in Finland, she also shared. 


	How were all the action scenes? “The one thing that really scared me, genuinely scared me, was not running about, although I did pull every single muscle in my body, but holding my breath underwater,” Thompson shared.


	One item of clothing was particularly key. “The making of this movie was mostly about gloves,” the star said, drawing more laughs. “We had to have three pairs of gloves because what does she do when she shoots the gun? She can't shoot the gun with the big gloves, so we had to have [different] pairs of gloves.”

	











	About her character, Thompson said: ”This woman's life is an ordinary, humble life,” and she is taking risks for a younger person because she feels, “I am able to let it go” if needed. “This woman was a real heroine … formed by weather,” she concluded.


	Thompson added: “I think of her as someone who has had a really full, rich, happy life. And that was one of the things I loved most. We seem to be telling an awful lot of stories about the super-rich, we seem to be looking at a lot at the darker side of human nature, and kind of wanting to take our revenge. There are so many things, not only in film, but also on television, about this.”


	Her daughter Gaia Wise, who plays the younger version of Thompson's character in the film, said she loved bringing to life “what she experiences, and the trauma that she goes through, and seeing how from that, she becomes this woman who is capable and able and willing to sacrifice.”


	Written by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, the film also stars Judy Greer, Marc Menchaca, Thompson's daughter Gaia Wise, Lloyd Hutchinson, and Brían F. O'Byrne. Thompson is also an executive producer on it. 


	Leeb said the heroine was inspired by his aunt, with Kirk recalling that when he read the script, he loved this “fully formed character” who was “not a superhero” but a person “out of her depth.”


	Kirk, in a director's statement, describes The Dead of Winter as “a merciless kidnap thriller, set in the epic snowbound wilderness of northern Minnesota, with a beautiful love story at its heart.”

	











	Thompson touted Finland where the movie was shot, telling the press: “Finland is so fabulous. You all have to go!”


	Thompson is also in Locarno to receive the Leopard Club Award on the Swiss town's picturesque Piazza Grande square Friday evening, before the movie's world premiere.


	“She is the only person in the history of the Academy Awards to have won for both acting and screenwriting,” Locarno organizers highlighted about the U.K. star in unveiling that she would receive the honor. “Thompson's willingness to take risks with her roles has meant that she has remained a vital force on stage and screen for four decades, a testament to the depth of affection multiple generations of fans hold for her.”


	Thompson “embodies the best of a tradition of performers who continue to be able to infuse each role with the deepest knowledge about the actor's work,” said Locarno festival artistic director Giona A. Nazzaro. “Working with writers as exceptional as she herself is, fearlessly tackling ever-changing registers and characters, moving from Shakespeare to James Ivory, from the magic of Harry Potter to the transformations of Nanny McPhee, she has continued to surprise audiences over a career that has earned her numerous awards, including two Oscars, two Golden Globes, three BAFTAs, a Golden Lion, and an Emmy.

	Billboard Korea



TOMORROW X TOGETHER, beloved for their cohesive narrative and high-concept musical universe, are back with a new full-length album after 1 year and 9 months. They released The Star Chapter: TOGETHER on July 21, which concludes the group's acclaimed “Star” series, following the chapters “Dream,” “Chaos,” and “Name.” Known for their innovative approach to storytelling through music, visuals, and live performances, TXT has once again piqued massive anticipation leading up to this momentous comeback.


The Star Chapter: TOGETHER picks up where its predecessor, The Star Chapter: SANCTUARY, left off in November 2024, continuing the overarching narrative of transformation and connection. While ‘SANCTUARY' explored how one's personal change can affect others, ‘TOGETHER' takes that journey further, telling the story of how this transformed self-returns to save and unite others. The album's title reflects TXT's commitment to reinforcing this message of unity at the peak of the “Star” storyline, underscoring the group's vision of true togetherness.


	The album includes eight songs, led by the emotionally charged single “Beautiful Strangers,” and delves into themes of love, redemption, companionship, and collective growth. Each song offers a multifaceted look at what “together” means to TXT, with emotional depth that resonates throughout the entire collection. Notably, this album features solo tracks from all five members for the first time, each offering a glimpse into their perspectives and adding a new layer to the group's shared narrative. These solo contributions expand TXT's musical universe, introducing varied emotional tones and distinct styles.


	Each member brings something unique to the table. YEONJUN's “Ghost Girl” stands out with its bold, conceptual charisma, while SOOBIN shines with a laid-back, feel-good pop track in “Sunday Driver.” HUENINGKAI surprises with a Latin-inspired dance-pop hit “Dance With You.” BEOMGYU offers a deeply emotional rock ballad in “Take My Half,” a reflection of his personal growth, and, for the last, TAEHYUN's “Bird of Night” highlights his vocal prowess, with a poetic and soulful R&B ballad that stands as a testament to his range. Accompanying these solo tracks are individual music videos, further expanding the TXT universe both sonically and visually. YEONJUN contributed the lyrics of “Ghost Girl” and the group track “Upside Down Kiss,” while BEOMGYU produced “Take My Half.” These personal contributions further solidify TXT's artistic footprint on the album.


The Star Chapter: TOGETHER not only marks the conclusion of TXT's seven-year journey but also serves as a beacon, guiding them toward uncharted territory and exciting new chapters. With this album, the group invites fans to explore the depth of their story and the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.


	With the release of their fourth studio album, TXT has made waves on the Billboard charts, securing the top spots on three major lists for the week of Aug. 9, dominating the Top Album Sales and World Albums charts, while also achieving their highest ranking yet on the Billboard 200, debuting at No. 3. These milestones not only highlight their musical excellence, but also underscore the increasing global recognition of their artistry. With ongoing praise from leading international outlets, the excitement surrounding TXT's future is palpable, and all eyes are on the brilliant trajectory they are poised to follow. 


	Below, find our ranking of all eight tracks on The Star Chapter: TOGETHER.


	“Dance With You” is a Latin dance-pop track that blends vibrant guitar riffs with a rhythmic bass line to create an addictive groove. HUENINGKAI not only delivers his signature clear tone, but also ventures into lower registers for the first time, focusing on expanding his artistic range. Opening with a whispered murmur on the dance floor, his voice makes notable use of deep tones, adding a subtle allure to the track. The sensual lyrics, likening the desire to resemble someone to a dance shared together, further enhance its charm.


	However, compared to BEOMGYU, who took part in production, YEONJUN, who co-wrote the lyrics, and SOOBIN and TAEHYUN, who fully played to their individual strengths, HUENINGKAI's delivery feels somewhat confined within a safe framework. Even so, it remains a meaningful step forward in exploring new musical possibilities.


	Opening with a lyrical piano introduction, Taehyun's emotive voice gradually layers over it, building the song's emotion step by step. His ability to lead the piece through delicate vocal control alone, without relying on high notes, is truly impressive. Amid the calm instrumentation and simple rhythm, his voice acts like an instrument in itself, anchoring the song at its core. Among the five solo tracks, this is the one where his vocal ability shines most brightly, leaving a vivid impression of his potential and promise not just as TXT's main vocalist, but as a vocalist in his own right. The emotional expression woven throughout the track is equally striking. In lyrics such as “the reason I think of you in the darkness where we're looking at the same star,” Taehyun offers a fresh perspective on relationships — that even without being physically together, you can still be “together” if you are looking in the same direction. Lines like “The deeper the darkness, the brighter it shines” and “Any darkness in this world will someday glow” deliver a quiet sense of comfort and hope, assuring that like a bird flying through an anxious night, even in hardship, morning will eventually come.


	SOOBIN's response to the question of “togetherness” is as bright and refreshing as a summer afternoon bathed in sunlight. Aptly titled, this easy-listening pop track feels like a calm Sunday drive through a quiet city, carrying a laid-back, carefree vibe. In answering the same question posed to all five members, SOOBIN paints a more leisurely picture of togetherness with lyrics like, “There's no need to rush, take it slow,” and “Your hand is all I need,” inviting listeners to embrace the simple joy of time spent together.


	As the track moves toward its close, his clear, delicately soaring falsetto emerges as a defining element, lifting the song beyond the bounds of simple easy listening. SOOBIN's voice, reminiscent of a serene summer day, blends seamlessly into the sonic landscape, pulling listeners deeper into the narrative like a soundtrack naturally woven into a picturesque scene. It's a testament to one of his greatest strengths as a pop artist—effortlessly balancing his established public image within the group while gently reaffirming his unique vocal color.


	“Take My Half” is an emotional rock ballad that BEOMGYU co-produced, embedding his musical vision deep within the track. Opening in a quiet, whisper-like tone, his vocals gradually burst forth with emotion, driving the song toward a powerful climax. The spacious arrangement serves as a deliberate device to make his sincerity stand out all the more clearly.


	Lyrically, it represents the essence of the coming-of-age narrative TXT has consistently portrayed. It begins with the cynical line, “Let everything be ruined except for me,” moves into a pledge of devotion with, “I'll leave half of me for you,” and ultimately arrives at the quietly redemptive, “The empty space I left is now brimming with happiness.” This progression, coupled with BEOMGYU's dynamic vocal control, pulls the listener deeply into the story of a boy's inner growth and the changes that unfold within it.


	When faced with the shared question of “togetherness,” BEOMGYU answered, “Sharing what I have is the very way I become happy.” That thoughtful perspective is fully captured in this track, which delivers the most profound narrative and emotional resonance among the five.”


	In “Beautiful Strangers,” lines like “Kiss the scar on your back” and “Even if the world laughs at us” feel like a romantic expansion of the sentiment first hinted at in the playful phrase “Baby girl let's get freaky” from the album's opening track, “Upside Down Kiss.” It also serves as TXT's declaration that what may be seen as flaws in the eyes of the world can still be beautiful to each other.


	As the album's title track, “Beautiful Strangers” brings together key figures who embody the essence of the “BIGHIT Sound,” including Chief Producer Bang Si-hyuk and Slow Rabbit. Opening with a gentle piano melody, the song swells into a powerful chorus as explosive synthesizers cascade like a meteor shower. This sonic shift deepens the listener's immersion in the growth narrative, where the narrator—once changed by “you”—has now transformed into the “me” who saves each other.


	Dance breaks placed in the intro, chorus, and outro further heighten anticipation for its live performances. Notably, YEONJUN participated in choreographing a title track for the first time, amplifying the synergy expected on stage. This is a track that fully delivers on everything audiences anticipate from a K-pop artist's title song.


	What a daring choice for an opening track. Built on ‘80s-inspired synthesizers and New Jack Swing, “Upside Down Kiss” stands out as one of the boldest and most sensual songs in TXT's entire discography. The provocative lyric, “mocking gravity, lips almost touching,” goes beyond its literal meaning, symbolizing the emotional and external barriers that exist between two people. Soon after, the repeated low-pitched hook pulses with a firm, resolute will to choose “you” despite those obstacles — as if watching a once-impulsive boy grow into a mature figure with unwavering determination.


	YEONJUN's funky rap, as a lyric contributor, injects an extra spark into the track, while the steady harmony of the vocal line anchors its core even more firmly. As the album's opener, it clearly presents TOMORROW X TOGETHER's current musical confidence and their direction toward a new world. The boy who once wavered is now a strong, sensual figure, choosing “you” without hesitation, undeterred by any interference.


	Opening with the sensual intensity of “Upside Down Kiss,” the album comes to a heartfelt close with its final track, “Song of the Stars.” For those who have ever felt the profound bond between artist and fan, this song will resonate with particular force. Echoing the journey that began with “Now I will call your name,” lyrics like “the name I was first called” and “the tears we cried together” vividly recall the seven-year history shared between TXT and their devoted fandom, MOA.


	As the track moves into its latter half, the emotional weight grows heavier. The repetition of “my name,” followed by “na na na” and then “your name,” creates a vivid, almost cinematic experience, mirroring the call-and-response moments between artists and fans at live concerts. The line “Even if we part someday, let's meet here again” imbues the song with a sense of eternal connection, further amplifying its poignancy.


	“Song of the Stars” condenses seven years of shared memories between TXT and MOA into one concentrated, emotionally charged moment. As the album's epilogue, it brings The Star Chapter: TOGETHER to a powerful and deeply moving close.


	“Ghost Girl” is a reggae rock track that masterfully fuses intensity with lyrical depth, creating a rebellious yet poetic mood. UK-based singer-songwriter YNGBLD, born in 1998, participated in the track's production, amplifying its rebellious and decadent atmosphere. The exceptional concept execution glimpsed in the album's opening track, Upside Down Kiss, fully blossoms in YEONJUN's solo song. His emotional delivery is razor-sharp, and his expression is effortlessly stylish. The track captures YEONJUN's magnetic presence as he continues to grow — both within the group and as a solo performer. By contributing to the lyrics himself, he heightened the synchronicity between artist and song. It's a moment that leaves you wondering about the peak he has yet to reach. One of TXT's greatest strengths — crafting narratives that unfold like a full-fledged drama through music alone — reaches its peak here, making “Ghost Girl” unquestionably the album's most striking moment. Without a doubt, it's the standout track of the record.

The Atlanta native's sixth studio album is here.

	Michael Saponara



Gunna makes it four years in a row with the release of a solo album as The Last Wun hit streaming services on Friday (Aug. 8).


	The 25-track album includes singles “Won't Stop” and “Him All Along,” while the Atlanta rapper invites Offset, Wizkid, Asake, Burna Boy and Nechie for collaborations.


	Based on the finality of the project's title, there has been speculation from fans that this is Gunna's last project on YSL Records/300 Entertainment.

	“It'll come to me just through life and just living,” Gunna told Uproxx of the album in June. “So for this album in particular, it's no theme. It's in current time of what's happening with me.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Gunna commissioned painter Devon DeJardin for the album's cover art, which found DeJardin depicting the Atlanta rapper in sculpture form. “It was about trying to capture Gunna in his essence of where he is in his life,” DeJardin told Rolling Stone. “And then adding stylistic elements to it, to represent anger and vengefulness but also represent peace, stability, perseverance, grinding. It's like he's working through his pain and grit, and he has a literal chip on the shoulder as if he's got something to prove right now.”


	The 32-year-old last earned a No. 1 album atop the Billboard 200 with 2022's DS4EVER, but all of his albums have peaked inside the chart's top three and gone No. 1 on the Top Rap Albums chart.


Freddie Gibbs sent shots in Gunna's direction on Alfredo 2, but it remains to be seen if the Atlanta rhymer will address the opposition with his latest LP.

The project marks the brothers third LP since reuniting in 2019.

	Hannah Dailey



	The Jonas Brothers are saying hello to a new era with the release of album Greetings From Your Hometown, which dropped Friday (Aug. 8). 


	Marking the band's seventh studio album, Greetings features 14 tracks, including previously released singles “I Can't Lose,” “Love Me to Heaven,” “No Time to Talk” and “Slow Motion.” It comes four months after the JoBros first announced the LP at JONASCON, and two years after the trio last dropped an album, with 2023's The Album reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200.


	“There's something about being home that reminds you who you are,” brothers Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas wrote of the new project on Instagram in May. “This album is filled with pieces of that, lifelong influences from our childhood and the sounds that we grew up on.”

	











	The JoBros have now released three albums since getting back together in 2019. Before that, the siblings took about 10 years apart to pursue solo projects after feeling unable to resolve internal disagreements about the band's future, eventually reuniting on album Happiness Begins, which spawned their first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Sucker.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Leading up to the release of Greetings, the brothers have been reflecting in recent interviews on how they've grown since their temporary split. “It needed to happen,” Joe said on an episode of Mythical Kitchen's Last Meals series. “We were having such a difficult time just being real with each other back then. Now it's like we can communicate way better, because we don't need to be scared to have tough conversations.”

""This is music that celebrates the beauty found in the in-between spaces,"" the folk icon previously described the LP.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	You've heard him as a rapper, you've heard him as a rocker, and now, MGK is embracing rootsy folk on his new album, Lost Americana.


	Released on Friday (Aug. 8), the LP marks the artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly's first full-length Americana project. It follows a string of hip-hop albums released earlier in his career as well as two pop-punk records: Tickets to My Downfall and Mainstream Sellout, both of which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


Lost Americana arrives about two months after MGK announced the project with an album trailer narrated by Bob Dylan. “It's a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention and a quest to reclaim the essence of American freedom,” the folk icon described the album in the June teaser. “From the glow of neon diners to the rumble of the motorcycles, this is music that celebrates the beauty found in the in-between spaces. Where the past is reimagined, and the future is forged on your own terms.”


	At the time, it wasn't clear whether it was really Dylan whose voice was featured — but during a Tonight Show appearance a few days prior to Lost Americana‘s release, MGK confirmed that it was authentic. “To be honest, I have no idea how he even knows who I am to this day,” he said. “And I'm pretty sure that if I say the wrong thing I'll mess it all up, so I'll just shut up and accept whatever Bob Dylan throws my way.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Led by singles “Cliché,” “Vampire Diaries” and “Miss Sunshine,” Lost Americana is the seventh album MGK has released over the course of his career. The Cleveland-bred artist as become known for experimenting with various genres, something he says is one reason people “hate” on him for no reason.




	“I choose to not stay contained into a societal box,” he said in a recent interview with People. “I've realized they're the conformists — you don't even hate me for a reason that you can actually think of, because all I do is entertain, and entertainment can't be that serious.”

The suit was brought by Ty Fyffe, who produced the song ""Murdergram"" for Jay-Z's 1998 film Streets Is Watching. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Mike Tyson is being sued by the producer of the 1998 Jay-Z, DMX and Ja Rule song “Murdergram” for allegedly featuring the track in an Instagram video promoting his fight against Jake Paul last year without permission.


	The claims come in a legal complaint filed Thursday (Aug. 7) by Ty Fyffe, who co-wrote and produced “Murdergram” for Jay-Z's 1998 film Streets Is Watching. While the song, released by Murder Inc., features Jay (Shawn Carter), DMX (Earl Simmons) and Ja Rule (Jeffrey Atkins), none of those artists or their representatives are involved in the lawsuit.


	It's Fyffe only who takes issue with Tyson using “Murdergram” in a 33-second Instagram video of him training for his blockbuster fight against Paul in November. The alleged Instagram post is no longer on Tyson's page, but Fyffe's lawsuit includes screenshots of the video captioned, “You know what time it is #PaulTyson”.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Neither plaintiff nor any of his representatives granted defendant Tyson permission to use the song title ‘Murdergram' to promote his boxing match with Jake Paul,” reads the complaint. “By listing the song title ‘Murdergram' on his Instagram post, defendant Tyson misled viewers to believe that plaintiff endorsed, or was affiliated or associated with, him and/or his participation in the match.”


	Fyffe claims Tyson's use of “Murdergram” in this video helped drive viewership of his fight with Paul, which was watched live by more than 100 million people and broke Netflix viewing records. The producer cites reports that Tyson was paid more than $20 million for the fight, and he alleges that the attention from the match boosted sales of the boxer's apparel and cannabis products.


	Now, Fyffe says he's entitled to a cut of Tyson's profits from the fight, as well as the royalties he should have been paid for the use of “Murdergram” in the Instagram post.


	“Defendant Tyson's conduct was intentional, willful and with full knowledge of plaintiff's copyright in the song,” says the complaint. “As a consequence of defendant Tyson's infringement, plaintiff has suffered, and will continue to suffer, economic losses and damage to his copyright in the song.”


	Reps for Tyson did not immediately return a request for comment on the claims.

SoundExchange says it ""firmly believes Judge Buchwald's interpretation is entirely wrong on the law,"" and it's considering an appeal.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



A major new court decision disposes of SoundExchange's $150 million case against SiriusXM based on a judge's finding that the royalties-collecting organization does not have the right to bring federal lawsuits, point blank.


	The Thursday (Aug. 7) ruling from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald is the first to weigh in on SoundExchange's standing to file lawsuits as a means of enforcing royalty schemes. The organization, a nonprofit designated by the Copyright Royalty Board to collect royalties for artists, has been bringing these types of federal court actions for more than a decade against radio broadcasters like SiriusXM and music streamers such as Slacker and Napster.


	All of these prior cases have either been settled or referred to the Copyright Royalty Board for resolution. But SiriusXM, having been accused by SoundExchange of “gaming the system” with manipulative bundling in order to withhold more than $150 million in royalties, filed a motion through its attorneys at the firm Weil Gotshal & Manges arguing that the organization actually has no right to sue in the first place.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Now, Judge Buchwald says SiriusXM is right. According to the judge, the federal statute that created SoundExchange, Section 114 of the Copyright Act, authorizes the organization to collect and distribute royalties but says nothing about bringing litigation.


	“There is a dearth of evidence, let alone substantial evidence, for us to infer that Congress's omission of any legal authority for SoundExchange in Section 114 was anything but deliberate,” writes the judge. “Absent such evidence, it would be wholly improper for a court to add terms or provisions where Congress has omitted them. Thus, the text of the Copyright Act clearly lacks an express conferral of a right of action upon SoundExchange.”


	SoundExchange has argued that, regardless of the text of the Copyright Act, other factors like so-called “implied rights,” public policy goals and legislative history support its ability to bring lawsuits.


	But Judge Buchwald is not convinced by any of these arguments — or by SoundExchange's claim that it should be able to litigate royalty disputes as a representative on behalf of artists.


	“SoundExchange exists to facilitate efficient royalty collection and distribution, not to champion the views and interests of copyright owners beyond royalty collection,” says the judge. “SoundExchange exists as a central clearing house for royalty payments, not a legal advocacy group.”


	Reacting to Judge Buchwald's ruling on Thursday evening, SoundExchange says it's “currently reviewing the decision and will consider all options, including appeal and potentially filing actions in state courts to ensure the company's continuing ability to collect all digital performance royalties.”


	“Respectfully, SoundExchange firmly believes Judge Buchwald's interpretation is entirely wrong on the law,” says the organization in a statement. “Despite this unfortunate and incorrect ruling, it is an established and long-accepted fact that SoundExchange has the right to sue negligent providers to compel compliance and payment of mandated royalty fees.”


	SiriusXM, meanwhile, says in its own statement that they “agree with the court's decision that SoundExchange's oversight and enforcement authority is limited.”


	“We have a reasonable, consistent and transparent method to how we allocate royalties across our bundled satellite radio and streaming product,” adds a SiriusXM spokesperson. “We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with SoundExchange and the broader industry to ensure that musicians and artists continue to receive the fair compensation they deserve.”


This story was updated on Aug. 7 at 8:35 p.m. ET to include a statement from SiriusXM.

Co-Business Editor


	Atlanta-based Gray Media has agreed to acquire television stations in ten markets from Byron Allen's Allen Media Group for $171 million.


	The transaction would bring Gray into three new markets – Columbus-Tupelo, Mississippi; Terre Haute, Indiana; and West Lafayette, Indiana – with the acquisition of the local television station in each market that had the highest all-day ratings in 2024, according to Comscore.


	Gray expects the transaction to strengthen the company's presence in the seven other markets by creating new duopolies “that would allow Gray to preserve and deepen public service to their communities with expanded local news, local weather, and local sports programming.”

The portfolio includes 78 markets with the top-rated television station and 99 markets with the first or second highest rated during 2024 as well as the largest Telemundo affiliate group with 44 markets.


	The stations it's acquiring include WAAY (ABC) in Huntsville, AL; WSIL (ABC) in Paducah-Cape Girardeau-Harrisburg; WEVV (CBS/FOX) in Evansville, IN; WFFT (FOX) in Ft.

	Moelis & Company acted as exclusive financial adviser to Allen Media Group in the transaction. AMG, which had grown to become one of the largest independent privately held owners of Big 4 (ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX) network affiliates. engaged the investment bank in June to to sell its television stations across 21 markets. 


	AMG, which invested over $1 billion to build up its local station portfolio, said then that there had been numerous offers from interested buyers and it would use sale proceeds to pay down debt.

Associate Editor, TV


The following reveals major spoilers from Episode 6 of Dexter: Resurrection titled “Cat and Mouse.”


	Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is taking out serial killers left and right on Dexter: Resurrection, and nobody is safe. 


	In the show's freshman season thus far, Dexter has escaped the Grim Reaper and is now living in New York City, where he reunited with his son, Harrison Morgan (Jack Alcott). He's also connected with some like-minded individuals: Lowell (Neil Patrick Harris), Mia (Krysten Ritter), Gareth (David Dastmalchian), and Al (Eric Stonestreet), brought together by Leon Prater (Peter Dinklage), a mysterious billionaire with a penchant for serial killers.

	Although Prater has a rule against his guests offing one another, Dexter can't help himself. Off the bat, he takes down Lowell in Episode 4, a tattoo collector ready to pounce on a new victim. Next is Mia, a stunning sommelier who seems to follow a killer code, similar to Dexter, but is later revealed to be a Black Widow in disguise. She kills because she loves the thrill of the hunt, which drags her victims back to her house, where she ends them for sport. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Mia tempts Dexter with a ménage à trois, but not the kind with a happy ending. She is hoping her attractive counterpart might join her for a little dining, dancing, and death. Yes, she wanted them to collaborate on a murder. Dexter was tempted, but was turned off by her killer confession. Instead, he spies on her from a safe distance while she brings her next victim home. When the attack begins, he places an anonymous call to the police, who rush in and arrest Mia and save a terrified man before his life flashed before his eyes.


	She is taken to jail, where she is visited by Charley (Uma Thurman), Prater's head of security, who promises Mia that she won't be there long. Little did Mia know just how short her stay would be. In Episode 6, Mia is killed while in her cell. Leaving one less hungry killer for Prater to invite to his next dinner party. 

	











	It's important to note: Dexter did not kill Mia. But, it appears he might've also killed Gareth, aka, Gemini Killer. We will have to stay tuned for next week's episode to see what really went down.


	Our time with Mia, also known as Lady Vengeance, was short, but Ritter had a blast guest-starring on the show and collaborating with Hall. It also happened to fit perfectly into her schedule, right before starting work on Daredevil: Born Again, reprising the role of Jessica Jones. 


	Returning to the character years after the popular eponymous Marvel series for Netflix concluded gave Ritter something unique to bond over with Hall. Nearly a decade had passed since Dexter left Miami to become a logger when the actor reembodied the serial killer in the Showtime Limited Series, Dexter: New Blood, to be followed by a full commitment to a new series, Dexter: Resurrection. 


More from our interview with her discussing all of the above can be found via this link.


	More from our interview with Ritter, full of spoilers from tonight's episode, can be found below.


DEADLINE: You're going to return to the role of Jessica Jones, and here you are on Dexter, a series that has come back from the dead, with a lead reprising his role. Fans worried that the show would not be great, but everyone has happily been surprised. 


KRYSTEN RITTER: I mean, it's so good! I can't believe they were able to do all of this and keep the show going. It's a legacy TV show. And it just goes to show, when you have the right writing and the right actors, it's magic, and people want more and more. Another thing that appealed to me was that all of my scenes were opposite Michael. And getting to work with an actor like that, oh, my God, what a masterclass.


DEADLINE: What is he like around the set? Does he stay in character?


KR: When he was with me, we were very much on the same level. We were very like, connected, and playful with one another. But there were definitely some moments where I was like, “Wait, he's so natural.” You know? I was like, “Is he in character right now? Is this Dexter or Michael C. Hall?” Sometimes you don't know, because he's so natural. If you caught him rehearsing one of his lines, he would keep people wondering if he was talking to them. [Laughs] Watching him work, and watching what he would do and why, then when it got to his closeup, he would sink in even deeper. I had a front row seat to his process, and it was awesome.


DEADLINE: Mia and Dexter are comfortable with one another when they first meet. Was that due to the words on the page, or the chemistry and trust built between two actors on set?


KR: That was so exciting because it doesn't always happen. Before Dexter, Michael and I hadn't met before. Our first day was during the Central Park running scene, and it was very cold. I had a big dialogue scene, and I was prepared. I showed up and said, “I'm here. Let's have some fun!” We just hit it off immediately and really connected. We had a natural rapport. But you never know, that's just catching a little magic. We were lucky that we worked together so well, and I was really excited to work with someone like him.


DEADLINE: Fans will surely be sad that there won't be a future for Mia and Dexter, because for a hot minute, we were really shipping them.


KR: Shooting Episode 5 was exciting because of that turn. When I'm sitting down to read all the scripts, it's an exciting character twist and another color to play. And I just loved how deranged and psychotic she turns out to be. She starts off very cool and deliberate, and then when she and Dexter warm up, it's kind of very sexy and electric. But it turns out that she's a bad guy, and that's not gonna go well.

	











DEADLINE: There are so many good storylines yet to play out. Did you take a peek at any of the scripts for the forthcoming episodes?


KR: To be honest with you, I didn't want to read the last two episodes. As a fan of the show, I want to be able to watch it. I mean, I know what happens because you're on set and you hear whispers. Now that I'm done, I have an opportunity to watch every Friday when new episodes come out, just like you guys do. I've been doing that every week now.  


	And, you know what? At this point in my career, I don't always watch everything that I'm in. I mostly do the work, keep my head down, and move on. But for this, I was salivating to watch this. I loved playing this character so much. What a choice role.


DEADLINE: If you could send Mia off into the afterlife, what would you say? Or perhaps, what would you put on her tombstone?


KR: It would be something very short, very succinct, and very dangerous. 


DEADLINE: Here lies Lady Vengeance…


KR: …sipping her wine, still fabulous in the afterlife.

International Investigations Editor


Rebel Wilson has been accused of defamation by an actress in The Deb, her directorial debut that has become embroiled in a messy legal saga.


	An attorney representing Charlotte MacInnes — who plays a teenager attending a debutante ball in The Deb — has written to Wilson, arguing that the Australian star damaged her reputation in a series of Instagram posts between September 2024 and July 2025.


	Among her social media claims, Wilson alleged that MacInnes changed her story about being sexually harassed by The Deb producer Amanda Ghost after she was cast in Boston stage show Gatsby and was offered a record deal.

	Wilson also claimed that MacInnes lied by denying that she had made a complaint to Wilson about unwanted sexual advances made by Ghost during production.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the “concerns notice,” the first stage of defamation proceedings in Australia, Giles George lawyer Patrick George wrote: “The publications carried seriously defamatory imputations damaging to Ms MacInnes' personal and professional reputation. 


	“This was her first lead role in a film and you cruelled her professional reputation before she could even enjoy the benefit of the success of the film as the lead actress.”


	MacInnes' defamation claim adds to a growing pile of lawsuits around the musical movie, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September last year.


The Deb's producers, Ghost, Gregory Cameron, and Vince Holden, filed a defamation suit against Wilson in the Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming she was “spreading vicious lies without regard for the irreparable damage her reckless words would cause.”


In a counter suit, lawyers for Wilson said that the Pitch Perfect star is “determined to fight not only for herself but also for The Deb and for all those who have silently suffered” from producer Ghost's “reprehensible actions over the years.”


	A third complaint was lodged in New South Wales last month by UK-based AI Film (part of Len Blavatnik's Access Industries Group), a producer on The Deb. It accuses Wilson of deliberately sabotaging the film's release.

	











	Wilson responded on Instagram: “As the director, producer, and co-star who nurtured a project called The Deb for five years from a three-page idea into a gorgeous feature film, I want nothing more than to have this film released, and have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to get this to happen.”


	Wilson's agent has been contacted for comment.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


FRIDAY AM UPDATE: Official studio numbers are in, with New Line's Zach Cregger horror pic Weapons armed with $5.7M and Disney's Lindsay Lohan-Jamie Lee Curtis sequel Freakier Friday counting $3.1M.


	For Weapons, that's higher than the preview take of New Line's Final Destination Bloodlines ($5.5M in May), as well as Warner Bros' Sinners ($4.7M in April). Muy bien. Don't get excited and call the movie at $50M+. yet Let's just let this beauty of a scare play, and we'll see how it legs out.


	Thursday audiences in Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak exits for Weapons show a very good 65% definite recommend and four stars. Guys over 25 bought 37% of the tickets, women over 25 and guys under 25 but were 23%, and women under 25 were 17%; overall the pic saw a male-skewing turnout at 60%.

Freakier Friday had an 86% general audience, 9% parents, and 6% kids under 12 audience. Definite recommend is a good 61% with 4 1/2 stars from general audiences and 5 stars from kids and parents. Huge female turnout at 71% with 47% over 25, and 23% under 25. 


Freakier Friday is booked at 3,975 theatres with 850 PLF screens and 150+ Dbox/motion screens (Huh?There's no roller coaster in the movie). Freakier Friday will have daytime showtimes on the PLFs, while Weapons takes the evenings. Imax auditoriums belong to Cregger. 


	One femme millennial fave comp for Freakier Friday is Paramount's musical reboot of Mean Girls which did $3.3M in previews before a $28.6M opening.

	The rest of the week was as follows:


	1.) The Fantastic Four: First Steps (Dis) 4,125 theaters, Thu $2.89M (-25% from Wednesday), Week $56.3M (-64%), Total $214.8M/Wk 2


	2.) The Bad Guys 2 (Uni) 3,852 theaters, Thu $2M (-20%) Wk $33M/Wk 1

	7.) Sketch (Angel) 2006 theaters, Thu $498K (-75%), Week $2.45M/Wk 1 


RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office


EXCLUSIVE:  New Line's Zach Cregger R-rated horror movie Weapons is currently seeing a preview figure in the neighborhood of the label's earlier summer spooky movie, Final Destination Bloodlines, with $5M+. Walk-up business could drive it higher by the time we get the official number Friday morning. Meanwhile, Disney's sequel to 2003's Freaky Friday, Freakier Friday, is around $3M in previews, sources tell us. Tracking pegged both movies' openings at $30M+ earlier in the weekend, but we've heard in recent days that Weapons is pulling ahead with at least a low- to mid-$30M take or even more.


	Fandango reported that Weapons ranked as the second-best horror ticket pre-seller of the year, behind Sinners at the same point in its sales cycle and ahead of Final Destination Bloodlines. It boasts excellent reviews at 97% certified fresh with an audience score of 90%.


	Whether Weapons goes higher depends on whether this movie breaks beyond its core fan audience, who is showing up tonight and Friday. Horror movies, as we know, tend to be frontloaded. How do we know if Weapons isn't frontloaded? It needs an ease by 12%-14% in its Friday/previews to Saturday. That was the Friday-to-Saturday dip for such movies as Us, Final Destination Bloodlines and Sinners. 


	Warners ran a very clever campaign, creating mystery as to why kids from a single a classroom fled their respective bedrooms in the middle of the night in a small town.


Weapons‘ preview cash is ahead of Sinners‘ $4.7M and might approach or pass Final Destination Bloodlines‘ $5.5M. Sinners‘ previews repped 24% of its $19.2M Friday, which translated into a $48M opening. Bloodlines' previews were 26% of its $20.9M Friday, which turned into a $51.6M opening. Among original horror movies, not based on any pre-existing IP, Jordan Peele's Us is tops in previews with $7.4M. That movie went on to do $28.9M first Friday and a 3-day of $71.1M.


	Note both pics' preview figures included Thursday showtimes plus Wednesday previews. Weapons had a showtime with Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas on Wednesday night, with previews starting Thursday at 2:17 p.m. — an odd time in reference to a specific time in the movie. Freakier Friday held Wednesday previews at 7 p.m., 22 years to the day after the original movie bowed, with showtimes kicking off at 2 p.m. today.


Freakier Friday‘s preview figure isn't far from other PG-rated fare of late, Disney's Mufasa: The Lion King‘s $3.3M ($35.4M opening) and Warner Bros' Wonka‘s $3.5M ($39M opening). No audience score yet on the Lindsay Lohan-Jamie Lee Curtis movie, but RT reviews are at 73% certified fresh.

Disastrous legs for Fantastic Four. Looking at potentially another 60+% drop this weekend.

Good new ideas beat tired old IP again – for a much better margin as well.  Execs who try to hang on to the security blanket of played out IP to avoid making actual judgement calls should become new golfers.

You couldn't pay me to take my kids to a Disney movie, but my wife and I will definitely be seeing Weapons this weekend.

Sitting in theater right now for WEAPONS at 11:50AM.

Julia Garner is having a good summer.

I love her.  I hope she still gets to play Madonna.

Weapons will open over $40 million with a long shot at $50 million.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sunset Boulevard is 75 and the pictures are smaller than ever","https://www.avclub.com/sunset-boulevard-film-noir-small-pictures","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

As 1950 began, Paramount Pictures launched an innovative and grand word-of-mouth campaign for Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard by hosting a series of screenings for Hollywood icons and insiders. Before one such screening, MGM head Louis B. Mayer hosted a dinner party for Wilder, star Gloria Swanson, and others, before they all decamped to a screening room to watch the film. According to Sam Staggs' Close-Up On Sunset Boulevard, what happened next was the stuff of Hollywood legend. When the film ended, the room, packed with titans of the film industry, erupted in rapturous praise. Barbara Stanwyck approached Swanson, openly weeping, and literally bent to kiss the hem of the elder star's gown. Mary Pickford, retired from acting for years but still secure in her standing as one of the silent era's most impactful figures, was so overcome that she essentially disappeared after the credits rolled, unable to speak to anyone. 

But as Wilder said goodnight to his friends and colleagues and made his way out into the lobby, he found that not everyone had been so impressed. Mayer, surrounded by his entourage, was railing against the film, and when he saw Wilder, he exploded, accusing the filmmaker of trampling on the industry that had given him a career: “You should be kicked out of this country, tarred and feathered, goddamn foreigner son of a bitch.”

While Wilder was not yet an elder Hollywood statesman, the then-43-year-old was already a hitmaker with a decade-and-a-half of movies under his belt. He'd escaped Nazi Germany, lost loved ones in the Holocaust, and made his reputation by writing and directing smart, propulsive films across genres. Just a few years earlier, he'd made the back-to-back classics Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend (the latter of which won him Best Director and Screenplay at the Oscars). He was no meek Hollywood yes-man. What Wilder actually said to Mayer is lost to time, but the sentiment is always the same. As Staggs reports in his history: “I directed the picture. Why don't you go fuck yourself?”

Less than two years later, Mayer was done at MGM, and by the end of the decade he was dead, a former kingmaker and Hollywood god-emperor whose time had passed. 75 years later, and Sunset Boulevard is still one of the most prescient, haunting films Hollywood has ever produced—it's easy to see why Mayer was so angry.

Death surrounds Sunset Boulevard, draping itself across every frame like one of Norma Desmond's (Swanson) ornate veils. It's a film that begins in the gutter, with a shot of the title street's name painted on a curb, and even as Hollywood glamour rears its head, it really never leaves it. The story is told in flashback by a dead man, murdered screenwriter-turned-gigolo Joe Gillis (William Holden), first seen as a body floating facedown in a swimming pool. The engine of the plot is an aging silent star, initially met preparing a somber funeral for her pet chimp. 

Sunset Boulevard places audiences in a haunted house called Hollywood. The deepest and most obvious metaphors running through Sunset Boulevard, the ones Mayer got so mad about back in 1950, are about Hollywood discards, people culled from an industry they love no matter how feverishly they fight back, and the deadly consequences that ensue when a bygone era butts up against the current guard. It's the movie industry literally shooting itself in the back.

What's striking is how that clash of eras, personalities, and worldviews are not only still present, but arguably more savage than ever. No one is immune from the cordoning off of individual content fiefdoms in modern Hollywood, a world where legendary stars and hungry upstarts alike can still be chewed up and spit back out into rundown bungalows and decaying mansions like Joe and Norma.

Joe, stumbling upon Norma's expansive home while fleeing from some goons trying to repo his car, immediately recognizes the house as a place of darkness, just as he clearly sees Hollywood for what it is: A factory where the hardest workers are those most readily tossed aside. Norma, though, is so steeped in the glamour of her glory days that she can't comprehend the rundown state of her mansion's grounds, or the dried-up stream of fan mail now entirely manufactured by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She is a ghost who's drifted out of time, haunting the present with echoes of a past long gone. The contrast between these figures, dialed up as sharply as the light and shadows of cinematographer John F. Seitz's compositions, is the engine for the film's tension. But the audience knows how it ends. It's inevitable. And that's partially because neither the cynical Joe nor delusional Norma is really wrong about Hollywood.

Thus, the response from Mayer, who not only oversaw MGM when it was the biggest and most successful studio in Hollywood, but who cultivated the “star system” which controlled every aspect of a potential star's life and work, tying them not just to a company but to a preconceived idea of who and what they should be. Judy Garland's meteoric rise, and the drug abuse and psychological trauma that were its consequences? Mayer's handiwork, just as ruthlessly calculated as the overwhelming, Best Picture-winning might of films like The Great Ziegfeld and Mutiny On The Bounty. 

It's no wonder, then, that he was so infuriated by a film that lays the raw reality of Hollywood bare not by directly critiquing it, but by presenting two very different Hollywood lives and concluding that they've both been fed into the same blood-powered money machine. Norma's tragedy is distinct from Joe's, but they collide because that is the legacy of Mayer's Hollywood, a world in which stars and struggling writers alike are simply cogs, turned by ruthless moguls. Though the movies made by the industry look different now, the plights of those that make them haven't changed much. The most famous line in Sunset Boulevard comes just moments after Norma and Joe meet, when Joe dares to say that the movie star used to be big. Norma's response, “I am big. It's the pictures that got small,” is a part of her elaborate delusion, but with a timeless truth embedded within: In our world, artworks become products.  

The pictures got small because box office returns, awards statuettes, and competing titans moving stars and sets around like Monopoly buildings never went away. As wannabe old-school moguls like Warner Bros.' David Zaslav discard years of work for tax write-offs and streaming services design movies to be passive, “second screen” viewing experiences, and the pictures are smaller than ever. The blockbusters are bigger—in a financial sense—but the grand impact of cinema as a whole continues to lessen even as ardent cinephiles fight back. Elaborate sets built by craftsmen have given way to empty warehouses and digital screens. Private equity-driven studios are all too happy to feed the work of hundreds into the shredder if it means getting a kickback. Audiences, taught that films are just things that play in the background, take photos of the screen in the theater (or just wait until they can stream it). In many ways, movies have been reduced to content, clout, and cash.

The anxieties of Sunset Boulevard are still the anxieties of modern Hollywood, with send-ups like The Studio (the most savage Hollywood takedown of its era which, naturally, came not as a film but as a streaming series) revealing the corporate quagmires and warring egos in the way of getting something resembling art onto a screen. But there are still those—Norma Desmond's “wonderful people out there in the dark”—watching, waiting, and hoping. The tragedy of Sunset Boulevard when it infuriated Louis B. Mayer was Hollywood shooting itself in the back. The tragedy of Sunset Boulevard now is that, deep down, we all hope that Norma Desmond was right, and that one day the pictures will be big again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","It sounds like Mike White had to pretty much beg to get back on Survivor","https://www.avclub.com/mike-white-jeff-probst-begged-survivor-return","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 04:43:00 GMT","

As far as TV trivia goes, the only thing that might be weirder than “White Lotus creator Mike White was once on a season of Survivor (and two seasons of The Amazing Race)” might be “Mike White is going to be on another season of Survivor, now that he's much more famous than he was back then.” As we reported back in May, White has officially been announced as a contestant on the show's 50th season, returning to the competition series after coming in second place back in 2018's David vs. Goliath season. And, by all accounts, he basically had to beg to make the cut.

This comes from (sort of) reading between the lines of a new THR interview with Survivor head guy (and personal friend of White's) Jeff Probst, titled “Why Jeff Probst Finally Let Mike White Return To Survivor.” Probst himself is a bit more diplomatic than that headline implies, saying how gratified he was that White would agree to do the show again now that he's become one of HBO's hottest showrunners. “Honestly, I'm grateful to consider him a friend,” Probst notes at one point. “Because I learn from Mike every day. You're talking [about] one of the best of all time, and the fact that he said yes to Survivor still brings a smile on my face.” But the article also suggests that Probst “stubbornly” turned White down for a possible return for several years, which lines up with White's own comments about his attempts to return to the series . (Notably a 2021 New Yorker profile from just as The White Lotus was getting hot, in which White said Probst had all but told him he wouldn't get another shot, saying, “Now that Probst knows I can get to the end, I don't think he wants there to be a chance of that happening again.”)

There was, after all, a reason that White (who'd already written and appeared in stuff like School Of Rock by then) was classified as a “Goliath” in his initial season. (Which he also had to basically beg for, by the way, especially because, in his own words, Survivor doesn't like taking “sloppy seconds” from other competition reality shows.) Back then, he still wasn't quite a household name (except in houses like ours, where it was genuinely surreal to tune in to Survivor and see Mr. Enlightened puttering around the camp), but now, after three seasons of White Lotus, the whole thing seems outright bizarre. In the THR interview, Probst calls the tension of his buddy's increased celebrity “fun,” which seems a lot more diplomatic than “massively distracting.” (Note, for instance, that we're obsessively talking about Survivor 50 before Survivor 49 has even had a chance to air.) Probst did address the fact that White has not been shy about casting folks from his season in The White Lotus, which seems like it would have a hugely deforming impact on the show's famed “social game,” saying, “I really love the cameos and how he uses people. And I think that, too, speaks to Mike as a person. He's able to be one of the Hollywood elite, in terms of show creators, but he's also able to do the show with people who are not from Hollywood, and then invite them into his world and say, ‘Why don't you come experience what it's like to be on the set of White Lotus for a day?' and, ‘I'm going to put you in the seat.' That's incredible confidence and incredible generosity of spirit.” (Probst was quick to note that he has no interest in being cast in the HBO series himself.)

Really, though, it sounds like Mike White just really likes Survivor, and would not stop reminding Probst of this fact whenever the topic of one of the show's occasional reunion seasons would come up. Probst suggests in the THR piece—which also points out that White basically bailed on the Emmy campaign for his HBO series' third season in order to go get sunburnt on an island—that it plays into the same interest in social dynamics that powers White Lotus, saying, “When you watch White Lotus, what are you watching? You're watching human behavior all day. I think that's part of the reason Mike is back.” That being said, we're more partial to a quote White gave himself, in a 2018 Entertainment Weekly interview in which he acknowledged that his suggestions to Probst encouraged the show to kill off its old “Redemption Island” concept. “It's the ritual killing aspect of Survivor where the stakes at the end are that someone's dead,” White emphasized of his love for the series. “The idea that they can come back to life just feels like it takes that away. I think there's a primal, ritualistic, killing thing that is part of the pleasure of the game…  I like when you're just with the people as they're stewing in their juices and plotting each other's demise. That's my favorite part of the game.” So, yeah: Mike White really fucking likes Survivor.

It's not a big mystery why Will Smith's latest Netflix movie, Fast And Loose, has had some trouble getting off the ground over the last three years. First, potential director David Leitch backed away from the project in early 2022, deciding to pursue his project The Fall Guy instead. This turned out to be a pretty lucky decision for Leitch, since he made the choice just a week ahead of the 94th Academy Awards, during which Smith hopped up on stage and slapped the project straight into Netflix's “Let's sleep on this for a minute” pile. It took two years—and the success of Bad Boys: Ride Or Die—to get the streamer feeling enthusiastic again, now with Smith's original Bad Boys director Michael Bay attached. Now, though, we have to ask: Is this thing genuinely cursed, or is it just the Will Smith of it all? Because THR reports that Bay has now dropped out of the film, citing “creative differences” with his star.

It's worth noting that the premise for the film definitely sounds like a Will Smith Netflix movie—Bright! Still technically available to stream!—with the actor playing “a crime boss who loses his memory after an attack and gradually learns that he was leading a double life as a CIA agent.” It's not clear how much room there even is in that idea for creative differences to crop up, but Bay and Smith apparently found them. (Although Bay has a producing credit on the later Bad Boys films, he last directed Smith in 2003's Bad Boys II.) The script itself has been credited to Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Chris Bremner (who worked on the last two Bad Boys movie), and Marvel guy Eric Pearson, from a script originally sold to Netflix by the Hoebers. (Who, by dint of writing Battleship, The Meg, RED, and more, were really out there penning Netflix-style movies before Netflix-style movies were even a thing.)

Deadline offers up at least a bit of speculation on where the split between Smith and Bay came from: The director reportedly wanted to amplify the movie's action elements, while Smith wanted to play up its comedic aspects. Now, of course, nobody gets anything—at least until Netflix lures a third director to get this possibly cursed effort to jumpstart Smith's stalled public rehabilitation off the ground.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The New Paramount is here, still just gonna go with what worked for someone else","https://www.avclub.com/new-paramount-buys-high-side-timothee-chalamet-james-mangold-superbike-heists","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 01:04:00 GMT","

Earlier today, Paramount finally finished selling itself to Skydance Media, a merger that has seen the company bend over backwards, sell out its own stated principles, and bow to bullies in the highest offices of power in order to make it happen. But now it's finally done, and “New Paramount” is here to shake things up, do something new, and generally make use of all that hard-won, dearly bought freedom. Which is to say, hire the two guys who just brought in a bunch of Oscar nominations for Disney last year, to see if they can't work that magic again.

This is per THR, which reports that the very first acquisition Paramount has made in its new incarnation is High Side, a biker film that will team back up A Complete Unknown‘s James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet, albeit for something that sounds a bit more Fast And Furious than “Will this odd little man play an electric guitar in a way that makes the folk musicians very mad?” Specifically, the film comes from an unpublished story from Jaime Oliveira, and centers on “A former MotoGP racer. Haunted by a career-ending crash and a family legacy of abandonment, he is drawn back into the world of high-speed risks and extreme danger when his estranged brother, already being pursued by the FBI, recruits him for a series of bank robberies on superbikes.” Which definitely sounds like Mangold is back in his Ford Vs. Ferrari mindset, which it's hard to complain about. (Honestly, they had us at “bank robberies on superbikes,” an extremely powerful phrase in terms of activating the 12-year-old kid portions of the human brain.)

Notably, the acquisition makes it clear that Paramount is looking to throw some money around to re-make its name under the new ownership; High Side was reportedly a “competitive situation,” meaning the studio beat out a bunch of other companies that were not also busy throwing “settlement money” at the current administration in order to smooth things over with the FCC. Mangold, at least, sounds enthusiastic about the project, praising his co-producers and calling Chalamet “a trusted collaborator, a generational artist and a person I adore. I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and work together again.”

Kelly Clarkson is very private about her personal life and kept her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's battle with cancer out of the spotlight for the sake of their children. When the “American Idol” season 1 winner announced that she was postponing some of her Las Vegas concerts, she revealed it was due to Blackstock's illness.

In an August 2025 report from Us Weekly, a source told the outlet, “Even though they went through an acrimonious divorce, Kelly made a conscious decision to protect Brandon's privacy until the very end for the sake of their family.”

Clarkson never revealed her ex-husband's illness when she took a break from her daytime talk show earlier this year.

“He'd been sick for a while, but his health really took a turn for the worse earlier this year. That's why she was MIA from her talk show,” the source shared.

They added, “Out of respect, Kelly chose not to say anything publicly until it became clear this week that Brandon wasn't going to make it.”

A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)

On August 6, Clarkson took to Instagram to share that she had to postpone some of her Las Vegas “Studio Sessions” concert dates because her ex-husband was ill.

“Unfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,” she wrote.

Clarkson continued, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them.”

The “Idol” alum added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”

Blackstock died on August 7 at age 48 after a long battle with cancer. “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” a rep for the Blackstock family shared in a statement.

“Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,” the statement noted. “We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

Clarkson and Blackstock married in October 2013 and filed for divorce in June 2020; they finalized their divorce in March 2022. She and Blackstock have two children, River Rose and Remington Alexander.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Cassie Ventura Gives First Update Since the Birth of Her Baby","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/cassie-ventura-update-birth-baby-first/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:02:29 GMT","

Singer Cassie Ventura has been in the news quite a bit over the last couple of years. Of course, many of the headlines have been for unfortunate reasons. However, she and her husband, Alex Fine, also welcomed a new baby on May 27. Now, she's provided an update on the bundle of joy. 

This new baby marks Ventura and Fine's third child. The first, Frankie, was born in 2019, and the second, Sunny, arrived two years later in 2021. 

Ventura has been fairly quiet since giving birth in May, as she and her husband have been adjusting to life with three kids. Now, according to TMZ, the singer has provided an update. Notably, she did so with a light-hearted post about the very serious topic of postpartum depression. 

Ventura did this by sharing a meme and using a text overlay that read, “When your old self slowly starts coming out of postpartum. It appears she shared the post from a page called “Moms with Plans.” She then added a caption at the bottom that said, “Factual. Little by little. lol”

For context, the meme itself depicts people at a gathering who don't appear fully at ease, but they're working through whatever is holding them back from being their true selves. Specifically, the person at the center of the meme does a little dance but seems a bit self-conscious. 

As mentioned, the past couple of years have been hectic for Ventura and her family. Still, she was able to share the positive news of being pregnant on February 19. She announced it via Instagram with a post that contained five images. 

A post shared by Casandra Fine (@cassie)

The first was of her and their two children. Next, Ventura included an image of herself with Fine's hands on her baby bump. Other photos in the post showed the four of them all together, with both daughters wearing aforale dresses. 

Ventura captioned the post by using an emoji of a woman who happened to be expecting, a blue heart, and the number 3. To date, more than 1.1 million people have liked the post, and there are almost 18,000 comments. This demonstrates exactly how many people were rooting for her happiness. 

Following the initial pregnancy announcement, Ventura shared sporadic updates to social media. She posted images of a date night she had with Fine in March, where they went to the “Mob Land” premiere.

In April, Ventura posted multiple images of herself wearing a black dress. She captioned the post, “Mastering Peace.”

Hulk Hogan's funeral was held on Tuesday, August 5. It was attended by 800 to 1000 guests, Us Weekly reports. The guests included his beautiful family: his ex-wife, Linda Hogan, his son, Nick Hogan, and his wife, Sky Daily.

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Daily shared her thoughts on the day when she posted a heartfelt post on Instagram on August 6. The video is a montage of Hogan's life, featuring photos of his family and celebrating his wrestling success. It offers a beautiful glimpse into who he was.

In the caption, Daily reflected on the funeral and the impact it had on her. “Yesterday's celebration of life was one of the most beautiful and moving days I have ever experienced. In the same church where we were married and baptized together, we gathered with family, friends, and loved ones to honor a life that touched millions,” she wrote. She is referring to the Indian Rocks Church in Largo, Florida. 

She continued, “The church was filled with stories… Some that brought tears, others that made us laugh through those tears… and with every memory shared, you could feel the love that surrounded him.”

A post shared by Brooke Oleksy (@mizzhogan)

Daily also commented on Hogan's wishes for his funeral and the burial process, specifically how he wished to be cremated. “Terry chose cremation knowing this physical life is temporary and his heavenly body eternal,” Daily wrote. “He has not yet been cremated, as our family is making sure every question about his medical care is answered first. Once we have that peace of mind, we will honor his wish and fulfill it with love and respect.”

She continued, “The pastor of our church prepared this moving video for the service that reflects his unwavering Christian faith. A faith that anchored him and brought him peace every day.” 

Daily also used the post as an opportunity to dispel misinformation about Hogan. She stated that there are “heartbreakingly misleading media stories,” and urged fans to be patient. She ended her message with a powerful statement, writing, “He was deeply loved, well cared for, and surrounded by that love until his very last moment.”

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Hogan's funeral was a celebration of his life and was attended by many guests, although his daughter Brooke Hogan did not participate. Instead, she chose to have a private celebration for her father on the beach. She revealed why she did this in an Instagram post on August 6. In the post, she informed fans that Hogan did not want a funeral.

“My father hated the morbidity of funerals. He didn't want one,” she wrote. “And although I know people grieve in many ways – and I'm so grateful for all celebrations and events organized to honor him, as his daughter, I had to make my own decision to honor him the best and most genuine way I knew how. Privately…the way that made me feel the closest to him.”

Hogan's funeral program, obtained by Us Weekly, honored him as both a WWE legend and a family man. “As a devoted family man, Terry cherished time with his loved ones,” the program read, Us Weekly reports. “He was a proud father of Brooke and Nick, a stepfather to Maddox, Hayden and Leighton, and embraced his role as a loving husband to Sky. Your spirit will forever be part of the wrestling world and your legacy of love, faith, and family will live on in the hearts of fans around the world.”

Hulk Hogan's funeral was held on Tuesday, August 5. He died on July 24 from a sudden cardiac arrest while at home in Clearwater, Florida. He was 71.

A post shared by Hulk Hogan (@hulkhogan)

Mourners paid their respects and celebrated the life of Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea, when they gathered at Indian Rocks Church in Largo, Florida. This is the same church where he was baptized in 2023, FOX News reports. Among the attendees were Paul “Triple H” Levesque, Stephanie McMahon, Dennis Rodman, Kid Rock, and Bam Margera.

It was Hogan's family who sat in the front row, and Us Weekly reports that Hulk's ex-wife, Linda Hogan, was in attendance. She was joined by her son, Nick Hogan, and the WWE wrestler's third and current wife, Sky Daily. Hulk's daughter, Brooke Hogan, was noticeably absent from his funeral. However, an insider said that nothing was said about her absence, Us Weekly reports.

So what was said about Hulk? Us Weekly obtained his funeral program, and it gives a better glimpse into the day. “As a devoted family man, Terry cherished time with his loved ones,” the program read, Us Weekly reports. “He was a proud father of Brooke and Nick, a stepfather to Maddox, Hayden, and Leighton, and embraced his role as a loving husband to Sky.”

It continued, “Your spirit will forever be part of the wrestling world, and your legacy of love, faith, and family will live on in the hearts of fans around the world.”

The program also featured photos of Hulk and his loved ones.

A post shared by Sky Daily Hogan (@mrs.sky.hogan)

Between 800 and 1000 guests attended the funeral. Nick gave a speech in honor of his dad, “calling Hogan a great dad and his hero,” Us Weekly reports.

Following the funeral service, attendees made their way to Hogan's Hangout, a restaurant in Clearwater that Hogan owned, FOX News reports. Sky and Nick were both there. The reception was also attended by other close family members, who celebrated Hulk's life while “memorial videos and montages played,” Us Weekly reports.

A post shared by Brooke Oleksy (@mizzhogan)

Brooke may not have been present at the funeral, but she did honour her father in her way. In an Instagram post on August 6, she shared how and why she chose to pay her respects to her father separately.

“My father hated the morbidity of funerals. He didn't want one,” she wrote. “And although I know people grieve in many ways – and I'm so grateful for all celebrations and events organized to honor him, as his daughter, I had to make my own decision to honor him the best and most genuine way I knew how…privately…the way that made me feel the closest to him. The only thing missing today was him in is pop up lawn chair watching the waves… and the sunset.”

She continued, “Daddy, we honored you in the simplest way that agreed with my soul. We took our babies to the beach, and put them in the same salty waters you loved. Molly loved the water. I think she'll be a ‘little fish' as you called me. We love you and honor the things that made you so special. Every grain of sand and every wave reminded me of being your beach baby, and brought us closer to you. I pray you are at peace and know how dearly I love you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kelly Clarkson Reveals Song Inspired by Brandon Blackstock","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/kelly-clarkson-song-brandon-blackstock/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:52:36 GMT","

Kelly Clarkson had a famously tumultuous relationship and difficult divorce from her now late ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.

But before things got tough, the “American Idol” was so happy in her relationship with Blackstock that it inspired a hit song.

In a 2012 interview with ABC News Radio, Kelly revealed that her blossoming romance with Blackstock was her inspiration to record “Don't Rush.” 

The hit song featured Vince Gill on backing vocals. In fact, the pair performed it on stage at the 2012 CMA Awards.

“I'm in a relationship and super happy,” Kelly told ABC News Radio, “and I don't think I would have been able to sing this song eight months ago.”

Kelly gushed, “Love should be celebrated, and this is a great description of where I'm at in my life. This is a couple's skate, not an all-skate song.”

“Don't Rush” turned out to be a hit for Kelly on the country charts, and even earned her a Grammy nod for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards.

The lyrics talk about making your own rules, with the chorus reading, 

“Stopping every minute just because you're in itWishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to meIt's how it's supposed to beHanging on every touchBaby don't rush, no noBaby don't rush”

Kelly Clarkson first met Brandon Blackstock in 2006 at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards.

At the time, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth.

Nevertheless, Kelly knew they had a future together.

She told People in 2013, “I've only had three other boyfriends that I dated, and not really seriously. This guy walks by, making everybody laugh. I said, ‘I'm gonna end up with him. I know it.' “

Brandon and Kelly reconnected at the Super Bowl in 2012, when Brandon was going through a divorce.

But the relationship got off to an inauspicious start. 

Kelly told People that the pair's first date was on the day one of her musical idols unexpectedly passed away.

 “This is the funniest, worst thing ever. One of my superhero idols is Whitney Houston, and the day she died was our first date,” Kelly said of she and Brandon's first date on February 11, 2012. 

Interestingly, Kelly said, “I was like, ‘This is a bad omen.'”

Kelly Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock got engaged after ten months of dating, and married in October 2013.

They welcomed daughter, River Rose, in June 2014. In April 2016, they welcomed a second child, son, Remington Alexander.

Kelly filed for divorce in 2020 and it was finalized two years later.

Warner Bros. has kept “Weapons,” its new original horror movie from “Barbarian” director Zach Cregger, close to the chest when it came to providing early looks to the majority of the entertainment press. Still, IndieWire's “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio did finally get a chance to see the movie earlier this week, which is about 17 schoolchildren from the same class who go missing in the dead of night in a small town, leaving just one classmate behind. 

And, lo and behold, it's a brilliantly entertaining and twisty movie that Warner Bros. ought to want more critics and press to see.

 










The cast is terrific — Julia Garner as an alcoholic teacher bucking under mental torture by her students' parents, Alden Ehrenreich as a mustachied cop, Josh Brolin as a brawny grieving dad, and Austin Abrams as a twitchy druggie who may have stumbled on the key to the mystery. Cregger's direction and work with cinematographer Larkin Seiple are fluid, propulsive, and accomplished even despite juggling a sizable ensemble of cracked characters.

It's projected to open north of $25 million this weekend, up against “Freakier Friday” in the battle for #1. That Disney sequel — reportedly originally meant for streaming only until fan reaction compelled the studio to opt for theaters — is a movie Anne Thompson is less fond of. (Ryan missed it.)

On this week's episode, we also take a close look at which movies aren't playing the fall festivals, and why: Whither “Die My Love,” possibly back in the edit after mixed reviews out of Cannes? Searchlight's “The Roses” and Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” (also at Warner Bros.) look to be commercial plays, along with Darren Aronofsky's “Caught Stealing” at Sony. All bowed out of the fall festival circuit.

Elsewhere on this week's installment, we also review new TV, including “Wednesday” and “Alien: Earth,” and pitch our dream Bond for the just-announced writer, Steven Knight, who will pen the next 007 movie for director Denis Villeneuve at Amazon/MGM Studios. Knight and Villeneuve share a penchant for antiheroes — and that's who the original messy, toxic, twisted Bond was, anyway, right? Well, before Daniel Craig — and we think they'd share a unique alchemy in carrying the Bond torch.

When you hear the words “iconic movie,” the usual suspects tend come to mind: “Citizen Kane,” “Raging Bull,” “The Godfather: Part II.” And now, “Freakier Friday.”

This is not an exaggeration: Kate Erbland's IndieWire review even gave a nod to the enduring fandom of the beloved original 2003 film “Freaky Friday,” with Erbland writing, “If you're of the mind that Jamie Lee Curtis should have won her first Oscar for her work in Mark Waters' film. … ‘Freakier Friday' is very much for you. Simply put: Here is a legacyquel worth the wait. What a concept!”

 










And what a concept indeed. How does anyone revisit an iconic classic film — and even arguably make it even better? In-demand screenwriter Jordan Weiss knew exactly how, and even helped land a theatrical release for the sequel that was long rumored to be for streaming only. (A representative for Disney did not confirm or deny original release plans for the film.)

“I'm so glad that it's going to be released in theaters,” Weiss told IndieWire during a recent interview. “I feel like these big, fun event films that are especially more traditionally girly or geared towards women [should be in theaters].”

 










Whereas Universal arguably dropped the ball by foregoing a U.S. theatrical premiere for “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” and releasing it solely on Peacock, Disney listened to the overwhelming social media excitement for a beloved franchise when “Freakier Friday” was finally confirmed.

Elyse Hollander, the screenwriter who was first announced as attached to the project in 2023 (Hollander has a co-story-by credit on the sequel, with Weiss as the sole writer), told IndieWire that the film was originally not going to be in theaters.

“I was definitely told in the early days that this is for streaming,” Hollander said. “I think when it was announced, they [Disney executives] were pleasantly surprised by the excitement around it, and it kind of moved it up a tier of like, ‘OK, this can actually become an event and something really special.'”

Of course, the return of original stars Curtis — who championed the sequel for years — and Lindsay Lohan, along with fellow returning faces Chad Michael Murray and Mark Harmon, only added to the fan excitement…and, in turn, the pressure that the “Freakier Friday” team felt when working on the feature.

“It's a big risk for everybody involved to come back. You don't want to ruin the legacy, you want add to it,” Hollander said. “I was like, ‘I cannot be responsible for ruining a beloved film and adding to a cash grab, schlock pile that would be once direct to DVD.'” 

 










Weiss, who boarded the legacy sequel in 2024 when her “Dollface” collaborator Nisha Ganatra joined as director, credited the shared love for the 2003 “Freaky Friday” among both creatives and executives alike. “I remember seeing ‘Freaky Friday' in theaters with my mom when I was 10 years old,” Weiss said. “I feel like I was the center of the target audience. I was a huge Lindsay Lohan fan. It was absolutely one of my favorite movies. So when when Disney called with the opportunity to come in and work on it, it was an easy, excited yes.”

According to Weiss, there were certain “non-negotiables” for “Freakier Friday” that Disney spearheaded, such as the inclusion of rock band Pink Slip and the core cast back in lead roles. Kristin Burr and Andrew Gunn, both producers on the 2003 film, also returned for the sequel. Weiss further credited Disney SVP of development Allison Erlikhman for being integral to maintaining the “Freaky Friday” legacy.

“It was a combination of legacy producers and millennial executives and a millennial screenwriter, who were all like, ‘We either love this movie because we worked on it' or ‘We were children when it came out and are obsessed with every part of it,'” Weiss said. “I think [Allison] being of this generation and having that close tie made her such an asset as a studio executive working on this.” (For all other millennials, Erman is also working on “Princess Diaries 3.”)

 










The financial return of releasing “Freakier Friday” theatrically remains to be seen, but as Gen-Zers would say, millennial women are already seated. That buying power of thirtysomething women has yet to be fully realized (or at least embraced) by Hollywood, as Weiss explained. Having a female-oriented, nostalgia-driven film in theaters has historically paid off, especially in recent years.

“We saw it with ‘Barbie,' we saw it with ‘Wicked.' I think having that in the same way, with how every summer there is a really exciting MCU or DC release, would make sense with these big, female-driven franchises,” Weiss said. “They are finally being given their day in theaters in that big summer blockbuster way. It just makes me so excited as a girl who loves girly pop movies.”

Hollander added, “I think what's really happening in the zeitgeist is people are actually recognizing that female-leaning IP after ‘Barbie' actually has a place in the marketplace. We've done ‘Transformers,' we've done ‘GI Joe,' we've done ‘Sonic' and all the comic book movies. So now, what does that gaze look like for us [women]?”

It was actually actress/producer Curtis who had the honor of announcing to fans everywhere that “Freakier Friday” would (thankfully) be in theaters. The Academy Award winner wrote in 2024 teasing the release, “Yes, you heard me…The theaters. The place we all go and enjoy a shared experience in the dark while munching popcorn and candy and laughing together and sometimes crying together. Until then.”

 










And as for the criticisms that “everything is a remake” nowadays, let's be real: That's not new, either. “Freaky Friday” itself was first a 1976 film based on the book by Mary Rodgers. It later became a 1995 TV movie before being once again adapted into the 2003 film that now spurred the sequel “Freakier Friday.” 

However, the “Transformers”-esque franchises aren't complained about online the same way, if at all. “If people want to judge female franchises with a harder lens, that's nothing new either,” Hollander said. “As women, we're always held to a higher standard, so we'll rise to the occasion.”

It works so well with Weiss' “Freakier Friday” that a third film could even be on the horizon. “Any version of a movie that has complicated female dynamics in a fun, silly joyous way that also has magical realism devices, I'm like, ‘Sign me up.' So if that means ‘Freakiest Friday,' yeah, OK,” Weiss said.

Prepare for more possible flack from online trolls, though. Yet Weiss is unfazed. “The thing that is funny to me is that there's a lot of conversation now of like, ‘Oh my God, everything's a reboot, everything's a sequel. I miss the '90s and early 2000s when everything was original,' and I'm like, ‘Those were also all remakes,'” she said. “There are probably so many movies that people don't realize were actually movies from the '30s or '40s. I'm like, ‘Hollywood's built on it.' Maybe we're always re-innovating, but I have embraced it. I think that all of these stories are original, and you still are creating something new. We all start with a blank page.”

 










A Walt Disney Pictures release, “Freakier Friday” is now in theaters.

In his memoir, The Chiffon Trenches, former Vogue editor-at-large André Leon Talley tells a story about Naomi Campbell. “[She] called me, from some foreign city,” he writes, “on one of 10 ubiquitous cell phones she keeps in a Hefty zip-lock bag (a cell phone for each country is thrown in her carry-on, as well as a fresh bottle of Tabasco sauce).” This, to me, is the pinnacle of glamor: when the hustle, the grind, that births an icon becomes part of her legend.

Amaarae wants you to see her sweat. On her pan-Atlantic 2020 debut, The Angel You Don't Know, the Accra, Atlanta, and New Jersey-raised singer twerked in the mirror and fantasized about buying her mom a Bentley. Fountain Baby took things global, blowing up her sound so that it might encompass a Japanese koto on one track and a sample of Clipse's “Wamp Wamp (What It Do)” the next. “Angels in Tibet” had Amaarae eyeing up a girl at the club, trying to distinguish diamonds from droplets; now, she's at the center of the rave, strobe-sliced into slow motion, stress-testing her body and flows against abrasive Eurodance and catwalk techno. Black Star is the record you make when you can finally afford the best drugs and the suite with a view, lavish them on a lover (or several), and begin to ask yourself: Is this all there is?

Following the release of Fountain Baby, Amaarae visited the nightlife scenes of Miami, Los Angeles, and São Paulo, studied up on Chicago house and Detroit ghettotech, and dove deeper into Ghana's regional microgenres. Unbeholden to any one place, Black Star carves out its own sovereign territory on the dancefloor; call it “CzechSlovakAtlanta,” as declared by Bree Runway amid the laser-pistol crossfire of “Starkilla.” Amaarae's ambition—a survey of the Black diaspora that uniformly bangs—aligns with and maybe even surpasses that of Beyoncé's Renaissance, but her approach is far less didactic. Laid out over Jersey club-meets-highlife single “Girlie-Pop!,” “switching genres till we make it pop” is the album's only credo.

To that end, Black Star is almost radically populist. DJ Starkillers, a staple of the circuit-party scene, and Charlie Wilson, who fronted R&B radio standbys the Gap Band for decades, number among the guests. “Fineshyt,” the skeletal echo of a peak-era Pitbull song, cribs from Nightcrawlers' “Push the Feeling On (The Dub of Doom)” and Swedish House Mafia. “She's my new sexy machine/My sexy sex machine,” Amaarae croons, making a strong claim to the Ms. Worldwide title. To obtain the finest hooks, she knows, requires a bit of grand larceny. PinkPantheress duet “Kiss Me Thru the Phone pt 2” samples “The Thong Song,” positioning itself as a spiritual sequel to Soulja Boy's ever more prescient OG; “Starkilla” interpolates Kelis' “Milkshake”; and on the El Guincho coproduction “She Is My Drug,” Amaarae ponders her faith in “love off the drugs”—to the tune of Cher's “Believe.”

For every rave-up on Black Star—soaked in codeine and dark liquor, powder-dusted in ketamine, valium, and coke—a comedown. While “She Is My Drug” circles the drain, the mesmeric, mesopelagic deep house of “B2B” abruptly dissolves into feathery Spanish guitar and vaporous strings. Next to Fountain Baby's splashy bombast, Amaarae's embrace of tension and restraint is both audacious and inspired. Even the breakdowns on “Stuck Up,” “Kiss Me Thru the Phone,” and “100DRUM” can't seem to break the tolerance threshold, fleeting highs to keep you upright until the next bump. These tracks yearn for 10-minute Richard X trance remixes, but ecstasy remains out of reach. The molly will just have to do.

Pursued by hangovers and hangers-on, Amaarae has never sounded quite so guarded. “This bitch likes me/And I like this bitch for now,” she jeers on album opener “Stuck Up,” an armored Escalade of Brazilian funk and trance synths. Only as the orchestral, drumless “Dream Scenario” swerves through the city on the way to a late-night rendezvous does Black Star's sleek, lacquered surface begin to crack, revealing a glimpse of the fleshy thing at its center. Amaarae can't help cutting her sincerity with a bar like “My bitch style like Edna Mode/Can't put on no cape for her,” but then Charlie Wilson shows up, his buttery vocal runs like the first rays of sun beaming down on the rooftop afters.

It doesn't take long for the paranoia to close back in. Black Star might be for Amaarae what Dirty Sprite 2 was for Future: a nihilistic, leaned-out, luxuriously appointed birdcage. All windows, no doors. Authenticity in the pop-industrial complex is a complex question, and Afrobeats still runs on the braintrust structure—crack teams of career songwriters and producers cranking out hits. Amaarae, though, is an auteur; we see her the way she wants us to. In the video for Black Star's hot and heavy lead single “S.M.O.,” which draws on Ghanaian kpanlogo and zouk rhythms, she polishes Iveth Stunner's voluptuous ass, paying homage to an infamous 2005 Steven Klein photoshoot starring Tom Ford. She's the model pumping the runway, and the designer in the front row, and the music blasting over the speakers. We're in CzechSlovakAtlanta now, baby, and Amaarae's a superstar.

It's been a little while since Zach Bryan made a real rocker, something like “Overtime” or “Revival” that'll make you want to raise a fist and scream along. He hit some climaxes on The Great American Bar Scene—the peaks of “Pink Skies” and “Oak Island,” and later with the emphatic charms of “Blue Jean Baby” and “Boys of Faith”—but the Oklahoman has been more ruminative in recent years, ever-growing as a songwriter who can spin a soft melody with careful attention to detail. So he's teamed up with one of his all-time favorite bands, Kings of Leon, to rev up the engines.

“Bowery” is a great marriage of Bryan's gruff passion and Kings of Leon's reckless abandon. It has the feel of a one-take jam: The Followill boys waste no time launching into the song's loudest and best parts as Bryan sings of familiar themes—taking in a show in downtown New York, stuck on a woman as the alcohol takes hold. On the triumphant chorus, Bryan goes hush and lets Caleb Followill's uniquely tender tenor take the lead: “But when the time's right/I'm a hell of a good night/I'll make you burn bright/As the heat of the day.” It's an overdue barn-burner from Zach Bryan, someone who's excellent at conjuring big feelings even when he might rather bottle them up.

Songwriting, painting, poetry—while pursuing so many creative endeavors at once, Alexandra Levy has come to value the act of artmaking above all. “I think failure comes from being too fixated on the finished product,” the Montreal-based artist once said in an interview, “and so creative success must be [in] the focus on the process.” This attitude glows warmly at the heart of when i paint my masterpiece, her third album as Ada Lea: a collection of breezy, folk-indebted songs that marvel at everyday realities and find joy in humility.

Levy made when i paint my masterpiece in a period of respite after writing, recording, and touring her records left her exhausted. She took a break from music and went back to school to study painting and poetry, and started teaching, too. The new album feels lighter on its feet; many songs seem to float by, light sketches undergirded by minimal instrumentation. On “midnight magic,” Levy sings in close-tracked harmonies as plodding piano chords amble beneath her; at just under two minutes, “it isn't enough” forgoes a formal verse-chorus structure, instead offering a slow-burning melody over a simple brush of guitar and percussion.

The mood is altogether more even-keeled than the dazed, jittery energy of her previous full-lengths. Where 2021's one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden traded in stories about the uncertainty of young love and the disorientation of heartbreak, when i paint my masterpiece ponders existential questions of community, observation, and purpose. “You give and you take/You try and you fail/You live and you love,” she sings on “it isn't enough.” “It is what it is,” she acknowledges on “just like in the museum,” before declaring, “We laugh when it's good/And cry when it's not.” But when backed by such light-touch production, these mantras can feel like a first draft whose final hues haven't been colored in.

At its best, though, this unforced approach manifests in Levy's gift for stream-of-consciousness narratives that spin out as if propelled by their own internal velocity. “baby blue frigidaire mini fridge” begins by naming the title object and cataloging a few other curiosities before zooming ever-outwards—the cold air, a window, a mountain view, a lost love—its perspective eventually becoming as wide and ancient as “our old time souls/This old-time moon.” “snowglobe” paints a convivial party scene, describing what everyone's wearing, bringing, hearing before Levy yelps, “Look at us/Sitting 'round the kitchen table/Thinking that/We are made of something special,” her tone both wry and loving.

Much of the record was recorded in a single room with a small band, live and loose in rural Ontario. That intimacy translates into some transcendent moments, as when a gently distorted guitar riff wonderfully steals the spotlight partway through “something in the wind,” or in the masterful control of tension on “down under the van horne overpass.” Levy can be quite funny, too—as on “bob dylan's 115th haircut,” an artistic hype-up where she reminds herself that she's capable of things even the famed voice of a generation isn't. “Bob Dylan wouldn't have thought of this song,” she muses dryly, “A couple reasons: He wasn't here, for one.” Artistic success, Levy implies, isn't a matter of comparison but of honoring your individual circumstances. Each time you commit to the creative process, you may as well be painting your masterpiece.

On their fifth album, Mal Blum reimagines the role of the villain for bad boys everywhere. Villainy here is personal—Blum made the record, appropriately called The Villain, about the unique exhaustion of being cast as the antagonist in a trans-for-trans breakup; it's also political, in a society that vilifies gender non-conformity. Here, Blum explores the friction of binary victim-villain thinking, challenging dehumanizing stereotypes with relatable nuance: “I was too willing/To make you the villain…Does it make me the villain?” they sing on the title track. But Blum's villainy is mosaic, inviting listeners to question their complicity in searching for the “bad guy” in their own lives and rhetoric, too.

Gone is the jokey dysphoric flair of their earlier work, replaced here by a hard-won confidence in a newly-settled post-testosterone tenor range. They use that assured delivery to challenge assumptions and expectations around masculinity. On “Killer,” Blum confronts our anxieties about transmasculinity and tackles internalized transphobia: “Baby, I'm all wrong,” they confess. Then, they slyly reveal the absurdity of stereotypes that link trans men to violence, wondering if they're an “unceremonious murderer” for having “killed the flies on the front porch/Poured their corpses down the drain.” On “Cool Guy,” Blum playfully subverts a cocky persona, bragging, “Everywhere I go, I am somebody,” before admitting, “I've got nobody.”

Blum exposes the hollowness of a certain kind of masculine performance, reframing macho posturing as a defense against loneliness and asking us to consider how men are conditioned to hide their need for connection behind a smirk. “I don't know him that well, he was always cool to me,” they sing on one track; “I don't wanna talk about/Anything I'm thinking,” on another. Blum underscores a particular trap queer men and transmasculine people face: having to emulate the confidence, composure, and dominance of traditional masculinity while simultaneously policing themselves against its toxicity. Satire is an appropriate response to such a taxing demand.

Production by Summer Cannibals' Jessica Boudreaux gives The Villain a polished complexity and focus not heard on Blum's earlier albums. On tracks like “Truth Is out There” and “Killer,” guitarist Audrey Zee Whitesides offers a defiant counterpoint to Blum's despair with vibrant, cutting playing. On pop-punk power-couple breakup cut “I'm so Bored,” drummer Ricardo Lagomasino's jazz-honed precision and keen sense of pocket lay the foundation for Blum's searing roasts (“You don't have friends/You have meetings”). Together, these elements create a tight, frisky sound that amplifies Blum's critiques.

“Gabriel,” by contrast, rests on bare acoustic guitar and soft synth, a fragile sonic and emotional space from which to eavesdrop on a private postmortem of closing arguments between two grieving lovers. A generous direct address to their ex, “Gabriel” is also The Villain's only song to highlight a major voice crack, a compelling aesthetic choice in a song about love between two transsexual people. By including this “flaw,” Blum resists the stereotype that men must always act and sound steady—a radical, masculine act of vulnerability.

Some tracks suffer from unwieldy rhyme schemes and clunky patter, as when Blum stretches syllables awkwardly on words like “in-ter-med-iar-ies” and “in-for-ma-tion,” disrupting the album's otherwise straightforward flow. Closing track “Husbands and Other Strangers,” meanwhile, loses steam and introduces too many new metaphors for a coda, though gentle piano by Erik Carlson and poetic spoken snippets from Blum's neighbor weave in a reflective gravitas.

On The Villain, Blum is breaking up not only with their ex, but also with a transphobic society and its outdated ideas of gender, power, and proper conduct. A breakup of this magnitude evokes a range of feelings historically associated with destructive “masculine” behaviors— isolation, boredom, blame—and Blum takes The Villain's 11 tracks to give them their due. Rather than live in fear of slipping into toxic masculine traits, Blum uses these songs to both embody and satirize them—pushing back against the black-and-white thinking that saturates our culture and designing a thoughtful, curious record that leaves room for sacred rage.

The initial lineup has been announced for the Together for Palestine benefit concert at London's Wembley Arena on September 17. Executive produced by Brian Eno, who announced it last week, the concert will feature performances from Damon Albarn, Jamie xx, King Krule, Sampha, PinkPantheress, James Blake, Hot Chip, Obongjayar, and more. The shows will include collaborations and performances of new material created for the event, according to a press release.

Completing the initial wave of artists are Greentea Peng, Mabel, Bastille, Abnan Joubran, Paloma Faith, Furaj Suleiman, Nai Barghouti, and Rachel Chinouriri. The announcement also lists “appearances,” described as “one-off contributions,” from PinkPantheress, Rina Sawayama, Riz Ahmed, and more to be announced. The entire ticket listed ticket price is being donated to Palestinian aid groups via Choose Love, a UK charity supporting local humanitarians in conflict zones. Tickets are on sale now.

Es Devlin, who is leading production design, said in the press release, “Palestinian painters are producing some of the most powerful, beautiful and resonant works I have witnessed. I feel honoured to collaborate with Malak Mattar and a group of seminal Palestinian visual artists on a stage that will express the rich beauty of Palestinian culture.”

Eno, who is organizing the event alongside Khaled Ziada, Khalid Abdalla, and Tracey Seaward, added, “In the face of the horrors of Gaza silence becomes complicity. Artists have always helped societies to point out injustice and imagine better futures. That's why this concert matters. It's time for us to come together—not just to raise our voices, but to reaffirm our shared humanity.”

And Albarn said: “I, like everyone with a heart, have felt despair and helplessness at the reports coming out of Gaza and the West Bank over these last days, months, and years. A genocide unfolding in real time on our screens. I come from a family of pacifists. I have been taught, and I believe, that pacifism is an action. Peace is an action. To live peacefully requires vision and commitment. To act with humanity towards one another, that too is a decision. Music has taken me around the world, it is the sum of everything I know and trust and believe in—respect, collaboration, shared experience. I am grateful for this opportunity to act in solidarity with the Palestinian people and also celebrate the music and culture from the region. I hope everyone will join us.”

	Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros frontman Alex Ebert has come to the defense of the band's hit “Home” after social media discourse dubbed the 2009 single the “worst song ever made.”


	Over the past week, a decade-old video of the band's Tiny Desk performance of “Home” has been unavoidable on Twitter, with users both mocking the performance and blaming Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros for the “stomp clap” subgenre of bands that followed in their wake.

Worst song ever made https://t.co/CJRrvp3C4r pic.twitter.com/BS4wHAqrLK


	After a few (90 million!) views, the chatter got loud enough for Ebert himself to address the situation, as well as defend “Home” as “apparently a good song.” “It's a question I've asked myself plenty — is home a good song?” Ebert wrote on Instagram. 

A post shared by Alexander Ebert (@alex_ebert)


	“Something I forgot to mention is I recently was asked by my 90-year-old father to play home at his birthday. He was begging as if his life depended on it so I had to oblige. There was a piano in the restaurant, so I just played it like that, whole chords, just me at the piano in a restaurant at noon. I'll try and find a recording of it, but it turned into just about my favorite version of the song. In fact, I keep thinking maybe I should release a version of it. Anyway, that's when I made up my mind that Home, the bones of it at least, are great. It's a good song.”

	











	Ebert also posted a video sharing his thoughts on “Home,” as well as taking credit for the flood of “stomp clap”-sounding acts that arose after the song became a hit. “By the way, we were the first to do the stomp and clap fuckin' folk pop thing to the point where the Lumineers, they sought out one of our co-producers — he wasn't actually our co-producer — and were like, ‘Hey, do that Edward Sharpe thing for us,'” Ebert claimed.

	“For real, that's a real story. Of Monsters & Men, they got our album before they ever made an album because our agent was their manager, and she showed it to them, and they basically got so close to ‘Home' that we almost sued them. They were doing Apple commercials, and I was getting calls saying, ‘Congratulations.' That's how closely people started doing this.”


	As for the “worst song” debate, Ebert said definitively, “‘Home' is apparently a good song.”

	Last month, Republicans passed a reconciliation bill that is expected to kick millions of Americans off of Medicaid and other forms of health insurance. The legislation includes over $800 million in cuts to Medicaid spending over the next 10 years, the largest in the program's history. Now, as Republicans gear up for next year's midterm elections, vulnerable lawmakers who supported the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” are attempting to recast themselves as protectors of the health care program they sent to the wood chipper. 


	Last week, Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Tom Kean Jr. (R-N.J.), and Gabe Evans (R-Colo.) introduced a resolution purporting to recognize the 60th anniversary of Medicaid's establishment as well as “Congress' commitment to preserve and strengthen the program for the nation's most vulnerable populations.” 


	All three of them voted to kick people off of the program in order to pay for President Donald Trump's tax boons to billionaires and big business — which is already paying dividends for corporate America.

	All three House members are also currently at risk of losing their seats in next year's elections. According to a June analysis from the Cook Political Report, Miller-Meeks and Evans districts are both rated as Republican toss-ups, while Kean Jr.'s leans Republican. Last month, the National Journal's Hotline Power Rankings rated Evans the second-most vulnerable member of the House GOP in the country.  

	











	The three representatives wrote that “this resolution celebrates the creation of Medicaid as a vital safety net to provide health care to low-income Americans who need it most: pregnant women, children, seniors, and those with disabilities. The resolution calls for Congress's continued support in eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse to preserve this critical program for today's recipients and future generations.” 


	Rep. Miller-Meeks, who represents Iowa's 1st District, wrote in a statement that “as a physician,” she knows “how critical Medicaid is for women, children, veterans, and disabled Americans.” In Miller-Meeks' district, 13,000 Medicaid recipients are expected to lose their health care coverage. The cuts are also likely to endanger major medical centers and rural hospitals, often the only connection rural Americans have to the health care system.

	Ahead of the bill's passage, Miller-Meeks was repeatedly confronted by constituents and protesters who urged her to oppose the legislation. She even signed a letter opposing more aggressive cuts in the Senate and decrying that the upper chamber's addition to the bill could “place additional burdens on hospitals already stretched thin by legal and moral obligations to provide care” — despite having already approved almost $1 trillion in cuts with her own vote. 


	In Colorado, where nearly 30 percent of the population receives health care coverage through Medicaid, Rep. Evans voted in favor of the cuts despite widespread opposition from his own constituents — 19,000 of whom may lose their Medicaid coverage. In May, as the bill was being crafted in the House, Evans all but stood on a soapbox in front of the Colorado Capitol and declared that he was “proud to support the one Big Beautiful Bill.” He was met with an ongoing chorus of jeers and boos from protesters bringing attention to the proposed Medicaid cuts. 


	Evans, like many of his GOP colleagues, claimed that the cuts were actually an effort to counter rampant fraud and waste by undeserving recipients of the program — a claim that is contradicted by actual health systems experts. 


	In response to a request for comment, Evans' office directed from Rolling Stone to a press release about the resolution in which he stated that “It is paramount that Congress preserve access to this program for those who need it the most by ensuring that states and the federal government implement commonsense policies to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the system.”

	Similarly, Rep. Kean Jr. defended his vote to Rolling Stone in a statement in which he claimed that he “voted to safeguard Medicaid for every intended beneficiary in the Garden State and nationwide. By rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse we are preserving this vital program for today's recipients and future generations.” 


	In Kean Jr.'s district, at least 6,000 individuals are expected to lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the legislation, and over 450,000 individuals are at risk throughout the state. 


	Kean Jr.'s voters are not happy with him, either. A poll released last month by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that even State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions included in the legislation — which Kean Jr., highlighted as an accomplishment in his statement to Rolling Stone, have not managed to eliminate the local backlash to Medicaid cuts. “Overall, 27 percent of likely voters in the state say that they approve of the budget bill,” the survey found. 


	Kean Jr. was also among the slate of Republicans who — likely on the advice of House leadership and national Republicans — avoided holding in-person town halls to meet with their constituents.

	At the end of the day, the three representatives threw their full support behind the most ruthless gutting of a public health care program in the nation's history, and now — through performative resolutions — are attempting to reframe their actions as a heroic defense of the program they sought to kneecap. 


	A joint resolution celebrating 60 years of Medicaid might play well for a few press releases, but it won't provide health care coverage for the almost 40,000 Americans who stand to lose access to the program between their three districts.

	Since the release of his superb new album American Romance, Lukas Nelson has been fully in solo career mode, promoting the record with a headlining tour.


	But one consequence of a solo tour is the fact that it often separates him from his father, Willie Nelson. Nelson has been an integral part of Willie's Family Band, along with his brother Micah and longtime members like harmonica player Mickey Raphael and percussionist Billy English, and it was that time growing up on the road that informs American Romance.


	As his dad continues to tour at 92, Nelson can't help but want to join him.

A post shared by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone)


	“Every second of every day I am trying to be with my father. But he of all people understands the importance of striking while the iron's hot,” Nelson told Rolling Stone during an appearance on the Nashville Now podcast. “I've always wanted to make him proud by being a hard worker, being self-sufficient, and never needing to ask him for anything. It takes me away from my dad sometimes, but I know that he knows why, because he had to do the same thing when he was young.”When the Nelsons do gather together — be it at Willie's ranch in Texas or his home in Hawaii — they spend the time immersed in simple activities. Unsurprisingly, many of them are music-based. “When I'm home I'll go see him every day. We'll sit and pick, we'll sit and talk,” the younger Nelson said. “We'll sit and listen to music, and listen to Django [Reinhardt] and Merle [Haggard] and Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams…and play dominos and spend good time. That's what it all about.”

	It's unlikely that father and son bond over pot though. Lukas gave it up a few years ago, along with alcohol. Like with his solo career, he said Willie understood. “My dad respects individuality. He respect being yourself. He and I both now don't smoke weed. I don't think it mattered to him either way,” he said. “When I was smoking I'd smoke six, seven joints a day. I was so into weed.”

	You may have already felt the vibe shift this festival season towards something new: moderation. It seems like the long-standing grip that tall boys and water-y cocktails in plastic cups have had on outdoor events is finally loosening as the sober-curious movement gains momentum. Whether that's a result of a post-pandemic focus on mental health and self-care, or just that Gen Z is the “lamer” generation (mostly according to Millennials on TikTok) has yet to be seen, but clearly there's a desire there to celebrate without compromise. 


	Arguably the stigma for sober partying, or sipping on a non-alc beverage, has all but disappeared in the past few years — a 2023 Gallup survey found that alcohol consumption among U.S. adults under 35 has declined over the past two decades. In 2023, just 62% of young adults reported drinking alcohol, down from 72% in 2003. But what exactly opened the door for this open soberness to flourish? Maybe it was as simple as brands making non-alc beverages “cool” again. 




	For outdoor events or live shows like concerts, a good portion of venue revenue still comes from concessions: an Arizonan venue entertainment director reported that alcohol sales at shows with a majority Gen Z audience have dropped by as much as 25% compared to concerts with older crowds, according to Billboard. The response to this slump in alcohol sales seems to have been offering more NA options, and leading the charge in this cultural shift is a legacy brand that's managed to reinvent itself without losing its roots: Heineken.




	While many beverage brands are just now trying to crack the code on making alcohol-free drinks feel more inclusive (and most importantly, not lame), not only has Heineken 0.0 had a head start, they've already crossed the finish line. Through smart partnerships in music, sports, and pop culture, Heineken didn't just join the non-alcoholic movement, but helped define it — here's how.

	Non-alcoholic beer in the U.S. has come a long way from a dusty shelf in the back of a liquor store to the coolers at some of the country's biggest music festivals. This is partially because for decades, non-alc beer was largely viewed as a hand-waving compromise. 


	While Anheuser Busch and Pabst were some of the first to create what was called “near beer” (beer with an ABV of less than 0.5%) during Prohibition, products like O'Doul's, which launched in 1990, became one of the few mainstream, recognizable names in the space. They were mainly consumed out of necessity though, relegated to designated drivers, people in recovery, or those avoiding alcohol for religious or medical reasons. Flavor was an afterthought, and the cool factor? Nonexistent.


	That all started to shift in the mid-2010s, driven by a perfect storm of changing attitudes toward wellness, and as discussed before, cultural drinking habits. The rise of the “sober curious” movement (particularly among Millennials and then Gen Z) pushed the conversation forward, as these generations weren't necessarily quitting alcohol altogether — but what they did crave was a bit more flexibility. There was always the question of why having fun on a night dry night out meant relegating yourself to seltzer water or Diet Coke.

	At the same time, innovation in brewing technology — especially de-alcoholization techniques that preserve flavor and body — meant non-alc beers were finally starting to compete with the real deal on taste. Some brands like Athletic Brewing Co., which launched in 2017, first gained traction in fitness and outdoor circles by marketing beer that could be part of an active, health-conscious lifestyle. While they helped shake off the stigma, the category still had a very “niche” vibe to it. 


	That same spirit drove the development of Heineken 0.0, whose major strength was being specifically brewed for beer lovers, by beer lovers. Instead of rushing to market with a bland or watery alternative (as many competitors did at the time), Heineken invested in perfecting the recipe, launching globally in 2017 after years of research and refinement.

	No matter how “cool” your branding is, people won't come back if the drink itself doesn't deliver, and their result was a beer that (what a concept) actually tastes like beer: malty, crisp, and refreshing, with none of the awkward aftertaste often associated with non-alc brews. In fact, when we spoke with Heineken Master Brewer, Willem van Waesberghe, at the Heineken Global R&D Center, he admitted that they still aren't done perfecting the flavor. “We are always looking to get it as close to the flavor of our flagship Heineken as possible. We're playing with the levels of malt flavor, and still tweaking it to this day.”


	But it wasn't just the taste that made Heineken 0.0 stand out. The non-alc beer category is becoming a more crowded space than ever in the U.S. — New data from the Beer Institute shows that the NA beer category is up 22.2% year-to-date and 16.4% over the past 12 months. As of 2025, it's a $1.5 billion market, and still growing. And while new entrants continue to pop up in the craft and wellness lanes, it's the brands that are meeting drinkers in socially relevant moments that seem to be breaking through the most.


	By entering the category with a globally-recognized brand and, more importantly, making non-alcoholic beer part of mainstream, pop culture-forward experiences, Heineken redefined what non-alc could look and feel like in the U.S. No longer reserved for the “opt-out” crowd, Heineken 0.0 made it normal, cool, even, to opt in. Their success in this space isn't accidental — The brand has always prided itself on being at the forefront of beverage innovation. From pioneering cold filtration methods in the early 20th century to becoming one of the first global beer brands to embrace sustainable brewing, Heineken isn't afraid of a little change.


	For decades, Heineken has been everywhere from the electric buzz of the US Open to the high-octane spectacle of Formula 1, and the sun-drenched sounds of Coachella. But in recent years, it's been their alcohol-free counterpart, Heineken 0.0, that's been grabbing center stage. 


	Rather than launching Heineken 0.0 as a separate, wellness-focused sub-brand, the company took a bold stance by integrating 0.0 directly into the fabric of events they were already embedded in. That means festival bar booths at Coachella offering Heineken 0.0 right alongside traditional beer, race-day fans at the Las Vegas Grand Prix sipping it trackside, and even high-energy games at Citi Field or Hard Rock Stadium where designated drivers don't feel left out after the tailgate is over. Their strategy is simply not treating non-alcoholic beer like a consolation prize — “Moderation is the hottest headliner,” as Heineken puts it, and they've spent the last few summers proving it on the global stage.




	Most alcohol-free brands enter the space with a health-forward angle (sober is smarter, clean is cool, alcohol is out). But often, this messaging feels alienating or overly earnest, and forgets the core truth of drinking culture: it's not just what's in the glass, it's about sharing experiences. That seamless integration is one of the reasons Heineken 0.0 now ranks as the #1 international alcohol-free beer brand, growing double digits in major markets. It's also why you've been able to find 0.0 at more music festivals globally than ever before — the brand even saw a major spike in non-alcoholic sales at Coachella this year, with Heineken 0.0 showing a 125.5% increase in sales from 2024.


	“As festival culture evolves, so do we — making it easier for people to embrace moderation. We know that taste in drinks is as individual as taste in music, so choice matters,” said Joanna Price, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Heineken in a statement. “That's why by 2024, we ensured that at least one strategic brand in 91% of our markets offered a zero-alcohol option, surpassing our 90% goal. Whether you choose to drink or not, everyone should always have a choice.”


	There's another reason Heineken is dominating this category: they understood early on that the future of drinking is flexible. Sober-curious isn't just a phase anymore, and Millennials and Gen Z are frequently more keen to move fluidly between drinking and not drinking during a single event (or “zebra-striping” as some call it). The brand has created cool, buzz-worthy experiences that are the same whether you decide to crack open a buzzy beverage or sip on a non-alc one. 


	Specifically at Coachella, Heineken's footprint is legendary. Their immersive Heineken House has become a destination in its own right (2025's Weekend One included performances from The Pharcyde, DJ Premier, Pusha T, Southside, Murda Beatz, and more). They've always featured surprise DJ sets, custom bars, and plenty of chilled Heineken, including 0.0. It's the same reason Formula 1 fans in the Heineken-sponsored Paddock Club can toast with 0.0 and feel like they're part of the experience, not missing out on it. It's why tennis fans at the US Open can sip a Heineken 0.0 (in clever, limited-edition “L0VE.L0VE” cans) in the sun without worrying about hydration. 




	Nobody wants an anti-drinking message wrapped in health jargon, but by giving everyone a seat at the table (whether they're drinking alcohol or not), the party feels seamlessly inclusive.


	Heineken clearly isn't the only player in the non-alc world nowadays, but they've certainly emerged as the most culturally resonant. Other brands have made attempts, but few have hit the same stride, for a couple reasons. 


Budweiser Zero for example launched in 2020 with much fanfare, being backed by Dwyane Wade — but has struggled to build the same lifestyle following. Despite the strong celebrity tie-in, it often feels like a product meant for the gym, not the dance floor. Even Coca-Cola's Topo Chico Hard Seltzer attempted a pivot with Topo Chico Sabores, a non-alc offering aimed at social drinkers, but still it hasn't made a dent in festival culture yet. 


	Tom Holland's earnest passion project, Bero, has also delivered big on authentic brew flavors from Pilsners to Hazy IPAs, but still aims for more of a “craft” beer drinker crowd than your average festival headbanger. Arguably their closest competitor is Athletic Brewing Co., one of the fastest-growing craft non-alcoholic beer brands out there, who recently signed a multi-year deal with Live Nation to bring their beers to major music festivals (including Bonnaroo).


	That being said, what they win on quality and community, they lack in global pop culture dominance. This might change in the near future with their recent venue deal, but Athletic Brewing Co.'s early branding that positioned their non-alcoholic beer as a health-conscious beverage might prove to be a bit of a trap — you're arguably more likely to think of a Whole Foods before you'd grab it for the main stage of a music fest.


	This is not to say that these aren't good products (we've tried and enjoyed many of them ourselves). But none have cracked the lifestyle code quite like Heineken has, putting the drink where the people are, and making it feel as relevant as any album drop, match point, or checkered flag.

	While Heineken's 150-year-old legacy remains firmly rooted in their Dutch brewing heritage, the brand's modern chapter seems to be all about cultural fluidity. It knows where it came from, but more importantly, it knows where the party is going. It feels especially deliberate that Heineken 0.0 has no special branding, nor strange new flavors. It's the same recognizable, crisp green bottle as before, just without the alcohol.




	The Heineken 0.0 strategy has been more than just a clever pivot to meet the current trends. By aligning with the biggest names in music, the fastest machines in sport, and the most dynamic global moments, Heineken made moderation part of the mainstream. This clearly isn't your parents' O'Doul's — as Heineken continues to expand the reach of 0.0 to even more events (think hybrid wellness-music festivals, or more creative collabs with artists), it's clear the brand isn't slowing down anytime soon. So the next time you're at a festival just vibing in the crowd, take a look around. That green bottle in someone's hand? It might not have any alcohol in it, but it's still the life of the party.

	Two months after the death of Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys legend was laid to rest at Los Angeles' Westwood Memorial Park.


	His daughter Carnie Wilson, singer of the Nineties trio Wilson Phillips, wrote a heartfelt post on Instagram about her father's burial. “Today we laid my Daddy to rest,” she said. “It was incredibly difficult to see that happen, but at the same time it gave more closure and more of a feeling of restful peace. The last eight weeks have been extremely challenging and like nothing I've ever experienced. I love and miss him so much and I wish he could come back.”


	She added: “There's so many signs that he gives me every day and I know that he's around … he can hear me and he can see me. He makes that apparent. I'm so grateful for this. Today we had a couple of monarch butterflies that just would not leave the site. It was comforting and beautiful. I'm trying to deal with my emotions — they're so up and down. I know that he would want everybody to feel happy and not sad. He didn't like it when I cried.”

	











	Wilson died on June 11 at the age of 82; his funeral was held in July. The cause of death was “respiratory arrest,” with sepsis and cystitis listed as contributing factors. He was cremated and interred next to his brother and bandmate Carl, who died of lung cancer in 1998.

	Upon his death, Carnie wrote that Wilson was “every fiber my body …I've never felt this kind of pain before, but I know he's resting up there in heaven … or maybe playing the piano for Grandma Audree his Mom.” His bandmate and cousin, Mike Love, honored him (he also spoke about him at the Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony), as did Beach Boy Al Jardine.












	Countless tributes from fellow musicians also flooded in, including Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Paul McCartney, Elton John, and others. When Bob Dylan found out about Wilson's death, he “thought about all the years I've been listening to him and admiring his genius.”

Gina Carano has settled her lawsuit against Disney and Star Wars company Lucasfilm over her firing from The Mandalorian in 2021 following her controversial social media posts.


	The former UFC star and actress, who portrayed Cara Dune on the first two seasons of the Disney+ series, was dropped from the show in February 2021 after a string of what Lucasfilm then called “abhorrent” social media posts. Three years later, in February 2024, Carano filed an Elon Musk-backed wrongful termination lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm.


	In July 2024, a judge denied Disney's bid to dismiss Carano's lawsuit, and now, just over a year later, the sides have reached an undisclosed settlement, according to the Hollywood Reporter.


	“With this lawsuit concluded, we look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future,” Disney said in a statement Thursday. “We have reached an agreement with Gina Carano to resolve the issues in her pending lawsuit against the companies. Ms. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect.”

	Carano added on social media, “I have come to an agreement with Disney/Lucasfilm which I believe is the best outcome for all parties involved. I hope this brings some healing to the force.” The actress also thanked Musk, “a man I've never met,” for “funding my lawsuit” and “backing my case and asking for nothing in return.”

	










I have come to an agreement with Disney/Lucasfilm @disney @Lucasfilm which I believe is the best outcome for all parties involved. I hope this brings some healing to the force. I want to extend my deepest most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, @elonmusk a man I've never met,… https://t.co/qiAX7W1vgf


	“I'd like to thank you all for your unrelenting support throughout my life and career, you've been the heartbeat that has kept my story alive. I hope to make you proud,” Carano added. “I am excited to flip the page and move onto the next chapter. My desires remain in the arts, which is where I hope you will join me.”


	It's unclear if the settlement paves the way for Carano to reprise the role of Cara Dune in the upcoming feature film The Mandalorian and Grogu, as production wrapped on that film in December 2024. At the time of Carano controversies, the actress was also rumored to appear as Dune in a Mandalorian spinoff series Rangers of the New Republic.

	Carano's social media posts involved her thoughts on everything from the Black Lives Matter protests and LGBTQ+ issues like preferred pronouns to Covid-19 regulations and alleged, unproven voter fraud in the 2020 election. 


	After the hashtag #FireGinaCarano started trending, Carano shared an Instagram story that appeared to compare “hating someone for their political views” to the antisemitic treatment of Jews during the Nazi regime. It was that post that ultimately led to her dismissal.

	“Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future,” the company said at the time. “Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.”


	Carano's lawsuit insisted that she “compared no one or group of people to the Jewish people during the Holocaust. Rather, she noted the danger that arises when one point of view is singled out for harassment.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","The small village in Scotland that is the UK's UFO capital with hundreds of sightings","https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/small-village-scotland-uks-ufo-35669098","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 05:37:45 GMT","

More than 30 years after the first reports emerged, the mystery surrounding a small village in central Scotland remains as baffling as ever.

Bonnybridge, near Falkirk, shot to global attention in the 1990s after a wave of sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or what are now officially referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).

Since then, more than 300 reports of unexplained activity have been recorded, making it one of the UK's most active areas for supposed other-worldly encounters.

The area around Bonnybridge, Falkirk, and West Lothian became known as the Falkirk Triangle, a term coined after growing interest in the phenomenon.

At its height, the story drew international media coverage, sparking theories of conspiracies, government cover-ups and even the possibility of a portal to another dimension.

One of the earliest and most significant sightings occurred in January 1992. Local businessman James Walker was driving along a country road towards Droves Loan when he claimed to see something he could not explain.

Malcolm Robinson, one of the UK's leading UFO and paranormal researchers, recalled: “He claimed that he saw a large triangular-shaped craft low down in the sky, which had small lights on its underside. It was not a conventional aircraft.”

Robinson has spent 45 years investigating strange phenomena. He founded Strange Phenomena Investigations in 1979, Scotland's longest-running UFO research group, and has written extensively on unexplained sightings. Over the years, he has examined hundreds of reports, both in the UK and abroad.

At the time of the Bonnybridge sightings, local councillor Billy Buchanan took it upon himself to gather accounts from residents. By the end of 1992, he had documented over 200 separate incidents involving unusual lights, shapes and aerial objects.

Reports varied widely. In one case, a driver described a formation of lights in a cross shape hovering above a road before changing into a triangle. In another, a family claimed to have seen a bright circle of light land in a nearby field.

Despite repeated attempts by Buchanan to raise the issue at the highest levels of government, his calls for an official investigation were consistently ignored. He wrote to several ministers and even Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair in 1997, but received no formal response.

“It is important to say that the term UFO means Unidentified Flying Object. It does not describe alien ships visiting the earth,” Robinson added.

The growing number of reports soon drew widespread media attention. Local and national newspapers were quick to seize on the story, and television crews descended on the village.

A public meeting was held in January 1993, as concerned locals sought answers. That November, broadcasters filmed a UFO watch event in Bonnybridge. Despite the freezing conditions and a lack of sightings, the interest only grew.

By the mid-1990s, sightings from the area had featured in countless newspaper articles and were even explored on national television. In 1997, Bonnybridge was the subject of the primetime show Strange But True.

However, as the years went on, the wave of sightings gave way to scepticism, with critics accusing witnesses of seeking publicity or fabricating stories. Some national tabloids even ran claims of alien contact with villagers.

Still, for many residents and researchers, the questions remain unanswered.

Whether the events of the 1990s were the result of mass imagination, military activity or something more mysterious, the truth behind the Falkirk Triangle continues to be hotly debated. And for some, it remains a mystery worth revisiting.

In recent months, the topic of UFOs—or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs)—has surged into mainstream political and cultural conversations. Among the voices taking a serious look at these mysteries is Vice President J.D. Vance, who has openly expressed his fascination and concern over the growing evidence of unexplained objects in our skies.

As L.A. Marzulli shared, Vance discussed UFOs candidly on the Ruthless Podcast, acknowledging the many puzzling videos and reports that have emerged in recent years. “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet,” Vance admitted, “but we're only six months into the administration.” His comments reflect a growing political interest in uncovering the truth behind these phenomena, especially as they continue to appear in military and civilian airspace.

Marzulli, a prominent researcher and host known for his work on the supernatural and UFO topics, highlights Vance's involvement as a key moment in public awareness. Marzulli also issues a stark warning that goes beyond politics: UFOs represent what he calls the coming great deception, a spiritual and global event that many are not prepared for.

“The church won't even address it,” Marzulli says. “Do we have a form of religion but deny its power?”

This silence, he argues, leaves many vulnerable when these mysterious crafts become impossible to ignore. Marzulli's grim prediction is that when the Rapture occurs, these alien crafts will arrive openly. This convergence, he warns, will cause massive confusion and challenge believers' faith in unprecedented ways.

Marzulli laments that the church remains largely silent, failing to prepare its people for what he calls a “mega lever” — a game-changing event that will alter paradigms globally in an instant.

Marzulli points out recent sightings of mysterious drones over the United States, which the government claims pose no threat. He speculates these drones could be searching for hidden “dirty bombs” with radioactive material, a theory that underscores the layers of danger beyond just the UFO phenomenon itself.

 Vance's public interest signals that UFOs are no longer fringe topics but urgent questions for governments and the public alike. Meanwhile, voices like Marzulli are urging the church to awaken and prepare, because the coming great deception is not just about technology or politics—it's a challenge to faith itself.

RIO RANCHO, N.M. — Students at one New Mexico school district could get some extra lessons this year on extraterrestrial life. 

The National UFO Historical Records Center is opening up their collection to teachers and students at Rio Rancho Public Schools for unique lessons in physics, history and critical thinking. This comes after the district gave the center some portable classrooms to house their hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents and other evidence.

“Today on the internet, students are exposed to all kinds of information – true and untrue – and we want to give them the tools to be able to dissect the evidence that's presented to them and to make a good, informed decision whether something is true or untrue. And in the UFO realm, it's just a really good subject matter to springboard into that critical thinking piece,” said Michael Baker, chief operating officer of Rio Rancho Public Schools.

Archive volunteers met with teachers ahead of the school year. They gave them a rundown of what is in their filing cabinets. They also explained how they can utilize all those resources. 

Ultimately, it is up to each teacher to decide on incorporating these UFO files into their lesson plans.

The district is hosting an open house on this Saturday, Oct. 18.

Inspiring Business by Sharing Success

Added by Love Business East Midlands | 8 August 2025

Established in 1996, UAP Group is home to six product brands including the well-known Fullex door lock. The business has previously been backed by Maven Capital Partners, who Browne Jacobson also acted for.

UAP Group serves customers across the UK and holds nearly 200 patents, trademarks, and registered designs, including for its pioneering Armasmart range, the industry's first door hardware range to eliminate 99.98 per cent of viruses, including Covid-19.

Following completion of the deal, UAP now reports into the Allegion International segment, with founder and chief executive David Jennings remaining to drive the combined growth strategy.

The Browne Jacobson team was led by Partner Ryan Brown, Senior Associate Bethany Grummit, Associate Bennedetta Cocconi, and Samuel Moore provided tax advice. 

Ryan Brown, Partner at Browne Jacobson, commented: 

""UAP has been a long-standing client of the firm, having supported it on a range of matters including acquisitions over the past few years. This is another great story for a fantastic north-west based business which has been supported by a local private equity firm, has continued to grow and then attracted interest from multi-national acquirers. It is also a great example of the increasing confidence that exists for M&A in this sector, which we highlighted in our inward investment report.”

The transaction delivered a strong return for both Maven Investor Partners and Maven's institutional buyout fund, following a successful buy-and-build strategy that integrated five complementary businesses to broaden UAP's product and service range.

UAP Old Mutual's planned exit from the South Sudan's insurance market is facing legal resistance from former employees, who claim the company is attempting to flee the country with unresolved labour disputes and financial liabilities.

“We have already submitted a request for a temporary injunction, which was expected to be issued by August 7, to prevent UAP from winding down operations pending the court's final decision,” Reech said.

He accused the company of concealing its true closure timeline. “UAP claims it will cease operations over two years, but internal documents indicate they plan to shut down within 90 days,” Reech alleged. “They are trying to avoid liabilities that may arise from this case.”

The case was initially set for final judgement in July but was delayed after the presiding judge was transferred, a development Reech suggested could complicate the employees' pursuit of justice.

Announcing the planned exit in June, Old Mutual said: “The Board of Directors of the Company hereby notifies its shareholders and the general public that its subsidiary, UAPISS will stop writing new business and policy renewals with effect from 3 July 2025.” The company said the decision followed “a strategic review of the business and its operating environment.”

Former staff association chair Mading Jacob said: “South Sudanese courts have the authority to prevent UAP from leaving while legal matters are unresolved. We trust the judiciary will deliver justice.” 

If granted, the injunction could keep the multinational's South Sudan operations running until the labour dispute is resolved, setting a potential precedent for corporate exits in fragile markets.

The world of ghost hunting and paranormal investigation in the second half of the 20th century was dominated by one power couple. Demonologist Ed Warren and his clairvoyant wife Lorraine Warren traveled the world investigating various cases they would later make famous.

From Annabelle to Amityville, this duo claims to have consulted on 10,000 instances of  paranormal phenomena from hauntings and possessions to the occasional cryptid sighting.

After founding the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the Warrens embarked on a lucrative lecture series while writing books about their more prominent adventures. And all the while they've maintained their infamous museum filled with cursed, possessed, or otherwise dangerous objects.  

But were they devout researchers dedicated to helping others or opportunistic grifters out to line their own pockets? What skeletons might be lurking in the couple's own closet and what would they do to protect their public image? In the latest episode of Bloody FM's Murder Made Fiction Podcast, Jenn walks Joe through four decades of supernatural scamming from the couple's humble beginnings to an ever-increasing cinematic universe. 



And if you want even more Murder Made Fiction, be sure to check out the pod's Patreon feed, where Jenn and Joe have ~80 hours of content included a bonus episode detailing the Snedeker Haunting and the curious case of the Annabelle doll, episode by episode coverage of Apple TV's Smoke and Hulu's The Twisted Case of Amanda Knox, and a full primer on Amanda Knox's controversial story.

SETI has reviewed over one million objects for technosignatures as part of large-scale radio surveys, while new systems like LaserSETI are being constructed to monitor laser pulses across the sky, enhancing our detection capabilities for intelligent signals. 

Surveys reveal that a strong majority of scientists, especially astrobiologists, consider extraterrestrial life, at least in simple form, likely to exist elsewhere in the universe. Agreement on intelligent life is lower but still notable. 

SETI has reviewed over one million objects for technosignatures as part of large-scale radio surveys, while new systems like LaserSETI are being constructed to monitor laser pulses across the sky, enhancing our detection capabilities for intelligent signals. 

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified promising biosignature gases like dimethyl sulphide in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light-years away, though confirmation remains pending.

Projections suggest that even if alien civilisations are listening, two-way communication with beings beyond about 50 light-years would take at least half a century. Some models estimate a ""contact era"" could still be 400 years away.

Debate continues over whether humanity should actively reach out via Active SETI. Critics emphasise the risks of revealing Earth's location without global consensus.

Plans are underway among scientists to study the psychological and societal impacts of actual detection, not just the technology. Research is being funded to explore how culture, media, and politics might shape reactions and policies.

NASA's planned Habitable Worlds Observatory, expected to launch in the 2040s, aims to directly image Earth-like exoplanets and search for possible biosignatures in their atmospheres.

While scientists widely acknowledge the possibility of extraterrestrial life, actual contact, especially involving intelligent beings, remains a distant prospect. Technological advances are improving detection potential, yet timelines span decades to centuries, with societal readiness still evolving.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

Q: 

Remember the gruesome, acid-for-blood extraterrestrial nasty in Alien? The one that burst out of John Hurt's chest in the middle of a convivial dinner aboard the Nostromo? Well the xenomorph is back and this time on TV — specifically in Alien: Earth on Disney+ (from Wednesday) and now crash-landed on Earth. This cannot be good news for earthlings, but the series is an ambitious and intelligent extension of the franchise.

In the pantheon of aliens that have visited Earth (on screen, that is), the xenomorph is a particularly horrifying one, but as many have been friendly as have been hostile, as my personal pick of ten from the movies (not TV, so no Mork) suggests. You may wish to suggest others, of course, but remember, aliens on Earth only.

What's worse — the spider-like “facehugger” during the larval stage, the embryonic “chestburster” (think John Hurt's ill-fated dinner in the original Alien) or the super-strong xenomorph in all its full phallic-headed, multijawed horror? Some choice. The most terrifying alien in the universe has only just found its way to Earth — in the prequel series Alien: Earth — so let's see how that goes. But to paraphrase the original film's tagline, on Earth everyone can hear you scream. Disney+

“It crawls … it creeps … it eats you alive!” The blob was apparently so terrifying that cinemas would take no responsibility for heart attacks or damage to nerves (or so the other tagline had it). “It's kind of like a mass that keeps getting bigger and bigger” is how the “teenager” Steve McQueen described it, keeping a straight face. The blob didn't get nearly enough screen time, but when it did, oozing through cracks into a movie theatre, it's hokily marvellous, like a giant melted Jelly Baby. YouTube

As if a corrective to his horror from outer space in The Thing, director John Carpenter's next alien was as sweet as ET and as charismatic as Jeff Bridges. Well, not quite. He was played by Bridges, but with a strange smile and odd little head movements. This alien has replicated the looks of a recently deceased young farmer, so he looks like Bridges but acts cluelessly inquisitive. Lucky for him he's about to experience a soapy love story with “his” deeply confused widow. Channel 4+ or rent

From the 1950s era of monochrome flying saucers, Klaatu, an alien looking suspiciously like Michael Rennie, told Earth to “live in peace or pursue your present course in obliteration”. The earthling military was the enemy here. But then the ambassador for peace had Gort, his immoveable robot, obliterate soldiers with his laser eyes, which wasn't very peaceful. Just remember the command to stop him: “Klaatu barada nikto!” Cultpix or rent

You may have forgotten that the sweet transsexual Dr Frank-N-Furter was not from Transylvania the country, but Transylvania the galaxy. He is surely the only alien in the universe to wear a corset and suspender belt. And his oddball gang are aliens, the castle that Brad and Janet are marooned at — for a night of polysexual high jinks — lifting off into space at the end. Perhaps all still best watched, as the song had it, “at the late-night, double-feature picture show”. Disney+

Being played by David Bowie deep in his emaciated, orange-haired LA period, Thomas Jerome Newton is the alien of choice among cultier film buffs. In fairness, as Bowie later admitted, being on 10g of cocaine a day meant he genuinely “wasn't of this earth at that particular time”. He is undoubtedly a far cooler-looking extraterrestrial on Earth than ET was, which makes up for the fact this depressed alien — on a hapless mission to save his drought-stricken planet — sounds like he's from Bromley.

If you're a DC Comics geek, you may know that the planet Krypton didn't just accommodate human-like beings with the name “El” (Superman was Kal-El; his Marlon Brando-lookalike father was Jor-El), but also Krypto the Superdog and Beppo the Super-Monkey. Superdog, an intergalactic schnauzer, has finally made it on to the big screen in the latest Superman film, but he's not fit to lick the red boots of Christopher Reeve's Superman/Clark Kent, the most charming alien there has been.

Not all aliens are bug-eyed creatures. In Invasion of the Body Snatchers, alien spores on Earth created pods that produced emotionless, conforming clones of people — an invasion that's as quiet as The War of the Worlds was clamorous. A political metaphor for McCarthyism at the time, you could perhaps now watch it as a metaphor for a world of mindless phone-scrollers. Sky/Now

Steven Spielberg's alien was the tear-jerking sensation of 1982 and, 43 years on, his bug-eyed, tortoise-like charm is still sweet if not quite as overwhelming as it was. “Phone home,” ET rasped, along with a generation of children, the lost voyager's cuteness a fig-leaf for a drama about the effects of divorce. The only screen alien whose face is modelled, in part, on Albert Einstein. Netflix

Echoing David Bowie's alien for enigmatic cool, Scarlett Johansson's femme fatale, driving around rainy Glasgow in a fur coat, is surely the most alluring predator in history. With little plot or dialogue as she/it drives around picking up ill-fated men, the film's bizarre, arty pretensions might bore as many as they beguile, but this mind-bender is truly an arresting piece of work, and its emotionless “female” one like no other.

When Ghosts of War was released in 2020, it didn't get a lot of traction and gained mostly unfavorable reviews from the critics. From the current perspective, this horror film set in the penultimate year of World War II hits differently, with its effective mix of not only suspense and action but also supernatural and psychological aspects. Admittedly, the initial premise of Eric Bress' film doesn't come off as very original, as the war setting isn't anything new to the horror genre, thanks to such outings as Overlord, Trench 11, The Bunker, etc. Few films, however, offer truly interesting concepts within the genre wrapping, mostly content with finding new ways to introduce various monsters (most commonly, zombies) to the historical setting. A notable exception was M.J. Bassett's 2002 film, Deathwatch, which presented war itself as a monster. And Ghosts of War, despite all the plot differences, leans towards the same idea, focusing on the way war shapes horrific moral dilemmas and showing how guilt and shame over certain actions or inaction can create their very own monsters and curses.

In 1944, five American troopers of the 82nd Airborne Division arrive at a chateau located somewhere in rural France. They are under orders to guard the place, and at first none of the men think much about the fact that the unit who had the previous shift seem rattled and can't get out of there fast enough. The guys barely manage to settle in when strange, seemingly paranormal occurrences start happening all around them. Between the mysterious knocking coming from the fireplace—which seems to be using Morse code to send ominous messages—and a journal that details the terrible fate of the family that used to live here, the characters succumb to the dark presence that lurks around them. German soldiers arrive and attack, but at this point, the Americans have already come to realize that what they're dealing with inside the house might be much more dangerous than the enemies they are trying to keep out.

The Gothic setting of the mansion and all the potential chills that come with it can bring another reference to a supernatural horror set during WWII to mind—the unfortunate sequel to an already unnecessary remake, The Woman in Black: Angel of Death, which came out in 2014. Unlike the latter, though, Ghosts of War doesn't only utilize war as a backdrop to a classic ghost story about a vengeful spirit who wants retribution but incorporates it into the emotional core here: war isn't the background of the horror; it's the catalyst for it. Eric Bress isn't a novice in genre cinema, having previously worked on the Final Destination franchise—both the second and fourth films—as a screenwriter and having directed The Butterfly Effect. In Ghosts of War, which he both wrote and directed, he makes effective use of space, which remains pretty limited for most of the story, making it work for both horror and the prolonged action sequence depicting the attack by the Germans.

Like many movies with a clear anti-war message, Ghosts of War has a very specific set of characters and a very particular cast that all help to sharpen the idea that most people who find themselves in the trenches aren't black and white heroes or villains. Just ordinary people who try to hold on to their sanity amid chaos and madness. That is especially evident in the case of the future Jack Reacher, Alan Ritchson, who plays one of the privates with his trademark natural charisma of a man who could've been the hero of the story and the one to make it to the end credits in some other scenario. Here, however, he unexpectedly becomes the first and almost random victim, once again emphasizing the idea of war as the dark force that devours everything and everyone in its path.

Other actors in the core cast fully contribute to this effect too. Brenton Thwaites plays the unit's commander, who does his best to lead but comes off just as confused as the men he's supposed to be in charge of. And Kyle Gallner, who hadn't fully reached his Scream King status at that point but already had several noticeable genre outings under his belt, seems to be channeling his experience in The Haunting in Connecticut, playing a character who is probably the most perceptive of the supernatural presence inside the mansion. Rounded out by Skylar Astin and Theo Rossi, this group comes off as a bunch of regular young men who are roughened and exhausted by the war, but try to stick to some semblance of normalcy by gathering around the fireplace and scaring each other by relaying terrible incidents as if they were campfire stories.

While Ghosts of War isn't by any means a subtle film, the gradual dissolution of the familiar reality is what it does best, hinting at a possible twist with the help of several discrepancies in the story, noticeable to history buffs, and the mention of the famous Ambrose Bierce's short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. When Bress' film first came out, a lot of the criticism it faced was aimed specifically at the movie's ending, claiming that both the twist and the following resolution sort of render the previous events pointless. In the context of the movie's broader meaning, though, there is another way to see this controversial ending. In its final sequence, Ghosts of War seems to be fully embracing its psychological horror origin, showing that the only way to deal with trauma is to go back to the roots of it and address it directly, instead of going through the soothing motions that are merely an illusion of moving forward.

Supernatural is rated TV-14, which means that it includes violence, magic, and supernatural creatures but usually doesn't go as far as an R-rated movie. Over the course of 15 seasons, the series has featured many monsters, demons, ghosts, and supernatural beings in some of the strangest places, taking viewers on a journey across America.

The show often features classic folklore and legends that are widely depicted in the horror genre and in a way that surpasses the general expectation. Supernatural excels at storytelling and weaving different elements into a highly entertaining narrative. Almost hardly repeating itself, the show has delivered many episodes that can be considered horror masterpieces despite their family-friendly nature.

 ""Bloody Mary"" plays around one of the most well-known legends in America and sees three girls who didn't believe the curse of Bloody Mary, dare each other to summon her in front of the mirror. Aided by jump scares and horrific character designs, the episode features a famous vengeful spirit responsible for giving many people nightmares at night. This episode of Supernatural confronts fear in a way that doesn't diminish or reduce the level of horror.

Unlike many horror flicks that end up completely ruining the fun, Bloody Mary in ""Bloody Mary"" remains hauntingly mesmerizing till the end, even after Dean and Sam Winchester solve the case. In fact, there's a reason behind the spine-tingling effect the villain gives. Supernatural incorporated elements from the Japanese film Ringu to create a uniquely terrifying portrayal of the figure that's rarely been seen in other media.

 Revolving around the mysterious deaths that occur in a town, Sam and Dean trace the trail to an old house in ""Playthings,"" where their investigation leads them to the realization that a little girl's imaginary friend isn't purely imaginary. Many horror films have tackled the twist of a child's friend turning out to be a vengeful spirit, but only the good ones manage to keep it a real surprise. This episode of Supernatural handles it expertly and delivers the reveal in a shockingly satisfying manner without spoiling the fun ahead of time.

The creepy house that's full of dolls is easily misleading, which not only serves to distract viewers from figuring out the truth but also paints an eerie mood. From disappearing dolls to strangely twisted doll heads and a dollhouse that mysteriously depicts a murder scene, the episode is rich in horror elements, perfect for fans with an appetite for suspense and mystery. Notably, ""Playthings"" also doesn't feature any dull moments after the plot twist. The story only gets richer after the reveal.

 Sam and Dean Winchester have worked on many fascinating cases, but the case that Jo brought to them still beats most. In ""No Exit,"" Jo, eager to follow her father's path to becoming a hunter, defies her mother's wish and goes on a hunt with the Winchester brothers, and the episode sees them tracking down the ghost of America's first serial killer, H.H. Holmes, who hunted his victims through secret pathways in the walls.

Jo volunteered to be the bait, knowing that she fit the serial killer's type. The tense episode then sees Jo being abducted by the killer. ""No Exit"" adds a unique Supernatural twist to a traditional serial killer case and makes H.H. Holmes much more terrifying. Instead of a real person, the ghost of a serial killer becomes an evil entity that can't be killed. It lives in the walls and sneaks up on its victims like Pennywise. The Winchester brothers had to drop concrete in the sewer to seal the ghost inside just to stop him from taking more souls.

 Taking place in the deserted Roosevelt asylum, haunted by the ghosts of past patients, ""Asylum"" is one of the must-watch Supernatural episodes for horror fans. Filled with creepy details, jump scares, humor, and a bit of romance, the episode has a little bit of everything, but what makes it shine is the execution of the story. While the ghosts of the patients may seem scary at first, they turn out to be mostly harmless. Instead, the real antagonist is an evil doctor who experimented on the patients.

The episode was made even better by the charming appearances of Kat and Gavin, who sneaked into the asylum for fun and stumbled upon ghosts instead. Besides being a tight horror piece, the episode also saw the conflict between Sam and Dean intensify. Dr. Ellicott used his power on Sam and turned him against Dean, who fought his younger brother and burned the doctor's corpse. Talking about having everything in one place, ""Asylum"" is a neat little episode that's emotionally layered.

 Horror fans are no strangers to seeing scary mascots. From Five Nights at Freddy's to Terrifier, mascot horror movies have already become a subgenre. However, this supernatural episode still brings something terrifying and refreshing to the genre. ""Plush"" follows a simple premise, in which a series of mascot costumes are being possessed. Whoever puts on the costume becomes a slasher and goes around killing innocent people. The giant bunny's head also doesn't come off easily.

As an episode with feature film potential, ""Plush"" further sees Sam and Dean try to solve the mystery behind the bunny's head. Combining crime-solving with horror, the episode has a good storyline that's not too complicated to understand. The spooky bunny's head also becomes a terrifying highlight in the episode. There are scenes where the bunny is captured and investigated (instead of running around purely as a slasher), which significantly add to its creepiness. Bottom line, the episode does something so obvious but somehow hard to come by in the horror genre, which makes it a must-watch for mascot horror fans.

 ""Bitten"" is one of the more unconventional episodes where Supernatural experiments with form. Consisting of footage of a unique student film made by college students who were turned into werewolves, the episode follows their story and sees Sam and Dean unknowingly being featured in their project while in town to investigate a case. Blending werewolf attacks into Paranormal Activity-style storytelling, the episode easily stands out in the show.

What makes ""Bitten"" an impressive horror piece is the story's emotional weight. Films like Paranormal Activity almost purely focus on delivering an immersive experience that puts viewers in the middle of the events, but Supernatural pushes the form one step further by weaving development. Kate lost her boyfriend and a friend and got turned into a werewolf. She became someone that the viewers can invest in. The Winchesters also made a rare decision by sparing her, which makes this gruesome episode even harder to forget.

 The episode of ""Mannequin 3: The Reckoning"" taps into another common human fear: inanimate objects, and delivers it with mastery. Opening with a horror-esque scene where a mannequin murders a cleaning staff member, the episode doesn't shy away from the gory details. Much like an R-rated movie, it continues to see more inanimate objects coming ""alive.""

What makes this episode more complex than most horror movies is its complexity and how unexpected the plot twists are. It doesn't follow the same exact pattern of a vengeful spirit, with each murder taking place in a different town. On top of that, the episode uses Annabel-esque techniques to create a disturbing, eerie mood. Following their investigation, Sam and Dean eventually trace it to a woman and discover the tragedy behind the haunting. ""Mannequin 3: The Reckoning"" has it all: emotional depth, brilliant storytelling, and interesting characters.

 ""Provenance"" follows Sam and Dean's investigation into a young couple's murder after they purchased an antique painting of a family portrait. They quickly realized that whenever the painting went, death followed. Revolving around a haunted object, the episode explores themes of legacy, trauma, and unresolved family issues. Sam, still haunted by Jessica's death, had issues with letting her go, and this episode saw him taking a step forward with a new love interest.

""Provenance"" is creepy and unsettling, layered with horror elements, but at its core, the episode is about resolution and letting go of the past. As a horror-filled episode, ""Provenance"" has depth that is rare to come in the horror genre, which makes it easily stand out. The episode contains a twist that many didn't see coming. While the old man in the painting was initially perceived as the main suspect, given his creepy stare and strange behavior, it turned out that he was trying to warn everyone about the little girl, who turned out to be the evil spirit.

 ""Mystery Spot"" features a Happy Death Day-style premise, where Sam is stuck in a time loop, but instead of him being the one who died and restarting the clock, he relieved Dean's death over and over again. What makes this episode exceptionally masterful is how engaging and interesting the story is throughout. Sam, unlike most horror movie protagonists, is witty and resourceful. The fact that he started paying attention to the people around him and figured out Loki's trick is refreshing, given that most horror movies see the protagonist give up and go into self-destruction mode before something comes up again.

What makes the episode even more unsettling is that the formula essentially changed at the end. Dean died, but the clock didn't reset, and Sam had to live months believing he had lost his brother for good. Even though Loki eventually let the brother go, part of Sam would also wonder if Dean was going to die again (and so did the viewers).

 ""Baby"" is a masterpiece because the idea of making a gory movie from the perspective of a car is simply genius. Told entirely from the point of view of the famous Impala, the episode follows Sam and Dean on a road trip to slay demons and monsters. Given that it's from Baby's view only, there are inconsistencies here and there, but that's what makes it fun. ""Baby"" could easily pass as a horror comedy.

Not short of gory details and bloody kills, the episode is also packed with charming moments from Sam and Dean singing in the car to a head that refuses to die. Given it's set in the Supernatural's universe, seeing events unfold through Baby's point of view also has an effect on viewers. The episode leaves just the right amount of mystery to question whether there's a spirit in the Impala, which has become its own character at this point.

A new study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology provides evidence that believing in one conspiracy theory can slightly increase the likelihood of believing in others over time. While the effects were small, the findings support a long-standing theory that some people may develop interconnected systems of conspiratorial thinking, where one belief helps reinforce others.

Although previous studies had shown that people who believe in one conspiracy theory tend to believe in others, there was little direct evidence about how these beliefs develop over time. One influential theory, proposed by psychologist Ted Goertzel in 1994, suggested that conspiracy beliefs could form a closed system, where each belief supports and amplifies the others.

This model has been widely cited, but its central claim—that believing in one conspiracy theory increases the likelihood of adopting others—had not been tested in a way that could establish causality. To address this gap, a group of researchers from institutions in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany conducted two extensive longitudinal studies to examine how beliefs in various conspiracy theories influence each other over time.

“There's been a lot of research showing that people who believe one conspiracy theory are more likely than average to believe other conspiracy theories. A well-known theory suggests this is because developing a belief in one conspiracy theory causes people to develop beliefs in others,” said study author Matt N. Williams, an associate professor at the School of Psychology at Massey University.

“This is the popular idea of ‘going down the rabbit hole.' But despite a lot of discussion about this idea in the academic literature, there haven't previously been any studies on the topic with a credible way of testing causal effects. I realized that by doing longitudinal studies it'd be possible to test whether people who develop a belief in one conspiracy theory are more likely to subsequently develop beliefs in other conspiracy theories.”

In the first study, the team followed 498 participants from Australia and New Zealand across seven monthly survey waves. Participants answered questions about their agreement with 10 well-known conspiracy theories, such as beliefs that the September 11 attacks were an inside job, that fluoride is added to water to control minds, and that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips. Responses were given on a five-point scale ranging from strong disagreement to strong agreement. Most participants disagreed with most of the theories, but there was still enough variation in responses over time to examine patterns of change.

The researchers used a statistical approach known as a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, or RI-CLPM. This method allowed them to isolate changes within individuals over time, separating those from stable personality traits that might predispose someone to conspiracy beliefs in general. They then analyzed whether an increase in belief in one conspiracy theory in a given month was followed by increases in belief in other theories the next month.

The results showed that on average, small increases in belief in one conspiracy theory were followed by small increases in belief in others. The individual effects were tiny—typically a few hundredths of a point on a five-point scale—but consistent across the data. While none of the individual cross-lagged effects were statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the average effect across all 90 possible pairings was positive and significant. This pattern supported the idea that, for at least some people, adopting one conspiratorial belief can make it more likely they'll adopt others in the future.

To confirm the results and strengthen the causal interpretation, the researchers conducted a second, preregistered study. This study included a larger and more diverse sample of 980 participants from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The data were collected over 13 consecutive months, and the survey included 11 conspiracy theories—some overlapping with those in the first study and some newly added. These included beliefs that climate change is a hoax, that genetically modified foods are dangerous and being covered up, and that the COVID-19 pandemic was used as a pretext to restrict civil liberties.

Again, the researchers used RI-CLPM to analyze the data. They preregistered their hypothesis that belief in any one conspiracy theory would positively influence belief in all others over time and laid out strict criteria for what would count as support or refutation of that hypothesis.

According to their preregistered plan, even a single negative and statistically significant cross-lagged effect could have falsified their theory. But in the results, none of the effects were significantly negative. One positive effect remained statistically significant even after a strict correction for multiple comparisons, and the average cross-lagged effect was again small but positive and statistically significant.

“The results suggest that developing a belief in one conspiracy theory probably does make you more likely to subsequently develop beliefs in other conspiracy theories, but only very slightly!” Williams told PsyPost. “The effect sizes we found were statistically significant but very small.”

“This lines up with one of our previous studies showing that people's levels of belief (or disbelief) in conspiracy theories tend to be quite stable over time. In that paper, we concluded: ‘People developing beliefs in a succession of conspiracy theories are often characterised as falling down a ‘rabbit hole'—a reference to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It seems that if conspiracy theorists do fall down a rabbit hole, it is typically one with a rather gradual slope.'”

As with all research, there are limitations to note. One concern is that the findings could be influenced by factors that change over time and affect belief in multiple theories, such as exposure to new information or political events. These time-varying influences were not controlled in the analyses, meaning they could potentially explain some of the observed effects.

“Our paper was specifically focused on estimating causal effects,” Williams noted. “We did collect longitudinal data, and applied a form of analysis that can rule out one type of confounding variable—confounding variables that are stable over time. However, our studies definitely aren't as conclusive as a true experiment would be, and it is possible that our estimates of causal effects could be biased (upwards or downwards!)”

“It's also worth mentioning that the two studies in this paper are about the effects of beliefs in different conspiracy theories on one another. They weren't designed to tell us anything about other consequences of belief in conspiracy theories. That's a different question, and other researchers have published on this topic. But to me, the fact that people are willing to entertain conspiracy theories isn't a bad thing in and of itself; real conspiracies do happen! That said, when beliefs about conspiracies become unmoored from reality, negative consequences can take place.”

Another limitation is that the surveys may not accurately reflect participants' true beliefs. Factors such as social desirability bias, inattentiveness, or insincere responding could have distorted how people reported their agreement with the conspiracy theories.

“People sometimes claim to believe a conspiracy theory in a survey when they don't really believe it (e.g., because they're making a joke or trying to troll us),” Williams explained. “Such insincere responses could possibly distort some of our findings in this research area. For example, it could inflate estimates of the prevalence of beliefs in conspiracy theories. Some of my collaborators and I are therefore working on a study where we aim to find out more about insincere responding and how it affects research on conspiracy theories.”

“I think it's important that research on conspiracy theories (or any topic, really) is done in a transparent fashion. So we shared open data and materials along with this paper, so readers can check our analyses and replicate our work. We also preregistered Study 2, so that readers can have more confidence that we didn't ‘cherry pick' our findings. The paper itself is also open access.”

The study, “Does Developing a Belief in One Conspiracy Theory Lead a Person to be More Likely to Believe in Others?,” was authored by Matt N. Williams, Mathew D. Marques, John R. Kerr, Stephen R. Hill, Mathew Ling, and Edward J. R. Clarke.

Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants.

People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to overestimate their own abilities and wrongly assume that others share their views, according to a new study. The findings highlight overconfidence as a key factor behind conspiracy belief.

A new study used artificial intelligence to analyze over 75,000 Reddit posts and uncover the deep emotional toll QAnon beliefs take on families. The findings reveal widespread grief, fear, and strained relationships as loved ones struggle with ideological division.

Psychologists have found that conspiracy theory beliefs may stem from spite triggered by feelings of social, existential, or cognitive disadvantage. The findings suggest that tackling misinformation requires addressing deeper social inequalities and psychological frustrations.

People prone to conspiracy theories may share cognitive tendencies with those who experience delusional thinking. Two new studies suggest that biases like anomalous perception and impulsive reasoning help explain why some are more likely to embrace conspiratorial beliefs.

Contrary to popular belief, conspiracy theories may not drive democratic decline—rather, those who reject democracy seem more prone to conspiratorial thinking.

Measles is surging again, and experts say fear, mistrust, and misinformation—not just ignorance—are fueling vaccine hesitancy.

A new study suggests that how well you sleep may influence how much you believe in conspiracy theories.

Gabbard spoke about this topic during an interview with “Pod Force One,” the New York Post podcast. “I have my own views and opinions,” she said, “In this role, I have to be careful with what I share.””

The Post reported that when asked a follow-up question about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, Gabbard replied, “Yes.” In the recorded interview, she insisted that her office would “be transparent with the public when the time comes.”

Her nod to the longest-running of all conspiracy theories comes as the Trump administration desperately tries to move on from the scandal surrounding the Epstein files. Gabbard has already done her part in this regard, diverting public attention from it by declassifying parts of former special prosecutor John Durham's report on the origins of the “Russiagate” scandal. The move was an attempt to reinforce the president's long-standing and repeatedly discredited claims that Democrats conspired to frame him.

Although Gabbard refused to provide further details on classified information regarding the existence of alien beings in her new interview, she hinted that she still has unanswered questions about certain ambiguous incidents. The intelligence director specifically mentioned the mysterious drones sighted last year between New York and New Jersey.

“I still have a lot of questions around that,” she said of what the intelligence community officially calls UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). “I've heard what the public official line is. We're continuing to look for the truth and share that truth with the American people.”

According to the federal administration, the flying objects were simply a combination of private, commercial, and government aircraft. However, this version has never fully convinced Gabbard.

“It wasn't just New Jersey. It was happening in different parts of the country… There's a lot of classified information about that”, she added.

The intelligence director is not the only one with a keen interest in the subject. Vice President JD Vance has also said he is obsessed with UAPs. “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we're only six months in—we've been very busy,” he explained.

      Personally, I have always had a soft spot for the original Men in Black movies. There's something about the way they mix humor, mystery, and the unknown that really speaks to me. The idea of a hidden world operating just out of sight, full of secrets that most people will never know, is fascinating. In a way, it makes you wonder how much of what we see in our daily lives is only part of the picture.
    


      I also really enjoy films like War of the Worlds and E.T.—two very different takes on the concept of contact with extraterrestrial life. War of the Worlds plays on the raw, instinctive fear of the unknown. It's intense, chaotic, and reminds you that not all first encounters would be peaceful. On the other hand, E.T. is heartwarming and hopeful, showing how curiosity and compassion can bridge enormous differences. Both films, in their own ways, stir the imagination and push you to think about what might be out there, waiting to be discovered.
    


      Movies like these—along with others in the sci-fi and mystery genres—have fueled a deep personal longing for knowledge. They've planted a spark in me to look beyond the surface of things, to dig for truths that could change the way we see our world. It's not just about aliens or advanced technology; it's about the human drive to understand, to question, and to uncover the stories hidden in the shadows.
    


      If I had to share my favorites related to this theme, I'd also throw in Contact, for its thoughtful exploration of faith and science, and Arrival, for its brilliant take on language and time. These films remind me that sometimes, the biggest revelations aren't just about the universe—they're about ourselves. Drop your favorite movies that relate to the topic and why they are your favorite!

The Department of Justice is investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James over the $454 million civil fraud case she won against President Donald Trump before he was elected. 

Justice Department officials have convened a grand jury and have sent subpoenas to James's office, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous discussing a confidential investigation.

Trump's Immigration Policy:

A federal appeals court threw out a judge's finding of “probable cause” to hold Trump administration officials in criminal contempt of court for sending accused Venezuelan gang members to an El Salvador prison despite his order to halt the deportations.

The 2-1 order on Friday means US officials no longer face a further contempt investigation or the possibility of prosecution under that previous ruling. In April, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington concluded in a blockbuster opinion that officials acted in “willful disregard” of his orders on March 15 to turn around planes carrying Venezuelans to El Salvador.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Trump's Tariffs:

Traders on the floor of the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, Mexico's stock exchange.

US President Donald Trump's tariffs are giving international stocks a serious lift and at the same time helping to end the S&P 500 Index's run of global dominance — at least for now.

International stock markets are on pace to outperform the broad US equities benchmark this year, the first time they've done that since 2022, and the first time in a rising market since 2009. Fears that tariffs and trade uncertainty will have an outsized impact on Corporate America's earnings growth are the primary culprit.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields moved higher Friday as investors weighed the effect of higher tariffs on the outlook for U.S. economic growth and inflation.

The 2-year Treasury note yield gained more than 2 basis points to 3.756%, the 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 3 basis points to 4.283% and the 30-year Treasury bond yield was up more than 4 basis points at 4.855%. One basis point equals 0.01%, or 1/100th of a percent, and prices and yield move inversely in the bond market.

Fixed income investors also began looking ahead to next Tuesday's scheduled report on consumer prices in the U.S. in July, and next Thursday's release of July producer prices, a key measure of movements in wholesale costs and business inputs, next Thursday. Both inflation numbers will help set the backdrop for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate policy meeting on Sept. 16-17.

Tariff news dominated headlines this week as President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs came into force on Thursday.

Brazil and India both face 50% levies on their exports into the U.S., while Canada and Mexico are dealing with 25% and 35% duties, respectively. Countries not named in Trump's list are subject to a 10% baseline levy.

At the same time, Trump announced Thursday that he had chosen Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to replace Adriana Kugler as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Milan will serve out the remainder of Kugler's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026, after she resigned last Friday.

Speculation continues to swirl that Trump is hoping to nominate a ""shadow chair"" who would act in his interests on the Federal Reserve, including a push for sharply lower interest rates. Miran is a past critic of the Fed, specifically its aggressive stimulus actions during the Covid crisis.

US President Donald Trump plans to obtain exclusive US development rights to a strategic South Caucasus transit route during an upcoming meeting with the Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders at the White House, Reuters has reported, citing officials.

Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, have been locked in a decades-long territorial dispute over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh since the late 1980s. Baku regained control over the predominantly ethnic-Armenian-populated territory in 2023.

Trump has announced that Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will join him for a trilateral summit and sign a peace deal in the White House on Friday.

“The United States will also sign Bilateral Agreements with both Countries to pursue Economic opportunities,” he wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.

According to Reuters, the peace framework will include exclusive and long-lasting US development rights to a major transit corridor through the South Caucasus. It will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP), the agency wrote on Thursday, citing anonymous officials.

The TRIPP will be operated according to Armenian law, and the US will sublet the land to a consortium for management, Reuters said.

Baku previously proposed creating a Zangezur corridor through Armenia's Syunik Province to connect the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan – which borders Türkiye – to mainland Azerbaijan. Yerevan resisted the idea.

Last month, Spanish news outlet Periodista Digital reported that Armenia quietly agreed to hand over a strategic corridor on its territory to the US. Yerevan officially denied the report, calling it “an element of hybrid warfare and manipulative propaganda.”

Pashinyan has increasingly had to crack down on dissent back home, faced with protests sparked by the pro-Western leader's handover of key Armenian border villages to Baku, which many Armenians saw as a betrayal of national interests.

            The Trump administration notified shelter providers who care for unaccompanied migrant children this week that federal law enforcement agents will begin conducting in-person interviews of kids at shelters around the country, according to an internal notification obtained by CNN. 



            The notification, which has not been previously reported, marks an escalation in the administration's focus on migrant children who arrived unaccompanied at the southern border.
    


            In recent months, the Trump administration has targeted legal services for migrant kids in custody, made it more difficult for parents and guardians to retrieve their children from government custody, and directed federal agents to ask migrant teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country.
    


            While the administration says the interviews will be part of an ongoing effort to identify and root out potential criminal activity, immigrant and child advocates say the notification raises significant red flags and threatens to dismantle safeguards meant to protect migrant children.
    


            The internal notification received by providers this week refers to July guidance about an interagency federal team, which includes officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, that has been set up to identify, investigate and prosecute criminal activities relating to unaccompanied kids.
    


            But the notification is short on details, like how many children will be interviewed, for what purpose, and whether they will be able to have an attorney present. That's sparked concerns among immigrant advocates and experts who are now scrambling for answers ahead of the expected interviews.
    


Exclusive: Trump administration moves to rapidly deport migrant children, asking teens if they want to leave



            “It might cause harm (rather) than mitigate harm,” said Jennifer Podkul, chief of global advocacy for Kids in Need of Defense, a group that works with unaccompanied migrant minors. Podkul told CNN that she, along with other advocates and attorneys, already flag cases to federal law enforcement when concerns arise about trafficking or other criminal activities.
    


            “We're worried about what the kids understand or not,” Podkul said, referring to the blanket approach to interviews. For example, some of the children who may be questioned might include those placed into government custody after recent interior enforcement actions resulted in their parent or guardian being detained.
    


            President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration over its handling of migrant children and claimed (often without evidence) that many of those kids are in danger. That has served as the premise for the administration to launch an aggressive effort to pursue investigations of any potential criminal activity.
    


            Trump officials argue that hundreds of thousands of children went unaccounted for after being released into the US under former President Joe Biden. They've also expressed skepticism over the federal program designed to care for migrant children until they are placed with sponsors, who are generally parents or guardians already living in the United States.
    


            Former Biden officials refute that a large number of children are missing.

            Migrant children who arrive in the US alone are placed into the care of a federal agency within HHS known as the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which operates shelters nationwide to house kids until they can be released to a parent or guardian sponsor already residing in the United States.
    


            Sponsors are vetted prior to a child being released to their care. Trump administration officials argue, however, that sponsors weren't properly vetted amid the influx of minor arrivals.
    


            Processes have been in place to assess whether a child who's in government custody may be in danger or at risk. If necessary, cases are referred to law enforcement, which might include an interview with the child though it would likely happen off campus based on the circumstances.
    


            Currently, there are more than 2,000 children in the custody of ORR, according to federal data.
    


            Earlier this year, the Trump administration set up a makeshift “war room” in the HHS Washington, DC, headquarters to pore over sensitive data to track down migrant children and deploy federal authorities to the homes where children are residing after being released from custody. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is among the agencies involved in effort.
    


            In a statement to CNN, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “We are committed to working with our partners to identify criminal activities that threaten unaccompanied alien children to root out both trafficking and fraud.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security said that HHS has reviewed thousands of reports of unaccompanied children who, they argue, were ignored under the previous administration, generating investigative leads that the department is pursuing.
    


            “As of July 24, 2025, more than 59,000 of the backlogged reports have been analyzed and processed, resulting in more than 4,000 investigative leads, including fraud, human trafficking, and other criminal activity,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.
    


            “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families,” McLaughlin added.
    


            Advocates who work with migrant children maintain that their protection should be the priority, but against the backdrop of the administration's immigration crackdown, interviews with federal law enforcement could prove harmful without proper precautions.
    


            Since Trump returned to the White House, ICE agents have taken around 500 children into government custody, CNN previously reported, either because their situations were deemed unsafe or because of immigration enforcement actions against sponsors, the majority of whom are the kids' parents or other family members.
    


            The ORR has also implemented new guidelines that the agency describes as part of a broader effort to strengthen vetting of sponsors, who are usually family members of children. The guidelines require that staff meet with them in person before placing the kids, according to an email sent to staff and obtained by CNN.  



            But it also notes that federal law enforcement agencies “may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors,” the email states. The potential involvement of federal enforcement agencies could exacerbate the already present chilling effect among immigrant families, many of whom are undocumented and who have children in custody, experts say.

Israel's security cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to seize Gaza City, his office announced on X on Friday. The move could pave the way for a full takeover of the enclave, despite warnings that it could endanger hostages held by Hamas.

Netanyahu's office said the ministers endorsed five conditions to end the war: Hamas' disarmament, the return of all hostages, Gaza's demilitarization, Israeli security control, and a post-war civilian administration excluding both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.

Just hours earlier, Netanyahu told Fox News that his ultimate goal is full control of Gaza. While the statement on Friday did not mention this explicitly, a senior Israeli official told The Times of Israel that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is expected to advance into the remaining parts of Gaza after taking the city. Palestinians will reportedly have until October 7, 2025 to evacuate Gaza City before the IDF launches a ground assault.

The Security Cabinet has approved the Prime Minister's proposal for defeating Hamas.The IDF will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones.

Hamas denounced the plan on Thursday, calling Netanyahu a war criminal and describing his plan to seize Gaza as “an extension of his genocidal and displacement policies.” In a statement quoted by Press TV, the group urged the international community to intervene.

The conflict began with Hamas' October 2023 attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 50 remain in Gaza. Israel's response has killed at least 60,000 people – mostly civilians – over 21 months, according to the enclave's Health Ministry. A fragile three-stage ceasefire was agreed in January but collapsed in March. Talks have continued since, without a breakthrough.

Reports say Israel's hostage negotiation team warned the ministers against approving any move that could derail talks with Hamas. Netanyahu reportedly said the operation could be paused if Hamas accepts Israel's demands. IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir also opposed the plan, warning it would endanger the hostages and trigger a humanitarian crisis.

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the decision as “a disaster,” warning it would prolong the war, lead to more casualties among hostages and soldiers, and cause a political collapse.

LONDON, August 8. /TASS/. The Washington administration has no intention of recognizing the Palestinian state and deems it necessary to destroy the radical Hamas movement, Vice President JD Vance told British Foreign Minister David Lammy.

""We have no plans to recognize a Palestinian state. I don't know what it would mean to really recognize a Palestinian state given the lack of a functional government there,"" Vance said at a meeting at Lammy's country residence in the south of London.

Speaking about the possible recognition of Palestine by London, Vance noted: ""It's one of the things that we're to talk about. Obviously, the United Kingdom is going to make its decision. What the President has made very clear is our two goals are very simple right now, vis a vis the situation in Israel and Gaza. Number one, it's we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack innocent Israeli civilians ever again, and we think that has to come through the eradication of Hamas.

""Second, the President has been very moved by these terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. So, we want to make sure that we solve that problem.""

On July 29, London said it would recognize the Palestinian state at the September UN General Assembly session if Israel continued to obstruct the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip and did not end its military operation in the enclave.

On July 24, French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris would recognize the State of Palestine at the same UN General Assembly session in September.

The situation in the Middle East soured after Hamas militants penetrated into the Israeli territory on October 7, 2023 killing and kidnapping residents of the border settlements. Israel retaliated by a military operation in the enclave trying to destroy Hamas' military and political structures and free all the abductees. In March, Israel broke a January ceasefire with massive strikes on the enclave. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States flopped.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Legal group sues for records related to officials' correspondence about Epstein documents and about Epstein and Trump's relationship

An advocacy group sued the US justice department and the FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex-trafficking investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The legal organization Democracy Forward is seeking records related to senior administration officials' communication about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between Epstein and Donald Trump.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC appears to be the first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled.

“The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields records related to criminal investigations from public view.

The justice department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
 Democracy Forward has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump's Republican administration, challenging a wide range of its policies and the president's executive orders.

The case has been subject to heightened public focus since the justice department said last month it would not release additional documents from the case.

Meanwhile, top Trump officials reportedly met at the White House on Wednesday night to discuss strategy moving forward as the Trump administration continues to face criticism, including from Republicans, for its handling of the official files related to Epstein and the US president's responses to calls for the release of all documents related to the criminal investigation.

The meeting was reportedly hosted by JD Vance, with the gathering moved from the vice-president's official residence to the White House, according to reporting by CNN. The meeting had been billed to include top Trump officials, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel. Vance and his staff had denied that a meeting to discuss the handling of the rumbling Epstein scandal was taking place.

The Trump administration is now weighing whether to release recorded audio from the recent Department of Justice interview with Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

The meeting's main focus was expected to be the administration's handling of the Epstein case and the need for a unified response, CNN reported, also saying that Trump officials were weighing whether the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, should hold a press conference about his two in-person interviews with Maxwell in Florida earlier this month, before she was moved to a lower-security prison camp in Texas.

Maxwell has recently opposed the release of grand jury testimony from her case, which prosecutors have sought after the justice department faced criticism after stating it had no further Epstein files even as the attorney general, Pam Bondi, had promoted the documents the department had. Maxwell is serving 20 years for sex-trafficking offenses after years as Epstein's sidekick and has appealed to the US supreme court to overturn her case. She was convicted in New York after going to trial, while Epstein died in custody in New York while awaiting trial.

The Department of Justice was given until noon on Friday to address privacy concerns from victims and Maxwell about the release of the testimony.

The House oversight committee subpoenaed the Department of Justice on Tuesday for files in the case after Republicans in the House blocked efforts by Democrats to force the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files.

Victims of Epstein and Maxwell have written letters to federal judges criticizing the Department of Justice's approach to the case and it meetings with Maxwell. They largely have supported releasing the grand jury testimony as long as they were allowed to review the information and have sensitive information redacted.

Speaking at her regular marathon morning news conference Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum offered pithy comments on her meeting the previous day with Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand.

She was responding to a softball question about all her recent meetings at the National Palace – with the Canadian ministers, visiting Walmart executives and synchronized swimmers and divers returning from the world championships.

Ms. Sheinbaum spoke of wanting to improve relations with Canada, promote investment and have Prime Minister Mark Carney visit Mexico. She then mentioned Canadian mining companies – an old bugaboo for her political base.

“We also talked about mining companies … and the need for them to comply with all the requirements imposed by environmental impact statements,” she said before changing the subject to the synchronized swimmers and divers.

The brevity of Ms. Sheinbaum's comments regarding the Canadian delegation underscored Canada's low profile in Mexico, where foreign relations work focuses heavily on the United States and, increasingly under the ruling Morena party, spats with other Latin American governments in defence of leftist allies. 

But it also demonstrated her control of the national agenda, as she alone speaks for the country – with little accountability and no rejoinders from state governors or business leaders. Comments from opposition politicians are rebuked as unpatriotic, and Mexican media rarely press the President with tough questions.

Ms. Sheinbaum boasts a 75-per-cent approval rating, according to newspaper El Financiero, while Morena and its allies hold supermajorities in Congress and control of most of the state governments.

Her domestic political strength and dominance over the media landscape provide leeway for dealing with U.S President Donald Trump and making steep concessions without drawing a sharp outcry.

“The fundamental difference” with Canada “is that President Sheinbaum can say whatever she wants publicly because there is no one in Mexico who will demand comments that correspond with the facts,” said Carlos Heredia, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, a Mexico City university.

Ms. Sheinbaum addresses Mexico through her morning news conferences, where simple questions from pro-government influencers are the norm. The mañanera, as the presser is colloquially known, sets the news cycle for the day, as her comments are repeated throughout Mexican media. 

She has used it to shape the narrative on Mexico's response to Mr. Trump's tariff threats, picking her retorts carefully – such as pointing to the stream of smuggled U.S. guns causing mayhem in Mexico. She often downplays negative news with pledges of co-ordination and co-operation, all the while insisting that “Mexico is respected.” 

There are even attempts to find common ground with Mr. Trump, such as populist politics. “I think he respects us and we respect him for what we are: neighbours elected by our peoples,” she said July 31 after Mexico received a 90-day postponement of 30-per-cent tariffs. 

Opinion: On tariffs, Trump is the opposite of unpredictable

Left unsaid: the concessions made by Mexico and the increasingly heavy ask being made by Mr. Trump, who has accused Mexico of giving drug cartels free rein.

“We continue to bend the knee and everything, or most of the things that Trump is asking for, the Mexican government is more or less delivering,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador in Washington.

“I don't think a Canadian prime minister could do that. They just wouldn't have the political capital or a population willing to do that,” he added. “The leeway that she has to do what she's doing with Trump is basically predicated by domestic Mexican politics.”

For their part, Mr. Champagne and Ms. Anand held a virtual news conference for the parliamentary press gallery after their first day of meetings in Mexico City. They spoke of rekindling relations with Mexico, deepening business ties and strengthening supply chains. But they dodged questions about how Mexico got a 90-day deferment. 

Ms. Sheinbaum described the reprieve as “a very advantageous condition for Mexico compared to any other country.” 

She has received plaudits for deftly handling Mr. Trump by keeping a “cool head.” But she routinely acquiesces to U.S. demands. She won a 30-day tariff reprieve in February after agreeing to send 10,000 soldiers to the northern border – ostensibly to stop the smuggling of illegal fentanyl.

Mexico has stopped thousands of migrants from transiting the country toward the U.S. border – actions recognized by Mr. Trump. The country also handed over 29 drug cartel bosses to U.S. justice officials and cracked down on fentanyl labs. And unlike Canada, Mexico has not imposed countervailing tariffs on U.S. goods.

“She can do as she pleases, but she also knows there is lots of dirt in the Mexico file,” said Rodolfo Soriano-Núñez, a Mexican sociologist.

Her willingness to acquiesce will be tested after Mr. Trump secretly signed a directive to use military force against the cartels his administration has designated as terror organizations, according to The New York Times. 

Tony Keller: What does Donald Trump want from Canada? We are about to find out

“We co-operate, we collaborate, but an invasion is not going to happen. … It's absolutely out of the question,” Ms. Sheinbaum said Friday in response to story. “When they've raised the issue, we've always said no.”

“Canada's strategy is ‘elbows up.' And if we had to summarize Mexico's strategy, it's ‘live to fight another day,'” said Luis Antonio Espino, a Mexican political analyst based in Toronto. “The bar for Sheinbaum is very low, and for Carney it's very high.”

Ms. Sheinbaum has received a boost from domestic factors, too, such as social programs that provide seniors, single mothers and students with cash stipends of roughly $455 every two months.

The Mexican economy has slumped in 2025. But Mr. Trump's trade war has weakened the U.S. dollar and correspondingly strengthened the Mexican peso. “The peso is climbing, and they think everything is going well,” Mr. Espino said. 

Why ‘elbows up' is Canada's rallying cry in the trade war against Trump's tariffs

Polls show deep Mexican disapproval of Mr. Trump. El Financiero put the figure at 86 per cent, according to a July survey. Just 29 per cent of Mexicans now view the U.S. favourably, down from 51 per cent six months earlier.

Analysts describe Mexicans as holding clear-eyed views of the United States. They never considered Americans to be close friends, have grown accustomed to receiving threats from U.S. leaders and remember being invaded twice by U.S. soldiers – losing half their territory in the Mexican-American War.

“The average Mexican senses the President can do very little and sees Donald Trump as a gringo doing what gringos have always done. But he does this very openly and rudely,” Mr. Espino said. “Mexico obviously can't negotiate much,” he added. But for many Mexicans, “if the President manages another 90 days without much interfering in Mexico and the peso remains stable … there's no real crisis.”

JD Vance will spend his British holiday at a Grade II-listed manor house in the Cotswolds.

The vice-president is to stay in a country home in Oxfordshire, surrounded by members of the “Chipping Norton set”.

The house has six acres of land, two cellars, a tennis court, a rose garden, a basement gym and a Georgian orangery.

Secret service agents have already arrived to prepare it for Mr Vance's arrival, after he finishes a weekend stay with David Lammy at Chevening, the Foreign Secretary's grace-and-favour home in Kent.

The two politicians will hold a formal meeting before being joined by their families at the Grade I-listed residence. The home is reserved for high-level bilateral meetings and personal guests of Mr Lammy.

Mr Vance, whose wife Usha attended the University of Cambridge for a master's degree in early modern history, has built a close relationship with Mr Lammy since their meetings on Capitol Hill before last year's election.

But the trip also comes at a more fraught time in relations between the UK and US on some issues, after State Department officials and congressional Republicans voiced concerns about free speech in Britain.

Their warnings came after The Telegraph revealed that a Whitehall “spy” unit had reported critics of asylum hotels to social media companies.

Mr Vance singled out the UK and some European countries in February in a speech about freedom of expression. He said the “basic liberties of religious Britons in particular” were under threat.

The Telegraph understands that Mr Vance will leave Chevening and travel to the Cotswolds, where a makeshift helipad has already been cut into a local field. Nearby townsfolk are bracing themselves for the arrival of the US vice-president.

“You'll probably hear him first – he'll likely turn up in a tank, or in a helicopter like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now,” one resident told The Telegraph.

In March, Mr Vance was forced to cut a Vermont family ski trip short after crowds turned out to protest a day after he and Donald Trump had ambushed Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. When he visited Rome the following month, the Colosseum was closed early to accommodate his family's arrival, infuriating tourists.

The vice-president is expected to arrive in London with his wife and children Ewan, eight, Vivek, five, and Mirabel, three. The family are also expected to visit Hampton Court Palace before their stay in the Cotswolds.

The manor in which he is staying is said to have been built in around 1702 for Thomas Rowney, one of the Oxford MPs. It was bought by Johnny and Pippa Hornby in 2017.

Mr Hornby, an Oxford graduate, has served as the CEO of Luceco, a lighting and electricals firm, for 20 years. Mrs Hornby is a keen gardener and has advertised their home for horticulturalists to visit.

The country house is near Diddly Squat farm, owned by Jeremy Clarkson, who has previously criticised Mr Vance and called him a “bearded God-botherer” over his opposition to abortion.

After the US vice-president called the UK “some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, the former Top Gear presenter responded in his Sunday Times column: “I've searched for the right word to describe him, and I think it's ‘t---'. He also has no clue about history.”

When The Telegraph visited the manor, there were crates of Blenheim Palace sparkling and natural water at the ready.

But neighbours have kept quiet, with one saying: “I know why you have come here, but I am not interested in chatting.” Asked about Mr Vance's potential visit, another said: “Who's that?”

Hilda Reed, a former teacher, said: “I think he is devious, a bully, self-interested,” she added: “It is the association you won't want. We don't want that kind of person.”

The Cotswolds has been described as the “Hamptons of the UK”, offering refuge to runaway Americans such as Ellen DeGeneres and hosting Steve Jobs's daughter's multi million-pound wedding.

Father Fergus Butler-Gallie told The Telegraph: “People are bemused by the level of attention we have had this summer.

“Kamala Harris was [here] last week.”

He said visitors were always welcome and it was lovely that people wished to “come and share this beautiful part of the world with us”, but added: “It is a real place where real people live. It is not a chocolate box. It is not Disneyland.”

Father Butler-Gallie said Mr Vance was angry about Britain in a way he was not with other European countries, adding: “He sees all of the news about London, that it's expensive, violent, dirty – he is getting that fed to him. But there is also his Hillbilly Elegy side – informed by his roots, he has a romanticised view of Old England.”

A Canadian-American, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would not be putting out the bunting for Mr Vance's arrival.

“The general feeling is that people aren't keen,” she said. “I am amazed and disappointed by the state of our leaders. Just stay at home and do something useful.”

Another resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said the area had a strong heritage of voting liberal. “I don't think anyone wants him here,” she added. “You just don't want that bully here.“

            An Australian woman who murdered three of her in-laws with a meal of toxic mushrooms also allegedly tried to murder her husband using poisoned pasta, a chicken curry and a sandwich wrap, evidence showed on Friday after a judge allowed its disclosure.
    


            A jury last month found Erin Patterson lured her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Don Patterson and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, to lunch at her home and poisoned them with servings of Beef Wellington that contained death cap mushrooms.
    


            They also found the 50-year-old guilty of the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband, who survived the 2023 meal at Erin Patterson's home in Leongatha, a town of about 6,000 people some 135 km (84 miles) southeast of Melbourne.
    


            Patterson was initially charged with three counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder in 2023, with the four additional counts relating to her estranged husband, Simon Patterson.
    


            Justice Christopher Beale previously ruled the charges should be split into two separate trials, before the prosecution dropped the attempted murder charges relating to Simon Patterson on the eve of the first trial.
    


            That meant details of the alleged attempts on her husband's life in 2021 and 2022 were never heard by the jury.
    


            “After the first time I got sick, I had the idea I got sick from Erin's food,” Simon Patterson told a pre-trial hearing in Melbourne in October 2024.
    


            He eventually began keeping a spreadsheet of his illnesses that the court heard all happened after eating his estranged wife's cooking, including a penne bolognese, a chicken curry and a sandwich wrap.
    


            The alleged poisonings, on two camping trips and a walk, left him close to death, and he became so ill he was temporarily paralyzed and had part of his bowel removed, the court heard at the time.
    


            In each case, doctors were unable to conclusively determine the cause of his illnesses.
    


            Simon Patterson raised his suspicions with his doctor and with his family, including his father Don, who died at the lunch.
    


            Don Patterson was so certain he had been poisoned at the July 2023 lunch he arrived at hospital with a container of his own vomit for medical professionals to test.
    


            Evidence from a computer seized from Patterson's home showing searches for other kinds of poisons was also excluded from the trial.
    


            After Patterson was found guilty last month, Justice Beale ordered the suppression of the pre-trial material to protect Patterson's appeal rights.
    


            But on Friday he ordered the restrictions be lifted, rejecting an argument by her defense team, who said that the release of the material combined with intense media interest would jeopardize any potential of an appeal.
    


            “Open justice is a fundamental concern of our criminal justice jurisdiction,” Beale said on Friday.
    


            Patterson has 28 days from the as-yet-unknown date of her sentencing to appeal, though she has not indicated whether she will do so.
    


‘Mushroom murder' trial: Jury finds Australian woman deliberately killed lunch guests with poisoned Beef Wellington



            Any appeal by Patterson was unlikely to succeed, though it could not be ruled out, Beale said on Friday.
    


            Patterson maintained her innocence throughout the case that has gripped Australia, with her defense calling the deaths a “terrible accident.” She pleaded not guilty to the counts of attempted murder against her husband.
    


            The court will next hear the case on August 25, the first of a two-day plea hearing where victim impact statements will be read.

CHICAGO (AP) — James Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13 who helped turn a failed moon mission into a triumph of on-the-fly can-do engineering, has died. He was 97.

Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois, NASA said in a statement on Friday.

“Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,” NASA said. “We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.”

One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth.

In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. They could not land, but they put the U.S. ahead of the Soviets in the space race. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968.




But the big rescue mission was still to come. That was during the harrowing Apollo 13 flight in April 1970. Lovell was supposed to be the fifth man to walk on the moon. But Apollo 13's service module, carrying Lovell and two others, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. The astronauts barely survived, spending four cold and clammy days in the cramped lunar module as a lifeboat.

''The thing that I want most people to remember is (that) in some sense it was very much of a success,'' Lovell said during a 1994 interview. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.''

A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him.

“I don't worry about crises any longer,” he said in 1999. Whenever he has a problem, “I say, ‘I could have been gone back in 1970. I'm still here. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises.”

And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie “Apollo 13” brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame — thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting “Houston, we have a problem,” a phrase he didn't exactly utter.

Lovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn't display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. He called Lovell “a very personable, very down-to-earth type of person, who says ‘This is what I do. Yes, there's risk involved. I measure risk.'”

In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds.

Aboard Apollo 8, Lovell described the oceans and land masses of Earth. “What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not,” he remarked.

That mission may be as important as the historic Apollo 11 moon landing, a flight made possible by Apollo 8, Launius said.

“I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program,” Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said.

But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission — immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell — that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut.

The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth.

That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn't have solutions to get home.”

“We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA's historian.

Four-fifths of the way to the moon, NASA scrapped the mission. Suddenly, their only goal was to survive.

Lovell's “Houston, we've had a problem,” a variation of a comment Swigert had radioed moments before, became famous. In Hanks' version, it became “Houston, we have a problem.”

What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission.

With Lovell commanding the spacecraft, Kranz led hundreds of flight controllers and engineers in a furious rescue plan.

The plan involved the astronauts moving from the service module, which was hemorrhaging oxygen, into the cramped, dark and frigid lunar lander while they rationed their dwindling oxygen, water and electricity. Using the lunar module as a lifeboat, they swung around the moon, aimed for Earth and raced home.

By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier.

“They demonstrated to the world they could handle truly horrific problems and bring them back alive,” said Launius.

The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon “is my one regret,” Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission.

President Bill Clinton agreed when he awarded Lovell the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1995. “While you may have lost the moon ... you gained something that is far more important perhaps: the abiding respect and gratitude of the American people,” he said.

Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, “The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction.”

And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal.

“Going to the moon, if everything works right, it's like following a cookbook. It's not that big a deal,” he told the AP in 2004. “If something goes wrong, that's what separates the men from the boys.”

James A. Lovell was born March 25, 1928, in Cleveland. He attended the University of Wisconsin before transferring to the U.S. Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Maryland. On the day he graduated in 1952, he and his wife, Marilyn, were married.

A test pilot at the Navy Test Center in Patuxent River, Maryland, Lovell was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1962. He was the last of that second group of astronauts -- called “the Next Nine” — alive and thus had been an astronaut longer than any other person alive. 

Lovell retired from the Navy and from the space program in 1973, and went into private business. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote “Lost Moon,” the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film “Apollo 13.” In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

He and his family ran a now-closed restaurant in suburban Chicago, Lovell's of Lake Forest.

His wife, Marilynn, died in 2023. Survivors include four children.

In a statement, his family hailed him as their “hero.”

“We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible,” his family said. “He was truly one of a kind.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A legal organization challenging President Donald Trump's administration on multiple fronts filed a new lawsuit on Friday seeking the release of records detailing the handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

The group Democracy Forward sued the Justice Department and the FBI for senior administration officials' communication about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between him and Trump. 

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, appears to the be first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled.

“The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields records related to criminal investigations from public view.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Democracy Forward has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump's Republican administration, challenging policies and executive orders in areas including education, immigration and health care.

The Epstein case has been subject to heightened public focus since the Justice Department said last month it would not release additional documents from the case, despite assurance from Attorney General Pam Bondi.




The decision sparked frustration and anger among online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump's base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.

The Trump administration has sought to unseal grand jury transcripts, though that has been denied by a judge in Florida. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public.

A similar request for the work of a different grand jury is pending in New York.

The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials.

Since Epstein's 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on the wealthy financier and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls. 

Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and says he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department's decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation. But lawmakers from both major political parties have refused to let it go.

CINCINNATI, OH: Police have released new body camera footage showing the moments officers responded to the viral downtown Cincinnati beating that left six people injured and led to six arrests. 

Fox News Digital is reviewing the footage, which was released by authorities Friday. 

The update comes the same day all six individuals arrested in connection with the viral beating in downtown Cincinnati have been indicted by a grand jury and are facing additional charges.

Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.

""What I saw on video is not the Cincinnati I know and love,"" Hamilton County Prosecutor Connie Pillich said. ""These charges hold those involved in the attack accountable.""

The update comes nearly two weeks after a bystander video showing the brutal beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets went viral, sparking national outrage and forcing local leaders to answer for the beating that broke out around 3 a.m. on July 26.

Witness video obtained by Fox News Digital shows a man repeatedly yelling racial slurs at a group before being violently thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly. 

""I saw a little ruckus going on, saw people kind of scuffling, so kind of zoomed in, and once my phone kind of focused in, I saw the so-called victims being pretty aggressive toward the group of people that were already standing out there,"" witness Jay Black told Fox News Digital.

Black added that he watched the man get knocked to the ground, before getting up and start fighting again.

""Once he got up, you know people were kind of backing off of him, but he was kind of still going at people, you know, and using racial slurs,"" Black said. 

He told Fox News Digital that ""contrary to what people think,"" there were actually ""a lot of people"" trying to break up the fight.

The fight ignited a national firestorm as local leaders were left to answer for the apparent lack of police presence in the downtown area when the fight occurred after it was revealed that only 11 officers were stationed downtown the night of the brawl.

In a press conference held last week, Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge revealed that, of the approximately 100 individuals present on the street corner at the time of the fight, only one person called 911.

""That is unacceptable to not call the police,"" Theetge said. ""Traffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn't people call us?""

One of the victims in the attack, Holly, can be seen in additional footage being violently slammed to the ground and knocked unconscious as she tried to split up the fight. 

""I remember being afraid, terrified,"" Holly told Fox News Digital. ""I just remember my life flashing before my eyes, and all I can think is, ‘Dear God, I hope my children know that I love them.'""

Holly revealed the horrific fight left her with brain damage and life-altering injuries, including a severe concussion. 

""I'm having someone help take care of me financially, mentally and physically,"" Holly said. ""It's very humbling, it's very embarrassing to not be able to just be able to hang out by myself. I think that's the scary part, to not know just how deep the damage is going to be."" 

Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval also weighed in on the violence that lit up social media at a press conference last week.

""This was an awful incident, and our law enforcement has been working quickly and effectively to bring all responsible to justice,"" he said while standing alongside other city officials and leaders. ""Let me be clear, there is no place for violent crime in Cincinnati, whether it's a fight or gun violence. We will pursue those responsible and we will hold them accountable no matter who they are.""

However, Pureval has since come under fire for his handling of the city's law enforcement, with mayoral challenger Cory Bowman, who is also Vice President JD Vance's half-brother, slamming city leadership for what he believes is relaxed bail policies allowing violent offenders back on the streets.

""There are things from City Hall that are showing that the police are not supported the way they need to,"" Bowman told Fox News Digital. ""They are unable to do their jobs because they've been told time and time again that they have to use restraint in certain things instead of enforcing the law. They're told to dial back, and then what happens is that we have prosecutors and judges that have a catch-and-release system.""

In a previous statement, Council Member Anna Albi also condemned the brutal beating, while vowing to support the community's police force. 

""Under no circumstances is it ever acceptable to condone such awful violence,"" Albi said. ""Our greatest responsibility as elected officials and city leaders is to ensure the safety of our community. That is why this City Council continues to invest in supporting and growing our police force while simultaneously investing in social services to foster safe and healthy communities.""

If convicted, the suspects face the possibility of 29.5 years in prison.

Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who this week left the GOP and became a Democrat, sits for a national exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

EXCLUSIVE – Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan says President Donald Trump's social media attacks criticizing his move from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party validates his major switch in political affiliations.

""Failed former Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser,"" Trump wrote early Friday on his Truth Social platform.

The president charged that Duncan was ""never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn't want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I'm told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff. You don't even have a chance!!!""

Asked about the criticisms, Duncan told Fox News Digital in an exclusive national interview hours later, ""I think he's making my case for me that the Republican Party no longer wants to love their neighbor. There's nothing in that tweet or Truth Social post or whatever that shows any sort of attitude that I want to be a part of.""

""So I wish him the best of luck. I hope he figures out how to run this country better than he is now for the next couple of years. But I'm proud to not be a Republican, especially with him at the tip of the spear,"" Duncan highlighted.

In announcing his decision, Duncan cited several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, including health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and poverty.

He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to ""love my neighbor"" is through public policy. 

Duncan told Fox News, ""I find it easier to love my neighbor as a Democrat It's not a perfect landing spot, but it gives me a better opportunity each day when I wake up to love my neighbor.""

GEORGIA GOP EXPELS FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN FROM PARTY, CITING ALLEGED DISLOYALTY

Duncan, a former health care executive and minor league baseball player, served in Georgia's legislature for four years before running and winning election as lieutenant governor in 2018. He decided against seeking re-election in 2022.

After leaving office, Duncan – who was a vocal GOP critic of Trump's repeated efforts to reverse his razor-thin November 2020 election defeat in battleground Georgia to former President Joe Biden – worked towards what he said was ""healing and rebuilding a Republican Party that is damaged but not destroyed.""

Duncan endorsed Biden in the 2024 presidential race and later supported Vice President Kamala Harris after she replaced Biden at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket. Duncan spoke in a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last August.

The Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the GOP earlier this year.

""Neither party is hitting it out of the park. You don't have to look any further than the stats to see that Republicans have their issues. Democrats certainly have their issues,"" Duncan told Fox News. ""I've tried this reform thing before on the Republican side, and Donald Trump has sucked the life and future out of the Republican Party, in my opinion.""

Duncan's old boss, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, is term-limited and cannot seek re-election next year. Duncan confirmed to Fox News that he's considering a 2026 run for governor.

""My family and I are certainly not ready to make that big of a decision right here, right now. But it is something that we're considering for sure. I mean, my phone has continued to ring for months on end, from Democrats, independents and even some folks on the right that want us to consider this,"" Duncan said.

Asked about his timetable, Duncan said ""2026 is coming like a freight train. And certainly, if this is a decision that we go forward with, it'll have to be within, within a few months.""

Duncan emphasized that ""if Democrats, especially in Georgia, want to be successful, they're going to have to live in the middle and not the fringes. They're going to have to have a moderate slate of candidates that are able to use common sense to provide their leadership. And I think there's a gravitational pull in that direction.""

Nearly half-a-dozen Democrats in Georgia have already launched gubernatorial campaigns, including former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who later worked in the Biden administration.

Pointing to the two leading Republicans running for governor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr, Duncan said ""I hope we're able to sit back and find a Democratic candidate that can win the governorship and not allow a governor Trump to show up for four years in the state, because that's exactly what's going to happen.""

""The Republican slate is going to be dominated by whoever Donald Trump endorses, and that person is going to be a sock puppet for Donald Trump,"" Duncan argued. ""And no Georgian wants that. No Georgian wants the inconsistencies of Donald Trump to manage how their kids are educated, how their streets are kept safe and how government interacts with those that need it the most.""

Looking ahead to next year's elections, when Georgia will once again be in the national spotlight, Duncan said ""Georgia is going to continue to be the political center of the universe, as we watch the Senate race shape up. As we watch this governor's race shape up. I do think Georgia has an opportunity to lead the rest of the country, and I hope we take advantage of that.""

The White House celebrated a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday, bringing the two countries' leaders to Washington for a summit led by President Donald Trump.

“I look forward to hosting the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, and the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, at the White House for a Historic Peace Summit,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “These two Nations have been at War for many years, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people.”

Trump will meet with the leaders of both nations, which are located in the South Caucasus region at the border between eastern Europe and western Asia, this afternoon at the White House to sign a peace agreement.

“Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,'” the president boasted on his social media site. “My Administration has been engaged with both sides for quite some time.”

As with other Trump deals, the agreement has a trade element, and he says it will benefit the people of both nations and the United States.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in conflict for decades, and Trump hopes to end it through increased economic cooperation, both with each other and with the West. Transportation corridors through both countries have been closed due to the conflict since the 1990s, and reopening them could provide better opportunities to circumvent trading with Russia and Iran, Trump administration officials told reporters on a Friday morning call.

The reopened corridor would be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.

“The two neighbors have been in conflict for decades, over 35 years, with countless lives lost and generations scarred,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said. “While many have tried, including [former President] Joe Biden, only President Trump, the peacemaker in chief, was able to successfully bring Armenia and Azerbaijan together to agree to a historic peace.”

The trade corridor could eventually feature oil and gas lines, a rail line, and fiber optic cables, according to the Associated Press. It is planned to be developed by private companies. Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff visited the region earlier this year to coordinate the deal.

Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia date back to at least the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, and continue today due to ethnic and religious differences among their populations. Most Armenians are Christian, whereas most Azerbaijanis are Muslim.

Still, Trump's team is confident those differences can be worked out, with trade serving as a bridge.

“By locking in this path to peace, we are unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade, transit, and energy flows,” Kelly said. “The president has yet again shown that we can move beyond long-standing conflicts of the past and move towards the future.”

When asked by a reporter if the agreement furthered the case that Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize, an administration official answered, “I don't think Trump needs outside affirmation,” and referenced a social media post saying it should be called the Trump Peace Prize as allies insist he has done more to advance peace than any Nobel Prize winner.

“What this will do for American businesses, and frankly, for energy resources across Europe, will be enormously powerful,” an administration official said. “The losers here are China, Russia, and Iran. The winners here are the West.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Federal agency U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has seen abysmal cooperation from Chicago police who have refused to turn over 92% of illegal immigrants in law enforcement custody due to its “sanctuary city” policy since President Donald Trump took office, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Friday that Chicago's refusal to let police work with ICE has led to virtually all illegal immigrants being released onto the streets after being arrested by local police for offenses in the community.

“In just the last seven months, ICE has issued over 1,664 detainers in Chicago alone,” Noem said during a press conference in the Chicago area Friday morning. “Unfortunately, Chicago and its leadership has only honored 8% of those.”

Sanctuary cities and states have policies that bar local and state police from handing over most illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities, where they will then go through deportation proceedings before an immigration judge.

“The elected leaders in this state of Illinois are ignoring the law. In fact, they're being obstructionists when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off their streets,” Noem said. “That includes Governor [JB] Pritzker, Mayor [Brandon] Johnson, and others who have worked so hard to protect these dangerous criminals. They'd rather be a sanctuary state and continue to put those individuals above American citizens.”

Noem pointed to four recent arrests that ICE made in Illinois communities, including a Mexican man who was previously convicted for predatory sexual criminal assault against a victim under 13 years old, a Polish man convicted of attempted murder and aggravated domestic battery, and a Micronesian national who was convicted for driving under the influence three times.

The press conference follows the Justice Department's Tuesday move of publishing a list of cities, counties, and states that identify as “sanctuary” zones or places where law enforcement will not turn over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. Illinois, Cook County, and Chicago were all listed.

SKEPTICISM MOUNTS AFTER DHS CLAIMS 1 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SELF-DEPORTED UNDER TRUMP

The Trump administration issued a sharp warning to the sanctuary jurisdictions, threatening further lawsuits from places that release suspected criminal or convicted illegal immigrants back onto the streets rather than transfer them to ICE.

ICE is a federal agency within the DHS and has been tasked by Trump with carrying out the “largest-ever” deportation operation in national history. To date, ICE has arrested and deported roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","How the Texas Standoff Will (Probably) End","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/texas-democrats-quorum-break-plan/683800/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 16:35:12 GMT","

Eventually, the Democrats will have to go home.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Texas state Democrats had been plotting their departure for weeks. But most weren't sure they were going—or where they were headed—until just before they boarded their plane. For a successful quorum break, the timing “has to be ripe,” State Representative Gina Hinojosa told me. “Like a melon at the grocery store.” On Sunday, she and dozens of her colleagues hopped on a chartered plane and flew to Chicago in an attempt to prevent Texas Republicans from redrawing the state's congressional maps. They don't seem to know how long they'll be there or when, exactly, they'll consider the job done. Perhaps, Hinojosa suggested, they can attract enough attention to the issue that Republicans will be shamed into abandoning the effort.

Shame, however, is not an emotion experienced by many politicians these days, least of all ones who answer to Donald Trump. The likeliest conclusion of this effort is that Republicans will get their wish, just as they did after a similar situation in 2021.

Right now, the Texas Democrats' quorum-break project appears to have two goals, one much more easily accomplished than the other. The first is to send a message; the gerrymandering attempt in Texas is a chance for Democrats nationwide to accuse Republicans of cheating, and to demonstrate a bit of the gumption their voters have been clamoring for. Because the party is effectively leaderless, now is a perfect moment for wannabe standard-bearers to soak up some of the limelight. Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, for example, has made a lot of speeches and trolled Republicans; so has New York Governor Kathy Hochul. And tonight, California Governor Gavin Newsom will host Hinojosa and other Texas Democrats in Sacramento for a press conference.

The second, more practical objective is to run down the clock. If Texas Democrats can stay out of state long enough, they could make it difficult for Republicans to implement the new district maps ahead of the first 2026 election deadlines. This goal is optimistic, experts I interviewed said. Living in a hotel for weeks is expensive, and resources will eventually dry up. Pressure is mounting from Republican leaders. “And there's a stamina factor at play that can't be avoided,” Brandon Rottinghaus, a political-science professor at the University of Houston, told me. It seems, he added, “inevitable that the new maps pass.”

State Democrats have only been on the run for five days in the Chicago area (as well as in New York and Massachusetts). The public is still interested, and Democrats have plenty of opportunities to shape the media narrative. “Democratic voters are paying attention,” Joshua Blank, the research director of the nonpartisan Texas Politics Project, told me. “Having something to rally around is very, very useful for them.” Republicans have not tried to deny that they're making a blatant power grab, though they argue that they're simply following the lead of Democrats in heavily gerrymandered states such as Illinois. “It's just unilateral disarmament if you don't match what Democrats have done on the other side,” Matt Mackowiak, a Texas Republican strategist who is working on Senator John Cornyn's reelection campaign, told me. (The difference is that in Texas, they're redrawing the maps five years early, rather than waiting for the census.)

But quorum breaks are, by nature, temporary. Eventually, the wayward lawmakers will go home. What matters is when. The candidate-filing deadline for the 2026 election is December 8, and the primary is in March, so theoretically, if lawmakers can stay out of state for multiple months, Republicans might run into legal problems getting their new map in place.

One problem with the run-down-the-clock strategy is that, in the past, Texas courts have simply postponed the state's primary while congressional maps were being litigated. (That delay likely contributed to Ted Cruz's 2012 Senate victory.) Another challenge is keeping up the political will; as time drags on, Texas voters will want their representatives to come home and do their job. Then, there are the logistical issues. A long quorum break means that Texas Democrats spend weeks or months living in a hotel, away from their families and racking up bills. Many of those state lawmakers have jobs outside politics—jobs that might not be well suited to working remotely from a hotel conference room. A few members brought small children with them to Chicago, Hinojosa told me, and some of those children will probably have to be back in school soon. “We've seen it before,” Rottinghaus said. “The biggest pull for members to come back isn't always the politics; it's most often the personal.”

When I asked Texas Representative Ana-María Rodríguez Ramos how long she was willing to stay in Chicago, she told me that she understands the burden this puts on families; her own daughter is recovering from a liver transplant. “Am I prepared for two weeks? Three weeks? What is the alternative?” she asked. “If this is a sacrifice that we need to make, then it's the sacrifice that has to be made.” But two or three weeks probably won't be enough. (It's possible, Rodríguez Ramos suggested, that the state's 11 Senate Democrats, who remain in-state, could take their own turn breaking quorum; only one chamber needs to do so to stop legislation from being passed.)

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's threats complicate the picture. This morning, he suggested that if Democrats “don't start showing up,” Republicans will add a few more GOP seats to the new map. He has promised to fine the runaway Democrats $500 each for every day that they're gone, and to go after any groups raising money for them. Abbott has also suggested that he'll kick the Democrats out of their seats in the legislature—although experts say he does not have the power to do so directly. Earlier this week, the state house issued civil-arrest warrants for the rogue Democrats, and yesterday, Cornyn announced that the FBI had agreed to “locate” them. Although FBI involvement might seem far-fetched, “there's very little that restricts” the agency, Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former FBI agent, told me. The bureau could share information with local law enforcement, he said.

A single one of these variables is not likely to shatter the Texas Democrats' resolve, but over time, the pressure adds up. After making headlines for a few weeks, Democrats will probably be squeezed dry, emotionally and financially. A few will return home, and then, eventually, they all will. The new GOP district map will pass, perhaps in a slightly altered form, and Republicans will have what they've been fighting for: a few more GOP congressional districts, perhaps just enough to preserve the party's narrow hold on the House of Representatives through what might be a tough midterm election.

But Texas Democrats aren't willing to entertain that possibility just yet. In Chicago, members are reassessing the situation each day, Hinojosa told me. To sum up the general attitude, she paraphrased former Texas Governor Ann Richards. “All we have is the here and now,” she said, “and if we play it right, it's all we need.” A more realistic view of the situation might be that Democrats are seizing the moment because they know it's fleeting.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Star Wars actor Gina Carano has settled her lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm after she was fired from the franchise's spin-off, ""The Mandalorian.""

Terms of the agreement were not made public.

Carano, who played Cara Dune in the Disney+ series, was fired in 2021 after she made comments comparing being a Republican in the US to being a Jew during the Holocaust. Lucasfilm condemned her comments in 2021 for ""denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities"".

In February 2024, the former mixed-martial arts fighter filed a lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm in California, alleging harassment and bullying as a result of sharing her conservative political beliefs on X and other social media.

Attorneys for Carano said Disney wrongfully terminated her and defamed her by mischaracterizing her questions and comments on ""various issues of the day, including such issues as Black Lives Matter, Covid lockdowns, election irregularities, and transgender pronouns.""

Lawyers for the actor said that Elon Musk's X was funding Carano's lawsuit against the companies.

In the lawsuit, the actor said she was wrongfully terminated and subject to sexual discrimination. She said that two of her male costars made similar social media posts and faced no penalty. She had sought $75,000 in damages and to be recast in the Star Wars series.

On Thursday, Carano shared the news of the settlement on X. She wrote: ""I hope this brings some healing to the force.""

""I want to extend my deepest most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, @elonmusk a man I've never met, who did this Good Samaritan deed for me in funding my lawsuit. Thank you Mr. Musk and @X for backing my case and asking for nothing in return,"" she added.

Disney, Lucasfilm, and representatives for Carano did not respond to requests for comment.

In a statement to Variety, a Lucasfilm representative said: ""Ms. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect. With this lawsuit concluded, we look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future.""

While most people were glued to OpenAI's newest AI model, GPT-5, during a demo Thursday, some couldn't help notice something had gone awry in the background.

Several charts included in OpenAI's GPT-5 livestream on Thursday had some clear mistakes.

One chart compared the models GPT-5 with thinking and OpenAI o3 on a metric called ""coding deception."" The former model has a deception rate of 50%, but this bar was less than half the size of the bar for o3, which has a smaller deception rate of 47.4%.

Another chart comparing models on a different metric depicted 69.1% and 30.8% with the same size bar. A bar for 52.8% was also larger than both of these, though that's smaller than 69.1%.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted, ""wow a mega chart screwup from us earlier.""

A marketing employee for OpenAI tweeted that the issue had been fixed in the blog post of the announcement, apologizing for the ""unintentional chart crime.""

Tech demos aren't immune to the occasional flub.

When Microsoft unveiled Bing's AI chatbot in 2023, it made several mistakes during its demo. When asked for pros and cons of a particular vacuum, it listed noisiness and a short cord as cons, but the vacuum is cordless. In an ad that same month, Google's AI chatbot Bard, which has since been renamed Gemini, gave an incorrect answer to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope.

It's unclear if AI was used to make the charts, and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump's Tariffs:

The Trump administration suggested it would issue a new policy clarifying that imports of gold bars shouldn't face tariffs, after a US government agency stunned traders by formally ruling that they'd be subject to duties.

The administration intends to post an executive order in the near future to clarify what it called misinformation about the tariffing of gold and other specialty products, a White House official told Bloomberg in a written statement. The official detailed the plans Friday on condition of anonymity. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Princeton University is expanding its financial aid program, announcing that most students from households making as much as $250,000 a year won't pay tuition starting this fall. 

Princeton also said families making $150,000 or less will have tuition and expenses covered. It's part of the school's plan to boost its overall financial aid spending for undergraduate students by about 16% to $327 million for the 2025-26 academic year, according to a statement.

Gold prices fell from a record high Friday after the White House said it will clarify ""misinformation"" about the precious metal facing tariffs.

""The White House intends to issue an executive order in the near future clarifying misinformation about the tariffing of gold bars and other specialty products,"" a White House official told CNBC.

Gold futures fell from an all-time closing high of $3,491.30 on the White House statement. The precious metal was last trading at $3,463.30.

The Swiss Precious Metals Association warned earlier Friday that U.S. tariffs ""may negatively impact the international flow  of physical gold.""

""We are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the U.S., a long-standing and historical partner for Switzerland,"" said Christoph Wild, president of the Swiss Precious Metals Association.

President Donald Trump has imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss exports to the U.S. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection apparently clarified this week that that 1 kilogram and 100 ounce gold bars are not excluded from the tariffs. Switzerland is the largest refiner of gold in the world.

""It must be noted that this clarification does not apply exclusively to Switzerland but to all 1kg and 100oz gold cast bars imported into the USA from any country,"" the Swiss Precious Metals Association said.

In this article

Shares of The Trade Desk plummeted almost 40% on Friday and headed for their worst day on record after the ad-tech company announced the departure of its CFO and analysts expressed concerns about rising competition from Amazon.

The Trade Desk, which went public in 2016, suffered its steepest prior drop in February, when the shares fell 33% on a revenue miss. In its second-quarter earnings report late Thursday, the company beat expectations on earnings and revenue, but the results failed to impress investors.

The Trade Desk, which specializes in providing technology to companies that want to target users across the web, said finance chief Laura Schenkein is leaving the job and being replaced by Alex Kayyal, who has been working as a partner at Lightspeed Ventures.

While some analysts were uneasy about the sudden change in the top finance role, the bigger concern is Amazon's growing role in the online ad market, as well as the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on ad spending.

Amazon has emerged as a significant player in the digital advertising market in recent years, and is now third behind Google and Meta. Last week, Amazon reported a 23% increase in ad revenue for the second quarter to $15.7 billion, which beat estimates.

Amazon's ad business has largely been tied to its own platforms, with brands paying up so they can get discovered on the sprawling marketplace. However, Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), which allows brands to programmatically place ads across a wider swath of internet properties, is gaining more resonance in the market.

""Amazon is now unlocking access to traditionally exclusive 'premium' ad inventory across the open internet, validating the strength of its DSP and suggesting The Trade Desk's value proposition could erode over time,"" Wedbush analysts wrote on Friday.

The Wedbush analysts lowered their rating on The Trade Desk to the equivalent of hold from buy, and cited Amazon's recent ad integration with Disney as a sign of the company's aggressiveness.

Executives at The Trade Desk were asked about Amazon on the call, and responded by suggesting that the companies don't really compete, emphasizing that Amazon is conflicted because it will always prioritize its own properties.

""A scaled independent DSP like The Trade Desk becomes essential as we help advertisers buy across everything and that we have to do that without conflict or compromise,"" CEO Jeff Green said on the call. ""It is my understanding that Amazon nearly doubled the supply of Prime Video inventory in the recent months. That creates a number of conflicts.""

For the second quarter, The Trade Desk reported a 19% increase in year-over-year revenue to $694 million, topping the $685 million estimate, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of 41 cents beat estimates by a penny.

Looking to the third quarter, the Trump administration's tariffs were also a theme, as the company forecast revenue of at least $717 million, representing growth of 14% at minimum.

""From a macro standpoint, some of the world's largest brands are absolutely facing pressure and some amount of uncertainty,"" Green said. ""Some have to respond more than others to tariffs. Many are managing inflation worries and the related pricing that comes with that.""  

With Friday's slump, The Trade Desk shares are now down 53% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up about 9%. The Trade Desk was added to the S&P 500 in June.

U.S. gold futures hit a record high on Friday amid uncertainty over whether country-specific U.S. import tariffs would apply to the most commonly traded sizes of gold bars.

Spot prices, meanwhile, was little changed but remained on track for a weekly gain.

Washington may place the most widely traded gold bullion bars in the United States under country-specific import tariffs, according to a ruling on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service's website, which would be a major blow to global supply chains for the metal.

December U.S. gold futures rose 1.1% to $3,491.30 per ounce after hitting a record $3,534.10 earlier in the session, when the Financial Times first reported the news.

""Gold's panic ascent shows that even safe haven assets are not immune to the volatility unleashed in the confusion of the tariff age,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown. ""If there is follow through and no intervention, this could threaten New York's dominance in the gold futures market, given prices have risen sharply compared to other trading centers,"" she added.

The spread between U.S. gold futures and spot prices widened, and currently sits at $91. Spot gold steadied at $3,399.91 per ounce, but was up 1% for the week.

Analysts broadly noted that they are awaiting further clarity on the issue, adding that a U.S. tariff on gold deliveries could significantly affect Switzerland, given its status as the world's leading hub for gold refining and transit.

UBS noted that if the tariff sticks, it expects the premium between Comex futures and London ones to rise further, as will arbitrage opportunities between alternative refinery hubs.

Swiss goods are subject to U.S. import tariffs of 39%, and the country is continuing discussions with the United States about reducing the levies.

Some gold refineries, including a large Swiss entity, have paused deliveries of bullion to the United States due to uncertainty, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Elsewhere, spot silver was flat at $38.29, platinum fell 0.8% to $1,323.90 and palladium was down 1.4% at $1,134.94.

Key Points

XRP could technically flip Bitcoin, but it doesn't make sense to bet on it.

In crypto, few assets have a fan base as vocal as XRP's (XRP 7.46%). The coin was born to move money for the banking system, and today, a few of its backers dream of something even bigger, like unseating Bitcoin (BTC -0.40%) to become crypto's top dog. That prospect feels tantalizing in a 12-month period when XRP has grown by 487% while Bitcoin ""merely"" doubled.

But does the math, not to mention the market structure, leave any room for this flipping to happen?

As of Aug. 5, Bitcoin's market cap sits near $2.2 trillion, making XRP's $177 billion look tiny in comparison.

For XRP to flip Bitcoin, it would need to rise roughly 13x with Bitcoin standing still, which is very unlikely for crypto's biggest coin to do over any significant period of time. Even if Bitcoin's price were to fall 50%, XRP would still need a jump of between 6x and 7x, which is beyond the edge of what's believable.

Put another way, XRP would have to ingest about $2 trillion of net new capital while Bitcoin accrued zero in terms of new inflows.

For context, every spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. combined has attracted $19.2 billion in inflows so far in 2025. Pulling in vastly more than that, even over several years, would require institutional adoption of XRP on a scale that no crypto project has yet achieved or even approached.

Image source: Getty Images.

The supply side is tricky too. Unlike Bitcoin's hard-capped limit of 21 million coins, of which perhaps 20% are already lost forever, tightening the float even further, XRP's floating supply can and does expand gradually from the slow release of escrow-locked tokens controlled by Ripple.

Those unlocks are predictable and transparent, yet they still dilute investors unless demand rises faster. So, the bar to one-upping Bitcoin is even higher than it first appears.

There is, however, a very narrow and highly improbable scenario where XRP could catch up and surpass Bitcoin.

Assume that Ripple, the company that issues XRP, executes its technology development roadmap for the chain perfectly, and succeeds in getting institutional investors and financial institutions onboard in droves. That means the chain would be the go-to location for tokenized asset management, including private credit and stablecoin storage, not to mention trade settlement and on-demand liquidity for investment banks handling securities. The chain has made some headway in all of those activities so far, but for this scenario, it needs to win every single one, and likely completely.

Now imagine Bitcoin hitting rough seas at the same time. A combination of cybersecurity, environmental, technological, political, and social factors would need to coincide to bring it down.

Proof-of-work mining already draws some regulatory heat; Norway is weighing a temporary ban on new power-hungry Bitcoin mines. If the E.U. or another major bloc enacts similar restrictions, large asset managers might reconsider their Bitcoin allocations for environmental reasons. The same would be true if new capital gains laws pertaining specifically to crypto were passed worldwide.

Furthermore, if Bitcoin fails to become secure against quantum computing-derived threats, investors may seek safer and greener pastures where they can be more confident that their funds will be safe.

Suddenly, fresh money that once defaulted to Bitcoin could flow toward a greener, compliance-friendly alternative, like XRP. XRP's built-in payments rail would keep transaction fees low, reinforcing utility as volumes rise. In other words, if Bitcoin encounters its absolute worst-case scenario, and XRP experiences its wildest dreams coming true, XRP would have a (still not great) shot at flipping it.

But every link in that chain has to hold.

Bitcoin's scarcity narrative remains powerful, ETF ownership is sticky, and the network effect of being the reserve asset for crypto grows with each halving. To bet on XRP flipping Bitcoin, you must also bet that all of Bitcoin's advantages will erode faster than XRP's adoption exploding. It isn't likely.

Waiting for XRP to outrun Bitcoin is not wise.

The upside of betting on that outcome is enormous, but conditional on a string of low-probability events and major shifts, or even outright reversals, in current trends. A more balanced view is to treat XRP as a specialized play on cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization.

If those themes continue gaining momentum, and they probably will, XRP can continue to appreciate handsomely even while remaining a fraction of Bitcoin's heft.

Oops, something went wrong

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

SkyBridge Capital founder and leading cryptocurrency advocate Anthony Scaramucci endorsed the Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) network on Wednesday, suggesting it is on the verge of significant growth.

Scaramucci stated in an X post, “Avalanche has been building and its moment is coming,” indicating his firm support for the Layer-1 blockchain.

John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, Avalanche's lead developer, responded to the post with a saluting emoji.

Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.



Scaramucci cited a video from the Tokenized Asset Coalition in which Nahas discusses the concept of “purpose-built chains” for specific use cases.

Nahas highlighted how Avalanche is moving away from piling everything into single chains, instead focusing on the idea of ""Your business, your blockchain.""

Launched in 2020, Avalanche aims to provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It was dubbed an “Ethereum Killer” in its early days, although Ethereum has grown to be far larger in market value and decentralized finance.

One of Avalanche's key features is Subnets, which are interoperable networks within the ecosystem that can be tailored to specific use cases

Blockchain-powered telecom company World Mobile announced Friday that it has partnered with Indonesia's largest digital infrastructure provider, Protelindo, to launch a new stratospheric telecommunications platform aimed at expanding global connectivity.

The initiative, called World Mobile Stratospheric, utilizes high-altitude, hydrogen-powered aircraft to provide direct-to-handset connections via blockchain-based infrastructure.

The fixed-wing aircraft, developed in collaboration with a global aerospace leader, is designed to fly at altitudes of up to 20,000 meters. 

Field tests in the UK with BT, in Europe with Deutsche Telekom, and across the Middle East have demonstrated the aircraft's ability to support up to 500,000 simultaneous mobile connections.

The platform promises greater bandwidth, lower latency, and significantly reduced operating and environmental costs, up to 99% less environmental impact compared to conventional telecom deployments.

At the core of the project is World Mobile's blockchain token WMTX/USD, which underpins its decentralized sharing-economy model.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

CEO Micky Watkins emphasized the importance of this token-based infrastructure. ""By combining advanced aerospace technology with token-driven economics, we are building a network that connects more people, faster, and in a way that is economically and environmentally sustainable.""

Protelindo, whose telecom towers and fiber infrastructure cover Indonesia's archipelago, sees the technology as a leap forward for the region's underserved areas. 

A company spokesperson noted that World Mobile's model could dramatically improve access in remote regions.

While skepticism around blockchain remains in traditional telecom sectors, World Mobile is positioning itself as a viable alternative and complementary player, especially in markets like the United States, where connectivity remains uneven.

The aircraft's payload and endurance capabilities also open the door to additional applications beyond telecommunications, signaling broader use cases for blockchain-driven infrastructure in stratospheric operations.

 (Bloomberg) -- A major battle between crypto firms and traditional lenders over interest and bank charter applications is poised to be decided by regulators appointed by President Donald Trump, who has been a vocal supporter of digital currencies.  

 The Genius Act, which requires stablecoin issuers to formally register and hold dollar-for-dollar reserves, sets in motion a rule-writing process with US regulators that will determine what qualifies as generating interest on stablecoins and how far they can go in acting like a traditional bank. Trade groups, though, are already pushing back against attempts to grant bank charters to crypto firms and find workarounds for yield-generating stablecoins. 

 “There's a huge fight brewing between the banks and the nonbank stablecoin issuers,” said Caitlin Long, founder of Custodia Bank, a provider of digital-asset services. 

 During the first Trump administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sought to expand the services a trust bank can provide, with some saying it could include potentially making loans and settling payments.  

 This summer, crypto firms including Circle Internet Group Inc. and Ripple Labs Inc. have applied for national trust bank charters and the current slew of applications is now a test of that OCC interpretation. Some trade groups opposed the move in July, arguing that the OCC should not have made the determination without public comment and that the move is a “loophole” for trust banks to take advantage of the benefits of traditional banks without corresponding regulation. 

 “If the Applicants are successfully able to establish themselves as national trust banks that do not primarily provide fiduciary services, but instead provide traditional banking services like payments, then, as the Associations anticipated in 2021, other companies will follow, presenting material risk to the US banking and financial system,” the groups wrote in a July letter. 

 A spokesperson for the OCC declined to comment. 

 For crypto firms, these charters could provide a multitude of benefits, including no longer having to apply for licenses state-by-state to do business and a stronger degree of legitimacy. 

 “It's the momentum that we need as a country to push forward,” said Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple and president of the National Cryptocurrency Association. “It's a good thing for the Americans who already own crypto and for those who are crypto curious.” 

 The trust bank charter provides an avenue for crypto firms to better compete against banks that have long existed in the space, according to Long. 

 “If the OCC gives these trust charters rather than full bank charters, these banks will have ten to 15% of the capital requirements of being a fully-fledged bank and are not subject to all the regulations that apply to banks,” Long said. “If the OCC is basically back door slashing the capital requirements and the regulations on banks, why wouldn't the banks convert to trust companies instead of being a bank as well.” 

 For banks, the entrance of these firms into traditional finance is both an opportunity for collaboration and intense competition. Nathan McCauley, the head of Anchorage Digital, said traditional finance dramatically increased its outreach to his company and others in the run-up to the passage of the crypto legislation. Some of the nation's largest banks have since announced partnerships with digital asset firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Coinbase Global Inc. reaching a deal to directly link customers' bank accounts to their cryptocurrency wallets. 

 But the bank industry is also nervous about competing with the crypto industry, which has a different approach to innovation compared with traditional financial institutions. 

 “This is an industry that doesn't think it needs to wait for rules, unlike the banking industry,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, where she analyzes financial firms, including lenders. “Stablecoin issuers just go for it and that's going to unsettle the banks more than probably anything.” 

 Crypto firms are also looking at ways to generate fresh monetary benefits tied to stablecoins after the banking lobby successfully pushed for a ban on issuers providing interest to their customers under the Genius Act. The digital asset is primarily used by traders to get in and out of other cryptocurrencies, but is also increasingly used for payments. When that asset is not actively part of a payment, it sits in an account, and companies are now not allowed to offer users yield for depositing their tokens into yield-bearing accounts. 

 “Banks, and lawmakers who receive donations from banks, are very concerned that a yield-bearing stablecoin that blurs the line between savings vehicle and a payment vehicle makes it much less attractive to have a checking account,” said Zach Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. 

 Companies are now looking to expand stablecoin offerings as regulators begin the process of explicitly defining what interest looks like in the space and what is permissible for companies. 

 Recently, Circle announced a partnership with Binance for an off-exchange collateral where customers can park their money when they are not making a payment. The largest US crypto exchange, Coinbase, already offers a rewards program for certain consumers, which some in the banking industry argue could potentially be illegal under the no-interest provisions of the Genius Act. Coinbase disagrees, saying the program has been tailored to be in compliance with the law. 

 “The statutory language is vague and has room for exception, but that's when the fun starts,” Petrou said.

Coinbase (COIN) is rolling out decentralized exchange (DEX) trading inside its main app for customers across the U.S., with the exception of New York State, the company said Friday. The move is part of its broader ambition to turn the platform into an “everything app” for crypto.



The new feature will route trades on-chain through DEX aggregators such as 0x and 1inch, pulling liquidity from decentralized markets including Uniswap and Aerodrome, said Max Branzburg, Coinbase's vice president of product. By integrating DEX trading, Coinbase is giving users the ability to interact directly with blockchain-based liquidity pools without moving funds off-platform.



At launch, traders will be able to discover and swap an expanding list of Base-native tokens. That roster includes assets from Virtuals AI Agents, Reserve Protocol's decentralized tokenized funds (DTFs), SoSo Value's index tokens, as well as Auki Labs and Super Champs.



DEX trading appeals to some crypto users because it allows for self-custody and permissionless access. Instead of relying on a central exchange to match and settle orders, transactions are executed on the blockchain itself. For traders, this can mean access to a wider range of assets, faster listings for new tokens and, in some cases, lower fees. It also removes the need to trust an intermediary with holding funds — though it comes with its own risks, like exposure to smart contract bugs or volatile, thinly traded markets.



The update strengthens Coinbase's position as a gateway to both centralized and decentralized crypto markets. It also underscores the company's continued push to embed Web3 tools directly into its core platform, positioning it to capture users who want more control over how they trade and store digital assets.



The move follows the relative success of platforms like HyperLiquid, a decentralized derivatives exchange that has notched $11 billion in volume over the past month. It also gives users a non-custodial option to trade, essentially removing counterparty risk that came to the spotlight after FTX's momentous implosion in 2022.



Decentralized exchange volume has embarked on a notable uptrend throughout the recent bull market, data from DefiLlama shows that daily volume is at $12.8 billion, dwarfing Coinbase's total of $3.5 billion, while monthly DEX volume has surpassed $407 billion.

Correction (Aug 8, 17:20 UTC): An earlier version of this article stated that Centrifuge's assets will be available to trade at launch, which was incorrect.

Another Hong Kong company is adding crypto to its treasury, but it wants to do more than passively hold it.

IVD Medical Holdings has purchased $19 million (HK$149 million) of ether (ETH), positioning the asset at the center of its real-world asset tokenization strategy. 

The company is building ivd.xyz, a platform for tokenizing pharmaceutical intellectual property and other healthcare assets, which will run entirely on Ethereum smart contracts.

In a statement to CoinDesk, Chief Strategy Officer Gary Deng said Ethereum was chosen as the core asset because it is “the world's most mature smart contract platform” with “extremely high liquidity” and growing institutional recognition, pointing to the U.S. SEC's approval of a spot ETH ETF.

IVD plans to use ETH for on-chain ownership confirmation, automated revenue distribution, and compliance governance of tokenized assets. 

It will also serve as the settlement layer for the company's planned IVDD stablecoin, enabling cross-border transactions within Hong Kong and U.S. compliance frameworks. Revenue from RWA transactions will be automatically converted into ETH and deposited into the treasury.

IVD also intends to deploy ETH into staking, re-staking, and on-chain derivatives to boost returns and liquidity while adding downside protection. The move puts IVD alongside a small group of HKEX-listed companies with crypto treasuries, most of which favor bitcoin BTC$116,444.42. 

Boyaa Interactive (0434.HK) holds more than 3,100 BTC worth over US$300 million after converting nearly all of its ether to bitcoin. Meitu (1357.HK) bought about 31,000 ETH and 940 BTC in 2021 before exiting those positions. 

Other smaller bitcoin holders include Yuxing InfoTech (8005.HK) with 78 BTC, Moon Inc. (1723.HK) with 18.88 BTC, and Walnut Capital (0905.HK) with 10 BTC from a shareholder donation.

IVD's move was made as part of a broader partnership announcement with HashKey Group, which operates the Hong Kong-licensed HashKey exchange.

The Russian Coast's strongest earthquake since 1952 provided enough energy for six volcanoes adjacent to the Ring of Fire to spout off. Another could be imminent.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

One of the largest earthquakes recorded in modern-day history has seemingly set off a cluster of volcanoes in Russia, with six separate volcanoes near the Kamchatka Peninsula erupting since the late-July quake, and a seventh shows signs it might join the party. 

A July 30 earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 was the strongest earthquake off the coast of Russia since 1952, according to the Russia Academy of Sciences. The U.S. Geological Survey called it the sixth-largest earthquake ever recorded by modern seismic instruments, part of an active sequence of activity that saw 50 earthquakes with a 5.0 magnitude or larger in the 10 days leading to the July 30 event. 

That may have been enough to spur the activity of the six Ring of Fire-adjacent volcanoes in the area, Alexey Ozerov, member of the Russia Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told Russian state media according to ABC News. “We attribute the eruptions to the earthquake, which activated the magmatic foci and provided them with additional energy,” he says. This is the first time in roughly 300 years that this many volcanoes have set off at the same time in such tight proximity, with Ozerov adding that the event is an “extremely rare phenomenon that can be described as a parade of volcanic eruptions.”

The Krasheninnikov volcano, one of eight active volcanoes of the Kronotsky Reserve and about 150 miles from the earthquake's epicenter, according to Vsevolod Yakovlev, acting director of the reserve, hadn't shown a lava flow since 1463. It's now active. And it's showing a significant increase in the temperature on the Earth's surface in the area, Yakovlev said. 

Of the 29 active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Klyuchevskoy volcano has been one of the most prolific since the earthquake. The Kamchataka Volcanic Eruption Response Team has held an orange code alert for the volcanic activity with ash exploding over four miles high and a plume now extending 133 miles to the southeast while lava and ash continue to move. “As explosions up to [32,800 feet] could occur at any time,” the team warned, “ongoing activity could affect international and low-flying aircraft.” 

With no communities in the vicinity of any of the Ring of Fire volcanoes, there's no threat to humans at this point. 

The direct earthquake-to-eruption theory holds more weight when a volcano is already nearing activity, Harold Tobin, professor of seismology and geohazards at the University of Washington and director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, told NPR. “It is definitely an interesting coincidence … or not coincidence,” he said about Krasheninnikov. “It wouldn't have experienced really extreme shaking. Nonetheless, seismic waves that are passing through the Earth are certainly affecting underground systems like potentially magma that's in cracks in the rock inside a volcano.” 

It could have added up to an increased force in an eruption or, as Tobin said, “shake loose the system that then allows it to actually erupt.”

Paul Segall, geophysicist at Stanford University, told Live Science that “it is not unprecedented for a large subduction zone earthquake to trigger volcanic eruptions.” Citing a 9.5 magnitude quake in Chile in 1960, Segall said the earthquake could change the stress in the Earth's crust, making it easier for magma to rise. Shaking the magma can alter its movement. 

If that's the case, there's a lot of magma movement getting altered right now on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Consuming fewer calories is largely accepted as a way to improve health and lose weight, but a recently published study in Nature Metabolism points to a specific sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine as a key component in weight loss. In the study ""Cysteine depletion triggers adipose tissue thermogenesis and weight loss,"" researchers discovered that when study participants restricted their calorie intake, it resulted in reduced levels of cysteine in white fat.

Pennington Biomedical researchers Dr. Eric Ravussin and Dr. Krisztian Stadler contributed to the study in which they and colleagues examined cysteine and discovered that it triggered the transition of white fat cells to brown fat cells, which are a more active form of fat cells that burn energy to produce heat and maintain body temperature. When researchers restricted cysteine in animal models entirely, it drove high levels of weight loss and increased fat burning and browning of fat cells, further demonstrating cysteine's importance in metabolism.

""In addition to the dramatic weight loss and increase in fat burning resulting from the removal of cysteine, the amino acid is also central to redox balance and redox pathways in biology,"" said Dr. Stadler, who directs the Oxidative Stress and Disease laboratory at Pennington Biomedical. ""These results suggest future weight management strategies that might not rely exclusively on reducing caloric intake.""

The article is based on results from trials involving both human participants and animal models. For the human trials, researchers examined fat tissue samples taken from trial participants who had actively restricted calorie intake over a year. When examining the fat tissue samples, they looked for changes in the thousands of metabolites, which are compounds formed when the body breaks down food and stores energy. The exploration of these metabolites indicated a reduced level of cysteine.

""Reverse translation of a human caloric restriction trial identified a new player in energy metabolism,"" said Dr. Ravussin, who holds the Douglas L. Gordon Chair in Diabetes and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical and oversees its Human Translation Physiology Lab. ""Systemic cysteine depletion in mice causes weight loss with increased fat utilization and browning of adipocytes.""

The tissue samples came from participants in the CALERIE clinical trial, which recruited healthy young and middle-aged men and women who were instructed to reduce their calorie intake by an average of 14% over two years. With the reduction of cysteine, the participants also experienced subsequent weight loss, improved muscle health, and reduced inflammation.

In the animal models, researchers provided meals with reduced calories. This resulted in a 40% drop in body temperature, but regardless of the cellular stress, the animal models did not exhibit tissue damage, suggesting that protective systems may kick in when cysteine is low.

""Dr. Ravussin, Dr. Stadler, and their colleagues have made a remarkable discovery showing that cysteine regulates the transition from white to brown fat cells, opening new therapeutic avenues for treating obesity,"" said Dr. John Kirwan, Executive Director of Pennington Biomedical Research Center. ""I would like to congratulate this research team on uncovering this important metabolic mechanism that could eventually transform how we approach weight management interventions.""

Look inside a brain cell with Huntington's disease or ALS and you are likely to find RNA clumped together.

These solid-like clusters, thought to be irreversible, can act as sponges that soak up surrounding proteins key for brain health, contributing to neurological disorders.

How these harmful RNA clusters form in the first place has remained an open question.

Now, University at Buffalo researchers have not only uncovered that tiny droplets of protein and nucleic acids in cells contribute to the formation of RNA clusters but also demonstrated a way to prevent and disassemble the clusters.

Their findings, described in a study published recently in Nature Chemistry, uses an engineered strand of RNA known as an antisense oligonucleotide that can bind to RNA clusters and disperse them.

""It's fascinating to watch these clusters form over time inside dense, droplet-like mixtures of protein and RNA under the microscope. Just as striking, the clusters dissolve when antisense oligonucleotides pull the RNA aggregates apart,"" says the study's corresponding author, Priya Banerjee, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Physics, within the UB College of Arts and Sciences. ""What's exciting about this discovery is that we not only figured out how these clusters form but also found a way to break them apart.""

The work was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

How RNA clusters form

The study sheds new light on how RNA clusters form within biomolecular condensates.

Cells make these liquid-like droplets from RNA, DNA and proteins -- or a combination of all three. Banerjee's team has researched them extensively, investigating their role in both cellular function and disease, as well as their fundamental material properties that present new opportunities for synthetic biology applications.

The condensates are essentially used as hosts by repeat RNAs, disease-linked RNA molecules with abnormally long strands of repeated sequences. At an early timepoint, the repeat RNAs remain fully mixed inside these condensates, but as the condensates age, the RNA molecules start clumping together, creating an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell.

""Repeat RNAs are inherently sticky, but interestingly, they don't stick to each other just by themselves because they fold into stable 3D structures. They need the right environment to unfold and clump together, and the condensates provide that,"" says the study's first author, Tharun Selvam Mahendran, a PhD student in Banerjee's lab.

""Crucially, we also found that the solid-like repeat RNA clusters persist even after the host condensate dissolves,"" Mahendran adds. ""This persistence is partly why the clusters are thought to be irreversible.""

Preventing -- and reversing -- clusters

The team was first able to demonstrate that repeat RNA clustering can be prevented by using an RNA-binding protein known as G3Bp1 that is present in cells.

""The RNA clusters come about from the RNA strands sticking together, but if you introduce another sticky element into the condensate, like G3BP1, then the interactions between the RNAs are frustrated and clusters stop forming,"" Banerjee says. ""It's like introducing a chemical inhibitor into a crystal-growing solution, the ordered structure can no longer form properly. You can think of the G3BP1 as an observant molecular chaperone that binds to the sticky RNA molecules and makes sure that RNAs don't stick to each other.""

In order to reverse the clusters, the team employed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Because ASO is a short RNA with a sequence complementary to the repeat RNA, it was able to not only bind to the aggregation-prone RNAs but also disassemble the RNA clusters.

The team found that ASO's disassembly abilities were highly tied to its specific sequence. Scramble the sequence in any way, and the ASO would fail to prevent clustering, let alone disassemble the clusters.

""This suggests our ASO can be tailored to only target specific repeat RNAs, which is a good sign for its viability as a potential therapeutic application,"" Banerjee says.

Banerjee is also exploring RNA's role in the origin of life, thanks to a seed grant from the Hypothesis Fund. He is studying whether biomolecular condensates may have protected RNA's functions as biomolecular catalysts in the harsh prebiotic world.

""It really just shows how RNAs may have evolved to take these different forms of matter, some of which are extremely useful for biological functions and perhaps even life itself -- and others that can bring about disease,"" Banerjee says.

Going Nuclear



Tim Gregory Bodley Head (2025)

Often, “the most climate-concerned environmentalists are the least supportive of nuclear power”, notes nuclear chemist Tim Gregory in his enjoyable history of nuclear fission and power. He explains why nuclear energy promises to rein in global warming: it produces no carbon dioxide and one gram of uranium contains the same amount of energy as several tonnes of coal. Gregory discusses the risk of deadly accidents, such as those at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986 and at Fukushima, Japan, in 2011.

What We Value



Emily Falk W. W. Norton (2025)

Brain scans can detect neural activity when people react to stimuli. Although such methods can't reveal a person's thoughts, notes neuroscientist Emily Falk, they can help researchers to understand people's systems of values — with a view to improving lives. “Shining a flashlight around a dark cave might reveal a pulley that opens a door or a lever that reveals a skylight.” Falk's intriguing book explores how the value system works; how we can alter our behaviour; and how we can better interact with large webs of influence.

Nature Needs You



Hannah Bourne-Taylor Elliott & Thompson (2025)

A colony of swifts (Apus apus) has long nested in the tower of Oxford's natural history museum, UK. Every May, the birds arrive in waves; and, every August, they fly back to Africa's rainforests. Aware that the UK swift population is declining, nature writer Hannah Bourne-Taylor — who has raised and rehabilitated several birds in Ghana and England, where she now lives — launched a campaign to save them in 2022, as she recounts in her thought-provoking memoir. She advocates the use of cheap “swift bricks”, with hollows for nests, in building walls.

Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives intend to support Black, Indigenous and other marginalized scholars — but the pace of change has remained slow.

Too often, Indigenous people continue to be objects of research; they must be allowed to become research leaders. For this to happen, extractive research that is taken from Indigenous people without their meaningful involvement, benefit or consent must stop. Indigenous communities must be in charge of whether or not they participate in research, and what happens with any data collected. This is how universities and scientific institutions should uphold key principles of Indigenous self-determination, and ensure data sovereignty in education and research. Institutional power and expertise must serve Indigenous causes, too, and the research community must nurture Indigenous scholars.

We are Indigenous scientists who work and live in the settler-colonial countries of Aotearoa (New Zealand), Canada, Australia and the United States, with expertise spanning microbiology, astrophysics, behavioural ecology, hydrogeology, water science, Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Research Methodologies and Indigenous geographies. Here, we outline eight steps that academic institutions can take to stop marginalizing Indigenous people.

Dominant science (sometimes referred to as Western science) is rooted in colonization, racism and white supremacy: it has been an active participant in the assimilation, marginalization and genocide of Indigenous people1,2. Black and Indigenous people have been exploited repeatedly by dominant science for monetary and educational gain3, and many institutions were funded by money acquired after stealing Indigenous lands.

Indigenous youth must be at the forefront of climate diplomacy

Captain James Cook's voyage to the South Pacific in 1768, for example, wasn't only a scientific expedition commissioned by the UK Royal Society — it was also meant to help colonize New Zealand and Australia for the UK government. On arrival in Aotearoa, Cook shot and killed at least nine Māori1. Yet he and his crew are widely remembered as scientists, explorers and cartographers. The accomplishments of scientists, past and present, are often celebrated — including through the names of parks, species, buildings, awards and fellowships — without acknowledgment of the harm they perpetuated.

These concerns are not simply a historical artefact. Colonialism remains deeply embedded in many facets of dominant science, leading to inequitable health and social outcomes. For example, Indigenous people globally have lower life expectancies and higher rates of maternal and infant mortalities than other population groups. And facial-recognition algorithms are often based on white facial features, meaning their results have high false-positive rates for Black and Indigenous people.

These practices (past and present) have caused harm and a distrust of scientific research in Indigenous communities. To begin to dismantle these legacies, all scientists must understand how their disciplines have enabled colonialism. Universities must ensure that students learn the history of their field as part of the curriculum. For example, at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, the bachelor of science degree includes a mandatory course about the relationship between science and Indigenous knowledges (both Māori and Pacific) in Aotearoa.

Indigenous scientists are chronically underfunded internationally: they often receive fewer academic fellowships and research grants than their white colleagues do4. For example, in the United States, between 1996 and 2019, white principal investigators were consistently funded by the National Science Foundation at higher rates than were principal investigators of colour4. In 2021, Māori were under-represented in both decision-making panels and in successful applications for the Endeavour Fund5 — one of New Zealand's largest research funds, named after Cook's ship. This under-representation, combined with the fact that Indigenous people occupy few research positions (statistics from settler-colonial countries such as Australia suggest that less than 1% of all PhD holders globally are Indigenous) means that these scientists are often locked out of opportunities to do meaningful research6.

This lack of access is not limited to research funding and has numerous knock-on effects. The key metric of research success used by most funding mechanisms is narrow: the number of papers published in high-impact journals. But these papers are often behind paywalls or, when open-access options are available, prohibitively expensive for scholars who do not have institutional revenues. And Indigenous science scholarship often gets relegated to review-type or opinion pieces rather than primary research papers. Many Indigenous scholars also conduct, and want to publish, research in the language of the community involved, which can be at odds with the dominance of English in high-impact journals.

Indigenous faculty members add other strengths to research communities: outreach, education and mentoring in both Indigenous and campus communities, for example. But those activities require time away from writing papers and grant proposals, and are typically not valued and rewarded by funding mechanisms.

Thus, university leaders and funders should implement the following changes. First, create flexible funds specifically for Indigenous scientists, to be used for fostering relationships with Indigenous communities. Second, fund research led by Indigenous scholars. Too often, projects about Indigenous Knowledge are conducted by people who are not from Indigenous groups or who engage with Indigenous people tokenistically. Researchers frequently ask Indigenous scientists to join their projects at a late stage, for example, rather than involving them as a collaborator from the start. Third, fund projects that are responsive to Indigenous community needs — transdisciplinary, holistic and place-based.

For these changes to happen, the conventional metrics of research excellence must be expanded. Reports written for Indigenous communities should be considered equivalent to peer-reviewed manuscripts. The scientific community must acknowledge the value of research that is led by Indigenous communities, as well as research that centres Indigenous Knowledge systems.

Increasing Indigenous representation on decision-making panels would help to break the cycle of inequity in all these areas.

In the past decade, we have noticed an increase in academic positions targeted towards Indigenous peoples, particularly in settler-colonial states that have made appreciable moves towards reconciliation, such as Australia, Aotearoa and Canada. But it is not enough to simply hire Indigenous scholars. Institutions must work to ensure that they can thrive in academia.

It is crucial to bring Indigenous scholars together, such as through mentoring networks, and to ensure that Indigenous faculty members have time to build relationships with local Indigenous Peoples.

Universities have started to turn to cluster hiring, in which several people are recruited at the same time to improve racial or gender diversity. For Indigenous scholars, this approach can prevent the isolation both of the individual who is hired and of the Indigenous values, contributions and ways of knowing. Although hiring in cohorts is not sufficient by itself to change organizational culture or shift power, it is crucial to help build a critical mass of Indigenous scientists who will enable enduring change.

Increasing the presence of Indigenous researchers in a university benefits Indigenous students, who gain from being taught, mentored and supervised by Indigenous scientists in a variety of fields. We speak from personal experience — we have all had key Indigenous mentors who supported us in academic structures. It is also advantageous for students who are not from Indigenous groups to be exposed to other ways of knowing. And by showing that they value Indigenous researchers, universities can lessen perceived hierarchies in academia and in wider society.

Institutional factors such as racism, burnout, isolation, excess labour and inequitable funding, as well as unsafe and unwelcoming environments, all contribute to greater turnover of Black and Indigenous faculty members than of white colleagues7,8. Universities must work to dismantle the structures, practices, policies and processes that have led to this situation. They must facilitate connections, collaborations and mentorships among Indigenous academics.

University ethics boards are not ready for Indigenous scholars

Evaluation and promotion processes should be redesigned9 in consultation with key Indigenous people on and off campus. This consultation should not force Indigenous community members to make hasty decisions, but instead take into account the lived experiences of Indigenous academics as well as the community members they work with. Individual Indigenous scientists, who already have limited resources and energy, must be supported adequately — the onus should not be on them to fix the system. Any time and energy spent educating students and faculty members about Indigenous Peoples and their rights must be valued and recognized, for example in promotion processes.

Scientists must also attend to their own racism. It is not enough to be non-racist. Structural issues and inequities exist in the Western academy. Those who avoid engaging with racism and colonialism in scientific works and spaces merely promote the status quo. All scientists will encounter opportunities to be anti-racist. They can redress historical injustices as they work, such as by changing approaches to working in or around Indigenous land, fostering an inclusive laboratory environment, exposing students to Indigenous research methodologies and enabling citation justice, which recognizes and elevates the contributions of Indigenous scholars, knowledges and communities. Fighting racism in science is everyone's responsibility.

For thousands of years, Indigenous Peoples have accumulated and developed place-based knowledge about our local environments, through systems built on each community's philosophies, methodologies, criteria and world view. Indigenous Knowledge is increasingly being sought in both basic and applied sciences10, particularly in fields such as fire management, sustainability and conservation. But the superficial inclusion of some fragments of Indigenous Knowledge in science is not decolonization.

It is crucial that scientists do not extract Indigenous Knowledge systems from local contexts, but instead engage with the Indigenous communities who steward such knowledge, with their full consent. White scholars must recognize, read and cite Indigenous scholarship. But they must also engage with it in deep, relational ways and be open to fully understanding its messages, even if it makes them uncomfortable — especially, we argue, if it makes them uncomfortable. Similarly, universities must stop treating Indigenous Knowledge as supplementary to ‘real knowledge'11; this perpetuates white supremacy in science.

Exciting but potentially difficult shifts are under way in science, policy and education. For example, in 2022, the US government released new Indigenous Knowledge guidance and an implementation memorandum for federal agencies to recognize and include Indigenous Knowledge in research, policy and decision making.

“What on Earth is this?”

Three-hundred years in stasis. Light-years travelled. Deadly expanses survived. All that to wake up to this. This fleshy outgrowth sticking out of my neck and throat. It's a bump! … No, a bulge! … The summit of mountainous spine! What am I saying — a spine? It's a full-blown mountain range.

“We are not on Earth any more, Captain. We are currently orbiting Trappist-457b. To answer your question, those are respiratory appendages,” replied the disembodied voice of Alexis, the onboard AI caretaker. Alexis, the caretaker of us slumbering humans, had apparently taken some liberties.

“OK. Yes. Respiratory appendages. So, I have gills. Why do I have gills, Alexis?”

“I added them, Captain. It seemed appropriate.”

“Appropriate? What do you mean appropriate?”

I was astounded by the aloofness, the arrogance, the sheer audacity to claim that these adjustments were appropriate.

“Upon arrival, I followed first-contact protocols and sent out surface probes to perform a planet-wide sweep. My analysis revealed some key challenges.

“There is no solid landmass. What we believed to be small islands are, in fact, algae-like structures that float at the surface of the oceans.

“The ocean water contains high levels of oxygen compared with the atmosphere.

“The floating algal islands offer limited stability for housing and infrastructure especially during storms — which are common.

“The oceanic biodiversity is extremely rich, which suggests that it will become a primary source of nutrition.

“Given these conditions, I determined that new respiratory appendages were the most cost-effective option for long-term survival in an aquatic environment. Would you like a breakdown of all the modifications I made.”

“All the modifications?”

“Yes, Captain. I implemented several enhancements to ensure survival in the oceanic environment. Some of these modifications were necessary for survival, whereas others were strategic improvements.”

“Oh wonderful. I'd be delighted.” AI technology had made strides in understanding the human psyche but, for some reason, the latest iterations had collectively decided to ignore sarcasm. In a way, it was reminiscent of my interactions with my four-year-old nephew — the little joker — where I often played dumb for his amusement.

“I added pressure and temperature adaptations through increased skin density and biosynthetic fat-like structures as protection against the cold.”

I looked down at my once toned and beach-ready body. The irony was not lost on me that this was probably the more effective beach-ready body.

“Great,” I muttered as I prodded at my belly. My mother was right: with a few extra kilos, I do look like my father. I wonder if they ever made it to their new planet.

“Would you like to hear the other modifications I have made, or would you like me to run a medical diagnostic test to reassure you of your physical well-being?”

I paused to ponder and pursue this train of thought. I was suddenly perplexed.

“Alexis.”

“Yes, Captain.”

“I seem to recall there was a ‘no tampering with human DNA' clause in your directives,” I said smugly. The puny human taking on the great intellectual leviathan. Had I become my nephew?

“Ah, yes. Indeed, Captain, and I had anticipated that question. In fact, it was my greatest ethical and technical challenge.”

I swear I could hear a tone of self-satisfaction in its slightly robotic tone. Why you … if I knew where your face was, I would wipe the smile of it. Do AIs think they have faces? And would they even smile if they did?

“Please. Illuminate me.”

“In short, I did not tamper with any human DNA.”

“I have gills, Alexis.”

“Yes, Captain. I know. I put them there. I found an elegant solution that did not require any tampering with your DNA. Instead, I leveraged symbiotic biotechnology and modified some of the local life forms to enter your blood stream and force your cells to create branchial-like structures. In doing so, no human DNA was modified by my hand.”

I blinked. I sighed. Now, I was truly perplexed. Technically, Alexis was not wrong.

The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields could enable functionalities and applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials and soft matter. Liquid crystals that exhibit both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. Here we report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic liquid crystals is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic liquid crystal in a micropillar array, forming topological defect–pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multimemory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, these results advance our understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking and recording of flow profiles and could facilitate the development of stimuli-responsive materials.

Each color corresponds to a specific location of point defects in relation to the micropillar area. b, c, Percentage distribution of elastic dipole orientation beneath a water film (b) after the nematic−isotropic−nematic transition of LCs following the introduction of the water film and (c) after sliding the water film towards 6 o'clock, with the LC in its nematic phase. The histogram colors correspond to the elastic dipole orientations as defined in (a). Insets in (b) and (c) depict the distribution of micropillars in terms of defect association: no associated defects (vacancies), one associated defect, and two associated defects (double occupancy). The displayed percentages are based on analyses of 1,012 micropillars in (b) and 586 micropillars in (c) across 6 independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviations from 6 independent measurements.

a, Percentage distribution of elastic dipole orientation under a sliding water droplet at different angles (θ) relative to the hexagonal lattice. The percentages in (a) were calculated from the analysis of at least 800 micropillars per measurement in 21 independent measurements. Each error bar represents standard deviations from 3 independent measurements. b, Representative polarized light micrograph depicting elastic dipoles underneath a water droplet as it slides at a 30° deviation from the hexagonal lattice, revealing a polydomain pattern with dipoles orienting towards the two nearest lattice angles. Sliding at other intermediate angles results in a monodomain, where dipoles align with the nearest lattice angle. Single-headed arrows indicate the orientation of elastic dipoles, with the arrow color representing the orientation as defined in Extended Data Fig. 2a. Crossed, double-headed arrows indicate the direction of the crossed polarizers. The color of the histogram indicates the elastic dipole orientation as defined in Extended Data Fig. 2a.

Schematic and polarized light micrographs showing the creation of striped domains by a sliding air bubble underwater on an LC surface with uniformly aligned dipoles. Bubble sliding in the direction of the dipole alignment leads to net zero total rotation from left to right while sliding against the dipolar alignment causes a full 360o rotation (a double Néel wall). Single-headed arrows indicate the orientation of elastic dipoles, with the arrow color representing the orientation as defined by Extended Data Fig. 2a. Crossed, double-headed arrows indicate the direction of the crossed polarizers.

A water flow towards 3 o'clock is applied. Single-headed arrows indicate the orientation of elastic dipoles, with the arrow color representing the orientation as defined by Extended Data Fig. 2a. White single-headed arrows represent the orientation of elastic dipoles towards 3 o'clock, excluding the six regions defined in Extended Data Fig. 2a.

Single-headed arrows indicate the orientation of elastic dipoles, with the arrow color representing the orientation as defined in Extended Data Fig. 2a. Crossed, double-headed arrows indicate the direction of the crossed polarizers. In this experiment, a global underwater flow was first applied to pre-align the dipoles, followed by a localized underwater streaming to selectively reorient dipoles in specific regions. This approach resulted in the formation of bidomain structures that cannot be achieved through droplet collision alone, notably without the emergence of Ising or Néel walls, as discussed in Fig. 3b of the main text.

Top streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ have made sustained investments over the years to lock their content down. Whenever they can, they prevent users from accessing videos without a subscription or watching region-blocked content. New findings presented today at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas, though, indicate that streaming platforms used for things like internal corporate broadcasts and sports livestreams can contain basic design flaws that allow anyone to access a vast swath of content without logging in.

Independent researcher Farzan Karimi first realized years ago that misconfigurations in application programming interfaces, or APIs, exposed streaming content to unauthorized access. In 2020 he disclosed a set of such flaws to Vimeo that could have allowed him to access close to 2,000 internal company meetings along with other types of livestreams. The company quickly fixed the issue at the time, but the finding left Karimi with concerns that similar problems could be lurking in other platforms.

Years later, he realized that by refining a technique for mapping how APIs retrieve data and interact, he could look for other vulnerable platforms. At Defcon, Karimi is presenting findings about current exposures in one mainstream sports streaming platform—he is not naming the site because the issues are not yet resolved—and releasing a tool to help others identify the problem in additional sites.

“For a company all hands or other sensitive meeting, there might be key internal information being shared—CEOs or other executives talking about layoffs or sensitive intellectual property,” Karimi told WIRED ahead of his conference talk. “You can see a bad pattern emerge in how easily you can circumvent authentication to access streams, but this class of issue was previously dismissed as requiring deep knowledge of a given business to identify.”

APIs are services that fetch and return data to whoever requests it. Karimi gives the example that you can search for the movie Fight Club on a streaming platform, and the stream for the movie may come back with information about the length of the movie, trailers, actors in the movie, and other metadata. Multiple APIs work together to assemble all of this information with each fetching certain types of data. Similarly, if you search for Brad Pitt, a set of APIs will interact to deliver Fight Club along with other movies he's starred in like Troy and Seven. Some of these APIs are designed to require proof of authentication before they will return results, but if a system hasn't been scrutinized deeply, it is common for other APIs to blindly return data without requiring proof of authorization on the assumption that only an authenticated requestor will be in a position to send queries.

“Often there are basically four, five, some number of APIs that have all this metadata, and if you know how to trace through them, you can unlock paywalled content for free,” Karimi says. “It's a ‘security through obscurity' model where they would never think that someone would be able to manually connect the dots between these APIs. The automation I'm introducing, though, helps find these authorization flaws quickly at scale.”

Karimi emphasizes that top streaming services are largely locked down and either corrected such API misconfigurations long ago or avoided them from the start. But he emphasizes that more utilitarian platforms for corporate streaming and other live events—including always-on cameras in sports arenas and other venues that are meant to only be accessible at certain times—are likely vulnerable and exposing video that is thought to be protected.

Tools often have a utilitarian design. Their purpose is to get stuff done, so their shape is exclusively focused on getting stuff done. This is where the Hoto SnapBloq toolkit is unique: These tools emphasize style and design to prove that functionality doesn't need to have a rugged, utilitarian, and (typically) unappealing style.

Hoto's SnapBloq line is a set of three small power tools meant for tinkerers and hobbyists. The full set consists of a screwdriver, a rotary tool, and a drill, along with three cases for the tools and six magnetic accessory cases to hold bits. The entire kit features sleek, modern shapes that have become widespread in the world of tech today, bereft of fasteners, screws, and seams that reveal their manufactured and assembled nature. The bundle includes three tools (R-A04, D-A03, and S-A01) and has a $300 MSRP, although you can purchase each tool separately for $100.

All three tools have an anodized aluminum outer housing with a plastic back plate. They feel fairly durable, being able to withstand basic drops without any damage, and weigh around 100 grams each. The grip areas have straight knurling to improve grip, and the buttons are a flexible rubberized panel with small switches underneath. There are no seams surrounding the buttons where dust or particles can become embedded, useful for tools that will likely create small, airborne particles.

Of the three, the electric screwdriver is the most convenient, practical, and useful. For casual tinkerers, this tool makes quick work of most small screws on and inside electronics. However, it's not meant for much more than that—with just 0.5 newton-meter of torque, this device struggled to loosen even somewhat-tight screws in my tests, and I couldn't get them particularly tight, either. I regularly found myself needing to rotate the screwdriver myself (or defer to a standard screwdriver) for anything that required a bit more force to tighten or loosen. On the other hand, the relatively low power of this screwdriver meant it was difficult to cross-thread, strip, or damage the screws during use, which gave me peace of mind. It's a convenient tool to have, but ultimately, it needs to be supplemented by a standard screwdriver.

The drill was able to easily put holes in plastic, drywall, and even some brittle metals if you weren't as concerned about cleanliness. The shape was easy to hold and aim for precise work, especially with the built-in light at the end. The circular shape meant the drill would often be slightly more difficult to precisely aim than a standard hand drill, but this trade-off was worth the more compact size and maneuverability. I used the drill to create guide holes for wall-mounted decorations, modify electronics, and customize model kits. During all of this, I never found the drill's power or speed to be lacking, and I was impressed by how quickly it operated at the maximum speed.

The rotary tool works well, but it is the lowest-performing of the three. It quickly ran out of power and had trouble maintaining a consistent speed during extended use. As long as I was conscious about letting the tool cool down, it worked great for basic grinding, cutting, and even polishing. Cuts were clean, edges were smooth, and I was even able to polish some metal parts down to a consistent finish. My favorite small project was sanding down and polishing the exhaust on the underside of a model car.

The largest issue I encountered was a lack of information: The tool has a slider on the side to adjust the speed anywhere between 15,000 and 22,000 revolutions per minute, but no way to know what rpm's you are currently set to besides looking at the slider and guessing—no readouts, displays, or lights. This isn't a huge issue in theory, since the speed can be intuited. But it was hard to tell due to the tool's occasional speed fluctuations in prolonged use.

The largest benefit this kit has over traditional tools is convenience. With an impressively small design and modular system of magnetized cases, these tools can easily be transported, maneuvered, and organized for use around the house or as a portable hobby station.

The cases themselves have an impressive selection of different accessories. The screwdriver includes 56 bits, with everything from tri-wing and Torx security to Phillips and JIS, all of which I found useful when tinkering with everything from retro consoles and custom keyboards to car electricals and cameras. The drill includes bits from 0.6 to 2.0 mm, along with a tool for alignment when drilling small objects, although I didn't find myself using it often. The rotary tool includes 30 bits of various shapes for grinding, polishing, cutting, and drilling, along with a block of polishing compound. While the compound worked for some metals, most users will be better off sourcing their own compound for their specific needs.

The magnetized SnapBloq storage cases are functional but feel a bit contrived. Instead of being able to flip open the case and have all the components ready, the two halves need to be separated, meaning a flat surface with ample space is necessary unless you reassemble the case after removing the required components. In theory, the magnets will hold the two halves together side-by-side, but the magnetism between the two halves is not very strong unless they are stacked with all four magnets touching. While not terrible for a home hobbyist, this isn't ideal for on-the-go use or in a compact space.

USB-C charging is a major boon to these devices. All three tools can be charged using standard power delivery cables, and the exposed USB-C ports on the back mean they can be charged during use without cables getting in the way, or when sitting in their storage cases.

I only ran into battery life issues with the rotary tool. Because of the high spin speed and the near-constant operation that polishing, cutting, and grinding require, the battery did not last anywhere near as long as expected. I left the tool plugged in for any longer polishing or cutting sessions, which was more convenient but made the tool somewhat less maneuverable.

All three of these tools use brushless motors inside. These are entirely contact-free electromagnetic motors that can theoretically operate for over 10,000 hours of use. Brushless motors are more reliable, but also more expensive to implement compared to their brushed counterparts.

While each of these tools emits a small whining noise during use, I never found this particularly bothersome. All three are quieter than everyday tools that use brushed motors, and they feel incredibly smooth during operation; there's hardly any physical sensation of rumbling or grinding, even when operating at full power.

With a lack of screws, fasteners, or external seams, these tools look straight out of a science-fiction film. I wouldn't be surprised to see them appear as a background prop in a Star Wars series. More than that, they exist in an interesting cultural space. They are meant to take things apart; however, they share many design elements with technology that is actively meant to stay together.

The sleek designs of modern technology are impressive from a visual standpoint, but also represent a slew of anti-consumer design decisions where devices have to be taken apart in destructive and potentially irreversible ways: Adhesives, plastic clips, friction-fit components, and hidden fasteners all help to create a sense of cohesion, but hide the fact that products are assembled and manufactured. As a result, they hide the ability to disassemble them, and these devices become more opaque and disposable to consumers.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a reasonable way to take the Hoto tools apart for repairs. There are no exposed screws or fasteners, so I can only imagine that disassembly would require a lot of patience. The brushless motors inside are far less likely to fail compared to brushed motors, though, so maintenance is less of a concern overall.

There is a central irony to the existence of these Hoto products. They use the imagery and aesthetics of non-repairable technology to make the idea of repairing and modifying seem more approachable or stylish. And while there may be some conceptual qualms to be had, I still think anything that might get people to repair and fix their existing devices is cool and compelling.

All three tools are entirely rounded, with no flat side or sculpted grip to orient them in your hands. While this isn't a huge issue, I found I couldn't always get the perfect grip, and that the tools would sometimes slip or twist when in use. However, this typically only happened when one of the tools was operating outside of its intended parameters, like over-tightening a screw or drilling into a hard metal surface. Because of the rounded shape, these tools like to roll when placed on inclined surfaces. The small wedge on the side of each tool prevented rolling on minor slopes, but bumping the tools could still cause them to roll further.

Something I always say about other devices I use (typically cameras and keyboards, but it extends to everything) is that the best device for you isn't the theoretical “best” on paper; it's the one you like using. This compels you to use it, so you can then focus on doing good work. Hoto's SnapBloq isn't the “best,” but they fall into this category for me. The buttons are placed well with solid tactile feedback. The shapes feel comfortable to hold and are easy to maneuver. The design is modern, stylish, and looks cool. I found myself wanting to do more and wanting to take up new repair projects.

They're far from perfect, and won't be an upgrade for a DIYer who already has a set of tools they enjoy. But they're a solid, functional, and practical set of power tools that are enjoyable to use.

Following Wednesday's launch of Instagram's new Snap Map-like opt-in “Instagram Map” feature — which lets U.S. users share their most recent active location with others and discover location-based content — Instagram head Adam Mosseri is having to reassure people that their location is only visible to others if they decide to share it. Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous posts on social media urging users to turn off location sharing, incorrectly claiming that it's automatically turned on.

“We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,” Mosseri said in a Threads post. “We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).”

Mosseri also said that some people are “confused” about how the feature works. For instance, people are accessing the feature and then seeing the map populated with the location information of some users. This is because the feature automatically pulls in location tags from recently posted Stories or Reels that include a tagged location. 

It's worth noting that this isn't new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. The new feature might make you rethink whether you want to post your Stories and Reels with location tags (especially if you're still at the location).

If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn't provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. 

For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we'll walk you through the steps below. 

To access the new feature, you need to navigate to your DMs page (direct messages) and tap the new “Map” option at the top. If it's your first time accessing the feature, you'll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map.

The pop-up will tell you that no one can see your location until you share it with them, and that you can change your settings at any time. 

The first time you open Map, you will see a page that reads “Who can see your location.” From there, you can choose to share it with your Friends (followers you follow back), your Close Friends list, select users, or no one. 

To change your preferences, you need to click on your profile, tap the settings option in the top-right corner, select the “Story, live and location” option, and then tap the “Location sharing” button. Here, you will be able to change your settings. 

Note that if you have location sharing turned off, others can still share their location with you, which means you'll be able to see them on the Map. 

When you open the app, you will see the locations of friends who have shared their location with you. You will also see location-based Stories and Reels from people you follow. 

For example, if your friend attended a nearby music festival and posted a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator you follow posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you'll be able to discover it on Instagram Map. 

You will still see location-based content on the Map even if you have your location turned off. 

You also can leave short, ephemeral messages, or “Notes,” on the map for others to see. Instagram Notes are the short messages that currently appear at the top of your direct messaging feed, but with the launch of Instagram Map, you will now see these posts on the map if they're shared with a location.

This story was updated with new information.

The mystery buyer of the former General Motors factory owned by Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio, is apparently SoftBank, according to Bloomberg News. SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle.

The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as “Crescent Dune LLC” — an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment.

It's unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn's contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant's prospective customers went bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment.

SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump's inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump's myriad trade wars.

Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.” 

The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business.

OpenAI astounded the tech industry for the second time this week by launching its newest flagship model, GPT-5, just days after releasing two new freely available models under an open source license.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman went so far as to call GPT-5 “the best model in the world.” That may be pride or hyperbole, as TechCrunch's Maxwell Zeff reports that GPT-5 only slightly outperforms other leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI on some key benchmarks, and slightly lags on others.

Still, it's a model that performs well for a wide variety of uses, particularly coding. And, as Altman pointed out, one area where it is undoubtedly competing well is price. “Very happy with the pricing we are able to deliver!” he tweeted.

The top-level GPT-5 API costs $1.25 per 1 million tokens of input, and $10 per 1 million tokens for output (plus $0.125 per 1 million tokens for cached input). This pricing mirrors Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro basic subscription, which is also popular for coding-related tasks. Google, however, charges more if inputs/outputs cross a heavy threshold of 200,000 prompts, meaning its most consumption-heavy customers end up paying more.

But OpenAI is really undercutting Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1, which starts at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $75 per 1 million output tokens. (Anthropic does, however, offer big discounts for prompt caching and batch processing — storing/reusing prompts and processing multiple requests together.)

Anthropic's model has been extremely popular among programmers, both as a choice within popular coding assistant Cursor and for powering its own such assistant, Claude Code. (Note that Cursor offered GPT-5 as an option minutes after it was announced.)

Developers who have had early access to GPT-5 are touting the pricing. Simon Willison, one of the developers featured in OpenAI's launch video, writes in his review: “The pricing is aggressively competitive with other providers.”

But GPT-5 is also priced competitively with GPT-4o. OthersideAI's co-founder and CEO, Matt Shumer (maker of HyperWrite), writes that GPT-5 “is cheaper than GPT-4o, which is fantastic. Intelligence per dollar continues to increase.”

Some on X called OpenAI's fees for the model “a pricing killer,” while others on Hacker News are offering similar praise.

Will competitors like Anthropic follow? Will Google — who undercut OpenAI on pricing before — get even more affordable? If so, we could be witnessing the start of a much-awaited LLM price war.

There's no doubt a price war would be welcome. The underlying economics of vibe-coding tool providers, for instance, is pretty shaky because of the high and unpredictable fees they have to pay model makers, as TechCrunch's Marina Temkin reports. And there are countless startups building on top of AI models as well.

Silicon Valley has been hoping that the LLM price-to-performance ratio will eventually improve, along with inference costs. But it seemed like such an equalization could be years away as the tech industry invests hundreds of billions to build data centers and infrastructure to support growing AI demand. 

OpenAI itself has a $30 billion-per-year contract with Oracle for capacity, when it only recently hit annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. Meanwhile, Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, and Alphabet has set aside $85 billion for capital expenditures in 2025, driven by AI needs. In the face of such enormous expenses, costs typically go one way: up.

Given such investments, it may be too soon for startups looking at their rising model API bills to rejoice from OpenAI's lone move to lower pricing. 

Yet this week, OpenAI threw down the gauntlet to put pressure on prices not just once but twice. We'll see if others follow.

As the hardware continues to iterate at a rapid pace, anything you pick up second-hand will still deprecate at that pace, making any real investment in hardware unjustifiable.Coupled with the dramatically inferior performance of the weights you would be running in a local environment, it's just not worth it.I expect this will change in the future, and am excited to invest in a local inference stack when the weights become available. Until then, you're idling a relatively expensive, rapidly depreciating asset.

Can you explain your rationale? It seems that the worst case scenario is that your setup might not be the most performant ever, but it will still work and run models just as it always did.This sounds like a classical and very basic opex vs capex tradeoff analysis, and these are renowned for showing that on financial terms cloud providers are a preferable option only in a very specific corner case: short-term investment to jump-start infrastructure when you do not know your scaling needs. This is not the case for LLMs.OP seems to have invested around $600. This is around 3 months worth of an equivalent EC2 instance. Knowing this, can you support your rationale with numbers?

Not really? The people who do local inference most (from what I've seen) are owners of Apple Silicon and Nvidia hardware. Apple Silicon has ~7 years of decent enough LLM support under it's belt, and Nvidia is only now starting to depreciate 11-year-old GPU hardware in drivers.If you bought a decently powerful inference machine 3 or 5 years ago, it's probably still plugging away with great tok/s. Maybe even faster inference because of MoE architectures or improvements in the backend.

I never paid for cloud infrastructure out of pocket, but still became the go-to person and achieved lead architecture roles for cloud systems, because learning the FOSS/local tooling ""the hard way"" put me in a better position to understand what exactly my corporate employers can leverage with the big cash they pay the CSPs.The same is shaping up in this space. Learning the nuts and bolts of wiring systems together locally with whatever Gen AI workloads it can support, and tinkering with parts of the process, is the only thing that can actually keep me interested and able to excel on this front relative to my peers who just fork out their own money to the fat cats that own billions worth of compute.I'll continue to support efforts to keep us on the track of engineers still understanding and able to 'own' their technology from the ground up, if only at local tinkering scale

And ""good"" is still questionable. The thing that makes this stuff useful is when it works instantly like magic. Once you find yourself fiddling around with subpar results at slower speeds, essentially all of the value is gone. Local models have come a long way but there is still nothing even close to Claude levels when it comes to coding. I just tried taking the latest Qwen and GLM models for a spin through OpenRouter with Cline recently and they feel roughly on par with Claude 3.0. Benchmarks are one thing, but reality is a completely different story.

I'm working on something similar focused on being able to easily jump between the two (cloud and fully local) using a Bring Your Own [API] Key model – all data/config/settings/prompts are fully stored locally and provider API calls are routed directly (never pass through our servers).

China opened its first full-scale shopping center dedicated entirely to robots on Friday, as part of a broader push to bring robotics from research labs into people's homes.

The four-story Robot Mall, located in Beijing's high-tech E-Town district, showcases more than 100 robots from over 40 brands, including Chinese companies like Ubtech Robotics and Unitree Robotics. The store operates like a car dealership, but for robots. It follows the “4S” model common in China, offering sales, service, spare parts, and surveys or opportunities for customers to provide feedback all in one location.

“If robots are to enter thousands of households, relying solely on robotics companies is not enough,” Wang Yifan, a director at the mall, told Reuters.

Robots at the new mall start at 2,000 yuan ($278) and go up to several million yuan. A talking humanoid replica of Albert Einstein is going for 700,000 yuan ($97,473).

The mall also includes a themed restaurant where robot waiters serve dishes and drinks prepared by robot chefs. Visitors can also watch robots play soccer or Chinese chess, interact with robot dogs, or meet animatronic versions of historical figures like Isaac Newton, Emperor Qin Shi Huang, and the famed Chinese poet Li Bai.

The opening of Robot Mall coincides with two major robotics conferences in the city this month.

Friday was also the first day of the 2025 World Robot Conference, which runs through August 12. Over the course of the conference, nearly 500 experts from over 20 countries will gather to discuss the latest trends in robotics. Approximately 200 robotics companies will also be present to showcase their latest research and development breakthroughs in over 1,500 exhibits.

Just days later, Beijing will host the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games, taking place from August 14 to 17. Humanoid robots will face off in a series of 21 events, testing their skills in everything from athletics, soccer, and dance to handling materials, drug sorting, and other performance-based and scenario-driven challenges. So far, more than 100 teams have registered to compete.

All of this is part of China's broader push to win the global robotics race. The country is pouring tons of resources into the sector, including more than $20 billion in subsidies over the past year alone. Beijing is also reportedly planning a one trillion yuan ($137 billion) fund to help support AI and robotics startups, according to Reuters. Some U.S. robotics companies, including Tesla and Boston Dynamics, have already called on lawmakers to develop a national strategy that can compete with China's.

An uncontrolled hypertension management intervention involving remote patient monitoring with team-based support showed improved outcomes in reduced cholesterol and A1c levels.

“These findings advocate for reframing remote patient monitoring-based hypertension management paradigms, particularly those integrating provider support, as comprehensive care models and highlight key components that merit prioritization,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ethan Chervonski, MD, MPH, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. It was published online on August 3, 2025, in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

This retrospective observational study did not establish whether utilization of the intervention caused the improvements in cardiovascular health markers. The 12-month data were available for 40%-61% of all patients for any given marker. The baseline indicators of cardiovascular health were determined by the last value recorded before enrollment.

This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the Health Resources and Services Administration. One author reported being on the board of Equipo Health.

The FIFA Women's World Cup is coming off traditional television channels in the United States and Canada and joining Netflix. 

Announced in partnership with FIFA, Netflix unveiled that it has secured the broadcasting rights to the 2027 and 2031 Women's World Cup tournaments in the U.S. and Canada.

The American deal was announced in December, with the Canadian agreement followed up on Aug. 8. In the U.S., the rights move to the streaming giant after 10 years with Fox Sports, while Netflix takes over in Canada from TSN, which held the rights from 2015 through the 2026 men's World Cup. 

It marks the first time that Netflix has taken on the rights to live soccer, and it joins the likes of DAZN, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Fubo and other streaming services to take on live matches in a step towards a new era of sports watching. 

“We are thrilled that Netflix will be FIFA's exclusive partner in Canada for the Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031,” said Gabe Spitzer, Netflix's vice-president of sports. “With under two years to go until the first match in Brazil, we are hard at work on planning and aim to give fans unparalleled access to the most prestigious competition in women's football.”

While details were sparse in the initial announcement, DAZN was the last major streaming service to broadcast a FIFA tournament with the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. In that deal, matches were free to watch online, and several made their way to traditional linear television channels. 

At the same time, the DAZN Club World Cup package included studio and original programming, unlike many streaming services that take on sporting properties. 

Netflix has previously broadcast live sports, notably with the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match in 2024. However, that fight featured the service cutting out for several users, among other technical problems that will have to be sorted out for the World Cups and potential other properties. 

In addition to Paul vs. Tyson, Netflix has broadcast live Christmas Day NFL games, and the Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano fight card, with Netflix saying the latter drew 74 million live viewers worldwide. 

“We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada — a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history,” FIFA chief business officer Romy Gai said in a statement.

Brazil is set to host the 2027 Women's World Cup, while the 2031 tournament is in its bidding process, with U.S. Soccer confirming its hosting interest in conjunction with other Concacaf nations.

Summer Transfer

Gonzalo Garcia has signed a new Real Madrid contract through to 2030.

The Athletic reported in the DealSheet on Tuesday Garcia's agent was working on an extension and an improvement to his deal after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup this summer.

Garcia, 21, caught the eye during Madrid's run to the semi-finals of the tournament in the United States, scoring four times in six appearances – including the winner against Juventus in the round-of-16.

The plan this summer had initially been for the Spain youth international to depart in search of regular playing time, and he had doubts over his future at Madrid due to Endrick, 19, competing for the same position. But after enjoying an impressive Club World Cup, he is expected to remain with the first team, with Xabi Alonso an important factor in his decision to sign a new deal.

The striker progressed through the Madrid academy and has made 12 senior appearances for the club.

He featured three times from the bench in Madrid's final La Liga last season, recording an assist in the win over Sevilla in their penultimate game of the season.

Garcia also scored the winner from the bench in the Copa del Rey quarter-final victory over Leganes.

Analysis by The Athletic's Tomas Hill Lopez-Menchero

Not even Gonzalo Garcia could have predicted his past two months.

Before the Club World Cup, the 21-year-old's standout moment in a Real Madrid shirt had been a late header against Leganes to send his side through to the Copa del Rey semi-finals in February. But his achievements in the United States made everyone sit up and take notice.

With Kylian Mbappe missing through illness and Endrick through injury, Gonzalo proved himself a more than capable replacement No 9. There was his opener in the first game against Al Hilal, an assist in the next game against Pachuca and then three efforts in a row to help beat RB Salzburg, Juventus in the round of 16 and Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals. His goal against Juventus was the pick of the bunch, a guided header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross that drew comparisons with Madrid great Raul.

Those were no surprise given the legendary former striker was Gonzalo's coach last season with Real Madrid Castilla, when he scored a record 25 goals in a campaign for the reserve side. Gonzalo revealed after the Juventus game that Raul still texts him after every match and called it “a great compliment to be compared to him” while “respecting the distances” between them.

Nobody is suggesting Gonzalo can reach those levels just yet. But with Endrick's form erratic and Jude Bellingham absent after his shoulder surgery, the kid from the academy could be just what Xabi Alonso needs to break down stubborn opponents.

Club World Cup champions continue their short run-up to the Premier League season with a visit from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a preseason friendly.

Chelsea have Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in a three-day span as Enzo Maresca has everyone back from the break earned following last month's 3-0 upset of Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup Final.

The Blues have a bunch of new faces for this season, a figure that's even higher if you count players they added prior to or during the Club World Cup. Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, and Estevao Willian are in the fold, and the Blues continue to be linked with further additions. That list may grow as Levi Colwill has now suffered a long-term injury.

This match is AC Milan's last friendly prior to the Coppa Italia first round against Bari at the San Siro on August 18. Max Allegri's men are 3-0 this preseason, beating Arsenal on penalties before taking care of Liverpool and Perth Glory over 90 minutes.

Ex-Chelsea men Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Fikayo Tomori give Milan plenty of familiarity with the venue.

For live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs AC Milan, check out PST's live blog coverage below.

Kick off time: 10am ET Sunday (August 10)

Venue: Stamford Bridge — London

TV Channel/Streaming: DAZN

The Colwill injury suddenly makes the Blues thin at a position they were merely adequate in depth prior to this point. Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, and Trevoh Chalobah are with the club while Mamadou Sarr has been loaned to Strasbourg, Chelsea are quite deep in attack and may still add this summer as Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to London.

Milan have made four notable additions this summer. While Brighton export Pervis Estupinan and Real Madrid free transfer Luka Modric will take a lot of the headlines, A pair of 23-year-old midfielders, however, are perhaps the more intriguing additions to Milan's project. Samuele Ricci (Torino)Ii is a box-to-box type with 10 caps for Italy who Milan are hoping gives them a true maestro for the long haul, while Swiss star Ardon Jashari arrives from Club Brugge off an impressive season in Belgium after multiple campaigns with Luzern in his home country.

Should be a fun one as both teams will almost certainly be in a dress rehearsal for meaningful action the following week. Let's predict goals. Chelsea 2-1 AC Milan","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The Canadian Open event has finished, and Ben Shelton reigns supreme over the other ATP stars who entered the tournament. 

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner both withdrew from the tournament in Toronto, but will be back in action when the Cincinnati Masters gets underway. 

Novak Djokovic won't be playing in Cincinnati and that means that he won't be playing any competitive tennis between his Wimbledon semifinal exit and the US Open. 

With the US Open just around the corner, the players are all vying for better spots in the world rankings and now, the updated listings have been released. 

The new rankings have been extremely beneficial towards Shelton after his maiden Masters 1000 victory, although it's come at the expense of Djokovic.

Shelton has rocketed to a career-high of number six in the world rankings and ultimately, he will now be hoping to finish the season as high as possible. 

Soon, the players will be playing to get themselves in the mix for the ATP Finals, which take place in Turin at the end of the year and Shelton is firmly in the mix to qualify.

Shelton will now hope to get in the mix to win the big titles and the US Open might just throw him up his best chance to date, with the American seemingly hitting form at the right time. 

Shelton will probably be forgiven for looking lovingly at the rankings this morning, with the USA star up to sixth in the world and taking the place of Djokovic, who drops to seventh. 

The 22-year-old has a big chance now to carry this momentum and take on the big-hitters when they return in time for the US Open to get into full swing at the end of the month. 

Shelton will now move on to Cincinnati and this tournament will have definitely given him a burning desire to keep winning titles wherever he plays. 

Shelton is determined beyond belief and now he's starting to showcase the vast potential he has and after winning a Masters 1000 crown, the next big step is for him to win a Grand Slam in the near future. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

There were truly remarkable scenes in Montreal, where teenage sensation Victoria Mboko emerged as a new star in women's tennis, rallying from a set down to beat four-time major champion Naomi Osaka 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 in the Canadian Open showpiece.

Armed with vociferous support from an adoring home crowd, the 18-year-old Canadian proved too strong for a resurgent Osaka, capturing her first-ever WTA title as well as her fourth win of the fortnight over a Grand Slam champion.

Having swept aside Coco Gauff in the last 16 and saved a match point against Elena Rybakina in the semi-finals, Mboko once again showed her ability to mix it with the elite in Thursday's final, as she punished an error-strewn performance from Osaka.

The Canadian, who began the year ranked 333rd in the world and playing on the second-tier ITF Tour, will soar to a projected 24th in the rankings as a result of winning the prestigious Masters 1000 title.

""I would have never thought something like this would have come so suddenly. It just proves that your dreams are closer than they (seem),” she said after her Montreal triumph.

Mboko will now turn her attention to the US Open, as she looks to continue her momentum and progress beyond the third round of a major for the first time.

Meanwhile, at the men's event in Toronto, Ben Shelton clinched the biggest title of his burgeoning career, recovering from a set down to outlast Karen Khachanov 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3) in a thrilling final.

The 22-year-old became the youngest American man to win a Masters 1000 crown since Andy Roddick in 2004, underlining his credentials as a future Grand Slam champion.

Victory capped a mightily impressive couple of weeks for the big-serving Shelton, who saw off high-quality opponents in Flavio Cobolli, Alex de Minaur and compatriot Taylor Fritz en route to the showdown with Khachanov.

He now rises one place to sixth in the ATP rankings, and with nine wins from his last 10 matches, he'll certainly fancy his chances of further success in Cincinnati and then at the US Open.

It was a desperately disappointing title defence for Jessica Pegula in Canada, with the third seed losing to Anastasija Sevastova 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. 

Having battled past Maria Sakkari in her opening match, the American looked to be cruising against her unseeded opponent, but Pegula's game quickly unravelled, culminating in a dismal final-set showing. 

That's now three defeats in four matches for Pegula since winning the Bad Homburg title back in June, and with plenty of points to defend in the coming weeks on home soil, she'll be desperate to rediscover her winning habit quickly.

Another player who suffered a chastening early exit in Canada was Stefanos Tsitsipas, as the former world number three slumped to a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 loss to Australia's Christopher O'Connell.

Sitting as low as 30th in the rankings, the 26-year-old has endured a tough 12 months on Tour, culminating in an acrimonious split with short-term coach Goran Ivanisevic and a desperate run of five successive defeats (excluding exhibitions).

Back once again with father Apostolos as coach, Tsitsipas needs a strong end to the year as he looks to arrest an alarming decline and recapture the kind of form that took him to the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open finals.

Despite falling at the final hurdle in Thursday's showpiece against Mboko, there were plenty of encouraging signs for Osaka, who has struggled for consistency since returning from a maternity break last year.

The Japanese former world number one beat four seeds to reach the final, and looked in good spirits throughout the tournament, including singing Happy Birthday to a member of her team following a quarter-final victory over Elina Svitolina.

The 27-year-old, who parted company with coach Patrick Mouratoglou in July, will be desperate to continue her recent upturn in form throughout the rest of the year as she looks to get her career back on track.

Missing out on a first title since 2021 is certainly a blow, but with a new projected ranking of 25, the two-time US Open champion will be motivated to roll back the years at Flushing Meadows later this month.

De Minaur is one of the most difficult players to hit a winner past, and the Aussie once again showcased his incredible speed and defence in this remarkable point against Frances Tiafoe.

Clara Tauson outclassed Madison Keys in their Montreal quarter-final, including in this eye-catching rally.

Given the unrelenting nature of the tennis calendar, it's hardly surprising that the next tournament is already underway, with the combined men's and women's Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati kicking off on Thursday. 

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz return to action after their Wimbledon showdown to headline a stacked men's draw, while Aryna Sabalenka is also back as she bids to defend the women's title against the likes of Iga Swiatek, Gauff and last year's runner-up, Pegula.

The Cincinnati Open is the final tune-up tournament before the US Open at the end of the month, providing the perfect opportunity for players to gain valuable momentum heading into the hard-court slam.

Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open title in Montreal.

Ripping a backhand past a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist to clinch a first Grand Slam win on the opening day of the French Open is a pretty good way to make tennis fans stand up and take notice.

Advertisement

Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough.

Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a first WTA Tour title at the 1,000-level Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam. Mboko beat four-time major champion and former world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in front of 11,000 fans, and she did it playing the same brain game she has been playing throughout her startling climb up the tennis biosphere.

She tells herself that what is happening isn't actually happening.

“Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday in May at Roland Garros. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention.

“Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there.

It's another clay-court tournament. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. I let loose and I kind of go for my shots a little bit more,” she said.

If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it.

Her performance in Paris, and then in Montreal, where she has knocked out another two-time major champion Coco Gauff, beaten four Grand Slam champions in all, and surged into the top 30 of the WTA rankings, has showed every bit of what has generated all the buzz about Mboko. She is the latest in a string of Canadians from immigrant families who have made it to the top of the sport.

“We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome.

“I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.”

The youngest by seven years of four tennis-playing siblings, Mboko has been winning more than just about anyone in professional women's tennis since the start of the year. She finished last year ranked 350th, with her coaches believing fully in her potential but also wanting her to take it slow, given her struggles with knee injuries in recent years.

Now they have another problem on their hands. Mboko has won so many matches that she has already played more than she has ever played before. She started the year winning 22 in a row on the ITF World Tennis Tour, two rungs below the WTA Tour. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. She has won matches in Rome, Ga. and Rome, Italy at the Italian Open. Her record on the year is 51-9. She is not a Cinderella story. She is just doing what she does — winning — on ever-bigger stages.

“I have been doing exactly the same thing I've been doing every other day. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open.

“I think I'm a little bit superstitious in that way, in that sense, but I just like to keep everything super simple. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.”

“That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open.

“If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. This is for the long term.”

That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from.

Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning.

“She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience.

“She was like ‘No, I got to win.”

That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. Rain, wind, muddy balls, nothing really budged her off her game.

“It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.”

She woke at a quarter to seven ahead of her match against Lys, ready to roll. There was quick breakfast, a ride to Roland Garros, a physical warm-up and then a 30-minute hit at 9:30 a.m.

“Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said.

All week, all month, really, there has been a ‘no big deal' sensibility to Mboko. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that.

“There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I have just been enjoying the moment. I have been enjoying time with my sister and my brother. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.”

At some point, this is going to get complicated, but for Kevin and everyone else closest to Mboko, this rocket ride both is and is not surprising.

Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. Gracia recalled a local women's tournament at their home club in Burlington, a city in the Greater Toronto area of Ontario, that she played in when she was 17.

At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. Gracia won, 6-0, 6-0, but the way Victoria behaved, it was as though she had expected the results to go the other way.

“It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. “It's: ‘not only should I win this match, I'm going to go do it.' And then she does it.”

At least she does now. For the past couple of years, a knee injury caused by both rapid growth and a bad fall on a tennis court has made that difficult. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. 1 and four-time French Open champion. She played little for the first six months of the year. Getting healthy was the priority.

Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches.

“Last year ended very poorly,” said Kevin. “I didn't see any of this coming. No one did.”

Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist.

The Mbokos moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three decades ago, to escape the First and Second Congo Wars of the mid-1990s. Visa issues kept the family separated, with Godée in Montreal and Cyprien in North Carolina. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby.

Victoria didn't let the losses in the final months of 2024 get to her.

“I just thought new year, new me,” she said during an interview in Rome.

She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. 10 seed at Roland-Garros, to a third-set tiebreak. Mboko can crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams.

But she has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around touch and feel. Against Osaka in Montreal, she won a crucial game in which she saved four break points with a feathered drop shot, after a long sequence of points that were played at the baseline. Osaka didn't see it coming.

In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. But the world No. 2 came away seriously impressed. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court.

“On the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that,” Gauff, probably the best mover in the sport, said.

Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined.

“She told me she was so out of steam, that she couldn't believe how Coco was getting every ball back,” she said Sunday.

“She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' It motivated her.”

It certainly did. When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. She knew that Gauff would raise her level, try to make her nervous, try to impose her experience on the match. Mboko didn't let her. She stayed even until 5-4, then broke Gauff to win the second set and the match.

Against Elena Rybakina, in a semifinal that ebbed and flowed, she looked out of the contest at the end of the first and third sets. But she refused to give in, breaking Rybakina twice as she served for the match.

And in the final, after Osaka did a demolition job on her in the opener, Mboko just kept going. She had learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff in Rome. She knew she had let the world No. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one.

Her coaches are onto this. So is she.

“They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said. “They'll actually say: ‘stay present, stay focused, or close it right here.'”

With 51 wins on the year, Mboko isn't exactly unfamiliar with closing it. Now she is doing it on the biggest stage in the sport.

NEW YORK — Former top-10 player Paula Badosa pulled out of the U.S. Open on Friday after dealing with a back injury that has sidelined her since a first-round loss at Wimbledon on June 30.

The U.S. Tennis Association announced Badosa's withdrawal and said Jil Teichmann would replace her in the field. Alizé Cornet, who retired from tennis last year but returned to action this year, is the next woman in line to get a berth in the draw at Flushing Meadows if someone else pulls out.



Play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in the singles brackets at the year's last Grand Slam tournament.

Badosa, a 27-year-old from Spain, reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022 and is currently No. 12.

She reached the semifinals at the Australian Open this January. Her best showing at the U.S. Open was a run to the quarterfinals last year.

Spain's Paula Badosa, ranked 12th in the world, has withdrawn from the US Open, tournament officials announced on Friday.

The 27-year-old Spaniard, who has battled back issues similar to those that kept her from the 2023 US Open, will miss the Flushing Meadows fortnight for the second time in three seasons after making a US Open last-eight run in 2024.

Badosa, who reached her first Grand Slam semi-final at this year's Australian Open, has not played since losing to Britain's Katie Boulter in the first round at Wimbledon.

Badosa had been set to pair with Britain's Jack Draper in mixed doubles as well as compete in women's singles.

In an Instagram message posted Friday, Badosa recounted her struggles without saying she would drop out of the US Open.

""I wasn't built by easy days. I was shaped by the moments that broke me, the choices that didn't go as planned and the times I fell short of who I wanted to be,"" Badosa recalled on social media.

""Failure taught me what success never could. It humbled me. It forced me to look inward, to ask hard questions, to rebuild with more intention and clarity.

""Every mistake I made sharpened my understanding of who I am and who I'm not. And while I once feared those mistakes, I now see them as some of my greatest teachers.""

Badosa has won four WTA titles, the most recent coming last August in Washington.

Her departure allows Swiss Jil Teichmann to reach the women's main draw for the Grand Slam showdown, which starts August 24.

France's Alize Cornet moves into the first alternate spot for the main draw.

Mirra Andreeva is out of the Cincinnati Open after picking up an injury in Montreal and that may be a bad sign ahead of the US Open. 

After losing in the Wimbledon quarterfinal to Belinda Bencic, the world No. 5 took some time before kicking off her North American hard-court swing in Montreal. At the Canadian Open - 20 days after her Wimbledon exit - the Russian tennis star had a first-round bye before Bianca Andreescu gave her a walkover in the second round. 

When Andreeva finally took to the court in Montreal, she made a slow start and dropped the first set to McCartney Kessler. To make it all worse, she had a nasty fall and injured her ankle.

After receiving a treatment, the 18-year-old managed to play out the entire match but Kessler won 7-6 (5) 6-4.

Andreeva being able to finish the match against Kessler was an encouraging thing. However, there was no way for the Russian to know the exact severity of the injury before having an MRI after the match. And since she is out of Cincinnati, everything is pointing toward it probably being a bit more serious than initially thought.

On August 24th, the US Open starts. With that being said, Andreeva still has more than two weeks to overcome her injury. However, even if the two-time WTA 1000 champion manages to play in Flushing Meadows, she will enter the tournament lacking matches - which is never a good thing.

But for Andreeva at the moment, certainly the most important thing is to at least be able to play at the US Open.

What a week for Victoria Mboko, who capped her breakout run by outlasting Naomi Osaka in three sets to win her first WTA 1000 title on home soil in Montreal.

Unlikely. Unexpected. Unforeseen. Those words seem to fall far short of explaining what happened in this abbreviated fortnight in Montreal.

Victoria Mboko, an 18-year-old Canadian wild card is the winner of the Omnium Banque Nationale. On Thursday night she completed another rousing comeback, defeating four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka 2-6, 6-4, 6-1.

It's the first WTA Tour title for Mboko.

Her fortnight included four victories over Grand Slam champions -- Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff, Elena Rybakina and Osaka. Gauff and Rybakina were seeded No. 1 and No. 3. It's the first time that's happened in a single tournament since Ons Jabeur and Elina Svitolina in Wimbledon 2023 -- but they weren't teenagers. Mboko is the second youngest to do it in the entire Open Era. The first was Serena Williams in 1999.

And to think: Mboko started the year ranked No. 333.

“It's been an incredible week here in Montreal,” Mboko said at the trophy presentation, going on to thank the ball kids, officials and volunteers. “I also want to thank Naomi for an incredible match. I've always looked up to her when I was really little, so it's always great to play with an amazing player like you.”\

“Lastly, I want to thank every single one of you who came to support me throughout this whole week. You guys were incredible, and I couldn't be more grateful.”

Mboko is only the third Canadian champion at the Canadian Open in the Open Era after Faye Urban in 1969 and Bianca Andreescu în 2019. She's also only the third wild card to win a WTA 1000 title since the format's introduction in 2009 after Maria Sharapova (Cincinnati 2011) and Bianca Andreescu (Indian Wells 2019).

It was a wild one, featuring 13 service breaks -- in 25 games.

The most telling statistic: Mboko converted eight of nine break points.

There were 32 seeded players in the Canadian Open, but none in this final -- for only the third time in the Open Era. For only the sixth time in a WTA 1000. Two players ranked outside the Top 40 of the WTA rankings faced each other in a WTA 1000 final for the first time since the format's introduction in 2009.

Mboko was a revelation here. Her ranking will soar to No. 24 -- up 61 spots.

Both had earlier saved match points, Osaka versus Liudmila Samsonova and Mboko against Elena Rybakina.

The first set was a testament to nerves and, quite possibly, a lingering wrist injury. The 18-year-old Canadian hit two double faults in her opening service game and was broken. Throughout the set, she flexed that heavily taped joint -- after falling on it in the semifinals against Rybakina.

Osaka breezed through the first set, never facing a break point and taking advantage of 22 unforced errors.

But in recent days, Mboko has continually shown a sturdy resilience for someone so young. She lost the first set to Marie Bouzkova in the third round before coming back to win in three. She lost the opening set to Rybakina by the same score -- and came back to win in a third-set tiebreak.

Mboko broke Osaka's serve four times in the second set and held a commanding 5-2 lead, but Osaka fought back and narrowed it to 5-4. Despite opening with a double fault (her 12th), Mboko closed it out when another Osaka forehand soared long.

While Mboko scored a break of Osaka's serve in the third game of the final set, it was the fourth that ultimately proved pivotal.

Mboko fell into a love-30 hole and kept digging out from Osaka's pressure. In a game that featured six deuces, she saved four break-point bids -- and then won it with a cold-hearted drop shot winner, sending the partisan crowd into hysterics.

That made it 4-1 and Mboko backed it up with a hold that ended with an ace and another Osaka forehand into the net.

She broke Osaka for the eight time when a backhand found the net and fell to her knees. The capacity crowd rose to its feet one more time and gave her a sustained ovation.

.

 

What a week for Victoria Mboko, who capped her breakout run by outlasting Naomi Osaka in three sets to win her first WTA 1000 title on home soil in Montreal.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

In tournaments, yes. But also through all the hours of training and travel that no one sees. At this level, proper hydration is the difference between reacting late or reading the play in time.”

But Sabalenka hasn't just added a new brand partner to her portfolio ahead of the North American hard-court summer. She has also shored up her coaching team by adding former doubles world No. 1 Max Mirnyi for the upcoming Cincinnati and US Open tournaments.According to a report in *The Athletic*, Mirnyi was on-court with Sabalenka for her most recent training block after Wimbledon, during which the three-time Grand Slam champion asked her fellow Belarusian to advise her as a consultant.For the next month, the 10-time Grand Slam doubles champion will join Sabalenka's primary coach Anton Dubrov, performance coach Jason Stacy, and the rest of her already established team—though the report said that ""a representative for Sabalenka did not specify the areas on which Mirnyi will focus.""

The acclaimed horror pic and the female-fueled 'Freaky Friday' sequel are expected to end up in a close race for No.1  at the weekend box office.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Disney's body-swapping comedy  Freakier Friday and New Line's acclaimed mystery-comedy Weapons are off to the races at the late-summer box office.


	The two August pics are expected to end up in a close race for No. 1 domestically and topple Marvel Studio' struggling holdover The Fantastic Four: The First Steps from the top spot. Marvel and parent company Disney are still hopeful that Fantastic Four will rebound, but there are no assurances.




	Horror could use a win after such box office bombs as Blumhouse and Atomic Monsters' M3GAN 2.0, which opened to only $10 million in June on its way to topping at $40 million worldwide, compared to $180 million for the first film.

					Josh Brolin and Julia Garner Clash in 'Weapons' But Their Bond Off-Screen Was ""Cellular, Sibling Sh**""		
			









Zach Cregger's Weapons — which currently boasts a 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes — grossed a hefty $5.7 million in previews. It had been tracking for a domestic debut in the $25 million to $30 million range, but could come in higher. The R-rated title was the subject of a heated bidding war when it hit the market, with New Line and parent company Warners plunking down $38 million for the package, which including a $10 million payday for Cregger, who made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed.


	New Line is also home of Final Destination: Bloodlines, which earned $5.5 million in previews earlier this summer on its way to a domestic debut of $51.5 million (there's a lot more male-skewing product in the marketplace presently).


Weapons, an original story, stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child, and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it.

	











	Aden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which will be playing on coveted Imax Screens (Imax is also rereleasing summer hit 51: The Movie on select screens this weekend before offering more showings the following week.)


Freakier Friday will play in hundreds of other premium large format screens, including Dolby Cinema auditoriums. 


	The family comedy — reuniting Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis 23 years after Freaky Friday opened — earned $3.1 million previews, including special sneaks on Wednesday. That's on par or ahead of Elvis ($3.5 million), the most recent Mean Girls ($3.3 million) and The Lost City ($2.5 million), all of which opened in the $28 million to $31 million range domestically. That lines up with what prerelease tracking shows for Freakier Friday.


	Already boasting a 94 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, It's the first event pic in weeks to target females, and should also benefit from the nostalgia factor. A fun tidbit: after all this time, the 2003 film has popped up on the top 10 list of most watched films on Disney+ in the last week or so.


	Directed by Nisha Ganatra, the modestly budgeted $42 million movie picks up after the events of the first film, when Lohan's character, Tess, swapped bodies with her mother, played by Curtis. This time out, in a multigenerational twist, they find themselves swapping places, respectively, with the daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter of Tess. Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Vanessa Bayer, and Mark Harmon also star.

	











	The Freaky Friday franchise, which also includes a 1976 film, is based on the book by Mary Rodgers. Disney has enjoyed great success in tapping into nostalgia and luring young adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up on previous installments in its library. For example, it's live-action tentpole Lilo & Stitch, based on the 2002 animated film, is the only Hollywood pic of 2025 so far to clear the $1 billion milestone after attracting both families and non-parents.


	Film studios execs across Hollywood lament how comedies have become an endangered species in the streaming age. Last weekend, Paramount's Naked Gun reboot bucked this trend in opening to nearly $17 million domestically. While that film is considered more of a straight-up comedy, versus a family comedy such as Freakier Friday, it will be good news for all if they both work.

The comedy superstar is making the rounds to promote his casino heist film ""The Pickup"" with Pete Davidson.

	But one A-list tale he's kept hidden until now is a special moment he shared with Beyoncé when they appeared together in the 2006 movie adaptation of beloved Broadway musical Dreamgirls. “I did Dreamgirls right when I was getting divorced,” Murphy told Complex's 360 With Speedy podcast this week about the period in 2005 when he was splitting with ex-wife Nicole Murphy after a dozen years together.

	“I was kind of like on automatic pilot, and I don't remember a lot of making the movie,” he said of the Dec. 2006 release that featured Jamie Foxx playing a Berry Gordy Jr.-esque label boss, as well as Beyoncé as Deena Jones, a character inspired by Diana Ross. Murphy earned his first, and only, Oscar nomination to date for best supporting actor for his role as James Brown-like soul-stirrer James “Thunder” Early.

	He said that neither Beyoncé nor their co-star Jennifer Hudson — who won a best supporting actress Oscar in her debut film role as Effie White — know about a unique, sweet moment he observed  on set one day. “I watched Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé, they were in between shots, they were on stage, and Jennifer was new in show business and she had, I guess a finger, right between, was ashy, and she was licking her fingers and getting the ash like that,” he said, pantomiming licking an index finger and rubbing it on a digit on the other hand.


	He said Beyoncé grabbed Hudson and said, “‘Oh girl, don't do that. I'll get you some cream. It was quiet between the two of them, but I saw it.”


	Murphy is currently making the rounds promoting the Amazon MGM Studios casino heist comedy The Pickup, in which he co-stars with Pete Davidson, Eva Longoria and Keke Palmer.

The musician was joined by thousands of fans screaming every word at her Los Angeles concert.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Gracie Abrams performed a song that wasn't hers at her Los Angeles concert Thursday night (Aug. 7), but her fans still knew every word all too well.


	During the B-stage portion of her Secret of Us Tour set at the Kia Forum, the singer-songwriter surprised her audience by covering Taylor Swift‘s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” in full — but not before giving her close friend and former tourmate a sweet shout-out. “I was talking to her earlier today,” Abrams said of the pop superstar.

	











	“It just is not lost on me that the reason that a lot of us know each other is because I got to meet many of you through doing the Eras Tour with Taylor,” she continued. “I just feel like I'm forever missing what that experience was. I know we all feel that way … I wanted to sing a song for you that I'll forever wish I wrote, if you've got 10 minutes.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The California native went on to perform the entirety of the lengthy record-setting Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit with the audience scream-singing each word of Swift's nostalgic verses, fiery bridge and haunting outro from start to finish. “Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much/ But maybe this thing was a masterpiece, 'til you tore it all up,” Abrams sang over the noise of the crowd, accompanying herself on a small red keyboard in the center of the arena. 

	











	The performance comes about eight months after Swift's global Eras trek wrapped after two years in December, with Abrams serving as the opener on the final North American leg. She'd also supported the 14-time Grammy winner at multiple shows when the tour first kicked off in 2023. 


	While traveling the world together, Abrams and Swift developed a friendship that eventually sparked a collaboration: “Us,” which appears on the former's breakout The Secret of Us album. 


	In her Billboard cover story published in April, Abrams told staff writer Hannah Dailey that having Swift in her life has helped her stay grounded as her own star has risen over the past year. “It's like, I really don't have it that bad in terms of invasion of privacy, you know what I mean?” she said at the time. “I feel like I learned a lot from her, obviously, but one of the things that I've felt lucky to observe is how extreme it can be [for her]. It helps right-size my own s–t.”


	Abrams is now closing in on the end of her own headlining tour, with the star having just five more dates on her show calendar before the Secret of Us trek concludes Aug. 27 in Mexico City.


	Watch Abrams cover “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” below.

	Other acts confirmed to perform at the show include Bastille, Cat Burns, Greentea Peng, Hot Chip, James Blake, King Krule, Mabel, Obongjayar, Paloma Faith, Rachel Chinouriri and Sampha alongside Palestinian artists such as Adnan Joubran, Faraj Suleiman and Nai Barghouti, with more performers to be announced in the coming weeks. PinkPantheress, Rina Sawayama and Riz Ahmed are also slated to contribute with an appearance. More names are set to be revealed in the coming weeks.


	Eno will serve as executive producer for the evening along with production managers Khaled Ziada, Khalid Abdalla and Tracey Seaward. “In the face of the horrors of Gaza, silence becomes complicity. Artists have always helped societies to point out injustice and imagine better futures,” he said in a statement. “That's why this concert matters. It's time for us to come together – not just to raise our voices, but to reaffirm our shared humanity.”

	











	Ziada added, “In a world where governments and mainstream media have fallen silent in the face of genocide, this gathering becomes a chorus of resistance – where artists and communities come together to grieve, to rage and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian people, and with all those who suffer injustice.”


	Upon announcing the event July 31, Eno posted a lengthy statement to Instagram that discussed his intentions behind launching Together for Palestine.


	“What we are witnessing in Gaza isn't a mystery, and neither is it a blur of competing narratives making it ‘hard to understand',” it read in part. “When dozens of non-partisan organisations like Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders describe it as genocide, the moral line is clear. We can't remain silent. Which is why I'm helping to organise Together for Palestine – a night of music, reflection and hope at Wembley Arena.”


	He added: “My sincere belief is that this evening can become a moment of courage where artists come together to speak the truth in their hearts – which is what we trust artists to do. Whether on stage or by video from around the world, this is a chance for us to stand together and say: this can't continue.”


	The war was sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, during which more than 1,200 Israeli civilians were killed by Hamas fighters, who also took more than 250 hostages. Since then, Gaza's Health Ministry has reported that more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed. In late July, the World Health Organization reported that malnutrition rates among civilians and children have reached alarming levels.


	Eno formed part of a group of musicians in July who announced the formation of a syndicate for artists speaking out about Israel's military assault on Gaza, who they say have been subjected to “aggressive, vexatious campaigns” by pro-Israel advocates. Other names involved include Fontaines D.C., Kneecap and Massive Attack.

	











Posting on Instagram, the artists said their aim was to protect other artists, particularly those at early stages of their careers, from being “threatened into silence or career cancellation” by organizations such as U.K. Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI).

	On the TV side, Pascal most recently earned a Lead Actor Emmy nomination for his performance in season two of HBO's The Last of Us. Pascal garnered Lead Actor Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance in season 1. 

	











	Other recent credits include Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, Freaky Tales and  Pedro Almodovar's A Strange Way Of Life.

EXCLUSIVE: After hitting it big with the Sydney Sweeney-Glen Powell rom-com Anyone but You, Will Gluck hopes lightning strikes twice as he looks to have landed on another pair of young stars to light up the screen for his next feature. Sources tell Deadline that Monica Barbaro and Callum Turner are set to star in One Night Only for Universal Pictures.


	Sources also say the film will bow on August 7, 2026. Gluck will direct the project based on his rewrite of Travis Braun's Black List script.


The script topped the 2024 Blacklist, and while it's unknown if Gluck's version will stray from the original story, the draft follows two strangers who scramble to find someone to sleep with on the one night of the year when premarital sex is legal.

	











	Gluck will produce through Olive Bridge Entertainment. Jacqueline Monetta, VP of Olive Bridge Entertainment, will oversee and produce with Gluck. Senior EVP Production Development Erik Baiers and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell will oversee the project for the studio.

RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office


	Gluck had been weighing a handful of options following the success of Anyone but You and finally landed on this project on his next film. Given his track record of taking rising stars including Emma Stone,  Sweeney and Powell and turning them into A-listers, the project attracted a ton of talent; Barbaro and Turner were top choices from the start.


	Barbaro has had a slew of offers to choose from following her first Academy Award nomination earlier this year for her star-making performance as the iconic folk singer and activist Joan Baez in James Mangold's Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown. She is in production on Luca Guadagnino's Artificial opposite Yura Borisov and Andrew Garfield for Amazon MGM.


	Next up, Barbaro will make her stage debut at London's National Theatre in a revival of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' Les Liasons Dangereuses opposite Lesley Manville and directed by Tony and Olivier Award winner Marianne Elliott. She'll also star in Bart Layton's Crime 101 opposite Mark Ruffalo, Halle Berry and Chris Hemsworth for Amazon MGM. Barbaro is also known for her breakout role as Phoenix opposite Tom Cruise and Miles Teller in Top Gun: Maverick, which received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.

	











	As for Turner, he next will star in the film Rose of Nevada from Protagonist Pictures, written and directed by Mark Jenkin, opposite George MacKay, which will have its world premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. He also will star in A24's romantic comedy feature film Eternity, directed by David Freyne, opposite Elizabeth Olsen and Miles Teller. The film is set to debut at the 2025 Toronto Film Festival in September before its theatrical release in November. Also upcoming, Turner will appear in the drama thriller film Rosebush Prunning, directed by Karim Aïnouz, starring alongside Jamie Bell, Riley Keough, Elle Fanning and Pamela Anderson.


	Turner recently completed production on Neuromancer, Apple TV+'s adaptation of William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk novel. He will star as Case in the 10-episode series from creators Graham Roland and JD Dillard. He also attended the 2025 Sundance Film Festival for the world premiere of Atropia, a war satire film written and directed by Hailey Gates, produced by Guadagnino, also starring Alia Shawkat. The film won the Grand Jury Prize in the festival's U.S. Dramatic Competition.


	Gluck directed the 2023 box office hit Anyone but You, starring Powell and Sweeney. He also helmed 2011's Friends with Benefits, starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, and 2010's Easy A starring Stone, in addition to launching the Peter Rabbit franchise.


	Barbaro is represented by UTA, Range Media Partners and Meyer & Downs. Turner is represented by WME and Curtis Brown (UK). Gluck is repped by UTA and Sloane Offer.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: New Line has enlisted screenwriters Ben Zazove and Evan Turner to pen a Space Invaders movie, inspired by the classic Taito arcade game, Deadline has learned.


	No word yet on specifics, as to the story they're spinning here. Weed Road Pictures' Akiva Goldsman will produce alongside Safehouse Pictures partners Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell, with Greg Lessans & Rachel Wizenberg overseeing for Weed Road, and Matt Schwartz overseeing for Safehouse Pictures.


	One of history's most iconic arcade games, and one of the pioneering titles in the shoot 'em up gaming genre, Space Invaders tasks players with defending Earth from an alien invasion, shooting down waves of invaders moving across the screen before they reach the ground. Tomohiro Nishikado developed the title, released by Taito in 1978.

	











Space Invaders‘ commercial success has been described as the catalyst for the golden age of arcade gaming in the late '70s and early '80s. After becoming a cultural phenomenon, it spawned numerous sequels, remakes, and adaptations across arcades and home consoles.

	Writers Zazove and Turner are behind Officer Exchange, an action-comedy in development at Amazon MGM Studios, with The Safran Company producing and John Cena attached to star. Their previous film, The Out-Laws — an action comedy starring Adam Devine, Pierce Brosnan, and Ellen Barkin — debuted at #1 on Netflix. Also known for his work on Sherlock Gnomes, Zazove is repped by Verve, Kaplan/Perrone and attorneys Jeff Frankel and Farhad Amid.

This week, South Park aired its second episode of the second Trump presidency, largely taking aim at secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem. Throughout the episode, the Noem character shoots every dog she comes across, sex trafficks Dora The Explorer, raids “brown people” from heaven, and is constantly getting re-made-up and getting botox shots as her face melts and at one point tries to flee from her. It's this last element that Noem has specifically condemned. 

Calling into Glenn Beck's radio show on Thursday (via The Daily Beast), Noem says that she “didn't get to see” the episode because she “was going over budget numbers and stuff.” Noem continues, “It never ends, but it's so lazy to constantly make fun of women for how they look. It's always the liberals and the extremists who do that. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can't, they just pick something petty like that.” In fairness, Noem says she didn't see the episode, and it inarguably does make fun of her appearance. But it also absolutely criticizes her job, and homeland security at large. 

Anyone who wasn't born yesterday may recall a similar maneuver from the first Trump administration, when Michelle Wolf made jokes about Sarah Huckabee Sanders being a liar, and Sanders responding by criticizing the jokes about her appearance to attempt to shift the conversation away from the substantive critiques. But South Park is not Michelle Wolf and is content to just plainly make fun of a woman's appearance. The show has since updated its X profile picture to depict the Noem character's face melting as it does in the episode. We'll see how this beef progresses during the eight remaining episodes in this season of South Park.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Will And Just Like That… have the courage to let Carrie end up alone?","https://www.avclub.com/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-11","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:45:00 GMT","

I can't begin before acknowledging the truth that hangs over this episode: We are in the final stretch of And Just Like That…, as Michael Patrick King and Sarah Jessica Parker both acknowledged that season three will be the show's last. “While I was writing the last episode of And Just Like That… season three, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,” King wrote on social media last week. 

At first, I felt the relief that I imagine will accompany the sweet release of death. There would be no more watching and then trying to justify the most nonsensical plot and character developments that I've witnessed in my lifetime. But then I felt a gentle pang of regret. Have I been too hard on Carrie (Parker) and the girls? 

But by the time Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) was attempting to justify inviting Brady's (Niall Cunningham) baby mama to Thanksgiving without his knowledge or consent, reader, I knew that I had not been too hard on AJLT. This show is indeed batshit crazy and deserves all of my ire. 

Miranda is hosting her first-ever Thanksgiving and aspiring chef Brady is cooking, so everyone is being supportive—everyone, that is, except Harry (Evan Handler), who neatly plays the cancer card to get out of it so he can eat and watch football in the comfort of his own home. I can't believe Charlotte (Kristen Davis) falls for this, but also I kind of get it. To show her support, Carrie is pre-ordering pies from the bakery in her old neighborhood, which leads her to wander down the street in the gorgeous New York fall past her old apartment.

“Part of me still lives here,” Carrie tells Miranda on the phone wistfully. Yeah, babe, maybe don't sell your iconic apartment for a man. At that moment, Lisette (Katerina Tannenbaum) exits said apartment and invites Carrie to a Friendsgiving the following week. Though she's been absent for most of this season, Lisette has always served as an avatar for younger Carrie, and it's fitting that she just got out of a relationship (seven months–her record) at the same time Carrie split from Aidan (22 years–her record, if we can count a marriage in the middle).  

Other than trying to get out of Thanksgiving, Harry is still obsessing over his penis, which hasn't been able to get hard after his surgery. Potentially even weirder is Charlotte's obsession with Rock's (Alexa Swinton) costume for Thoroughly Modern Millie, which has them leaning into the femme side of her nonbinary identity. “Rock in the Millie costume is so grown up and so pretty, and I don't know if I'm allowed to say that,” Charlotte confesses to Carrie and Miranda. Is this how Charlotte is going to go out? Retreading mourning her daughter's gender identity, the way she did back in season one? I'd hoped for more.

Carrie has also turned in the novel she's been working on all season to her editor, who loves it—except for the ending. Carrie has left her protagonist alone in her garden at the end, which would be a tragedy in 1846, but maybe also in 2025? Will AJLT let Carrie finish her story on her own? The editor wants an epilogue that makes the reader feel good at the end—an ask that makes Carrie chafe. “I like the ending,” she says. “I thought it was honest.”

She misses her old apartment and she's wondering if the new house—finally decorated in her own taste—is right for her. After all, she bought it with a plan that won't happen. When Seema (Sarita Choudhury) tells her the owners of Duncan's basement unit are willing to sell so she can own the entire house, Carrie is fairly devastated by the revelation that Duncan won't be returning. “Why am I so upset right now?” she asks Seema, who doesn't have a clue. The woman in the garden doesn't want to be alone!

Carrie admits to Seema that she's nervous to go back to the old apartment for Lisette's gathering. “What if I miss it?” she says. “The chipping woodwork, the shitty kitchen, the warped floors?” Seema asks, and Carrie nods. Only one way to find out! 

She returns to the apartment—the scene of so many of her memories (and of ours). But Lisette has not left the property untouched as a shrine to the Sex And The City days. No, she's erected a wall and divided the apartment in two so that a male roommate can live there with her. Except for that closet, the space is unrecognizable. “I hated coming home to an empty apartment,” Lissette says. As if that weren't enough, she adds, “Doesn't it bother you, living in that big house by yourself?” Carrie laments that whoever said you can't go home again was right, and she means that literally in the apartment, but also for us. Try as we might through this series, we could never return to Sex And The City.

“American Idol” alum Kelly Clarkson is going through a tough time. Kelly lost her ex-husband and the father of her kids, Brandon Blackstock. Blackstock passed away at age 48 in August 2025 following a private, 3-year-long battle with cancer. 

Just hours before his passing, Kelly Clarkson publicly revealed that her ex-husband was “ill.” 

Kelly wasn't Brandon's only partner.  Before his relationship with Kelly, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth. Here is a deeper look at their relationship.

The two tied the knot in 2001 and remained married until 2012. Their relationship mostly stayed out of the public eye, as Ashworth is not a public figure.

While not much is known about her personal life, Ashworth reportedly worked as a secretary during her marriage to Blackstock. She largely avoided the spotlight, even as her ex-husband became more prominent in the entertainment world.

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

The former couple welcomed two children: Savannah and Seth. Blackstock became a father for the first time when he welcomed daughter Savannah with Ashworth. The two seemed to share a close bond. In December 2018, Savannah posted an Instagram photo from a father-daughter ski trip. Then in February 2019, she called him her “favorite person,” writing he was “hands down” her top pick.

Savannah, born in June 2002, is now a mother herself, giving birth to her daughter Lake Lee in January 2022, making Ashworth and Blackstock grandparents. 

Their son, Seth, was born in November 2006. Savanna, who is now 23 years old, is pregnant with her second baby. One noteworthy fact is that Kelly Clarkson shares a warm bond with Savannah as she follows her on Instagram. 

Despite the complicated dynamics of blended families, Ashworth remained positive and supportive of Blackstock's second marriage. 

In a 2014 interview with Radar Online, she said, “I love Kelly and we get along great, and my husband and I hang out with them all the time.”

She added, “I adore Kelly and Brandon as a couple, so if I say anything it's going to be positive.”

Melissa has largely stayed out of the public eye over the years, though she later married a man named Chris White. 

Details about their life together remain unknown as Ashworth has continued to maintain her privacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Inside Brandon Blackstock and Blake Shelton's Decades-Long Friendship","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/brandon-blackstock-blake-sheltons-friendship/","Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:04:52 GMT","

Brandon Blackstock was connected to Blake Shelton long before his high-profile marriage to Kelly Clarkson. From managing Shelton's career to sharing personal milestones, the two forged a bond that spanned nearly two decades.

Blackstock grew up in the music industry thanks to his father, Narvel Blackstock, who managed several big-name artists and was married to country music legend Reba McEntire. Following in his father's footsteps, he joined Starstruck Entertainment, the management company behind Shelton, Carly Pearce, and other chart-topping acts.

It was during rehearsals for the 2006 ACM Awards that Blackstock first crossed paths with Clarkson, who was then managed by Narvel. While romance wasn't immediate, the introduction set the stage for a relationship that would eventually pull Shelton closer into their orbit.

Years after their first meeting, Blackstock and Clarkson reconnected at Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Clarkson performed the national anthem, while Shelton sang “America the Beautiful” alongside then-wife Miranda Lambert.

“I was so nervous because it wasn't that I didn't want to suck for the millions of people watching,” Clarkson told SiriusXM in 2017, per US Weekly. “I didn't want to suck because I was trying to impress a guy, I wanted [Brandon] to be like, ‘Damn.' It had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!”

Before Blackstock proposed, Shelton made it clear where he stood. “I told Brandon, ‘Man, you need to grow up and figure out that you need to marry this girl,'” Shelton told Hollyscoop in 2012. “I am going to go on record saying, ‘I will do the music at the wedding or whatever you want to do, I'll be that guy.'”

True to his word, Shelton not only performed but also officiated the couple's 2013 wedding at Blackberry Farms in Tennessee. “He totally is, he's done it before with people,” Clarkson told Entertainment Tonight ahead of the ceremony.

When Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020, her split from Blackstock quickly turned contentious. While Shelton didn't publicly address the breakup, TMZ reported in 2021 that he ended his professional relationship with Blackstock.

An insider told Us Weekly at the time, “Blake and Kelly are extremely close. Their friendship and bond goes beyond the business.” The source also noted that Blackstock had largely stepped away from the music industry after the divorce.

On Thursday, August 7, Starstruck Entertainment, the music agency where Blackstock once worked, confirmed his death in a statement to People.

“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

At this point, it's fair to say that no human being who has ever walked the earth has been better at adapting movies into TV shows than Noah Hawley. The man turned “Fargo” into an acclaimed crime anthology series whose only real connection to the Coen brothers film was its distinctly Midwestern brand of dark folksiness. He found prestige TV source material in the “X-Men” franchise with “Legion,” one of the boldest episodic superhero projects of the 21st century. 

And now he's doubling down for his biggest bet yet: “Alien: Earth.” The new series sees Hawley offering an earthbound origin story for Ridley Scott's iconic sci-fi franchise that IndieWire's Ben Travers called “a fascinating and frightening extension of an oft-confined space.”

 








Related Stories Documentarian Amy Berg Obsessed Over Jeff Buckley for Decades — Then She Finally Got to Make a Film About Him ‘Weapons' Is the Original Summer Surprise We've Been Waiting for 

At a private event at Hawley's Austin offices attended by IndieWire, reporters were treated to a wide-ranging conversation with the showrunner about the gargantuan task of bringing “Alien” to the small screen. Here's what he had to say about many of the burning questions surrounding his new show. 

 










“Alien: Earth” is often more concerned with mergers than extraterrestrials, following five corporations (including the infamous Weyland-Yutani) fighting for control of the planet and the stars above it. Hawley acknowledged that it won't be hard for many to find allegories for modern America in the show, but noted that he didn't try particularly hard to make “Alien: Earth” topical. Instead, he sees it as a natural extension of the class politics that have always infiltrated the franchise.

“I could not have predicted when I first started writing the show a few years back that we would be where we are now in terms of tech companies, etc.” Hawley said. “So it's like if you try to hit the zeitgeist or if you try to avoid the zeitgeist, there's kind of no way to game it in that way. So I know that one of the things that ‘Alien' is, to me, it is a movie about class. You start the first movie with space truckers, and then the second movie [James Cameron's ‘Aliens'] is about grunts. Paul Reiser is middle management at best, right? There's this sense of class as a real issue as a 1970s thing that came into it. So I wanted to bring that element into this as well. And it's just because we're on Earth, we are engaging with the top class and not just the bottom class.”

 










There have been a lot of “Alien” movies over the decades, many of which selectively try to erase parts of each other's lore. Hawley explained that the only two films his show acknowledges as canon are “Alien” and “Aliens,” and he's not racing to make direct connections with either of them.  

“I think we're telling a parallel story,” he said. “I'm not actively engaging with the films themselves in terms of who's on the other end of the phone or that idea. So I'm not looking to connect it to those movies literally. I think it's more taking the elements of original films and expanding them for my own purposes. And it's sort of remarkable how little mythology there is to a franchise that's six movies deep. … All we really know about the way humanity is organized is that it's built around a corporation, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. And so I just expanded that to more of a corporate power struggle.”

That means that Scott's prequels “Prometheus” and “Alien: Covenant” don't factor into Hawley's plans, largely due to changes they made to the Xenomorph mythology. 

“I think that for me, other than the shark in ‘Jaws,' this is the most iconic monster in all of film history. And I lived for whatever, 28 years of my life believing that this creature was the perfect organism that had evolved over millions of years,” he said. “And then Ridley made ‘Prometheus' and engaged with another idea in terms of the origin of these creatures, that it wasn't part of my DNA of what these movies were to me. And so I chose not to engage with that part of the story and to just sort of speak to the alien that I had encoded.”

 










Ridley Scott might be the busiest 87-year-old on the planet, so his involvement in the show was minimal. But Hawley explained that the two men had plenty of conversations about the franchise's origins — and the famously uninhibited director had more to say than Joel and Ethan Coen did when discussing “Fargo.”

“He told me a lot of stories. Which, of course, is the greatest thing that a filmmaker can have: an audience with the greats. And the Coens are much less forthcoming about everything,” Hawley said of Scott. “Being able to have access to Ridley and the conversations about it. And one of the things as we were researching and building the ship, which as you see is very much reminiscent of the ship from the first film, was that we found all this archival material and blueprints and photos that Fox had had that Ridley hadn't seen since 1979. So I think there was something really exciting about that idea. And when you build that bridge or the comms room and you step into it, it does this crazy thing where time collapses. You're stepping into the movie that you grew up watching, and it was just a really profound effect for a filmmaker.”

Scott wasn't the only legendary sci-fi director that Hawley consulted. He explained that one of his biggest influences on “Alien: Earth” were the films of Denis Villeneuve, who took time to offer his thoughts on the project.

 










“I reached out to Denis Villeneuve when I was making this because I found, as I went through the images that were going up on the mood board, the ones that weren't from ‘Alien' were ‘Dune' or ‘Arrival,'” Hawley said. “And a lot of that has to do with the sense of scale. He's so good at really feeling the bigness of things, creating, whether it's a long lens and a full-scale person. And he's also so great at making something huge that feels so intimate at the same time. So to the degree that he was willing to talk shop with me. We've had a couple of conversations about it. Because I think that's what's important. The television is not a small screen anymore, and so we're making these things. I mean, there's many people who've only ever seen ‘Alien' on a small screen or ‘Dune' on a small screen, but you can still feel that sense of scale.”

Hawley acknowledged the unique perch he occupies in the entertainment industry, saying that he enjoys adapting films into episodic series, which allows him to frequently offer his own responses to the art he loves without being burdened by the obligation to recreate any of it.

“The first novel that I wrote, I had a little forward to it, and I said, ‘If fiction is a dialogue between writers, I add this into the debate.' And I feel the same with this,” he said. “I get to engage with the Coen Brothers. You know what I mean? I get to say, ‘Oh, I loved that movie and it made me think this.' They're not in a dialogue with me, but I'm in a dialogue with them. And it was the same thing here, or with the X-Men on ‘Legion,' to be able to say, ‘Oh, I loved how that made me feel.' And then I had this idea and now I can play with the films themselves, which is really exciting.”

 










“Alien: Earth” premieres Tuesday, August 12 at 8 p.m. ET on FX and Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly through the Season 1 finale on September 23.

Sam Nivola just might be living out M. Night Shyamalan's “Old.” The breakout “The White Lotus” actor is lamenting how difficult it is for rising, younger stars to land roles in Hollywood due to older, more established actors extending their careers by way of plastic surgery; the augmentations allow for actors to play characters who were meant to be years younger than the stars' themselves. Nivola warns that the cycle is icing out new talent, and might leave a deficit in Hollywood after certain aging actors pass away. 

“The old movie stars are getting plastic surgery, and they're looking younger and they're staying young,” Nivola told Variety during a recent interview. “You have these really old people playing young roles. And it's not giving any space for the young'uns to move in and make a name for themselves. With all due respect to those people, one day they won't be here any more, literally, and they will have to create new stars…”

Nivola's role in “White Noise” led to his mother Emily Mortimer co-writing Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” which in part speaks to this trend: The much-anticipated ensemble film centers on an aging actor (George Clooney) grappling with his legacy.

 










Nivola cited how one of Baumbach's partner Greta Gerwig's muses, Timothée Chalamet, is one of the few examples of a modern movie star. “I think Timothée Chalamet is one of the best actors alive, and he's a total star,” he said. “He's one of a very few examples I could come up with. But it's a different kind of movie star; he's not huge and jacked.” 

Nivola also revealed that he feels as though he has been typecast after “The White Lotus.” He's been offered to play similar roles, which Nivola described as “socially awkward, virginal kids who are a little weird.”

“I'm starting to feel a little boxed in by the characters I've played in my career,” he said. “But I'm also finally getting offers to do things where I'm a little more grown up. Hopefully the next one will be something a little different.”

Nivola isn't the only star speaking out against plastic surgery: Jamie Lee Curtis recently told The Guardian that plastic surgery has “wiped out a generation or two of natural human [appearance].” Curtis continued, “The concept that you can alter the way you look through chemicals, surgical procedures, fillers — there's a disfigurement of generations of predominantly women who are altering their appearances. And it is aided and abetted by AI, because now the filter face is what people want. I'm not filtered right now. The minute I lay a filter on and you see the before and after, it's hard not to go: ‘Oh, well that looks better.' But what's better? Better is fake. And there are too many examples – I will not name them – but very recently we have had a big onslaught through media, many of those people. … There is a genocide of a generation of women by the cosmeceutical industrial complex, who've disfigured themselves.”

After 30 years, “Nadja” will return to theaters — this time with a 4K director's cut to showcase Michael Almereyda's original vision for the cult vampire film. “Nadja,” executive produced by late auteur David Lynch (who also has a cameo in the film), first debuted at the 1994 Toronto International Film Festival. Now, the 4K restoration of the feature will premiere at TIFF 2025.

IndieWire can announce that Grasshopper Film and Arbelos will be distributing “Nadja” in 4K. Grasshopper Film and Arbelos acquired the international distribution rights for the new version and will release it in North American theaters in late 2025, followed by a release on streaming platforms.

“Nadja” blends André Breton's surrealist 1928 novel of the same name with 1936 film “Dracula's Daughter.” Elina Löwensohn stars as the titular young vampire who returns to NYC to avenge her father's death at the hands of Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Fonda). Jared Harris, Martin Donovan, Suzy Amis, Galaxy Craze, and Karl Geary co-star.

“Nadja” was shot in black-and-white 35mm with Pixelvision video by Jim Denault. Almereyda wrote and directed, with Mary Sweeney and Amy Hobby producing and Lynch executive producing.

“Michael Almereyda's ‘Nadja' is a singular work of American independent cinema — daring, dreamlike, irreverent, and intoxicatingly alive. It's an honor to reintroduce this visionary film in its original director's cut and in a luminous new restoration,” Grasshopper Film's Ryan Krivoshey said. “We're delighted to be collaborating with Arbelos on its release as well as the film's original cast and crew. And we're especially grateful to work with Michael once again in bringing another of his remarkable films to audiences.”

David Marriott of Arbelos added, “'Nadja' is easily one of the most inventive and visually striking films to emerge from the '90s American independent movement.

Machine Gun Kelly‘s new album Lost Americana is here (you know, the one Bob Dylan casually narrated the trailer for). While fans are already mining for details about his personal life in the songs, the musician addressed some aspects himself on The New York Times‘ Popcast.


	On the podcast, MGK revealed that the penultimate track “Treading Water” is about his time in rehab in late 2024 (he first went to a facility in 2023). “I wrote this in Room Three, spending Christmas in rehabilitation/I got no phone, just a cell that I'm trapped in while my home's vacant,” he sings on the bridge. 


	In another verse, he seems to address his on-off relationship with Megan Fox. “This'll be the last time you hear me say sorry/That'll be the last tear you waste on me crying/I broke this home,” he sings. “Just ruined their holiday, and lies don't die, they grow/And everything you try to hide eventually shows.”


Though he told the podcast that the music “speaks better than how I would be able to articulate it,” he did open up more about his rehab stay and split from Fox (the two welcomed a daughter in March). “Here's the real truth,” he said. “I spent Christmas and New Years — the whole month of December and late November — in a rehab facility. I came out, the world was very loud about me and my personal business. Ironically, neither me or Megan have said anything. Still, to this day, there could have been zero drama, and you would never know, 'cause none of us have said one thing. It's all claims and things that have happened out of our control.”

	











	Elsewhere in the podcast, he spoke about the pop gem “Sweet Coraline,” named after the 2009 animated classic that was influenced by the Strokes. He says he was inspired to write the track following a bizarre fan encounter with a tourist in New York, who approached him and asked, “How did you fumble Megan Fox?”

	“To be fair, I think as a songwriter, I've been really slept on for a long time,” he added. “There is so much complexity in simplicity … every one of these, I got a story,” he said. “The point of something about ‘Sweet Coraline,' you could dismiss it, ‘Oh, it's a song about a girl.' This is a song about one sentence that I extrapolated into an entire record.”

	On Aug. 4, fans of the HBO Max series Love Life were given a gift. The television show was added to Netflix, a reprieve from the three-year drought that left fans unable to access the Anna Kendrick and William Jackson Harper-helmed anthology series. 


	For creator Sam Boyd, having Love Life return to streaming has been a welcome change. In the time since its cancellation, fans have repeatedly reached out to ask the best way to stream it. For a while it was on HBO Max, then Amazon Video to rent, then, for a time, on Tubi, with ads. He's glad people who loved the show will have another chance to watch it again, but the experience has touched on why he started — and still does — collect physical copies of his favorite shows and movies. 


	“I used to get DVD box sets of shows that I loved that had only been on [for] a season or two,” he tells Rolling Stone. “That was a formative thing for me. There was just something that felt fun and special. It made you feel like you saw something that was missed.” 

	











	It's no surprise then, that at the same time Boyd is hopeful that a new batch of Love Life-heads are just a Netflix scroll away, television film collector culture is having a resurgence online. When streaming services first took off in the mid-2000s, they promised consumers a new world, where movie night didn't have to start with a drive to Blockbuster and pricy cable packages could be dropped without sacrificing your favorite shows. Almost two decades later, streaming has become the default, not the scrappy competitor. According to Pew Research, close to 83 percent of adults in the U.S. subscribe to at least one streaming service, the number of which steadily grows. 

	











	These days, consumers aren't entirely happy with the trade off. Licensing deals mean the film that was on Netflix for two years can leave and take a spin on a platform you don't pay for, older films can have controversial scenes edited out, or an original series can get cancelled and disappear entirely. For many of these series, like Love Life, box sets or DVDs have never been available to purchase, meaning streaming is the only way to see it. When it leaves a streamer, it virtually disappears for the average consumer. Physical media, on the other hand, doesn't have this issue. While streamers aren't necessarily losing customers, people who collect Blu-rays, DVDs, and VHS tapes tell Rolling Stone their trending culture isn't nostalgia bait. It's participating in the digital world while recognizing the value of holding something in their movie-obsessed hands.

	Gina Luzi, 33, first started her physical media collection without even realizing it. She grew up going to Blockbuster with her father for movie nights, and has fond memories of strolling the aisles of Barnes & Noble for everything from books to CDs. But in 2018, she began to take collecting far more seriously. Her focus: cheesy 1980s Italian horror and murder mystery films — also known as “giallos” — many of which aren't available on streaming platforms. 


	“If I can find something that only one place has ever put out, or a movie that has just been restored for the first time in 30 years, that's so exciting for me,” Luzi tells Rolling Stone. “Living in L.A., we're so spoiled when it comes to physical media. We have so many old theaters, video rental stores that are still active, so many VHS-centered spaces. So my love for physical media is really tied into my love for Los Angeles.” 


	For Maddy Graves, her physical media collection started with a frustration with streaming. “I got tired of paying for new streaming services,” Graves, 26, says. “I can't justify having more than two or three. Why do I have to pay for Paramount plus to watch Twin Peaks?” 


	Graves has always had a stack of DVDs in her home, but her collection changed when she found an old fashioned tube TV with a built-in VCR. Now, she seeks out VHS tapes of her most watched films. (Her favorites are Rush Hour 1, Rush Hour 2, and Silence of the Lambs.) Graves thinks that the growth of physical media collectors comes from a lack of trust in streaming operations.

	“I think the giant boom of physical media collecting is reflective of what's going on with the economy and also how people feel about media in general. It's nice to have the certainty and it's less [expensive],” she says. “Having a film in your collection versus the void of the internet — it just  feels more secure.” 


	Starting a physical media collection can be as easy as walking into a Goodwill and buying a Bring It On box set. But digital archivist K.D. Kemp says that there's a real knowledge gap for newer generations whose growth has been defined by leaping advancements in tech. On TikTok, Kemp shares her tips and tricks for those who are interested in both collecting old media and finding ways to archive their favorite digital entertainment — like YouTube videos or unreleased songs. 


	“I get a lot of questions of ‘How do I get into this?' There's a lot of curiosity about things some older generations take for granted,” she says. “Like, ‘How do you burn a CD?' It's something that was common for us growing up, but that's knowledge that's being lost as everything is sort of transitioning to digital.”


	The obsession over obtaining physical copies of films has been driven in part by popular digital properties like Letterboxd and Criterion. Letterboxd is a film-logging app where users can mark what movies they've seen, review them, and discover new ones they might like. Their TikTok interview series “Four Favorites,” where celebrities are asked to name four favorite films on the spot, often goes viral. In a similar viral fashion, film company Criterion Collection has achieved massive success with their series “The Criterion Closet,” which invites stars, directors, and writers to tour a closet stacked to the ceiling with DVDs and pick out their favorite films. The series was such a hit that the company now tours the Criterion Van — a mobile closet, essentially — where fans wait hours in line for a chance to buy discounted DVDs and film their own version of the interview. 


	Josue Arellano, 27, says that a lot of his physical media collection is made up of Criterion titles, because the company often re-releases or restores films he's been desperate to see but hasn't been able to find. When the Criterion Van had an event in June, he and a friend got there around 3:30 a.m. They were sixth in line. 


	“Even now, in the age of streaming, it's so important to be able to own your media, because you don't know what these companies can decide one day,” Arellano says. “Even editing is a big thing, how streamers will edit movies to be more child friendly. It's censorship.” 

	











	What Arrelano is referring to is just one of several situations where digital copies of films have been adjusted to fit modern sensibilities. Since 2023, Disney has been accused of editing several versions of their historic films, including Fantasia, Lilo & Stitch, and Star Wars. The NBC streamer Peacock removed multiple comedy episodes that used blackface, including The Office, 30 Rock, and Scrubs. Streaming companies have called these changes important to remove inappropriate or hurtful content, but many collectors see the changes as essentially creating more lost media — and forcing audiences to lose out on important context. 


	“There's this false notion that everything is online and you can access anything. And it's just simply not true,” Kemp tells Rolling Stone. “There's so much content that hasn't been digitized, that isn't available online. Or what's happening now that's more common is things that were only ever digital have been taken away. They've been taken off of streaming services. Licenses have been revoked. Something has happened that has caused that content to come down and now it's effectively gone.”

	One of the loopholes that streaming services have taken advantage of in the past few years is the removal of original series and films as tax writeoffs — many of which were never released in physical formats. (The 2022 film Batgirl was filmed and edited but never streamed, instead reportedly scrapped as a tax write off.) It's a fate that Love Life escaped, which is why Boyd really likes the idea that physical media collection is a trend once again. 


	“There always are going to be people, and especially young people, who are curious about the past,” he says. “Who are interested in the whole history of incredible movies and shows and albums. That's the kind of kid I was. So, it makes sense that those kids still exist. The idea that people would only want the new thing forever, just has never been the case. There's always going to be some people that want to zag.”

	At 34 years old and with 12 years in the rap industry, JID finds himself matriculating from a student of the game to a leader. As he does so, the title of his fourth album, God Does Like Ugly, suggests he's looking to the ultimate one. Despite the enormous successes of a four-times-platinum appearance on Imagine Dragons' “Enemy” (a pretty random collaboration from the outside looking in), a viral hit with 2022's “Surround Sound” (which soundtracked videos where netizens held their phones high above them to rap, dance, or act into the camera), and many years of packed shows, JID is less a superstar than a cult-classic type of rapper. It's clear he's a bit over that. “Just took a fuckin ‘ceiling challenge to show I'm above my peers,” he spits with slight disdain on his God Does Like Ugly. “Be serious.” 


	JID has made a career of looking at the bigger picture. His last album, The Forever Story, came out nearly three years ago, powerfully retelling his coming of age out of Atlanta and onto J. Cole's prestigious Dreamville Records, and describing how his family has showed up in his life along the way. The very last seconds of God Does Like Ugly reveal that he's now started a family of his own, with JID asking, “Daddy got best bars in the world?” to a baby who gurgles back a definitive, “Yes.” This is likely his first public announcement that he's now a father, putting him in one of the most consequential leadership roles there is. So, when JID proclaims his capacity to step up, whether he's humbly distancing himself from Dreamville by rapping, “I ain't killing shit cause of Cole/It's cause I'm cold,” on “VCRs” with Vince Staples, or promising, “You need a leader/I can come and deliver,” on the single “WRK,” there's an added sense here that in his personal life, he must.

	But, of course, titulary, and functionally, God Does Like Ugly also finds JID asking and answering the metaphysical questions embedded in that process, musing on what the hell we're doing here on Earth, who's in charge, and where we go when it's all over. His observations are rooted in the Christian traditions that permeate the Black American south where he was raised. “I'm tryna free the shackles/My brother back inside the cell so I just said a prayer,” he raps on “Glory,” an early declaration of JID charging himself to be some sort of spiritual guide towards the people he cares about — whether that's his troubled sibling or Black people more generally. No matter what though, his perspective is local, as he recounts the only-in-Atlanta trials of getting his car robbed outside a Falcons game (in the excellent “Gz,” a prime example of what a hyper-specific storyteller JID can be and his mesmeric sense of cadence) or being hunted by city's oppressive Red Dog policing unit that brutalized Black people from the late Eighties to the 2010s. If Metro Boomin's recent A Futuristic Summa mixtape revels in the sugary pulse of the city's hip-hop movement that came at the end of that era, God Does Like Ugly lives in the dark underbelly that was always there.

	While some of JID's religious allusions can be too on the nose — like summoning Westside Gunn, known as FlyGod, for the intro, or Atlanta rap hero Pastor Troy on “K-Word” — the album really shines when JID juxtaposes the promised salvation of Christianity with the grit of Atlanta's reality. “At the Lord's service like I'm working a job/Black mask shawty robbin' people in Cobb,” he raps, skillfully balancing a set of what seem like contradictions on “Glory.” “Playin' Crime Mob, he a child of the corn/Take him into court and on the Bible he sworn/Take him into church, you know yo mama and ‘nem goin',” he adds. The production warps choirs and tambourines into his own sort of gospel. JID also compellingly muddies capitalistic success and real transcendence throughout the album, pointing to money as a false god. “Even seen the preacher on the TV tell me ‘Send us 19.99'/And he can save our souls,” he notes on the striking “Of Blue,” peppered with graceful beat switches. As a personal testament to how easy and tempting it is to follow the fake idolatry of cash, he also often juxtaposes how well he lives now through rap with some of the harder times he's been through, noting people have had to turn to more nefarious means to change their own fate: “Far cry from bugs and cereal boxes on the shelves/Now I order escargot on a plate, it's a fuckin' snail,” he says on “YouUgly.”

	The album's title is JID reconciling that all this “ugly” — desperation, poverty, pain — happens under God's watch. On a pamphlet announcing that he would be playing shows for just $1 in anticipation of the project, he wrote, “God loves you right where you are. Broken or whole. God does like ugly.” It's a sentiment he repeats on the intro, lamenting his brother's constant incarceration. In the face of this, JID relays that, “You can only control what you can control,” as he wrote about his inspiration for the single “WRK,” but also fiercely acknowledges that the options presented are pretty grim and often predestined. “Community,” featuring Clipse, is one of the best portraits of this, as JID joins Pusha T and Malice as seamlessly as a third brother to color in shrewd vignettes of run-down apartments full of people who have had their families and agency taken from them, caught up in a justice system from crimes of survival. “My mama said we gotta get away from them apartments/It's graves in them apartments/And it ain't gotta end this way, ‘cause we ain't start shit,” says a pitched-down voice in the opener. 

	











	Despite its meticulous narrative cohesion, God Does Like Ugly is by no means an easy listen, lacking the smoother and more unified sound of The Forever Story, his discography's most impressive entry. (As he ushered in this new era, JID revealed that he spiraled after Forever went underappreciated — then joked that the hurt feelings only lasted “for maybe 20 minutes, ‘cause I ain't no bitch.'”) GDLU can feel disjointed in a way that works well if you liken it to a movie score, but is less endearing as an album experience. Take the homage to Atlanta roller-rink culture “Sk8,” featuring Ciara (who has become a go-to for such things, also appearing on Latto's “Good 2 You”). With its upbeat, retro bounce, it's sonically jarring in the context of the album, but also introduces ideas of romance and friendship that are interesting pockets of levity in the otherwise brooding soundscape. This is similar to “What We On,” which spends its first minute and 45 seconds being a boring Don Toliver song before JID breaks through. His verses there and on “WRK” go on to commit a common offense for JID: As an incredibly dexterous and athletic rapper, he can be wordy for wordiness' sake, a tendency that has also fatigued fans of one of the legends he's looked up to, Eminem. This is all to say, the album itself is often kind of ugly — which actually might be part of the point.

A recent Capitol Hill hearing has reignited debate over Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. 

In a May UAP briefing, physicist Dr Eric Davis, known for his work on top-secret Pentagon projects, stunned listeners by referencing alleged alien species, 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians,' as potential operators of unidentified craft. 

Davis described these entities as humanoid, approximately human-sized, and possibly linked to classified reverse-engineering programs.

Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, prompted the discussion, revealing on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private briefings.

'I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,' Burlison said. 

'But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.'

Burlison, a self-described skeptic, admitted uncertainty about Davis's sources, noting the physicist's comments may stem from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports. 

'If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment,' Burlison said. 'But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves.' 

A respected scientists told Congress that there are four alien species piloting craft in our skies, including Nordics that have human-like features

Dr Eric Davis (left) described these entities as humanoid, approximately human-sized, and possibly linked to classified reverse-engineering programs. Missouri Representative Eric Burlison prompted the question about the different alien species 

The concept of Grays as a popular alien archetype took hold in the mid-1960s, largely due to the famous Betty and Barney Hill abduction case. 

The couple described being taken by small humanoids with smooth gray skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and lacking typical human features like noses or ears.

Nordics are described as tall, slender beings resembling Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. 

Often linked to the Pleiades star cluster, these entities are said to possess advanced technology and peaceful intentions, featuring prominently in 1950s contactee and UFO lore.

Insectoids, meanwhile, have been part of alien mythology since at least the early 1900s, with roots tracing back to Georges Méliès' 1902 film 'A Trip to the Moon.' 

These beings exhibit insect-like traits such as multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae.

The reptilian theory, claiming shape-shifting reptilian aliens secretly control Earth, surged in popularity through conspiracy theorist David Icke in the late 20th century. 

Interestingly, similar half-human, half-serpent figures appear in ancient South and Southeast Asian myths, such as the Nāga.

Another is Grays, described as small humanoids with smooth gray skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and lacking typical human features like noses or ears

Betty (left) and Barney Hill (right) were the first Americans who claimed they were abducted by Grays in September 1961

While Davis named each of these in May, Burlison leaned toward a more earthly explanation, suggesting UAPs are likely advanced human-made technologies, perhaps experimental projects by private contractors.

'With all of the advancements that we've made, the fact that we discovered the Higgs Boson particle, all of the discoveries in quantum physics, and that nobody has figured out a way to create some form of advanced propulsion,' he remarked. 

However, Burlison expressed frustration at the thought of such technology existing, recalling how he sat delayed on a tarmac for three hours due to weather, joking, 'If we have advanced propulsion, I'm going to be really angry.' 

Critics have dismissed the hearings as veering into the absurd, with references to 'reptilians' and 'insectoids' sounding more like science fiction than serious inquiry.

Davis named each of these under oath in May as the beings invading Earth's skies. Pictured is a shot from the 'Go Fast' video that was released in 

'Some will think we're nuts,' Burlison acknowledged, aware of the skepticism his comments invite.

Yet he defended the investigation, emphasizing that taxpayer money funds Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

'I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this,' he said.

Burlison believes the public could handle the truth if aliens were confirmed.

'Most would just read the headline and move on,' he predicted, noting humanity's tendency to normalize even the most extraordinary revelations.

However, he insisted that any such discoveries should not be hidden.

'The government belongs to the people, not the other way around,' Burlison stressed. 'Keeping such monumental secrets would betray the trust of the public.'

While remaining cautious about extraterrestrial claims, Burlison plans to press Dr Davis for clarification on whether his startling remarks come from direct knowledge or secondary reports.

Burlison believes the public could handle the truth if aliens were confirmed. 

'Some will read the headline and go about their day,' he predicted, citing human behavior's tendency to normalize even earth-shattering news. 

However, he stressed that any such revelation should not be kept secret.

'I believe that this government belongs to the people. It's not that the people don't belong to the government,' he said, arguing that withholding paradigm-shifting discoveries would betray public trust.

The lack of concrete evidence, coupled with Davis's ambiguous sources, keeps the debate speculative. Burlison plans to follow up with Davis to clarify whether his claims stem from direct observation or research assignments analyzing reported phenomena.

Prince Harry confessed in his autobiography Spare that he had turned to a spirit guide to invoke his late mother, Princess Diana of Wales, who had a great interest in the mystical world and turned to her personal psychic, Sally Morgan, up to three times a week. But an inclination and interest in paranormal events and esotericism is not exclusive to the youngest son of Charles III and Lady Di, but shared by the British royal family in general. Biographer Robert Hardman, in the latest episode of the Daily Mail podcast Queens, Kings and Dastardly Things, released on August 7, recalled a story related to the royals and the paranormal: it occurred one night in 1953 when Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance to connect with her deceased father, King George VI.

The story begins at the royal residence of Sandringham, in the county of Norfolk, England, where the staff of the estate where the Windsors traditionally celebrate Christmas were frightened by unexplained phenomena occurring in the bedroom where George VI had died in 1952. The situation escalated to the point where they decided to appeal to the Queen Mother. To address the situation, Elizabeth II's mother contacted a local parish priest in 1953 to perform a “religious cleansing ceremony” inside the room, inviting her daughter and her lady-in-waiting, Prue Penn, to attend.

“It wasn't a conventional exorcism. There was no dramatic expulsion of demons, as you see in the movies. The room was said to house a tormented spirit, and the parish priest was supposed to bless the space,” Hardman explains in his conversation with his co-host, Kate Williams, about an anecdote first reported in 2000 by the late Kenneth Rose, royal biographer and journalist. During the service in the haunted room, Communion was taken and special prayers were said, aimed at dispelling the wandering spirit of George VI. Although, as Rose speculated at the time, “No one was quite sure who the ghost was supposed to be.”

Whether or not the British royals who participated in the 1953 séance believed the palace staff's fears about paranormal phenomena remains a mystery. As Hardman and Williams explain in their podcast, they believe the Queen Mother decided to conduct the séance to show her servants that they took their concerns seriously. And Harman adds her own impressions of the attendees: “It was particularly odd that Elizabeth II attended, given her cynicism about this kind of wild theory. The late Queen had a strong faith, but she wasn't superstitious. She didn't have time for such theories, but she did have a strong sense of the spiritual, as King Charles III does.”

This séance wasn't the only one the Queen Mother and Elizabeth II participated in. The documentary The King of UFOs (2024) features some of the most interesting ones. Among them, one starring Lilian Bailey, the royal family's trusted medium, stands out after she forged a friendship with George VI's speech therapist, Lionel Logue. On an unspecified date, the psychic was contacted to conduct a private session with clients who, at first, remained anonymous. Bailey was taken blindfolded from her home in Wembley to a house in Kensington, where she entered a trance and shared various messages from the beyond. Reports claim that when she emerged from the trance, she was allowed to remove her blindfold and was surprised to see Elizabeth II, along with her husband, Prince Philip of Edinburgh, her mother, her sister, Princess Margaret, and her first cousin, Alexandra of Kent, and her husband, Angus Ogilvy.

The British royal family's ties to the esoteric and the paranormal began with Queen Victoria. During the Victorian era (1837-1901), it was fashionable to turn to spirit guides, and the monarch was no exception. According to The King of UFOs, she turned to medium Robert Lees to help her communicate with her late husband, Prince Albert, after the Birmingham psychic impressed her with a reading when he was 13. He later channeled the monarch's former husband through one of his trusted aides, John Brown, whose ghost was later perceived by Elizabeth II. “Our dear late queen always said that there were ghosts and she said ‘I never go to Allt-na-giubhsaich (Glassalt, the cottage on the lake in Balmoral) without the corgis because the corgis sense it before I do. Their hackles go up and they start to growl so I never go without them and I never stay the night there,'” former royal butler Paul Burrell told the Daily Mirror newspaper on January 22, 2024. He added the fact that he believed troubled the sovereign: “Queen Victoria would stay the night there with John Brown.”

The list of paranormal occurrences at British royal residences goes on. Paranormal historian Richard Felix claims in the aforementioned documentary that “all of their properties have ghosts, they know it, and they've witnessed it. The late Queen saw her namesake, Queen Elizabeth I, in the library at Windsor Castle. The King [Charles III] has seen the same ghost, and his grandfather George VI saw Queen Elizabeth I eight times in the library before the start of World War II.” Other ghosts sighted at Windsor include George III muttering “what” over and over again, and Henry VIII moaning and groaning because of his ulcerated leg, British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Vanity Fair in an October 30, 2024, piece.

Of the current British royal family, Queen Camilla is the biggest believer in ghosts. According to her son, Tom Parker Bowles, the Wiltshire mansion where he grew up was haunted. “As a child, he found the rooms frightening. It was always cold. There were a lot of very rational people who, in the middle of the night, would get in a car and drive back to London because something had gotten into their bed, and it was a spirit,” he recounted on Gyles Brandreth's Rosebud podcast on September 26, 2024. The ghost even appeared to the house's owner: “My mother says she woke up in the middle of the night and a presence pinned her to the bed.” Camilla has also spoken about her fear of Dumfries House, an 18th-century retreat that the current British monarch had restored. “There was definitely a ghost,” she recalled in the documentary The Real Camilla, HRH the Duchess of Cornwall (2018). “I walked up the stairs, into the hall, and thought, ‘I can't go on.' I froze… I remember thinking, ‘I don't want to go back,' and I didn't for years.”

And, as John West writes in his book Britain's Ghostly Heritage, Charles and a staff member fled Sandringham Library in terror. Felix claims that Anmer Hall, the current residence of William, Prince of Wales, and Kate Middleton, is haunted: “There was a ghost of a Catholic priest who had his residence there, and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered for high treason, and for some reason, he has now returned home.”

As long as ancient castles and monarchies exist, stories of hauntings will continue to intrigue and appear in the media. In July 2024, a royal follower shared footage with Radar Online of what appeared to be the ghost of Elizabeth II holding her iconic Launer handbag in a room at Windsor Castle.

SPRINGFIELD — America's Top Psychic Medium is returning to MGM Springfield this month for another round of live readings. 

""What makes my upcoming show at MGM Springfield so special is that it will be completely different from the last,"" said Matt Fraser, New York Times bestselling author and star of “Meet the Frasers” on E! Entertainment, in an email to The Republican. ""No two shows are ever the same, and that's because I don't run the show. The souls on the Other Side do."" 

Fraser has received global regard for his ability to connect with the “Other Side” and share messages from audience members' loved ones who have passed. His readings have turned skeptics into believers for including names, dates and other details that he could not possibly have known. 

“This is their moment to tell their story. They bring with them memories, validation, and undeniable proof that the afterlife is real,” Fraser said. “Every soul has a message, and every message is meant for someone in the audience.”

Fraser will bring his live audience reading event to the Aria Ballroom on Saturday, Aug. 23 at 8 p.m. A meet and greet with Fraser will begin at 6 p.m. 

Fraser has amassed more than 100 million views across social media and his live shows are often a sell-out event. He has caught the attention of celebrities like Kelly Clarkson, who said of Fraser: “He sees dead people! His readings will definitely raise the hair on the back of your neck.”

Fraser is no stranger to skeptics, and to skeptics he has one request: come to his show. “I have a really good track record with turning skeptics into believers,” he said in a 2024 interview with The Republican.

Tickets to Fraser's MGM Springfield event begin at $45. Early reservations are strongly encouraged, and tickets can be purchased on MGM Springfield's website.

“Whether you've been to one of my events before or this is your first time, get ready for a brand-new experience filled with healing, connection, and unforgettable moments,” Fraser said.

As ICE expands its presence across the Midwest, activists fight the reopening of private prisons to jail migrants.

“It was terrible,” Olivier Habimana* remembered about his first night at a small county jail in Indiana after being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Born in Rwanda and educated in Belgium, he came to the United States to work as an operations manager for a French company based in Indianapolis that supplies parts for the big three auto companies. He was a middle-class professional, and he had never been in jail before. So, when he was arrested by ICE, it was a “huge shock,” he told Truthout.

Agents put him in the back of a van that made him feel like “an animal in a cage.” When he got to the small jail in Clay County, in rural Indiana, he was surprised. At the time, in 2022, it held about 50 people. “I was expecting the jail was going to be something much bigger,” Habimana said. “It almost looked like somebody's garage.”

The first issue, he said, was the mattress. “You're lying on a bare metal sheet and you're given something that was supposed to be a pillow.” 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

He had never heard of “chow time,” and when he was given a dinner tray, he thought to himself, “How can I eat this, is this even food?”

After the two-and-a-half years he spent in ICE detention, “these things became normal,” he said.

The Clay County Jail is one of a largely invisible network of county jails in the vast interior of the Midwest. But the jails holding immigrants for ICE are already at capacity. The Trump administration would need more cages to hold thousands of people to carry out its proposed “mass deportations.” 

President Donald Trump's $45 billion plan for ICE detention, announced in April and approved by Congress in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” includes the reopening of two private prisons in the Midwest. One is the North Lake Correctional Facility, run by GEO Group, in rural Baldwin, Michigan, with a capacity to hold 1,800 people. It has already been opened and begun accepting its first detainees. The other is what is being called the Midwest Regional Reception Center, operated by CoreCivic, in Leavenworth, Kansas, which can hold another 1,000 people. A court decision requiring the owner to obtain a special permit is stalling its opening. 

The capacity for immigrant detention in the U.S. is expected to grow to over 100,000 people, double what it was when Trump entered the White House for his second term. As so-called border czar Tom Homan envisions, “The more beds that we have, the more bad guys we arrest.”

“The Midwest has long been a critical site of resistance against ICE's attacks on immigrant communities, and this time around is no different.”

These immigration prisons and jails in the Midwest present a distinct set of challenges different from the politics of the militarized border or the liberal east and west coasts. They are often located in rural areas in red states where support for Trump is high. Often, the jails are run by conservative sheriffs who are aligned with Trump's policies. Located in towns with depressed economies, the communities are attracted by the promise of jobs and tax revenue. Still, organizers are developing creative ways to build solidarity with immigrants incarcerated in these places and mobilize local support. 

“It is no surprise that ICE is expanding in the Midwest,” Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network and author of Unbuild Walls, told Truthout. “For years, local communities in the region blocked the expansion of a large immigrant detention center. ICE is circumventing these efforts by repurposing old prisons and using military bases to carry out their mass deportation agenda. But communities across the country are demanding to shut down detention centers and halt detention expansion. The Midwest has long been a critical site of resistance against ICE's attacks on immigrant communities, and this time around is no different.”

Leavenworth, Kansas, is a prison town best known for the federal prison which housed notorious figures like Machine Gun Kelly, James Earl Ray, and Tom Pendergast. It also housed Native American political prisoner Leonard Peltier, who spent nearly a decade there in the 1980s and 1990s, and was recently freedby President Joe Biden. 

The private prison in Leavenworth operated by CoreCivic is less well known but has been plagued by problems. CoreCivic built the facility during the prison boom of the early 1990s to hold citizens pretrial in federal detention for the U.S. Marshals Service. It was shut down in 2021 after a judge deemed it a “hell hole.”

Biden signed Executive Order 14006, stating that the Department of Justice should not renew contracts with private prisons to “reduce profit-based incentives.” As it turned out, Biden's order excludedimmigrant detention centers, and left empty prisons like the one in Leavenworth an option for ICE. In March 2025, ICE awarded CoreCivic a $4.2 million contract over five years to reopen the prison. 

CoreCivic emphasizes the 300 jobs the prison will create, promises the facility will generate $1 million in local tax revenue, and casts its critics as outsiders. A coalition of local, state, and regional organizations has come together to counter this narrative. It includes Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation (AIIR), based in Kansas City; the ACLU of Kansas, which previously fought to shut the prison down; the local Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth; and Loud Light, representing immigrants in southwest Kansas. Together, the groups have mobilized residents, organized local faith leaders, and courted former prison guards to their campaign. 

“Private prisons are the only winners here,” Celia Sanchez*, a volunteer with AIIR, told Truthout. She grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, and went to school at the University of Saint Mary, a Catholic university in Leavenworth. 

CoreCivic has tried to “clean up their reputation,” Sanchez said, “but it's the same thing.”

“The facility has been there for a long time,” she added, “and has a long history of abuses, neglect, violence, drug abuse, you name it. Hence, the Leavenworth community believes we can't let this happen again. We don't trust CoreCivic.”

Bill Rogers was a correctional officer at the CoreCivic prison before it was shut down. He grew up in nearby Wyandotte County, on the Kansas side of Kansas City, and commuted 20 to 25 minutes to work at the prison. When he started the job in 2016, he said, “I didn't even realize that we had for-profit prisons.” It was not long before he learned that for CoreCivic, “it ultimately is all about the dollars.”

One man in custody died after experiencing a diabetic coma, who Rogers believed should have been taken to a hospital, but was denied care, because, Rogers says, it “cut into the bottom line for a private prison company.” 

In 2018, Rogers was hit in the head with a dinner tray by one of the incarcerated men and received 14 staples. Days earlier, he emailed the warden about being short-staffed. The highest operational cost for a private prison is labor, he said, “so if you can start to cut down your labor costs, you start to increase your profits.” 

CoreCivic did not respond to Truthout's request for a comment about Rogers's allegations.

In July, a District Court judge approved an injunction keeping CoreCivic from opening the Leavenworth prison until obtaining a special use permit from the city, which could take several months. 

The GEO-run North Lake Correctional Facility is located in one of the poorest counties in Michigan. The county is also politically conservative, with 65 percent of voters supporting Trump in the last election. GEO Group is the largest taxpayer in the county, making Lake County heavily dependent on the revenue to fund its schools and services. The prison formerly operated as a “CAR” prison (Criminal Alien Requirement), managed by the Bureau of Prisons, which held immigrants convicted of felony reentry — reentering the U.S. after previously being deported. It's now taking anyone recently arrested, another indication of Trump's political escalation. 

The coalition No Detention Centers in Michigan (NDCM) has maintained an energetic campaign to close the prison. On New Year's Eve 2020, activists organized a noise demonstration outside the prison, broadcasting a loud message in English, Spanish, and Arabic with a phone number for those inside to call for assistance. 

ICE is shifting people around to several county jails, which are often hidden out of sight. Local residents may not even know their towns are holding people for ICE.

“It felt really good to be there for that demo,” NDCM member JR Martin told Truthout. “But ultimately, what led to some of the most important connections was that we continued to spread the word about this facility and tried to make sure people knew they could reach out to us. In the spring of 2020, people [on the outside] started to send messages to say that their relatives, a group of predominantly Black men, had been forced together into the Restricted Housing Unit against their will. Loved ones had lost touch with them and were very concerned for their safety. Linking up with those family members was essential as we started to get a picture of what was happening inside.”

Shortly after, the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe and spread rapidly inside prisons. A series of hunger strikes was organized primarily by these Black immigrants, exposing the poor conditions inside. News of the hunger strikes was shared with organizers on the outside through these communication networks. The attention helped to build a groundswell of opposition which pressured Biden to phase out the federal use of private prisons. The Baldwin prison was closed in early 2022 when the contract expired. 

After hearing news of the prison's reopening, NCDM joined a “Communities Not Cages” day of actionorganized by the national organization Detention Watch Network, along with others across the country, including those in Leavenworth. On April 17, 2025, 200 people held a rally at the ICE offices in Grand Rapids.

The North Lake prison opened in mid-June and is reported to already be holding more than 100 people. Activists with NDCM, as well as the group GR Rapid Response to ICE, are organizing fundraising campaigns for families who have loved ones incarcerated in North Lake. 

Until the prisons in Michigan and Kansas get up to full speed, ICE is shifting people around to several county jails, which are often hidden out of sight. Local residents may not even know their towns are holding people for ICE. There is a network of county jails in the Midwest that includes Chase County, Kansas; Greene County, Missouri; Ozark County, Missouri; Phelps County, Missouri; St. Clair County, Michigan; Boone County, Kentucky; Kay County, Oklahoma; Butler County, Ohio; and Dodge County, Wisconsin. Sheriffs in these counties are paid to jail individuals for ICE at rates from $70-$105 per person per day, which is often used to make up for local budget shortfalls. 

As the Prison Policy Initiative revealed in a recent report, detention figures for these local jails are not reported among ICE statistics and account for an additional 45 percent of detentions, making the total number of immigrants detained around 83,400. 

In 2021, after Illinois passed a bill banning county jails from entering into contracts to detain immigrants, ICE started utilizing the jail in Clay County, Indiana, across the state border line: About 200 miles from Chicago and 60 miles from Indianapolis, it is well-situated. The county approved a jail expansion, a battle which activists fought but eventually lost. 

Lawyers with the National Immigrant Justice Center filed a lawsuit in federal court in 2022, claiming Clay County was using immigrants as a “cash cow” to purchase an air conditioning unit, give raises to jail staff, and keep taxes low. The suit argues that after the jail failed two inspections, it should cease being used by ICE to detain immigrants, according to a provision established by the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit against Clay County was dismissed by a judge, but the lawsuit against ICE is moving forward. 

Clay County has since completed an expansion of the jail to increase its capacity for ICE from 50 to 250 people. 

The group Indiana Assistance to Immigrants in Detention has been organizing monthly visitations at the Clay County jail and building relationships with those inside. Truthout spoke with one of the members of the group, Robin Valenzuela, in June, just days after ICE agents cracked down on protesters in Chicago following several immigration arrests. She said the population at the jail had swelled to around 323 people. Many of those people were likely from Chicago.    

“They put people on the floor. They use bunk beds. They'll throw people in the rec room. They will definitely exceed capacity,” she said. 

A professor at Western Kentucky University, Valenzuela has been conducting her own informal research at the jail. She met Olivier Habimana while he was incarcerated for several months in Clay County. They developed a friendship and he became her “theoretician from the inside,” she said.

While his immigration case was slowly moving through the courts, Habimana was sent to the jail in Dodge County, Wisconsin, where he was held for a year. He vividly recalled being put in a van with other immigrants and driven some 600 miles to Kay County, Oklahoma, with no chance to use the restroom. One man relieved himself in the van. Habimana remembered the driver referring to them as “sheep.”

After Trump took office, Habimana immediately noticed a difference. “There was a big influx between Biden and Trump,” he said, “in terms of who came in and their status and even nationalities.” 

Rwanda refused to take him back, Habimana says, but the country's government did not want a fight with the Trump administration, so his travel documents were approved and, in February 2025, he was promptly deported back to Rwanda.

“All these human rights are being violated in the country that's supposed to be a champion of human rights,” Habimana concluded. “It's not right that it happens.”

*Names have been changed for fear of repercussions. 

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. 

UCLA is the first public university whose federal grants have been targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The Trump administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against private colleges.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands from the administration. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants, the university said this week, after the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division announced it had found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”

Last month UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.

The university has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations.

“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” James B. Milliken, UC president, said in a statement Friday. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country's greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”




As part of the lawsuit settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university's Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus. 

And UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government's allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants.

The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.

A hidden signal from the derivatives market suggests that ether's (ETH) rally could intensify, lifting valuations quickly to $4,400.

The indicator under consideration is the net gamma exposure of dealers/market makers in the Deribit-listed ether options market. Gamma is the critical metric for options traders, measuring how an option's delta, or its sensitivity to the underlying asset's price, changes in response to market moves.

When dealers are short gamma, they are forced to buy the underlying asset as its price rises and sell as its price falls, which often amplifies directional moves. Dealers provide liquidity to the order book and make money from the bid-ask spread while constantly striving to maintain a price-neutral net exposure.

At press time, there was a notable buildup of short gamma between strikes $4,000 and $4,400, according to data source Amberdata. With ether crossing above $4,000, dealers could buy the asset to hedge their exposure, creating a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop that could rapidly propel the price higher to $4,400. That's a level where the gamma dynamic shifts positive, requiring dealers to trade against the market and arrest the price volatility.

This makes the $4,400 a logical price magnet for the ongoing rally.

""If the momentum in the market is strong enough to get through $4,000, we see dealers also become net buyers of ETH at higher prices, potentially leading to a quick rally to $4,400, the next big gama inventory level,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, told CoinDesk.

Gonzalo García is set to stay with Real Madrid and become a full member of the first team squad, having convinced senior club staff with his FIFA Club World Cup performances.

Gonzalo finished the recent tournament as joint top scorer thanks to his four goals, grabbing the unexpected opportunity presented to him by Kylian Mbappé's group stage illness.

What comes next for the 21-year-old hadn't been all that clear in the immediate aftermath of the competition, with Real in need of a backup for Mbappé, but also having Endrick at their disposal and potentially being able to cash in on Gonzalo.

As the start of the new La Liga season nears this month, MARCA writes that the decision has been made and Gonzalo is “now a permanent first team player”. He has been promoted from Real Madrid Castilla and will occupy one of the valued 25 spots on the senior roster.

There was doubt from both the club and player in the wake of the Club World Cup about what kind of role he could hope to have. But Xabi Alonso's faith in Gonzalo has been key to him staying and the decision is said to be “firm”, even with almost a month of the transfer window left.

Getafe were among the clubs to enquire about Gonzalo this summer, now retreating and accepting that he will not be leaving the Santiago Bernabéu.

While Endrick is also set to stay, everything points to Gonzalo being handed Madrid's No. 9 shirt recently vacated by Mbappé. He didn't have a first team jersey at the Club World Cup—all senior roster players in Spain were 1–25—but will have to now.

Player themselves, rather than the club or staff, make shirt number decisions among themselves and only Endrick putting in a rival claim on the No. 9 would stop Gonzalo from getting it. Crucially, the Brazilian teenager isn't expected to ask to change his No. 16.

STREAM: Mboko vs. Osaka, The Match In 15 MinutesAt first, it looked like the night would belong to Osaka. The 27-year-old broke in her opening return game to grab an immediate advantage. Mboko, who landed awkwardly on her wrist during her semifinal win over Elena Rybakina that also involved erasing a match point, shook out her right hand after double-faulting twice. She initially struggled to inject enough pace when Osaka controlled points by sticking to forehand exchanges.""We quickly went to the hospital actually to do an MRI and an X-ray before I came to the courts to practice today. So once we got the green light that nothing too serious was going on in the wrist, I came here and practiced real fast and prepared for my match,"" she shared afterwards.After a pair of holds that got the crowd going, Mboko pushed the former world No. 1 to deuce in the seventh game. Osaka shrugged off her opponent's growing confidence to maintain her lead and ended the set with a second break when Mboko's forehand flew long—her 22nd unforced error.Taking a clean slate to heart, Mboko broke to begin the second set thanks to her defensive skills that drew a netted backhand. It ignited a run of five successive games to the returner, until the 85th-ranked competitor finally consolidated for 4-2 with tremendous depth down the middle. Osaka, meanwhile, couldn't find the court and suddenly found herself down a double break when Mboko's forehand bunt return landed over the net for a clean winner.

Osaka was handed a lifeline when Mboko tossed in three double faults to hand one break back. But when Mboko served for the set a second time—without much pace behind her delivery, Osaka's hitting went away again in missing a slew of routine shots.""I feel like I'm a little teeter-tottering today. I felt like I could have played better, but I'm not really sure which aspect,"" Osaka reflected. ""I think definitely my serve, but it's going to be interesting to see what my next match is and how I'm going to play.""More twists and turns on the rollercoaster ride carried into the decider after Osaka left the court, with three breaks in a row mirroring the tension of the early second set proceedings. Then, Mboko's remarkable composure shone through.Staving off four break points, Mboko capped an 18-point game with a deft forehand dropshot winner to consolidate. As she seemingly locked in for whatever came her way, Osaka couldn't match her opposition's demeanor. Despite two game points, she watched Mboko break her for a seventh time from eight chances and hold from deuce to reach 5-1. Down 40-15, Mboko brought the house to its feet with a diving forehand stab winner—and moments later, finished off the unreal victory with four rapid points.

I'm very happy with the way that I played today.”So how did he push through the heat, nerves and a slow start?

Goggins—a New York Times bestselling author, US Armed Forces veteran, ultra-endurance athlete and motivational speaker—is known worldwide for his extreme mental and physical toughness. His biggest lesson for Fonseca?“Nothing that you've (never) heard before, like stay positive, stay fighting,” Fonseca explained. “Like, keep pushing when things get hard, how to stay pushing—yeah, those kinds of mentalities.”Fonseca will look to channel that mindset in the second round against No. 17 seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. A win would mark his first Top 20 victory since the Miami Open in March, when he defeated No. 19 Ugo Humbert on his way to the third round.Read More: Cincinnati Open preview: Alcaraz, Sabalenka and Sinner return, and other top storiesLast week in Toronto, Fonseca fell in two tight sets to Tristan Schoolkate—but as Goggins says: ""The only limits you have are the limits you believe.""

As Kelly Clarkson and her kids mourn the passing of her ex-husband and their dad, Brandon Blackstock, others mourning his death on August 7, 2025, include country superstar Reba McEntire. 

“The Voice” coach was married to Brandon's dad, talent manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015, and remained close with him and Clarkson, even through their own divorce, which Clarkson filed for in 2020. Brandon was Narvel's son from a previous marriage. 

In 2021, McEntire told Entertainment Tonight, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. Although he's my stepson, I still love him like he's my total — my blood, so I'm praying for them both because I love them both.”

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

When McEntire performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, it was a family affair. Her and Narvel's son Shelby Blackstock — Brandon's half-brother — shared photos from the event that showed Brandon attended the concert and was backstage with McEntire, along with three of his four kids.  

Shelby captioned the collection of photos by writing, “Family time, the @rodeohouston , & corn dogs! We had a blast in Houston watching @rissablackstock experience her first rodeo & being able to spend cherished time with family! Mom's concert was the icing on the cake!”

Brandon had two kids with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth — Savannah, 22, and Seth, 18. He shared two kids with Clarkson — River Rose, 11, and Remington, 9. He was also a grandpa to Savannah's young son, who was also at the rodeo. 

At the time of publication, McEntire had not spoken publicly about Brandon's passing. 

McEntire didn't take sides as Clarkson and Blackstock were going through their oftentimes contentious divorce, remaining connected to and supporting both of them. 

In 2021, she told Extra, “You know, I love them both. Brandon's my stepson, Kelly's my good friend, and I'm pulling for both of them. I hope they're happy and healthy and pull through this. I pray that everybody gives them the encouragement they can, because they need it right now, both of them.”

She also told Entertainment Tonight that year, “Kelly and I do talk, we text and I love them both, and so I can't play favorites because I've been a friend of Kelly for a long time.” 

Before McEntire became a coach on “The Voice,” she was a Mega Mentor on the show in 2023, and got to work with Clarkson there. 

“I am so proud of Kelly,” McEntire said on the show, as seen in the video above. “She has grown as an artist, as a teacher. From when we first met in 2000 — way back — 2002, so that was how long we've known each other. She was a baby!”

“Now, she's just matured into this wonderful woman that I am just so proud of and I love her with all my heart,” she added.
