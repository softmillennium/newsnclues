NEW YORK — Former top-10 player Paula Badosa pulled out of the U.S. Open on Friday after dealing with a back injury that has sidelined her since a first-round loss at Wimbledon on June 30.

The U.S. Tennis Association announced Badosa's withdrawal and said Jil Teichmann would replace her in the field. Alizé Cornet, who retired from tennis last year but returned to action this year, is the next woman in line to get a berth in the draw at Flushing Meadows if someone else pulls out.



Play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in the singles brackets at the year's last Grand Slam tournament.

Badosa, a 27-year-old from Spain, reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022 and is currently No. 12.

She reached the semifinals at the Australian Open this January. Her best showing at the U.S. Open was a run to the quarterfinals last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Canadian Open event has finished, and Ben Shelton reigns supreme over the other ATP stars who entered the tournament. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner both withdrew from the tournament in Toronto, but will be back in action when the Cincinnati Masters gets underway. Novak Djokovic won't be playing in Cincinnati and that means that he won't be playing any competitive tennis between his Wimbledon semifinal exit and the US Open. The new rankings have been extremely beneficial towards Shelton after his maiden Masters 1000 victory, although it's come at the expense of Djokovic. Shelton has rocketed to a career-high of number six in the world rankings and ultimately, he will now be hoping to finish the season as high as possible. Shelton will now hope to get in the mix to win the big titles and the US Open might just throw him up his best chance to date, with the American seemingly hitting form at the right time. Shelton will probably be forgiven for looking lovingly at the rankings this morning, with the USA star up to sixth in the world and taking the place of Djokovic, who drops to seventh. The 22-year-old has a big chance now to carry this momentum and take on the big-hitters when they return in time for the US Open to get into full swing at the end of the month. Shelton will now move on to Cincinnati and this tournament will have definitely given him a burning desire to keep winning titles wherever he plays. Shelton is determined beyond belief and now he's starting to showcase the vast potential he has and after winning a Masters 1000 crown, the next big step is for him to win a Grand Slam in the near future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MASON, OH − Part of the Lindner Family Tennis Center's $260 million, state-of-the-art facelift has been the increase in total courts to 31 (up from 17) and additional seating for fans to watch some of the top stars in tennis practice. If you're not early to a Carlos Alcaraz practice session, good luck getting a glimpse of the 22-year-old phenom. 2 behind defending Cincinnati Open champion Jannik Sinner, didn't put his best on display the last time he was in Mason. Last summer, Alcaraz was upset by Gael Monfils in the Round of 32. Alcaraz called it "the worst match" he had ever played in his young career and gave four hacks of his racket onto the Center Court surface during the third set that Paul Bunyan would've applauded. Alcaraz apologized one day later on social media. Rest assured, fans in Mason won't see similar antics from the 21-time ATP tour champion. Alcaraz showed composure beyond his years last month in a humbling loss at Wimbledon. 6 by Sinner, who he had beaten in their previous five meetings. Even on the biggest stage, after a loss in a rivalry that has encapsulated the ATP in recent months. "It was new (losing in a Grand Slam final), but you have to be ready for that. "At some point, I have to lose a Grand Slam final. "There's obviously a lot I have to improve, but it took me hours, not even days, to be grateful for everything I've achieved." Alcaraz has matured a great deal in a short amount of time, in an ultra-personal sport where players have long pushed the boundaries of the game's holy etiquette and sportsmanship (Nick Kyrgios was fined $113,000 for his outburst with a chair umpire in Cincinnati in 2019). He's on now and searching for an ATP 1000 title that has eluded him. With a bigger, 96-player field, the Cincinnati Open bracket is littered with ATP stars, but the possibility of another Alcaraz-Sinner showdown is hiding in plain sight. Roger Federer won a record seven Rookwood Cups, Djokovic reached the finals eight times (3-5) and Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray combined for three titles in a six-year span. "I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik (Sinner). "A lot of people, I just let them talk about our rivalry or the things we have done for the history books in tennis. I'm thinking about the history we're making." Sinner matches up with Daniel Elahi Galan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open title in Montreal. Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough. Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a first WTA Tour title at the 1,000-level Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam. Mboko beat four-time major champion and former world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in front of 11,000 fans, and she did it playing the same brain game she has been playing throughout her startling climb up the tennis biosphere. “Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday in May at Roland Garros. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention. “Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it. Her performance in Paris, and then in Montreal, where she has knocked out another two-time major champion Coco Gauff, beaten four Grand Slam champions in all, and surged into the top 30 of the WTA rankings, has showed every bit of what has generated all the buzz about Mboko. “We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome. “I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.” The youngest by seven years of four tennis-playing siblings, Mboko has been winning more than just about anyone in professional women's tennis since the start of the year. Now they have another problem on their hands. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.” “That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open. “If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from. Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning. “She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience. “She was like ‘No, I got to win.” That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. “It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.” “Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that. “There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.” At some point, this is going to get complicated, but for Kevin and everyone else closest to Mboko, this rocket ride both is and is not surprising. Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. Gracia recalled a local women's tournament at their home club in Burlington, a city in the Greater Toronto area of Ontario, that she played in when she was 17. At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. “It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches. “I didn't see any of this coming. Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby. She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. Mboko can crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams. But she has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around touch and feel. Against Osaka in Montreal, she won a crucial game in which she saved four break points with a feathered drop shot, after a long sequence of points that were played at the baseline. In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court. Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined. “She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. And in the final, after Osaka did a demolition job on her in the opener, Mboko just kept going. She had learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff in Rome. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one. “They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner captured his first Wimbledon crown a month ago, adding the fourth Major trophy to his growing collection. However, he admits it nearly ended in the fourth round. Jannik faced Grigor Dimitrov Centre Court and dropped the opening two sets. However, Dimitrov experienced a massive blow and retired at 2-2 in the third set after suffering a shoulder injury. DIMITROV NO PUEDE CONTINUAR SU PARTIDO ANTE SINNER Y SE RETIRA POR LESIÓN. 🙏  📺 Mirá nuestros partidos de #Wimbledon en #DisneyPlus. Sinner admitted he got lucky in that match. Convincing victories over Ben Shelton, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz en route to his maiden Wimbledon trophy. Jannik realized anything can happen and stepped up to overcome his next challenges in style and write history books. The Italian's resilience, combined with a touch of fortune, turned Wimbledon into his personal breakthrough. Sinner proved that in tennis, one moment can spark a champion's rise, even a lucky one. Dimitrov led 6-3, 7-5, 2-2 when he grabbed his right shoulder and started crying. He received a medical timeout outside the court and returned only to announce his retirement and experience the most heartbreaking moment of his career. Grigor revealed a partial tear of the pectoral major muscle and withdrew from the US Open, skipping a Major after entering 58 in a row since 2011! The two rivals competed in front of Roger Federer.

Mboko took the tennis world by storm in Montreal, beating former world No 1 Naomi Osaka in the final, having already toppled fellow Grand Slam champions Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff - the top seed - and Sofia Kenin in earlier rounds.

"It's exciting but equally it does also create pressure for her, which she'll have to handle and which will be new territory for her. US Open: Schedule and how to watch on Sky Sports Won four consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour events to begin 2025, adding a fifth in March. In second place for most ITF World Tennis Tour women's singles titles won this year. Coached by former world No 3 and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat. Croft saw Mboko's considerable talent first hand when actually losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, before she ultimately earned a lucky loser spot and upset 25th seed Magdalena Frech in the first round. "She played beautifully and was so unlucky not to win that match. "I have been even more impressed with how she rebounded after such a painful defeat and got into Wimbledon as a lucky loser, which I was so thrilled to see and now look what she's doing so quickly." Croft also believes Mboko is benefitting greatly from her choice of coach, former world No 3 and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat. "She's got a very good coach, who actually I was on the tour with, in Nathalie Tauziat," Croft said. She goes for her shots, but I also read an article where she was talking about how Tauziat was a very creative artist, served and volleyed, had slices and did many different things. "She strikes me already, at such a young age, as being very astute and aware of what might be required." "This is an 18-year-old wild card who has just won a top-tier tournament, at home in Canada, and by beating a four-time Grand Slam champion in the final. She also beat four Grand Slam champions in total across the draw - Osaka, Rybakina, Gauff and Kenin. "These things do not happen every day, so let's revel in it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bernard Tomic experienced a humiliating stumble during a Challenger event in Chicago, leading to an unexpected defeat against world No. The Australian player tripped over his own feet at match point and subsequently retired from the game. Elsewhere in tennis, Ben Shelton won the men's Canadian Open final on Thursday, with Victoria Mboko beating Naomi Osaka in the women's event. Tomic has been grinding away on the ATP Challenger circuit for several years now. The 32-year-old, who was once a Wimbledon quarterfinalist and ranked as world No. 17, earned around $64,000 in prize money last year, which isn't an awful lot for a professional tennis player. Despite this, Tomic is determined to retire on his own terms and continues to compete in lower-tier tournaments. However, ahead of a probable entry into U.S. Open qualifying, Tomic suffered a significant setback in Chicago. Tomic was at match point and seemed poised for a first-round victory. Tomic once declared he had no passion for tennis and even sparked controversy by stating he was "bored" during his 2017 Wimbledon campaign. This admission came six years after the four-time ATP champion achieved his sole Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance at the prestigious All England Club. Yet in a June interview, Tomic revealed a different perspective: "Without tennis, I don't know what I would do. I'm sitting about 200 in the world, or whatever, and my goal is to be top 100, and then I can retire. It's more of a statement, that sort of thing, so let's see if I can do it. It's the only thing I'm good at. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

The Hongkonger will face France's Ugo Humbert next after stunning upset of Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard

Hong Kong's leading tennis hope Coleman Wong Chak-lam has ranked his latest upset of a top-50 opponent alongside the best victories of his short career.

Wong made his mark at another ATP 1000 Masters event when he stormed into the second round of the Cincinnati Open, taking the scalp of world No 42 Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard by a comprehensive 6-3, 6-2 margin on Thursday local time.

The 21-year-old Wong, who now stands 177th in the world, had come through the qualifying rounds in confident mood, without dropping a set.

He duly proceeded to brush aside France's Perricard in what was his third ATP 1000 main-draw victory since joining the men's tour.

His latest landmark success has set him up for a second-round meeting with another Frenchman, Ugo Humbert.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian Open has announced a major expansion of its partnership with the global insurance leader, Chubb, building on a relationship that began in 2020 and signalling both organisations' ambitions to extend their international reach. The broader sponsorship significantly amplifies Chubb's visibility at one of tennis's most prestigious Grand Slam events. Beyond traditional branding, the insurer will feature prominently during the “Close Call” electronic review segments – high-drama moments that draw peak engagement from fans both inside Rod Laver Arena and on global broadcasts. Craig Tiley, Tennis Australia's Chief Executive Officer, welcomed the expansion and said, “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Chubb, a global leader in insurance. Chubb has been a key partner of the Australian Open since 2020, and we look forward to growing our already strong relationship. Marcos Gunn, Regional President APAC, added, “We are thrilled to announce the renewal and expansion of our partnership with the Australian Open, marking an exciting new era for Chubb as we deepen our connection to this iconic event. We look forward to our continued partnership and shared success on the world stage.” From a life insurance perspective, Bryce Johns, President of Chubb Life, continued, “Building on the successful partnership Chubb has formed with the Australian Open, we are proud to become the Official Life Insurance Partner. Together, we look forward to creating unforgettable moments for our customers and partners, and celebrating the spirit of competition.” The move reflects a growing trend in global sports sponsorship, where brands are moving beyond single-category deals to integrated, multi-channel partnerships that touch multiple aspects of the fan experience. For Chubb, it cements a year-round marketing asset embedded into the Australian Open's operations; for Tennis Australia, it secures a deeper commercial alliance with a partner aligned to its international growth strategy. The 2026 Australian Open will run from 12 January to 1 February, with Chubb's expanded role set to take centre stage as the tournament serves up its next chapter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You will be hearing the name Victoria Mboko more often in tennis. Mboko came from behind to beat a fourth major champion at the 2025 Canadian Open, defeating Naomi Osaka to claim a historic first title of her career — at WTA 1000 level and her home tournament in Montreal, no less. The Burlington native has also been in top form at the Grand Slams, making her first appearance in a major main draw at the French Open, having previously reached two junior major semi-finals as a teenager. Mboko won on her Grand Slam debut against Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun in Paris, before defeating German no. She followed that up at Wimbledon 2025, going from a lucky loser to triumphing on her maiden SW19 main draw appearance. Get to know Canada's rising star Mboko as she climbs the ranks of women's tennis. A year since Paris 2024 🎉 I Relive it. Watch and read the full highlights with your Olympic membership. A post shared by The Olympic Games (@olympics) Born to Congolese parents in the USA, while raised in Canada, Mboko was destined to be a tennis player. Victoria's oldest brother, Kevin, competed at collegiate level alongside their other sister, Gracia. "I just remember watching them from the sidelines and not wanting to be left out," Mboko told the WTA. I never like to lose a lot. They still hold that over me to this day!" A post shared by Vicky Mboko (@vickymboko) Mboko's coach knows a thing or two about competing on the Grand Slam stage. As of the 2025 season, she has been accompanied on the world tour by former Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat, having previously worked together at Tennis Canada. Tauziat, who represented France at three Olympic Games and reached the French Open quarter-finals, had a career-high ranking of no. Mboko's influence from some of the game's former players does not stop there. In the 2024 season, she spent a lot of time at Olympic gold medallist Justine Henin's academy in Belgium. Her international experience came in handy on her Billie Jean King Cup debut for Canada in 2025, where Mboko sealed a debut victory against Romania's Miriam Bulgaru 6-1, 6-4 for her nation. Canada's Victoria Mboko celebrates victory at the Billie Jean King Cup. It was just easy for me to just look up to her as a role model," she said during a recent press conference at Roland-Garros. She's such an inspiration for so many girls out there, not just me." Among her role models is fellow Canadian Bianca Andreescu, who won the US Open in 2019: "She was the first Canadian to do so, for a lot of us back home it was a really big deal and it was such an inspiring experience for everyone in Canada. It kind of changed a little bit the way things work there." The 25-year-old revealed that Andreescu is always happy to share advice with her: "Sometimes I see her in the locker room and we have a quick chit-chat here and there. Comparisons to the greats of the sport can be overwhelming for an 18-year-old, but when one of the current top stars sees herself in you, that is a true compliment. “I think I move pretty well, and she moves very well…As far as the movement, I think she's up there with me on that... She's playing some top-level tennis.” This time, Mboko followed up a first-set triumph with a convincing victory, beating top seed Gauff 6-1, 6-4 at the 2025 Canadian Open fourth round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preserving this international asset was a huge win for Warren County and its partners, the State of Ohio and the City of Mason," said Warren County Commissioner Dave Young at the official ribbon cutting last week. "I am thrilled that we are moving from proposing a plan that would retain the tournament to witnessing the opening of this world-class venue. Now at more than 40 acres, the campus is twice as large as it was in 2024, making it  larger than the French Open site at Roland-Garros, according to the Cincinnati Open's Campus Transformation Fun Fact. While the event, which began August 5th and runs until August 18th, draws players from all over the world, this year's tournament has 41 Americans competing in the main draws: 22 women and 19 men. One of the Americans competing in Mason this year is seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams. At age 45,  Williams continues her comeback as the oldest woman to win a WTA match in more than two decades last month in Washington, D.C. On Thursday, she played against 22-year-old Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who wasn't yet born when Williams won her first four Grand Slam titles. This facility truly sets a new bar as part of our repertoire of community amenities and for the tennis world. We are proud that the Cincinnati Open calls the City of Mason home, and we invite everyone, even non-tennis/racquet sport fans, to visit this amazing venue. We look forward to a strong continued partnership with the Cincinnati Open and remain grateful for the support and dedication of our residents, fans, partners and players who contribute to making this internationally renowned event possible in the Mason community. Led by Bob Moran and Jansen Dell, we are proud of the efforts of the entire construction team to create this exceptional campus transformation," explained Mason's Mayor Diana Nelson at the campus' transformation ribbon cutting. Even with that, I am overwhelmed by how incredible the new facility is, another gem for Warren County for now and the next generation," noted Ohio State Representative Adam Mathews during the campus' transformation ribbon cutting. Beginning in 2026, the facility will be open for year-round public use and additional events outside of the tournament weeks. This was an ambitious scope and an aggressive timeline, but I couldn't be prouder of what the team accomplished. We feel this campus transformation will raise the bar for what it means to deliver exceptional fan and player experiences at a world-class tennis event. We look forward to welcoming everyone back this week and seeing their reactions as they take in thistransformed campus for the first time," said Jansen Dell, Cincinnati Open Chief Operating Officer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a rain-impacted Day 1 in Cincinnati, first-round action will continue on Friday at the ATP 1000 tournament. LWOT previews and predicts the exciting matches ahead of a star-studded weekend, with this set of matches featuring 2022 champion Borna Coric. Quinn has battled through a steady 2025 season, though Kecmanovic's been a bit more consistent through the year, which won him an ATP 250 title earlier in February. Quinn will play at this tournament for the first time in his career, something that should be exciting for the home athlete, but Kecmanovic has to be the favorite based on his experience. Boyer had a breakout end of 2024 at the ATP Challenger Tour level, though his form has faltered since then. Look for Holt to win this match with his consistent baseline game. Neither player should feel like the heavy favorite in this match, with both Nardi and Tirante unable to make a big breakthrough on hard courts this season. Such a win could give the Argentinian the confidence he needs to win his second career ATP 1000 match on hard courts. Coric's form has nosedived over the past few years, though he knows how to play well on these courts as the 2022 champion — a title win that saw him upset multiple Top 10 players, including Rafael Nadal. Nava is an exciting American to watch, however, and he's had some exciting runs on hard courts at tournaments such as Los Cabos. He also qualified for the main draw without dropping a set, giving him some always-needed matchplay ahead of this Center Court matchup. Unfortunately for Coric, he hasn't won a tour-level match on hard courts this season, and Nava's confidence at home might put heavy pressure on the former champion.
