                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gonzalo Garcia has signed a new Real Madrid contract through to 2030. The Athletic reported in the DealSheet on Tuesday Garcia's agent was working on an extension and an improvement to his deal after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup this summer. The plan this summer had initially been for the Spain youth international to depart in search of regular playing time, and he had doubts over his future at Madrid due to Endrick, 19, competing for the same position. But after enjoying an impressive Club World Cup, he is expected to remain with the first team, with Xabi Alonso an important factor in his decision to sign a new deal. Not even Gonzalo Garcia could have predicted his past two months. Before the Club World Cup, the 21-year-old's standout moment in a Real Madrid shirt had been a late header against Leganes to send his side through to the Copa del Rey semi-finals in February. But his achievements in the United States made everyone sit up and take notice. His goal against Juventus was the pick of the bunch, a guided header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross that drew comparisons with Madrid great Raul. Those were no surprise given the legendary former striker was Gonzalo's coach last season with Real Madrid Castilla, when he scored a record 25 goals in a campaign for the reserve side. Gonzalo revealed after the Juventus game that Raul still texts him after every match and called it “a great compliment to be compared to him” while “respecting the distances” between them. Nobody is suggesting Gonzalo can reach those levels just yet. But with Endrick's form erratic and Jude Bellingham absent after his shoulder surgery, the kid from the academy could be just what Xabi Alonso needs to break down stubborn opponents. Mario Cortegana  Santos is a Football Writer for The Athletic covering Real Madrid. He has followed Los Blancos since 2019 at Diario AS, Goal.com and MARCA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Women's World Cup is coming off traditional television channels in the United States and Canada and joining Netflix. It marks the first time that Netflix has taken on the rights to live soccer, and it joins the likes of DAZN, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Fubo and other streaming services to take on live matches in a step towards a new era of sports watching. “We are thrilled that Netflix will be FIFA's exclusive partner in Canada for the Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031,” said Gabe Spitzer, Netflix's vice-president of sports. “With under two years to go until the first match in Brazil, we are hard at work on planning and aim to give fans unparalleled access to the most prestigious competition in women's football.” At the same time, the DAZN Club World Cup package included studio and original programming, unlike many streaming services that take on sporting properties. Netflix has previously broadcast live sports, notably with the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match in 2024. However, that fight featured the service cutting out for several users, among other technical problems that will have to be sorted out for the World Cups and potential other properties. In addition to Paul vs. Tyson, Netflix has broadcast live Christmas Day NFL games, and the Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano fight card, with Netflix saying the latter drew 74 million live viewers worldwide. “We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada — a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history,” FIFA chief business officer Romy Gai said in a statement. Brazil is set to host the 2027 Women's World Cup, while the 2031 tournament is in its bidding process, with U.S. Soccer confirming its hosting interest in conjunction with other Concacaf nations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That deal marked the first time Netflix had bought up a sports competition in full. The tournament in two years will be held in Brazil, and will see Champions Spain looking to defend their trophy. Runners-up from the Australia and New Zealand 2023 tournament, England, got a modicum of revenge for narrowly losing that final by defeating Spain in the climax of this year's UEFA European Women's Championship over the summer. Jack Champion Joins Netflix Comedy 'Don't Say Good Luck' Michael Bay & Will Smith Part Company On Netflix Action Film 'Fast And Loose' “We are thrilled that Netflix will be FIFA's exclusive partner in Canada for the Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031,” said Gabe Spitzer, Vice President, Sports at Netflix. “With under two years to go until the first match in Brazil, we are hard at work on planning and aim to give fans unparalleled access to the most prestigious competition in women's football.” We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada – a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history.” Netflix's deals for the Women's FIFA World Cup have ramped up its efforts in live sports, which to date have included the likes of the recent Katie Taylor vs Amanda Serrano 3 boxing match – 2025's most-watched professional women's sporting event – and its predecessor last year, which drew an even bigger audience of 74 million live viewers. It also includes the derided but much-viewed Jake Paul v Mike Tyson boxing match, weekly WWE Raw programming from the sports entertainment world, NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming Saul Canelo v. Terence Crawford fight next month. The Brazil World Cup in 2027 will run from June 24 to July 25 and feature 32 teams. The following 2031 edition, whose host is expected to be selected in the second quarter of next year, will feature an expanded 48 teams. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The U.S. Travel Association is “raising concerns about a new cost” with which foreign travelers coming to the U.S. for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 L.A. Games will have to contend, according to Daniel Barnes of POLITICO. Under a new law, the Department of Homeland Security “must start charging visa applicants a $250 fee at the time their application is approved.” The fee will be “revised annually to keep up with inflation,” meaning it “could be higher by the time” of LA28. The Congressional Budget Office “estimated the fee would raise around” $28.9B over the next decade. The travel industry group on Friday announced the “launch of the America's Sports and Travel Mega Event Coalition,” a new effort to “support the president's focus on the mega sporting events” and urge administration officials to “delay implementation of the visa fee or lean on Congress to remove it altogether.” Monument Advocacy, which has worked with the U.S. Travel Association since 2006, will lead the lobbying efforts. The coalition, which includes Marriott International, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), American Airlines and others, also “plans to push for increased U.S. consular staffing and expanded hours of operation to make the visa process more efficient” (POLITICO, 8/7).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Streaming service Netflix (NFLX) has secured the exclusive broadcast rights for the FIFA Women's World Cup soccer games featuring the Canadian team that are to be held in 2027 and 2031. The deal with Canada and America marks a major change in how World Cup soccer tournaments are broadcast. However, Netflix is pushing further into live sporting events in an effort to drive monthly subscriptions. The streaming giant already airs live football, boxing, and wrestling events. Netflix is focused on building a global audience. “We will embrace the opportunity to work with Netflix to continue to grow the popularity of the women's game in Canada — a nation with a rich FIFA Women's World Cup history,” said FIFA, organizer of World Cup events, in a written statement. The 2027 World Cup will be hosted in Brazil from June 24 to July 25 and feature 32 teams from around the world. Canada's women's soccer team won gold at the 2020 Summer Olympics and is a contender to possibly win a FIFA Women's World Cup. The stock of Netflix has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 37 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 25 Buy, 11 Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The average NFLX price target of $1,395.19 implies 21.55% upside from current levels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club World Cup champions continue their short run-up to the Premier League season with a visit from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a preseason friendly. Chelsea have Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in a three-day span as Enzo Maresca has everyone back from the break earned following last month's 3-0 upset of Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup Final. The Blues have a bunch of new faces for this season, a figure that's even higher if you count players they added prior to or during the Club World Cup. Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, and Estevao Willian are in the fold, and the Blues continue to be linked with further additions. That list may grow as Levi Colwill has now suffered a long-term injury. Max Allegri's men are 3-0 this preseason, beating Arsenal on penalties before taking care of Liverpool and Perth Glory over 90 minutes. Ex-Chelsea men Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Fikayo Tomori give Milan plenty of familiarity with the venue. Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, and Trevoh Chalobah are with the club while Mamadou Sarr has been loaned to Strasbourg, Chelsea are quite deep in attack and may still add this summer as Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to London. While Brighton export Pervis Estupinan and Real Madrid free transfer Luka Modric will take a lot of the headlines, A pair of 23-year-old midfielders, however, are perhaps the more intriguing additions to Milan's project. Samuele Ricci (Torino)Ii is a box-to-box type with 10 caps for Italy who Milan are hoping gives them a true maestro for the long haul, while Swiss star Ardon Jashari arrives from Club Brugge off an impressive season in Belgium after multiple campaigns with Luzern in his home country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many players are expected to depart Manchester City over the coming weeks. The Premier League club have found it hard to move on unwanted players so far during the current transfer window, but it is a necessity, as Pep Guardiola has made it clear that he wants to work with a smaller group of players throughout the 2025/26 campaign. One of the easier ways to achieve this is by loaning out younger stars, with Vitor Reis set to join Girona ahead of the new season, while Jahmai Simpson-Pusey has already completed a temporary switch to Celtic. There is another member of Guardiola's squad who is in high demand, and the 19-year-old recently received a phone call from a World Cup winner about leaving Man City to join his club. Man City have rejected Roma's loan offer for Echeverri this week, which included a £29m (€33m) mandatory purchase clause, as the Premier League club have no intention of letting the midfielder leave permanently. According to Mundo Deportivo, Girona now look like the 19-year-old's destination for the upcoming season, as the La Liga club are Man City's preference for Echeverri after rejecting Roma's proposal. Echeverri would prefer a move to Roma as he is intrigued by their project and has received direct calls from fellow countrymen, Paulo Dybala and Matías Soulé, who have been trying to convince him to move to the Italian capital. However, that looks unlikely, as Manchester City have full control of the player and seem to have a plan in place for his development. Although Echeverri's future is complicated, one loan deal that has got over the line is Max Alleyne to Watford, with the Championship club announcing their new signing on Friday morning. This move had been lined up for some time, with Alleyne signing a new Man City contract before joining the Hornets for the 25/26 campaign.</p>

The latest rankings were released Thursday by world governing body FIFA. England, which has won back-to-back Euros and lost to Spain in the final at the 2023 World Cup, moved up one place to fourth. Brazil dropped three positions and is seventh despite successfully defending the Copa America to win its ninth continental title. Sweden and France were big movers after impressive showings at the Euros. Sweden rose three places and is third after being eliminated on penalties by England in the quarterfinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So which U.S. men's national team players have the most to prove in Europe? Here are five players to keep an eye on. And just like a power ranking, if you don't like it or if you disagree with it, that's fine. Dest is back on the field from his ACL injury and, so far, signs are good. I think beyond him proving that he can stay healthy this upcoming season, there are some interesting tactical questions when it comes to whether he is good enough to play defensively under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. But you take the good with the bad, and there's so much more good in terms of Dest going forward. Whether it's Pochettino or anybody else, I think most of his coaches have come to the realization that you can't hold him back. When Dest wants to defend, I think he can do it. It's just a question of whether he wants to defend. I think it's hard to keep him off of the pitch. Whether it's four or three in the back, I think he's going to be somewhere on that right side and I think he is going to be potent. If Dest is healthy and ready to go next summer in the World Cup, that right side looks very, very different. And I'm a lot more bullish about this team in general. I've also been bullish about Weah needing to start in that right wing spot and the ability to stretch the field. But you need to factor in the emergence of Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, and Christian Pulisic's ability to play on the right. And we can surmise that, whatever the situation was, it wasn't ideal for Pochettino nor for this team. I go back to when Musah first burst on the scene and was penciled into the USMNT midfield at a very young age. He could get out of situations that would then send the U.S. team into a much more attacking type of mode. What remains to be seen is whether we were already looking at Musah's ceiling and if that's as good as it gets. I still think there's something in the tank, maybe not a starter, but maybe he can start to ask some questions. The reason why I put Balogun here is that this No. And there are just over 300 days until the World Cup. But obviously it's been a long time since we saw him. He's endured injuries in his two years at Monaco, but luckily for him nobody has come along and taken that spot, even with Ricardo Pepi proving his worth. So if Balogun is playing, if he's scoring goals, he's right back in there when it comes to being the striker for the national team. I know that there are people out there that roll their eyes because we talked about Reyna so much. But again, it's relative to the fact that this player is undeniably talented. We don't know if he's even going to get called in going forward, and he's certainly not going to get called in if he can't change his playing situation. We still don't even know where he's going to end up after being linked with a move to Parma. But if he moves, or stays at Dortmund and things drastically change, then it would take very little for people to get right back on the Reyna train. From where he is right now, the gap can close dramatically. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?
