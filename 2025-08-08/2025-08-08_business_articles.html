Trump's Second Term:

Billy Long on Capitol Hill in Washington in April.

President Donald Trump plans to remove Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Billy Long from the job to nominate him for an ambassadorship, according to a White House official, throwing the leadership of the tax agency once again into turmoil.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner until a permanent replacement is named, according to the official, who described the changes on the condition of anonymity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold prices fell from a record high Friday after the White House said it will clarify "misinformation" about the precious metal facing tariffs. "The White House intends to issue an executive order in the near future clarifying misinformation about the tariffing of gold bars and other specialty products," a White House official told CNBC. Gold futures fell from an all-time closing high of $3,491.30 on the White House statement. The precious metal was last trading at $3,463.30. The Swiss Precious Metals Association warned earlier Friday that U.S. tariffs "may negatively impact the international flow  of physical gold." President Donald Trump has imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss exports to the U.S. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection apparently clarified this week that that 1 kilogram and 100 ounce gold bars are not excluded from the tariffs. "It must be noted that this clarification does not apply exclusively to Switzerland but to all 1kg and 100oz gold cast bars imported into the USA from any country," the Swiss Precious Metals Association said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of The Trade Desk plummeted almost 40% on Friday and headed for their worst day on record after the ad-tech company announced the departure of its CFO and analysts expressed concerns about rising competition from Amazon. The Trade Desk, which went public in 2016, suffered its steepest prior drop in February, when the shares fell 33% on a revenue miss. In its second-quarter earnings report late Thursday, the company beat expectations on earnings and revenue, but the results failed to impress investors. The Trade Desk, which specializes in providing technology to companies that want to target users across the web, said finance chief Laura Schenkein is leaving the job and being replaced by Alex Kayyal, who has been working as a partner at Lightspeed Ventures. Amazon has emerged as a significant player in the digital advertising market in recent years, and is now third behind Google and Meta. Last week, Amazon reported a 23% increase in ad revenue for the second quarter to $15.7 billion, which beat estimates. Amazon's ad business has largely been tied to its own platforms, with brands paying up so they can get discovered on the sprawling marketplace. However, Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), which allows brands to programmatically place ads across a wider swath of internet properties, is gaining more resonance in the market. "Amazon is now unlocking access to traditionally exclusive 'premium' ad inventory across the open internet, validating the strength of its DSP and suggesting The Trade Desk's value proposition could erode over time," Wedbush analysts wrote on Friday. Executives at The Trade Desk were asked about Amazon on the call, and responded by suggesting that the companies don't really compete, emphasizing that Amazon is conflicted because it will always prioritize its own properties. "A scaled independent DSP like The Trade Desk becomes essential as we help advertisers buy across everything and that we have to do that without conflict or compromise," CEO Jeff Green said on the call. "It is my understanding that Amazon nearly doubled the supply of Prime Video inventory in the recent months. That creates a number of conflicts." For the second quarter, The Trade Desk reported a 19% increase in year-over-year revenue to $694 million, topping the $685 million estimate, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of 41 cents beat estimates by a penny. Looking to the third quarter, the Trump administration's tariffs were also a theme, as the company forecast revenue of at least $717 million, representing growth of 14% at minimum. "From a macro standpoint, some of the world's largest brands are absolutely facing pressure and some amount of uncertainty," Green said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan addressed "misinformation" about his previous roles after President Donald Trump called for his resignation and raised ethical concerns. " I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I've built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards," he wrote in a memo to employees on Thursday. He said Intel's board is "fully supportive" of the company's transformation plan. Tensions hit a boiling point Thursday when Trump told Tan to step down as CEO "immediately" in a post to Truth Social and called him "highly CONFLICTED." Trump's demand coincided with questions from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., over the CEO's connection to Chinese companies and the potential ramifications for U.S. security. "Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations," Cotton wrote. "Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations." In his letter, Cotton also highlighted a criminal case at Cadence Design Systems involving illegally shipping products to China and asked whether Intel made Tan liquidate investments in chipmakers tied to the Chinese Communist Party. Tan worked at Cadence for over a decade and served as CEO. Tan was appointed CEO of Intel in March, replacing Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by the board in December after struggling to turnaround the embattled chipmaker. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Thursday that the firm does not believe Tan is "conflicted," but his connections to China depict an "increasingly bad look" considering who is currently in the White House. "Unfortunately, unlike other tech CEOs Lip-Bu does not appear to have cultivated the kind of personal relationship with Trump that would help to assuage his ire," Rasgon wrote. Trump may also be disappointed by recent decisions at the company, which included axing some foundry projects. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets. European stock markets rose sharply after news emerged that U.S. and Russian officials are working on a deal to stop the war in Ukraine. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar, reported that a potential agreement would allow Russia to occupy the territory it took during its invasion of Ukraine. Germany's DAX and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 provisionally closed flat, pulled down by declines in defense stocks. Shares of European defense contractors slipped into the red after news emerged that U.S. and Russian officials are working on a deal to stop the war in Ukraine. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar, reported that a potential agreement would allow Russia to occupy the territory it took during its invasion of Ukraine. London-listed BAE Systems and Babcock also gave up gains from earlier in the day. The companies are expected to benefit from renewed spending in Europe's defense rearmament. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges has told CNBC he sees a more competitive environment in Germany, but that the country still has huge bureaucracy. His comments came after Deutsche Telekom raised its core profit guidance for 2025 on Thursday, but flagged weak demand in its home market. Hottges told CNBC the company is looking to defend its position in a price war, saying "we are defending our positions in areas where we are highly attacked with lower prices." Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC on Thursday that the path for U.K. interest rates is still downward, but policymakers are facing a more "finely balanced situation" as inflation, a weaker labor market and U.S. tariffs create uncertainty. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, reducing rates to 4%. In an interview with CNBC's Ritika Gupta, Bailey said the division between committee members reflected "what a finely balanced situation we're currently in," but insisted he still believed "the path will be further downwards." "But I think we've got more uncertainty about the precise … course of that path," he said. "So I think there is more uncertainty about exactly what we'll be doing at the meetings immediately to come." Bailey said there are lingering risks around inflation, which hit a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June, and noted that the U.K. labor market was showing signs of weakening. He added that the MPC was monitoring new U.S. tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration, although he stressed that domestic considerations were having a bigger impact on its decisions right now. "The world is still in an uncertain place, and we have to factor that in, and I would also say that … yes, there's a whole series of sort of settlements on tariffs going on, but of course, it is leaving overall tariff levels and [the] overall impact on trade at a larger level than it has been for a very long time," he told CNBC. "I think we have to bear that in mind as well … we spend a lot of time looking at the world, because the U.K. is a very open economy." The company's chief financial officer, Christoph Jurecka, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" that the tariff environment is not affecting its commitment to the U.S., and warned of an upward trend in large losses from natural disasters. We're around 30 minutes into Friday's trading session, and stocks are broadly marginally higher. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen trading around 0.1% higher. Shares of German reinsurer Munich Re are down 7.3% after the company trimmed its insurance revenue forecast, citing currency headwinds and business developments. Markets are now pricing in a more-than 90% probability the Bank of England keeps rates where they are at its next meeting. Capital Economics says it expects the central bank to keep cutting at every meeting until it reaches a 3% base rate next year because it disagrees with its inflation forecasts, and says "it's only a matter of time" before labor market weakness leads to wage growth and inflation coming back down toward the Bank's target. Meanwhile, Barclays has a November cut as its base case, flagging the risk of Reeves' potential budget measures dragging on GDP growth and pulling inflation lower. Shares of Munich Re are lower in pre-market trade, after the reinsurer lowered its insurance revenue forecast for 2025. The group cited foreign exchange and business developments, but second-quarter net profit still came in above expectations. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the latest economic think tank to warn that taxes would have to rise later this year if British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules." Overnight in Asia, stocks were mixed, with Japanese stocks surging after investment giant SoftBank hit a record high following a quarterly earnings beat. Regional indexes look set for a muted open this morning, with futures tied to the FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX trading flat, while those tied to the French CAC 40 were last seen trading 0.2% higher. European shares ended Thursday's session higher after Moscow confirmed Russian President Vladimir Putin was scheduled to meet with U.S. counterpart Donald Trump within days.

Another chart comparing models on a different metric depicted 69.1% and 30.8% with the same size bar. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted, "wow a mega chart screwup from us earlier." Tech demos aren't immune to the occasional flub. When Microsoft unveiled Bing's AI chatbot in 2023, it made several mistakes during its demo. When asked for pros and cons of a particular vacuum, it listed noisiness and a short cord as cons, but the vacuum is cordless. In an ad that same month, Google's AI chatbot Bard, which has since been renamed Gemini, gave an incorrect answer to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. It's unclear if AI was used to make the charts, and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple, which has historically been the quietest of the Big Tech companies when it comes to dealmaking, set off a guessing game in Silicon Valley last week when CEO Tim Cook said he was on the hunt for deals. Apple's stock is down about 10% this year, partly out of investor concern that it has fallen behind in the AI race. "That's a lot of what we were hearing on the earnings call, is the leadership team acknowledging, we understand you want us to do something, we hear you, and if that means more investment or if that means making an acquisition, those are both things that we are looking into." "We are not stuck on a certain size company," he said. Cook said Apple has bought seven smaller companies this year from "all walks of life" and was doing a deal once every few weeks. Its last sizable deal was over a decade ago, when it bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. Apple's core is all about consumer experiences, creativity, and media, so it would be better for the company to focus acquisitions on AI startups that help it make progress in these areas, the banker said. That would probably rule out startups such as Anthropic and Cohere, which focus more on enterprise users. This banker said that Apple should have bought OpenAI, but with the startup's valuation potentially headed toward $500 billion, that ship has very likely sailed. There are also regulatory concerns if a company is too big, according to Luria. "For most intents and purposes, large M&A right now is off limits for these companies," Luria said, pointing to Meta's Scale AI investment as a blueprint for how Apple might proceed with a partnership and investment rather than an acquisition. Who thinks this is a good idea: Jim McVeigh, Gil Luria, Jordan Thibodeau, and Dan Ives "We're humbled that so many of the best phone makers in the world are interested in Perplexity, but aside from our own acquisitions, we are unaware of any M&A discussions that involve Perplexity," Perplexity's head of communication Jesse Dwyer told BI. Who thinks this is a good idea: Gil Luria and Ben Thompson What it does: Develops retinal scan display technology for augmented reality What it does: AI lab founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer, Mira Murati</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in an interview. "People are going to walk in the door almost instantaneously becoming reviewers and supervisors," she said. This is leaving entry-level employees free to focus on "more advanced and value-added work," Kosar said. "We will look back and say, 'Okay, these young people feel more like the managers of my day.'" Kosar said the technology meant PwC was changing how it trains its junior employees, adding that entry-level workers have to know how to review and supervise the AI's work. Where the Big Four firm once focused on teaching young employees to execute audit tasks, it's now focused on more "back to basics" training and the fundamentals of what an audit should do for a client, she said. Kosar was a partner in its digital assurances and transparency division before her role as AI assurance lead was created in July 2024. PwC's "assurance for AI" product, which works with clients on ensuring the AI they use is operated responsibly, has only existed since June. For all its potential, AI is challenging the Big Four's long-held business models, organizational structures, and day-to-day roles. Firms are having to consider outcomes-based pricing models based on results instead of billing clients by the hour. Alan Paton, a former partner in PwC UK's financial services division who's now CEO of a Google Cloud solutions consultancy, previously told Business Insider that automation could increasingly cause clients to question why they should pay consultants big money when they can get answers "instantaneously from a tool." While AI is already transforming more junior roles, Kosar said the technology would eventually affect senior ones. Partners and managers will have to adapt to new types of requests from clients, who are asking how AI can fully take over certain business tasks, she added. "It's a shift in how we serve clients as opposed to accelerating progression of capabilities," Kosar told BI. Kosar acknowledged there was fear AI would reduce critical thinking capabilities and replace jobs, but she said she thought AI would lead to better-informed, faster-developing professionals. "We will actually get to a better place in terms of how auditing works, how consulting works, and be able to focus on higher value insights and information," she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just over two and a half years ago, Mira Lane was asked during an informal discussion with someone at Google what she wanted to do with her life. She told Business Insider that she put together a "one-pager" about an AI prototyping lab that explores the impact of tech innovation on society, and sent it to the Googler who would eventually become her boss. The gamble paid off and she was brought on to spearhead Google's Envisioning Studio, an AI innovation prototyping lab made up of creative strategists, philosophers, and researchers dedicated to exploring technology at Google. Though Lane's career transition appears seamless in retrospect, the vice president of Google's Tech and Society told Business Insider she has a long history of pitching new ideas. These are Lane's tips on pitching ideas to management: Lane's first piece of advice is to get into a mindset where you feel OK with rejection. The Google executive said the idea you're pitching shouldn't be a "part of your identity," but you should still be attached to it to some degree and believe in it. "If you really like your idea, you can have a bunch of people say 'no' to it, and that's fine," Lane said. Lane said that when she pitched the Envisioning Studio to Google, the document she created was about three-quarters of a page. She said she knew that the leader reading it wouldn't have time to read an essay or a slide deck, so she made sure the tone was direct and to the point. Lane said she wrote the shortest pitch possible, and sweated over "every single word," to make sure each pushed her message forward. Lane said it's important to anchor your pitch into a problem — and that the problem has to be "big enough." When she was pitching the Envisioning Studio, she said she felt like there was a societal issue where people were feeling like they didn't have control over the future of technology. "It can't be so abstract, or niche, where people are like, 'well, that feels like a small thing. Lane said she was asked unusual questions in her Google interview, like about how she wants to make the world better.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead, Tan says it's the micro-credentials you earn from bite-sized courses that will impress employers. But I think there's more to it, whether that's your social experiences or being more entrepreneurial," Tan said in an interview with Business Insider last month. Before Meta, Tan was a regional director overseeing advertising sales at BBC News and a global vice president for retail at TripAdvisor. She is also the author of a careers book, "Own Your MAGIC." "The traditional setup of education, where you get a degree, is table stakes," she said. Tan cited her experience taking a short course on generative AI through a Singapore government initiative to supplement her learning. "I work for Meta, which is at the forefront of AI. But there is still so much that I could learn," Tan said. "I can look at YouTube videos, read the recipes, but you are not going to learn as fast unless you actually practice it," Tan said. Tan said people looking to level up can take classes — some of them free — on massive open online course providers like Coursera. Such courses will help candidates distinguish themselves and "set them up for success," Tan said. She added that continuing to pick up new skills even after graduating from college demonstrates one's curiosity, inquisitiveness, and passion for learning. Tan said she has been applying AI in the workplace and at home. Tan said even her daughters use AI, whether as a private tutor or to create comics. "At work, it's more like a partner," Tan said, adding that she uses AI to summarize long videos or to conduct research. "On the personal front, I use it for travel. Accenture CEO Julie Sweet says she always asks interviewees what they have learned recently. "We say, 'What have you learned in the last six months?'" "If someone can't answer that question, and by the way, we don't care if it's 'I learned to bake a cake,' if they can't answer that question, then we know that they're not a learner," she added.
