                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pennington Biomedical researchers Dr. Eric Ravussin and Dr. Krisztian Stadler contributed to the study in which they and colleagues examined cysteine and discovered that it triggered the transition of white fat cells to brown fat cells, which are a more active form of fat cells that burn energy to produce heat and maintain body temperature. When researchers restricted cysteine in animal models entirely, it drove high levels of weight loss and increased fat burning and browning of fat cells, further demonstrating cysteine's importance in metabolism. "These results suggest future weight management strategies that might not rely exclusively on reducing caloric intake." The article is based on results from trials involving both human participants and animal models. For the human trials, researchers examined fat tissue samples taken from trial participants who had actively restricted calorie intake over a year. "Reverse translation of a human caloric restriction trial identified a new player in energy metabolism," said Dr. Ravussin, who holds the Douglas L. Gordon Chair in Diabetes and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical and oversees its Human Translation Physiology Lab. "Systemic cysteine depletion in mice causes weight loss with increased fat utilization and browning of adipocytes." The tissue samples came from participants in the CALERIE clinical trial, which recruited healthy young and middle-aged men and women who were instructed to reduce their calorie intake by an average of 14% over two years. In the animal models, researchers provided meals with reduced calories. "Dr. Ravussin, Dr. Stadler, and their colleagues have made a remarkable discovery showing that cysteine regulates the transition from white to brown fat cells, opening new therapeutic avenues for treating obesity," said Dr. John Kirwan, Executive Director of Pennington Biomedical Research Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Look inside a brain cell with Huntington's disease or ALS and you are likely to find RNA clumped together. These solid-like clusters, thought to be irreversible, can act as sponges that soak up surrounding proteins key for brain health, contributing to neurological disorders. How these harmful RNA clusters form in the first place has remained an open question. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have not only uncovered that tiny droplets of protein and nucleic acids in cells contribute to the formation of RNA clusters but also demonstrated a way to prevent and disassemble the clusters. Their findings, described in a study published recently in Nature Chemistry, uses an engineered strand of RNA known as an antisense oligonucleotide that can bind to RNA clusters and disperse them. "It's fascinating to watch these clusters form over time inside dense, droplet-like mixtures of protein and RNA under the microscope. "What's exciting about this discovery is that we not only figured out how these clusters form but also found a way to break them apart." The study sheds new light on how RNA clusters form within biomolecular condensates. Cells make these liquid-like droplets from RNA, DNA and proteins -- or a combination of all three. Banerjee's team has researched them extensively, investigating their role in both cellular function and disease, as well as their fundamental material properties that present new opportunities for synthetic biology applications. The condensates are essentially used as hosts by repeat RNAs, disease-linked RNA molecules with abnormally long strands of repeated sequences. "This persistence is partly why the clusters are thought to be irreversible." The team was first able to demonstrate that repeat RNA clustering can be prevented by using an RNA-binding protein known as G3Bp1 that is present in cells. You can think of the G3BP1 as an observant molecular chaperone that binds to the sticky RNA molecules and makes sure that RNAs don't stick to each other." The team found that ASO's disassembly abilities were highly tied to its specific sequence. "This suggests our ASO can be tailored to only target specific repeat RNAs, which is a good sign for its viability as a potential therapeutic application," Banerjee says. "It really just shows how RNAs may have evolved to take these different forms of matter, some of which are extremely useful for biological functions and perhaps even life itself -- and others that can bring about disease," Banerjee says. “Magic” Cleaning Sponges Found to Release Trillions of Microplastic Fibers After 50 Years, a Neutrino Detector Finally Catches Elusive Ghost Particles Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One way scientists illustrate this threat is by using climate tipping points, also known as planetary boundaries, which showcase around nine critical ecological thresholds that could have devastating effects for life on Earth once crossed. These include things like biosphere integrity, ozone depletion, ocean acidification, and a relative newcomer known as “aquatic deoxygenation.” Although these thresholds are discussed with deadly seriousness, scientists wonder if the reverse of these doom-and-gloom thresholds—positive tipping points, if you will—could help encourage people, communities, and countries to adopt more aggressive green policies. The goal of this new paper is to design a methodology for identifying possible positive tipping points, understand how close we are to achieving these tipping points, identify what factors (both positive and negative) can influence them, and suggest what actions could be done to trigger them. “The challenge now is to identify potential positive tipping points, and the actions that can bring them forward—while avoiding wishful thinking about their existence, or oversimplification of their nature, drivers, and impacts,” Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter said in a press statement. “The global economy is decarbonizing at least five times too slowly to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius.” The good news is that we're not starting from zero. Thankfully, we're already well on our way to achieving some of these tipping points. For example, the widespread adoption of wind and solar energy over the past few decades has both increased renewable energy generation and driven investment into those industries, which in turn has lowered the once pricey costs of these technologies. “Other transformations—such as a major shift away from meat consumption—might also be more likely than they appear,” Steve Smith from the University of Exeter said in a press statement. “In other sectors there is little sign of approaching tipping points and in a few, such as nuclear power and concrete production, we should not expect there to be tipping points at all.” While the planetary red flags are immensely important for us to keep our eye on, it also helps to put in place actionable climate goals that can help us make the planet a healthy one for generations to come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian Coast's strongest earthquake since 1952 provided enough energy for six volcanoes adjacent to the Ring of Fire to spout off. One of the largest earthquakes recorded in modern-day history has seemingly set off a cluster of volcanoes in Russia, with six separate volcanoes near the Kamchatka Peninsula erupting since the late-July quake, and a seventh shows signs it might join the party. This is the first time in roughly 300 years that this many volcanoes have set off at the same time in such tight proximity, with Ozerov adding that the event is an “extremely rare phenomenon that can be described as a parade of volcanic eruptions.” The Kamchataka Volcanic Eruption Response Team has held an orange code alert for the volcanic activity with ash exploding over four miles high and a plume now extending 133 miles to the southeast while lava and ash continue to move. “As explosions up to [32,800 feet] could occur at any time,” the team warned, “ongoing activity could affect international and low-flying aircraft.” The direct earthquake-to-eruption theory holds more weight when a volcano is already nearing activity, Harold Tobin, professor of seismology and geohazards at the University of Washington and director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, told NPR. “It wouldn't have experienced really extreme shaking. Nonetheless, seismic waves that are passing through the Earth are certainly affecting underground systems like potentially magma that's in cracks in the rock inside a volcano.” It could have added up to an increased force in an eruption or, as Tobin said, “shake loose the system that then allows it to actually erupt.” Paul Segall, geophysicist at Stanford University, told Live Science that “it is not unprecedented for a large subduction zone earthquake to trigger volcanic eruptions.” Citing a 9.5 magnitude quake in Chile in 1960, Segall said the earthquake could change the stress in the Earth's crust, making it easier for magma to rise.

(2025)Cite this article The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields could enable functionalities and applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials and soft matter. Liquid crystals that exhibit both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. Here we report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic liquid crystals is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic liquid crystal in a micropillar array, forming topological defect–pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multimemory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, these results advance our understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking and recording of flow profiles and could facilitate the development of stimuli-responsive materials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese researchers have recently challenged the long-held belief that "all life depends on sunlight." These microbes derive energy from abiotic redox reactions during water–rock interactions. Hydrogen (H2) serves as their main energy source and oxidants are also essential for metabolic activities, but their origins were not previously well understood. To tackle this mystery, the research team simulated crustal faulting activities and discovered that free radicals produced during rock fracturing can decompose water, generating both hydrogen and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In microbe-rich fractures, hydrogen production driven by earthquake-related faulting was found to be up to 100,000 times greater than that from other known pathways, such as serpentinization and radiolysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered that jewel wasps can slow down their biological rate of aging. A study of jewel wasps, known for their distinctive metallic colors, has shown that they can undergo a kind of natural 'time-out' as larvae before emerging into adulthood with this surprising advantage. Aging isn't just about counting birthdays, it's also a biological process that leaves molecular fingerprints on our DNA. One of the most accurate markers of this process is the epigenetic clock, which tracks chemical changes in DNA, known as methylation, that accumulate with age. But what happens if we alter the course of development itself? To find out, a team at the University of Leicester including first author PhD student Erin Foley, Dr Christian Thomas, Professor Charalambos Kyriacou, and Professor Eamonn Mallon, from the department of Genetics, Genomics and Cancer Sciences, turned to Nasonia Vitripennis, also known as the jewel wasp. The researchers exposed jewel wasp mothers to cold and darkness, triggering a hibernation-like state in their babies called diapause. This natural "pause button" extended the offsprings' adult lifespan by over a third. What's more, the molecular slowdown wasn't just a random effect, it was linked to changes in key biological pathways that are conserved across species, including those involved in insulin and nutrient sensing. These same pathways are being targeted by anti-aging interventions in humans. What makes this study novel and surprising is that it demonstrates a long-lasting, environmentally triggered slowdown of aging in a system that's both simple and relevant to human biology. Professor Mallon added: "Understanding how and why aging happens is a major scientific challenge. This study opens up new avenues for research, not just into the biology of wasps, but into the broader question of whether we might one day design interventions to slow aging at its molecular roots. "In short, this tiny wasp may hold big answers to how we can press pause on aging." “Magic” Cleaning Sponges Found to Release Trillions of Microplastic Fibers After 50 Years, a Neutrino Detector Finally Catches Elusive Ghost Particles Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
