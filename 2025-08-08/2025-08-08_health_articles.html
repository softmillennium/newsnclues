                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This transcript has been edited for clarity. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to discuss a very interesting and controversial topic. The paper I'm discussing is “Germline Pathogenic Variants Identified in Patients With Genitourinary Malignancies Undergoing Universal Testing: A Multisite Single-Institution Prospective Study,” published in the Journal of Urology. It has been well recognized for over a decade that patients with ovarian cancer need to have germline testing, independent of whether they have a family history of that particular cancer because we identified particular mutations — BRCA mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 — that may not be evident in the family by history but are very relevantpotentially for cascade testing of their family members later. Increasingly, the discussion is about more universal testing for patients with breast cancer because of the incidences of BRCA and other mutations that are both relevant for treatment and for the question of genetic counseling for other members of the family. What about genitourinary (GU) cancers, as identified here? Should one take patients with all different kinds of GU tumors — prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancers, typically — and say there's a role for universal germline testing when a patient has been identified as having one of these cancers? To address this question, the group at the Mayo Clinic undertook comprehensive germline testing, examining for pathogenic germline variants at several sites from April 2018 to March 2020. A total of 601 patients enrolled with GU cancers. Again, this was across the sites and with GU cancers, regardless of a family history. Surprisingly, a majority of these patients, 86%, were male. First, they were seen in almost the same percentage in kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer, and that 14% is not that far off. Importantly, at this time, based on these data, fully 67% (or 2 of 3) patients had abnormalities that were potentially actionable. It could mean there may be a therapy involved. They were not like, “Oh, that's interesting, but there's nothing we can do about it.” For 2 out of 3, they could actually do something actionable. Importantly, of those 82 patients, 35% had at least one relative undergo cascade testing to examine for that variant. The bottom line here is that more than 1 of 8 patients in this unselected group of patients with GU cancers had a variant finding that was potentially pathogenic at the germline level. This would argue for — although there is going to be controversy and we need more data — universal testing, certainly of GU tumors, and one might ask for other tumor types. This would obviously be an extensive, new universal recommendation with costs associated with it, but this paper certainly raises that question that needs to be further examined.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ultraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public. We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. And if certain additives and processing steps used to make healthier food like commercial whole grain breads have any health impact." Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory The rapid rise in UPF consumption since the 1990s disrupted traditional dietary patterns, potentially contributing to adverse health effects. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. As detailed in a CDC report published yesterday, 55% of calories consumed by people ages 1 and older in the U.S. were UPFs. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. UPFs are relatively inexpensive, convenient for use and aggressively marketed, particularly toward youth and under-resourced communities, often displacing healthier alternatives. This new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to: UPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Human diets are increasingly including more industrially processed foods, leading to various systems for classifying foods based on processing criteria. Efforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers. The writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as "better-for-you alternatives." A meta-analysis of prospective studies cited in the advisory found a dose-response relationship between UPF consumption and cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, transient ischemic attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality. High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs-what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain. Balancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs: "More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers in Denmark show that every extra hour of daily screen use in kids and teens increases cardiometabolic risk, but getting enough sleep may help protect their hearts. In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers leveraged data from two Danish longitudinal cohorts comprising more than 1,000 mother-child participants to uncover the impacts of screen time on concurrent cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents. The study revealed that increased screen time, an increasingly worrisome trend in today's society, is associated with higher cardiometabolic risk. Encouragingly, however, longer sleep duration might help to weaken this association, with adequate sleep linked to a reduced strength of the relationship between screen time and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. Researchers also identified a novel blood-based "metabolomic signature" for high screen time that predicted screen time exposure across cohorts, and separately found that higher screen time in adolescents was associated with a higher predicted risk of future cardiovascular disease based on an NMR-derived CVD risk score. These findings underscore the critical interplay between screen use and sleep in shaping early-life cardiovascular health, while emphasising that the results are observational and cannot prove causality, thereby shaping future public health policy. Screen time impacted teen body composition differently by sex: While boys showed steeper increases in BMI, fat mass, and muscle mass with more screen time, girls saw weaker or non-significant changes. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the world's leading non-communicable causes of human mortality, with their origins traceable to exposures from childhood and even infancy. The accumulation of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, such as high blood pressure, adverse cholesterol levels, excess waist circumference, and insulin resistance during youth, sets the stage for adult disease. Alarming, our increasingly sedentary world of today, dominated by screen time, exacerbates known CVD-associated risk factors, including obesity and unhealthy dietary patterns. While previous research has linked high screen time to these individual risk factors, the relationship is complex, and it is often difficult to untangle the effects of screen time from other lifestyle factors like physical activity and, most importantly, sleep. CVDs' staggeringly high mortality rates (~19.8 million / 32% of all global deaths) and the fact that their global burden is rising necessitate the identification of early-life interventions that may safeguard our future generations from the dangers of heart disease. Changes in screen habits mattered: When researchers tracked kids from age 6 to 10, the increase in their screen time over those years was more strongly tied to worsening insulin resistance than their starting point. The present study aims to address this gap in the literature by leveraging two deeply phenotyped longitudinal Danish cohorts (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood [COPSAC2010 and COPSAC2000]) to provide a more comprehensive picture of how screen time, sleep, and cardiometabolic health are intertwined during critical early developmental periods. The study's primary outcome of interest was a composite cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score, calculated from Z-scores of five key measures: 1. waist circumference, 2. systolic blood pressure, 3. high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 4. triglycerides, and 5. glucose. Lifestyle factors, including sleep duration and physical activity, were objectively measured using accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X+) worn for 14 days. To explore the underlying biology of screen time-sleep-CVD risk associations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics of participants' blood samples was carried out, and a supervised machine learning model was trained to identify a "metabolic signature" of high screen time. Linear mixed models assessed the association between screen time and CMR. In tandem with metabolic signature profiles, these were used to generate a 10-year CVD risk score for each participant. Even after accounting for socio-demographic and medical confounders (age, sex, chronic disease), each additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a significant increase in the CMR score in both children (β=0.08, P=0.021) and adolescents (β=0.13, P=0.001). Crucially, sleep duration was a powerful moderator of this risk. The paper suggests evening light exposure from devices could disrupt natural melatonin rhythms, potentially explaining how late screen use worsens metabolic health. In childhood, sleep duration also mediated about 12% of the association between screen time and CMR, and later sleep onset was linked to a higher risk. This indicates that adequate sleep may help buffer against the metabolic effects of high screen time. This signature, which included elevated triglycerides and altered lipoprotein profiles, was robust enough to be identified in the childhood cohort and then successfully validated in the adolescent cohort. Separately, adolescents were observed to be more vulnerable to the effects of higher screen time, which was significantly associated with a higher predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (β=0.07, P=0.017) based on an adult-trained NMR cardiovascular risk score. Although some associations appeared stronger in boys, formal interaction tests showed no statistically significant sex differences. The present study provides strong evidence linking increased screen time and poor cardiometabolic health in both childhood and adolescence, but as an observational study, it cannot prove causation. Notably, sleep duration was found to potentially protect against the detrimental impacts of higher screen time. Finally, identifying a blood-based metabolomic signature for high screen time and a separate CVD risk score associated with screen time in adolescents offers mechanistic insights and opens the door for new biomarkers to identify at-risk youth and implement timely interventions. The authors highlight that their moderation and mediation analyses are exploratory and that reported screen time data could be subject to bias.
