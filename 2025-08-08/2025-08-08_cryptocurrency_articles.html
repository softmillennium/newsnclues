                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A hidden signal from the derivatives market suggests that ether's (ETH) rally could intensify, lifting valuations quickly to $4,400. Gamma is the critical metric for options traders, measuring how an option's delta, or its sensitivity to the underlying asset's price, changes in response to market moves. When dealers are short gamma, they are forced to buy the underlying asset as its price rises and sell as its price falls, which often amplifies directional moves. Dealers provide liquidity to the order book and make money from the bid-ask spread while constantly striving to maintain a price-neutral net exposure. At press time, there was a notable buildup of short gamma between strikes $4,000 and $4,400, according to data source Amberdata. With ether crossing above $4,000, dealers could buy the asset to hedge their exposure, creating a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop that could rapidly propel the price higher to $4,400. "If the momentum in the market is strong enough to get through $4,000, we see dealers also become net buyers of ETH at higher prices, potentially leading to a quick rally to $4,400, the next big gama inventory level," Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, told CoinDesk.

SkyBridge Capital founder and leading cryptocurrency advocate Anthony Scaramucci endorsed the Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) network on Wednesday, suggesting it is on the verge of significant growth. Scaramucci stated in an X post, “Avalanche has been building and its moment is coming,” indicating his firm support for the Layer-1 blockchain. John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, Avalanche's lead developer, responded to the post with a saluting emoji. Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Scaramucci cited a video from the Tokenized Asset Coalition in which Nahas discusses the concept of “purpose-built chains” for specific use cases. Nahas highlighted how Avalanche is moving away from piling everything into single chains, instead focusing on the idea of "Your business, your blockchain." It was dubbed an “Ethereum Killer” in its early days, although Ethereum has grown to be far larger in market value and decentralized finance. One of Avalanche's key features is Subnets, which are interoperable networks within the ecosystem that can be tailored to specific use cases If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some companies are now offering the option to receive salaries in digital assets, a trend likely to gain traction as the crypto market evolves. Secondly, some employees see this as a hedge against inflation and traditional financial systems. Lastly, the allure of crypto's rapid growth and potential for significant returns is undeniably appealing. Crypto payroll solutions promise reduced transaction costs, faster processing times, and flexible payment options for employees. By leveraging stablecoins, these platforms can ensure that employees are compensated in a stable currency, thereby mitigating the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. The trend of tech workers opting for crypto payroll has the potential to further drive demand for digital currencies, especially if a significant portion of workers begins to receive their salaries in these assets. This could lead to increased buying pressure, positively impacting market prices. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as more companies adopt these solutions, and managing the technical infrastructure to support crypto payroll can be complex. Furthermore, navigating the tax implications of receiving salaries in cryptocurrencies can be tricky for both employers and employees. Overall, the future of crypto salaries remains uncertain but undoubtedly intriguing. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's scaling roadmap is entering a faster phase, and the network's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, wants the clock to tick in seconds, not days. In an X post on Aug. 6, the Ethereum co-founder said that many major Layer 2 (L2) networks have now reached “Stage 1,” a milestone that marks their operational maturity on the network's scaling roadmap. According to analytics platform L2Beat, as of this week, all six rollups affected by recent Stage 1 requirement changes — Base, Optimism, Unichain, Scroll, Inco and Kinto — have completed the necessary upgrades and are now fully compliant. The next objective, Buterin argued in his X post, should be to cut withdrawal times to under an hour in the short term and about 12 seconds in the medium term, changes he called more important than advancing to Stage 2. The three-stage framework was first outlined in late 2022 on the Ethereum Magicians forum and later formalized by L2Beat, starting from experimental deployments, dubbed Stage 0, through operational but still improving systems, Stage 1, to fully trustless, fully verified rollups, known as Stage 2. DefiLlama data show that Ethereum's bridged TVL — the total value locked in bridge contracts moving assets across chains, not including Ethereum-based tokens — at around $500 billion, roughly twice the size of Ethereum's native on-chain TVL, which measures assets locked directly in Ethereum's own smart contracts such as DeFi protocols, staking, and lending, totaling about $245 billion. The gap shows just how important bridges have become for moving liquidity around. Additionally, cross-chain bridges still come with risks, as Buterin has often highlighted. In a January 2022 Reddit post, he explained that bridges connecting independent networks inherently increase risk because they rely on assumptions that may fail during network issues. “The fundamental security limits of bridges are actually a key reason why while I am optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem (there really are a few separate communities with different values and it's better for them to live separately than all fight over influence on the same thing), I am pessimistic about cross-chain applications,” Buterin wrote. For instance, if one blockchain suffers a 51% attack or undergoes a ledger reorganization, assets bridged to other chains could suddenly lose their backing or value. Now, Buterin proposes a “2-of-3” approach combining ZK proofs, optimistic proofs, and trusted execution environments to enhance both the speed and security of L2s in a bid to make them efficient enough that users won't need to rely on cross-chain bridges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain-powered telecom company World Mobile announced Friday that it has partnered with Indonesia's largest digital infrastructure provider, Protelindo, to launch a new stratospheric telecommunications platform aimed at expanding global connectivity. The initiative, called World Mobile Stratospheric, utilizes high-altitude, hydrogen-powered aircraft to provide direct-to-handset connections via blockchain-based infrastructure. The platform promises greater bandwidth, lower latency, and significantly reduced operating and environmental costs, up to 99% less environmental impact compared to conventional telecom deployments. Also Read: Two Seas Capital Opposes Core Scientific–CoreWeave Merger, Calls Deal Undervalued, Risky For Shareholders CEO Micky Watkins emphasized the importance of this token-based infrastructure. "By combining advanced aerospace technology with token-driven economics, we are building a network that connects more people, faster, and in a way that is economically and environmentally sustainable." Protelindo, whose telecom towers and fiber infrastructure cover Indonesia's archipelago, sees the technology as a leap forward for the region's underserved areas. A company spokesperson noted that World Mobile's model could dramatically improve access in remote regions. While skepticism around blockchain remains in traditional telecom sectors, World Mobile is positioning itself as a viable alternative and complementary player, especially in markets like the United States, where connectivity remains uneven. The aircraft's payload and endurance capabilities also open the door to additional applications beyond telecommunications, signaling broader use cases for blockchain-driven infrastructure in stratospheric operations.

"I'm excited to announce that Bags has made its first acquisition," Finn said on X following the auction, adding the hat to the Bags avatar. "We've acquired a $1B hat for just $0.7M. Get ready for what's coming next." The auction had to be paused at one point during the proceedings after a slew of fake bids were submitted, including one for an impossible amount of bitcoin, equivalent to the total 21 million BTC supply. "We massively underestimated your degeneracy," Ord City said in response, raising the auction's collateral requirement to rectify the issue. The token has gained more than 700% over the past 24 hours, rising to a market cap of $7.8 million, according to DEX Screener. The pink hat, originally handcrafted as a Christmas decoration, was first photographed on Achi in November 2018, and the image went viral when uploaded to Instagram. "This hat has been a lucky charm for us and a piece of internet culture that has traveled across chains, timelines, and communities, carrying our story along the way," the owners posted on X, congratulating Finn on the winning bid. "It has sparked conversations, inspired memes and connected people who share the same love for the dog wif hat. We hope it brings you and everyone around you the same luck, fun, and serendipity it brought us." Following a three-day auction on NFT marketplace Foundation in March 2024, crypto trader Gigantic Rebirth Ventures ultimately made the winning bid of 1,210.8 ETH, worth around $4.3 million at the time and $4.7 million at current prices. Dogwifhat is currently trading at $0.92, according to The Block's WIF price page, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours. Following a collapse in memecoin hype, the token is down over 70% since peaking around the time of the NFT sale, though it still commands a market cap of nearly $1 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin could soon be part of your 401(k), and Wall Street is getting ready. Trump's forthcoming executive order could open the $9 trillion US retirement market to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The order aims to give 401(k) providers legal protection when offering crypto investment options. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Apollo are reportedly developing crypto retirement products in anticipation of regulatory clarity. Financial providers may move cautiously, but the regulatory shift signals growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. If you've spent decades building your nest egg the traditional way, through your 401(k), stocks, bonds, and maybe a little gold, then you're not alone. According to Gallup, about six in 10 Americans have a well-defined retirement plan. US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that could open the doors for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies to enter the $9 trillion US retirement market. Now, if the word Bitcoin sounds like something from a sci-fi movie or a fad for tech-savvy youngsters, don't worry, you're not alone. This guide will walk you through what this executive order is, what it means for your savings and how you could legally and securely invest in Bitcoin through your 401(k). Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that could change how Americans save for retirement. This executive order is part of a broader pro-crypto strategy that aligns with what he has called his mission to “bring financial freedom back to the people.” Currently, most 401(k) plans limit your choices to things such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and sometimes gold. But this order could open the door to what are called alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The order is also expected to encourage employers and plan providers to offer more flexible investment options, without fearing legal trouble for stepping outside the traditional menu of funds. The details still need to be worked out, and financial providers may move cautiously. Crypto is no longer just a side bet for tech bros and Reddit threads. It's a trillion-dollar industry, and Bitcoin has earned its stripes as “digital gold”. Allowing Bitcoin in retirement plans means millions of Americans could start dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into BTC every paycheck, without needing to open a separate crypto exchange account.And this isn't just theoretical. In May, Trump's Labor Department reversed a Biden-era policy that discouraged 401(k) providers from offering crypto. Not all 401(k) plans will offer crypto right away. Your provider, whether it's Fidelity, Vanguard, or another, has to enable this option first. Starting small may introduce you to the digital assets while providing more long-term growth. According to VanEck's study, a strategic allocation of up to 6% in crypto, within a traditional 60/40 portfolio, provides the highest risk-adjusted returns, while risk-tolerant investors may benefit from crypto allocations as high as 20%. Once available, you'll be able to allocate part of your 401(k) into Bitcoin, just like you would with stocks or bonds. If the Trump crypto tax-free law is passed in parallel, it could mean tax exemptions on small crypto transactions or specific types of retirement contributions. A Bitcoin retirement account could soon be a reality in the US, designed to be both compliant and integrated into existing infrastructure.Legislators from North Carolina filed proposals in the House and Senate in March 2025 that would allow the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of several state retirement funds in cryptocurrencies. According to the Financial Times, big asset managers like Blackstone, Apollo and BlackRock have been preparing for this moment. Trump's order is expected to include a “legal safe harbor,” meaning these administrators won't be held liable for offering Bitcoin. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What did a decentralized ledger (known for Bitcoin) have to do with protecting and securing an enterprise infrastructure? That's when I began to look more seriously at blockchain not as a cryptocurrency enabler, but as a security primitive that could help us solve real-world problems security practitioners face today: tamper-evidence, data integrity and verifiable trust. At its core, blockchain is a system of records shared across multiple nodes. The blocks are chained together in a way that makes backdated data alteration computationally impractical. From a security lens, this architecture offers unique benefits: According to Gartner, 20% of large enterprises will use blockchain for digital trust initiatives by 2025. As a security practitioner, I've been following blockchain's move from theory to serious consideration, especially when dealing with persistent gaps in audit integrity, access verification and software provenance. In environments where insider threats, shared SaaS infrastructure or privileged access are concerns, immutable logging becomes critical. A malicious insider can alter logs, and some SaaS platforms offer only limited access or retention. To solve these problems, more security teams are now exploring blockchain-based audit layers, anchoring hashes of critical events (like privilege changes or API calls) into an immutable ledger. This creates a verifiable record that enhances the credibility of traditional logging systems. Their entire public sector uses blockchain to protect the integrity of legal, medical and identity records, which ensures that unauthorized changes are detectable. Breach one identity provider, and you compromise everything downstream. Blockchain enables self-sovereign identity (SSI), where individuals or devices present cryptographically signed credentials without relying on a central source of truth. This aligns well with zero trust architecture, where every identity must be continuously verified and validated. Projects like Sovrin showcase how decentralized identity models can reduce attack surface while maintaining strong verification without overexposing sensitive data. We all remember how the software supply chain attacks like SolarWinds and Log4j vulnerabilities revealed the fragility of our systems, when trust is assumed but not verifiable. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof way to log each stage of the CI/CD pipeline, tracking who committed code, what tools were used to build it and what passed (or failed) review. It can support software artifact tracking, including anchoring hashes of containers, building metadata and committing signatures into a shared ledger. Initiatives like SBOM are evolving quickly to improve software supply chain transparency and security, and blockchain may play a crucial role in anchoring or timestamping these software records in a tamper-resistant format. Like all technologies, blockchain is only useful when applied to the right problems. Most enterprise security use cases align best with private or consortium chains, which strike the right balance between control, performance and privacy. As AI adoption grows, so does the need to track model provenance. Many organizations today don't really know who trained their models, what data was used or how decisions are made. As regulatory pressure builds, this lack of transparency is becoming a risk. Blockchain is emerging as a tool to record this AI lifecycle metadata, creating transparent histories of model versioning and access. Projects like Ocean Protocol are already building frameworks for decentralized data exchange with embedded governance and auditability. In a future where AI regulations will demand explainability and accountability, blockchain may become a key enabler: not of performance, but of proof. I'm not advocating blockchain as a replacement for existing security tools. But I do believe it's time for CISOs and security teams to start evaluating blockchain's potential in specific, high-value areas where today's trust models fall short. As security practitioners, we are constantly asked to secure systems we do not fully control, defend data we do not directly store and establish trust in a digital ecosystem that was never designed with trust in mind. That is why blockchain deserves a serious second look. But I see its potential to enhance what we already have. But we do need to understand where and when this technology can help solve problems that traditional models cannot solve. That is the mindset shift I am advocating for. As security leaders, our responsibility is not to follow hype but to challenge assumptions, evaluate emerging technologies early and prepare our organizations for what is coming. Blockchain may not be the answer to every challenge we face. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.Want to join?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On July 18 the GENIUS Act, with bipartisan support, was signed into law by President Trump. But as we embrace this latest digital innovation, we cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: Cash remains vital to America's economic stability, individual freedom and national security. While digital payments offer convenience, preserving cash is a matter of inclusion, resilience, privacy and choice. Additionally, the collection and sale of consumer data from these digital payments has become a lucrative secondary industry. We've sleepwalked into a system where we not only pay more to use our own money, but in the interest of convenience, we also relinquish a degree of privacy and control over our financial lives. They depend on a vulnerable infrastructure: power grids, internet connectivity, cloud servers and telecommunications. Finally, increasing incidents of state-sponsored cyber-attacks that impact our digital payment infrastructure present a grave concern. Under these scenarios, if retailers no longer accept cash, Americans would be unable to access food, fuel or medicine while digital payment systems are inoperable. Several countries have already acted to avoid this risk. Norway, Belgium and France require retailers to accept cash. Others like the Netherlands, Ireland and Australia are advancing similar protections. But cash is also essential even in normal times. Many more lack reliable broadband to access banking services. Nationwide, over 25 million households are unbanked or underbanked, disproportionately affecting minorities, seniors and low-income communities. Another benefit is that cash helps consumers avoid overspending and debt traps, including the mounting risks associated with “buy now, pay later” plans and high-interest credit products. Also, over 90% of Americans still want the option to use cash. This broad support spans political lines, regions, ages, ethnicities and income levels. And it means that even people who rarely use cash do not want to see “Cash Not Accepted Here” signs at stores, restaurants and, most recently, even at our National Parks. While 12 states and several cities have passed laws to protect cash, the result is a confusing patchwork with unintended consequences including compliance challenges and costs. Protecting the right to use cash isn't about resisting innovation. It's about ensuring freedom, fairness, privacy, preparedness and choice while we also adopt creative digital payment options like stablecoins. Supporting cash is also not ideological — it's practical, principled and something nearly all Americans want.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump will allow retirement accounts to include alternative investments, including cryptocurrency. This could mean employees making elections in their 401(k) could soon see an option for digital currency investments. “What this may do is allow a plan sponsor to include some of these riskier asset classes in the 401(k),” said Barry Glassman, president of Virginia-based Glassman Wealth Services. “In the past, we've seen stocks, we've seen bonds, U.S. foreign, large cap, small cap, and some alternative strategies, but nothing as different as private equity and cryptocurrency,” he said. For those unfamiliar with crypto, Glassman said it should be thought of more as “a collectible” than something like a stock. “I doubt plan sponsors will go deep into ‘meme coins' or anything like that,” Glassman said. For those who may choose to put a portion of their retirement into the digital realm, Glassman said he believes younger investors in their 20s and 30s will lead the charge. “They're used to it, and the idea that their retirement account may build up over time, and may, in fact, be their largest asset at some point,” he said. One benefit for those who want to invest in crypto is there may be tax advantages for including them in their 401(k), because, like stocks, you would only face taxes when you pull your money out. “So, if people invest in Bitcoin and it goes up in value and they sell within their 401(k), they're not taxed on it,” Glassman said. If available down the road to employees, Glassman said he doesn't believe everyone will go in heavy on cryptocurrency in their retirement accounts. Glassman said there is another concern — people not waiting until the right time to invest in crypto. “My concern is with crypto trading near all-time highs, there's a far greater chance that people are interested and if this was available today, in 401(k)s, they would plow into it today, versus maybe a time when it dips,” Glassman said.
