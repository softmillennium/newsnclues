                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. UCLA is the first public university whose federal grants have been targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The Trump administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against private colleges. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grants, the university said this week, after the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division announced it had found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” Last month UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024. The university has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations. “Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” James B. Milliken, UC president, said in a statement Friday. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country's greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.” As part of the lawsuit settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university's Jewish community. It also has created an Office of Campus and Community Safety, instituting new policies to manage protests on campus. Last month Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government's allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restores more than $400 million in research grants. The Trump administration plans to use its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation.</p>

Geoff Duncan, who this week left the GOP and became a Democrat, sits for a national exclusive interview with Fox News Digital. Geoff Duncan says President Donald Trump's social media attacks criticizing his move from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party validates his major switch in political affiliations. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser," Trump wrote early Friday on his Truth Social platform. The president charged that Duncan was "never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn't want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I'm told he became a Democrat. You don't even have a chance!!!" Asked about the criticisms, Duncan told Fox News Digital in an exclusive national interview hours later, "I think he's making my case for me that the Republican Party no longer wants to love their neighbor. Geoff Duncan of Georgia this week switched parties and became a Democrat. "So I wish him the best of luck. I hope he figures out how to run this country better than he is now for the next couple of years. But I'm proud to not be a Republican, especially with him at the tip of the spear," Duncan highlighted. In announcing his decision, Duncan cited several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, including health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and poverty. He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to "love my neighbor" is through public policy. Duncan told Fox News, "I find it easier to love my neighbor as a Democrat It's not a perfect landing spot, but it gives me a better opportunity each day when I wake up to love my neighbor." Duncan, a former health care executive and minor league baseball player, served in Georgia's legislature for four years before running and winning election as lieutenant governor in 2018. After leaving office, Duncan – who was a vocal GOP critic of Trump's repeated efforts to reverse his razor-thin November 2020 election defeat in battleground Georgia to former President Joe Biden – worked towards what he said was "healing and rebuilding a Republican Party that is damaged but not destroyed." Geoff Duncan gives an address at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on Oct. 20, 2021, in Manchester, New Hampshire. "Neither party is hitting it out of the park. You don't have to look any further than the stats to see that Republicans have their issues. Democrats certainly have their issues," Duncan told Fox News. Brian Kemp of Georgia, is term-limited and cannot seek re-election next year. Duncan confirmed to Fox News that he's considering a 2026 run for governor. "My family and I are certainly not ready to make that big of a decision right here, right now. But it is something that we're considering for sure. I mean, my phone has continued to ring for months on end, from Democrats, independents and even some folks on the right that want us to consider this," Duncan said. Asked about his timetable, Duncan said "2026 is coming like a freight train. And certainly, if this is a decision that we go forward with, it'll have to be within, within a few months." And I think there's a gravitational pull in that direction." Nearly half-a-dozen Democrats in Georgia have already launched gubernatorial campaigns, including former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who later worked in the Biden administration. Pointing to the two leading Republicans running for governor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr, Duncan said "I hope we're able to sit back and find a Democratic candidate that can win the governorship and not allow a governor Trump to show up for four years in the state, because that's exactly what's going to happen." "The Republican slate is going to be dominated by whoever Donald Trump endorses, and that person is going to be a sock puppet for Donald Trump," Duncan argued. No Georgian wants the inconsistencies of Donald Trump to manage how their kids are educated, how their streets are kept safe and how government interacts with those that need it the most." Looking ahead to next year's elections, when Georgia will once again be in the national spotlight, Duncan said "Georgia is going to continue to be the political center of the universe, as we watch the Senate race shape up. As we watch this governor's race shape up. I do think Georgia has an opportunity to lead the rest of the country, and I hope we take advantage of that."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal agency U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has seen abysmal cooperation from Chicago police who have refused to turn over 92% of illegal immigrants in law enforcement custody due to its “sanctuary city” policy since President Donald Trump took office, according to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Friday that Chicago's refusal to let police work with ICE has led to virtually all illegal immigrants being released onto the streets after being arrested by local police for offenses in the community. “Unfortunately, Chicago and its leadership has only honored 8% of those.” Sanctuary cities and states have policies that bar local and state police from handing over most illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities, where they will then go through deportation proceedings before an immigration judge. In fact, they're being obstructionists when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off their streets,” Noem said. “That includes Governor [JB] Pritzker, Mayor [Brandon] Johnson, and others who have worked so hard to protect these dangerous criminals. They'd rather be a sanctuary state and continue to put those individuals above American citizens.” Noem pointed to four recent arrests that ICE made in Illinois communities, including a Mexican man who was previously convicted for predatory sexual criminal assault against a victim under 13 years old, a Polish man convicted of attempted murder and aggravated domestic battery, and a Micronesian national who was convicted for driving under the influence three times. The press conference follows the Justice Department's Tuesday move of publishing a list of cities, counties, and states that identify as “sanctuary” zones or places where law enforcement will not turn over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. To date, ICE has arrested and deported roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the Justice Department filing an official misconduct complaint against federal judge James Boasberg on 'America's Newsroom.' Circuit ruled 2-1 Friday that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg cannot move forward with possible contempt proceedings against the Trump administration. The case involves the administration's alleged violation of an emergency court order blocking the administration from using a 1798 law to summarily deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador — the latest in an evolving, high-stakes court clash that has played out for months in various courts. Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, two Trump appointees on the majority-Democrat bench, sided with the Trump administration Friday in blocking Boasberg's contempt motion from moving forward. "The district court here was placed in an enormously difficult position," Katsas said Friday, writing for the majority. "Faced with an emergency situation, it had to digest and rule upon novel and complex issues within a matter of hours. Katsas noted that the appellate court ruling does not center on the lawfulness of Trump's Alien Enemies Act removals in March, when administration officials invoked the 1798 immigration law to send more than 250 Venezuelan nationals to CECOT, the maximum-security prison in El Salvador. "Nor may we decide whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter," he added. "Perhaps it should warrant more careful judicial scrutiny in the future. President Donald Trump speaks before Pam Bondi is sworn in as U.S. Attorney General in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5, 2025 as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, right, looks on. The ruling comes months after Boasberg originally found grounds to move on potential contempt proceedings in the case. It comes as Boasberg has also ordered ongoing status updates on the location and custodial status of the 252 CECOT class migrants, after they were deported last month from El Salvador to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Venezuela. It is unclear how many of those migrants had pending asylum applications in the U.S. or had been granted a "withholding of removal" order blocking their return to their country of origin. The long-awaited ruling comes months after Boasberg ruled that the court had found probable cause to move on criminal contempt proceedings after he issued a late-night temporary restraining order on March 15 blocking the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport certain migrants to El Salvador. Despite the order, hundreds of migrants were deported to the Salvadorian prison, CECOT, in March, where they remained until late last month, when they were sent from the prison in El Salvador to Venezuela, as part of the prisoner exchange. Boasbeg ruled in April that there was "probable cause" to move on criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for failing to return the planes to U.S. soil and said the court had determined that the Trump administration demonstrated a "willful disregard" for his order.The appeals court granted the Trump administration's request for an emergency stay of the ruling months earlier, prompting questions as to why they did not move more quickly on the motion. James Boasberg, incoming chief judge of the U.S. District Court, in Washington, D.C., on Monday, March 13, 2023. The Trump administration for months has sparred with judges who have blocked the president's executive orders from taking force. Boasberg, in particular, has emerged as one of Trump's biggest public foes. Last month, the court attempted to have him removed from overseeing the case and have it reassigned to another case — a long-shot effort that legal experts and former judges suggested is unlikely to go far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House celebrated a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday, bringing the two countries' leaders to Washington for a summit led by President Donald Trump. “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,'” the president boasted on his social media site. “My Administration has been engaged with both sides for quite some time.” Transportation corridors through both countries have been closed due to the conflict since the 1990s, and reopening them could provide better opportunities to circumvent trading with Russia and Iran, Trump administration officials told reporters on a Friday morning call. “The two neighbors have been in conflict for decades, over 35 years, with countless lives lost and generations scarred,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said. The trade corridor could eventually feature oil and gas lines, a rail line, and fiber optic cables, according to the Associated Press. It is planned to be developed by private companies. Still, Trump's team is confident those differences can be worked out, with trade serving as a bridge. “By locking in this path to peace, we are unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade, transit, and energy flows,” Kelly said. New OPM director takes gentler approach to streamlining the federal bureaucracy When asked by a reporter if the agreement furthered the case that Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize, an administration official answered, “I don't think Trump needs outside affirmation,” and referenced a social media post saying it should be called the Trump Peace Prize as allies insist he has done more to advance peace than any Nobel Prize winner. “What this will do for American businesses, and frankly, for energy resources across Europe, will be enormously powerful,” an administration official said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump departs an event to mark National Purple Heart Day in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — A split appeals court panel tossed out a judge's contempt finding against President Donald Trump's administration on Friday in a case over deportations to an El Salvador prison. The decision comes after planes carrying Venezuelan migrants landed at the prison even after U.S District Judge James E. Boasberg said in court they must return to the United States. Boasberg found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of whom were nominated by Trump in his first term in the White House, agreed with the unsigned majority opinion. “The district court's order attempts to control the Executive Branch's conduct of foreign affairs, an area in which a court's power is at its lowest ebb,” Rao wrote. Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, dissented. “The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust,” she wrote. Boasberg had accused Trump administration officials of rushing deportees out of the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act before they could challenge their removal in court and then willfully disregarding his order that planes already in the air should return. Last month, the Justice Department filed an unusual judicial misconduct complaint against Boasberg over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of judges as well as his actions in the deportations case. Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the appeals court ruling, calling it a “MAJOR victory defending President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act” in a social media post and vowing to “continue fighting and WINNING in court.” Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the migrants, said there was “zero ambiguity” in Boasberg's order about the planes. “We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A hunter from the United States has been killed by a buffalo he was tracking during an expedition in South Africa, organizers said this week. Asher Watkins, from Texas, was killed on Sunday “while on a hunting safari with us in South Africa's Limpopo Province,” Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CVS), the safari company that organized the trip, said in a statement sent to CNN. Hans Vermaak, who leads CVS, which says on its website that it's the longest-running hunting safari company in South Africa, said Watkins “was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers.” Vermaak did not say whether the animal was later killed. When the target animal is spotted, hunters trail them on foot before taking a shot. Elephant kills two tourists from the UK and New Zealand in Zambian national park Another man in the area was reported to have been attacked and killed by a buffalo after he fired shots at it. South African authorities have faced criticism and even legal action from wildlife groups who condemn trophy hunting. Trophy hunting is a cruel pastime that turns sentient beings into targets, all for a grotesque photo,” animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said in a Facebook post. Another group, called We Will Not Be Silenced about Hunters, posted on social media: “If Asher Watkins had not come to our country to steal the lives of South African wildlife, he would still be alive and his family and friends would not be heartbroken right now.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen but recent inspections at other Boar's Head sites documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens. Workers gather outside the entrance of a Boar's Head deli meat plant in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025. The entrance to a Boar's Head deli meat plant is seen in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025. An aerial view of the Boar's Head processing plant in Jarratt, Va., on Thursday Aug. 29, 2024. But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens. The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods. USDA inspection findings from Boar's Head factories in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. “If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria. Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety. Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize” for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.” For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604. But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. “Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols” described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement. The entrance to a Boar's Head deli meat plant is seen in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025. The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. They surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified. “You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded. At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of “dried fat and protein from the previous day's production” on equipment, stairs and walls. Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations. The reports point to a “food safety culture problem,” said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University. “Usually that culture has to start at the top.” In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections. “I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,” Kowalcyk said. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel's weekly newsletter. Every year after the Michelin guide announces its selection of starred restaurants in France, journalist Nora Bouazzouni receives a flurry of angry and resentful messages. Since 2017, the French food journalist has reported on toxic restaurant culture in kitchens across France. Through testimonies collected from industry workers since 2020, the book recounts chefs erupting in violent tantrums, burning staff deliberately or throwing pans in their faces if they make a mistake during service. For women, it's being constantly sexualized, be it hands patting their bottoms every day, lewd remarks on their appearance and, in a more serious case, rape in a walk-in cooler by a colleague. “Because it's by dehumanizing people in the kitchen that they can be exploited.” But Bouazzouni's work has helped spark a national reckoning in France and has reached the ears of the country's top lawmakers:  On July 7, a motion to create a commission of inquiry into violence in the kitchen was tabled in the French National Assembly. “Indeed, behind the smooth and idealized images of the profession as presented in various entertainment programs hides a rigid, almost military and brutal hierarchical organization,” the motion reads. At the top of the food chain are the chef de cuisine and sous-chef, followed by the chefs de partie, who are responsible for specific stations (sauces, seafood, cold dishes and so on), junior cooks or commis and trainees. Both Escoffier and the precision of the professional restaurant kitchen that he inspired are revered in French culture. But in many ways, it's this top-down organization that has facilitated toxic kitchen culture, allowing chefs to abuse their staff with impunity, Bouazzouni points out. ‘My hands were throbbing and burning': The Michelin-starred chef fighting toxic kitchen culture In other words, it's a vicious cycle. But how do you undo a century-old French system that is replicated in kitchens around the world? While male-dominated kitchens and high-pressure situations have long been known to contribute to toxic work environments, a 2021 paper published in the Journal of Management Studies offered up one compelling, but simple solution: create more open kitchens. For the study, researchers from Cardiff University concluded that the unique working environment of fine dining kitchens – isolated, closed, hidden spaces, far from the public eye – comes with a sense of freedom from scrutiny, where regular rules don't apply. The kitchen environment effectively became a different moral universe for them,” lead researcher Robin Burrow said in a press release. The cult of celebrity chefdom in France has also contributed to the code of silence that has long muzzled victims. Top chefs are often lionized in long, fawning profiles, documentaries and cooking shows which makes them “untouchable,” Bouazzouni says, adding that the food media bears much responsibility for feeding the “mythology” of French gastronomy. France is no exception to the labor shortage and the “Great Resignation” phenomenon driven by overworked, disgruntled employees and younger generations in Western Anglophone countries. Today, 300,000 positions in France's restaurant and hospitality industry remain to be filled, says Thierry Marx, president of France's Union of Hotel Trades and Industries (UMIH). Marx, who runs 10 high-end restaurants in Japan and France including the Michelin-starred restaurant Onor and the Restaurant Madame Brasserie at the Eiffel Tower, explains that the brigade system is necessary for delegating tasks and maximizing efficiency in stressful, high-pressure environments. “I think we need to add management courses and admit that being competent in a professional technique doesn't necessarily give you managerial know-how,” Marx said. “And it doesn't mean you can behave like an executioner.” Over the last few years, the emergence of both the #metoo movement in cinema and of younger generations who are more likely to push back against abuse has helped advance the discourse on creating safe kitchens in France. Since 2021, a non-profit association Bondir.e, founded by female French chefs, has organized violence prevention seminars in culinary and hospitality schools in a bid to raise awareness early and break the cycle of violence. That's because in France enrollment in vocational schools can start with students as young as 15, an age when teenagers are still highly impressionable and easy to indoctrinate. “You don't know what work is, but you're confronted with violence where strict rules are imposed. You're told that suffering is normal and a necessary part of success. When you're 15 and that's the only example you have to go on, it's easy to accept.” New York City's outdoor dining scene has been on a wild ride The group has also set up a helpline to support victims of violence in the kitchen and offers professional training courses on communication and management in the kitchen. One of the group's founding chefs, Manon Fleury, 34, has since gone on to open her own restaurant, Datil in Paris, which holds a Michelin star. As the boss, Fleury has made efforts to run her ship differently than her predecessors: the restaurant is closed weekends to promote work-life balance. All new staff are given a code of conduct charter that emphasizes mutual respect and a spirit of collaboration, and leadership training is provided for managers. Communication is also a key part of the workplace, with pre- and post-service briefings and monthly one-on-one meetings. “…At Datil, there are men in the dining room and kitchen, but all the management positions are held by women.” “Bad management is a fear reflex,” he said. “Falling on the most fragile, that doesn't work anymore.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has fumed publicly and privately about the central bank's course of monetary policy under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whose term is up in May 2026. That means Trump will have the opportunity to nominate a new Fed chair, who will have to be confirmed by the Senate. The Fed chair also cannot change monetary policy whenever or without consensus. “I think first of all, just the language that that nominee uses can provide some measure of forward guidance with respect to where they see the potential path of interest rates going,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told the Washington Examiner. Given Trump's push for lower rates, it is expected that the new chair will guide the Fed's tone and messaging toward a more dovish monetary policy, but whether the FOMC participants go along with that is an open question. Powell has been quite cautious in the messaging of monetary policy, largely taking a wait-and-see stance with interest rates and emphasizing the avoidance of another wave of inflation that could be brought on by softening policy too soon. And while Powell's term is up in May 2026, the tone shift would likely begin earlier. Trump could even announce the nominee very early, hoping to undermine Powell's influence. “For example, a chair could declare up front the direction he or she wants to go, rather than letting the discussion reveal a committee consensus,” he said over email. “Manhandling the committee process would be a significant departure from Fed decision-making protocol,” Lockhart added. This year, there are eight meetings for the board will decide what to do with interest rates. Trump and some in his administration have been calling for immediate interest rate cuts, which cannot be done without an emergency meeting. Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, pointed out that the new chair would be able to call such emergency meetings. “And I wonder, you know, one test of how much would the new chair be their own person would be if they call an emergency meeting or not or if they wait” for the next scheduled meeting, Young told the Washington Examiner. Aside from monetary policy, the Fed chair might also try to immediately change the central bank by making staffing changes or canceling research that might be controversial. Much of that, though, would still have to go through the regional Fed banks and their presidents rather than through whoever Trump picks to lead the Fed. “And it would be great if we could trim all of that, but that's a conversation aside from who's going to be elected Fed chair,” he said. Young said that, at least for the Fed Board of Governors in Washington, the new Fed chair will have some discretion regarding staffing. But he expressed concerns about politics factoring into those decisions. “But given the administration, the way it treats messengers of bad news, I can't help but think that if a new Fed chair comes in who is pliable to the president's wishes, that any cuts they make would be politically motivated rather than merit motivated,” Young said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced last week that it would shut down after Congress voted to claw back over $500 million of federal funding from the organization. The announcement imperils local PBS and NPR stations around the country that have provided news and educational content for kids for nearly half a century. Amid the stripping of these federal funds, last month, the White House debuted a new educational partner at its launch event for its new Founders Museum exhibit: PragerU, a nonprofit organization that specializes in creating right-leaning educational short videos for adults and children. Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon introduced the partnership, followed by PragerU CEO Marissa Streit. In one, an AI-generated John Adams borrows a catchphrase from conservative pundit Ben Shapiro and tells the viewer, “Facts do not care about our feelings.” Since its founding in 2009, PragerU has become a juggernaut in the conservative educational media space, with their videos reaching millions of followers across social media. Their popular videos elevate narratives that have been sharply criticized as climate denialist, Islamophobic, and “misleading” about slavery. Over the past few years, the organization has partnered with states and superintendents throughout the country to make their educational material widely available to public school children and teachers. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. He's a conservative talk show host who started this whole thing. His partner was the screenwriter named Allen Estrin, who you may have never heard of. Their goal really was both educational and political. They viewed the educational system we have now as being too liberal and too dominated by those ideas. But, at first, they were for college students, and then, in 2021, it started to expand into younger students. Can you give us an example of a PragerU video that seems to be explicitly trying to provide a conservative narrative in response to a preexisting liberal one? The 1619 project really centered slavery in the American story and said that this was an essential to understanding American history. And a lot of conservatives objected to that — to the idea of framing American history in such a negative way. Why not talk about how we got rid of slavery? Why not talk about, you know, freedom and all of the other things that were behind the Revolution and all of that.” So that was the conservative pushback, and what we see in these PragerU videos, in sort of subtle ways, is a bit of a counter to that. There's a video with Christopher Columbus, who is talking to some modern-day kids who are saying, basically, “I heard bad things about you.” And he says, “You have to judge me by the standards that were true at the time.” The upshot of this video and other Prager videos is to — I think it's fair to say — minimize the role of slavery or how much we should focus on it or how upset we should be about it from our past and to try to look on more, shall we say, uplifting ideas from American history. What states are buying into this variety of educational material, if you can call it that? There are about eight states that have some sort of partnership with Prager U, which — keep in mind — that these partnerships do not mandate that schools use this material. That said, about a year ago, when we first reported on this, there were a half dozen states that had partnerships of one sort or another, which included Louisiana, Florida, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Montana, and Arizona. And then South Carolina and Idaho — maybe those are less surprising [partners]— have since formed partnerships with PragerU as well. In Oklahoma, they actually are quite excited about it. Now, Ryan Walters is the very controversial and very conservative education commissioner in Oklahoma, and he actually recently said that he wants to use PragerU material to evaluate teachers who are coming from other blue states— Doesn't mean there's not a federal role, but you know, education is run by states and school boards, so they are really the ones who decide whether this material is available or not. [PragerU] does have quite a few followers on their social media — millions of followers when you add it all up together. So, they do make their material available directly to viewers — anybody who wants it. They think it's an important contribution to our overall culture and education. It's funny to think of the preponderance of PragerU in state curriculum or even just online at the same time as the federal government just defunded PBS, essentially. I don't actually think these two decisions are directly related in any way — at least that I'm aware of — but I do think that they maybe both reflect a larger worldview, which we very much are seeing from this administration: an effort to stamp out what they would call “woke ideology.” They see that in lots of different places, and they're going after it in all sorts of different ways, whether it be pressure on universities to diversify their faculty, [or] whether it be defunding PBS and NPR, which they think are overly liberal. All of these are examples of using the power of the federal government to try and essentially diminish or change institutions that are not ideologically aligned [with them]. And that has happened across schools where you saw bans on conversations about race in classrooms in a bunch of different states. You're not allowed to talk about quote-unquote “divisive topics.” [There is] a lot of concern that topics like slavery were not going to be properly taught anymore, or the civil rights movement, or all sorts of other things that get at the various elements of systemic racism in our country. If you go to most education in this country, most classrooms have teachers who are doing their best to present a fair-minded read of history. The best teachers are challenging their students to look at it from multiple points of view and to understand that there is more than one way to read history. And I think that if it's presented in the context of, “There are [different] ways of viewing American history,” [then] I don't think that material that isn't factual should be taught. But if students are being challenged to consider things from multiple points of view, that's not a bad thing necessarily. Johnnie Moore, executive chair of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is a PR professional without much experience in aid. It's his latest move in an ongoing effort to silence critical news outlets and control the narrative. What the right gets wrong about Superman's origins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? When curing disease is bad for the federal budget. Last summer, the Congressional Budget Office released a report under the unassuming name “Budgetary Effects of Policies That Would Increase Hepatitis C Treatment.” I read it because I am the type of person who is interested in the budgetary effects of policies that would increase hepatitis C treatment. Untreated, it causes serious liver damage over the course of decades, leading to much higher rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer, all of which is very expensive to treat. Like most new drugs, these antivirals are under patent and quite expensive; as of 2020, the cost of an eight-to-twelve week course of the drugs, usually enough to cure an infection, was between $11,500 and $17,000. Yet CBO concludes that the drugs are so effective, and the costs of treating patients with hep C who haven't been cured are so massive, that expanding treatment with these drugs reduces federal spending on hep C treatment and associated complications overall. But over the same decade, the federal government would save $7 billion through reduced need for treatments like liver transplants and ongoing care for chronic cases. Put like that, this starts to sound like one of the rarest discoveries in federal budgeting: a free lunch. That means a policy that is good on its own merits (saving lives and preventing debilitating chronic disease) but also saves the government money. “An increase in hepatitis C treatment could also affect the federal budget in other ways—for example, by leading to improved longevity and lower rates of disability,” the authors note. The latter point is pretty straightforward: If hepatitis C leads to disabilities that make people eligible for disability insurance and subsidized health coverage, then reduced hep C means lower spending on those programs. But (and this is me speculating, so blame me and not the CBO if I'm wrong) that effect is probably swamped by that of “improved longevity.” Simply put: curing hep C means people live longer, which means they spend more years collecting Social Security, Medicare, and other benefits. That could mean that whatever cost savings the actual hep C treatment produces might be wiped out by the fact that the people whose lives are being saved will be cashing retirement checks for longer. I like to call it the Grim Reaper effect. Per the Urban Institute's regular report on government spending for children, the ratio of per capita spending on senior citizens to per capita spending on children is over 5 to 1. Put together, the deficit and the elder-biased composition of federal spending implies something that is equally important and macabre: helping people live longer lives will, all else being equal, be bad for the federal budget. I don't have an easy fix for the situation, but it feels important to at least understand. In 2022, the most recent year for which the Federal Trade Commission released data, Americans bought 173.5 billion cigarettes, or 667 per adult, less than a sixth of the peak, while fewer than 12 percent of American adults now smoke. That meant that in the late 1980s and 1990s, the US started to hit peak cigarette deaths, as adults who came of age during the smoking era started to get lung cancer and emphysema en masse, at numbers that less-addicted subsequent generations wouldn't match. A flurry of economic research at the time tried to make sense of what this meant for the federal budget. A useful 1998 Congressional Budget Office report noted that most research found that, over their lives, smokers spend more in health care costs (including more that goes on the federal tab) than non-smokers, even accounting for their shorter lifespans. But that picture changed once you added in pensions and other non-health spending. Economists John Shoven, Jeffrey Sundberg, and John Bunker in 1989 estimated that the average male smoker saved Social Security $20,000 (about $60,000 today) in benefits not paid. The figure for women, who live longer than men on average but earn less in wages and thus in Social Security, was about half that. “It seems likely that the Federal budget currently benefits from smoking,” two Congressional Research Service researchers concluded in 1994, when the “benefits” of early death to Social Security and Medicare were included. Malcolm Gladwell, in a thoughtful 1990 treatment of the problem in the Washington Post, was catchier: “Not Smoking Could be Hazardous to Pension System.” The CBO used a price elasticity of -0.3, meaning that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices reduces the number sold by 3 percent. But the 2012 report was meant to go a step or two further, according to then-director Doug Elmendorf, who explained the backstory in a recent conversation with me. “The effects of making people healthier are good for those people, obviously, but also perhaps good for the federal budget because the federal government pays for a lot of health care. If you're healthier, you don't need so much health care.” But at the same time, “It was clear that if people were healthier, they would live longer, and that could have budgetary costs. It wasn't obvious offhand what the balance of those effects would be.” The 2012 CBO report tried to put all these effects together: the effect of lower smoking on reducing health-care spending (including government-funded spending) due to a healthier population, the effect on Social Security and other benefit spending from resulting longer lifespans, the effect of lower smoking rates on wages, and tax revenue from those wages. The health effects of a cigarette tax hike reduced federal health spending by over $900 million over a decade, even after accounting for people living longer and claiming more years of Medicare. By contrast, retirement programs only spent $183 million more because people lived longer. Swamping all that was a $2.9 billion increase in tax revenue from a healthier population capable of working and earning more. First, Medicare costs would start to rise, as the cost of a longer-lived population began to swamp the cost savings of that population being healthier overall. (Even people who've been healthy for a long time can run up major health spending at the end of their now longer lives.) The point isn't “cigarette taxes are good” or “cigarette taxes are bad.” The point is that even a policy that saves lives isn't necessarily a slam dunk from the hard-eyed perspective of budget policy. Recent years provided a possibly even darker example. They had several reasons, but a major one was that Covid-19 had killed hundreds of thousands of Medicare patients prematurely. Not only that, but “Medicare beneficiaries whose deaths were identified as related to COVID had costs that were much higher than the average Medicare beneficiary prior to the onset of the pandemic.” Put another way: Covid killed off Medicare's sickest, and most expensive, enrollees. That meant the program was left with an overall healthier population, which by itself lowered medical costs by 2.9 percent in 2021. That represented $219 billion in benefits that no longer needed to be sent, minus $44 billion in lower payroll tax revenues and $25 billion in new benefits to surviving family members. It all reminds one of Logan's Run, in which people are killed off upon hitting age 30 lest they take up too many of society's resources. We need to know what government programs will cost over the near- and long-run. “Members of Congress regularly thought that we were ghoulish for talking about how, if people live longer, there'll be higher benefits for Social Security,” Elmendorf recalls. Obviously, we want to live longer and members of Congress should try to help all Americans live longer. But the fact that increased human longevity on its own worsens the budget picture should lead to some reflection. For one thing, it suggests that sometimes we should embrace policies simply because they're the right thing to do, even if they don't pay for themselves. Recall the hepatitis C treatments that prevent expensive long-term expenses for Medicaid, but might add on new costs by extending the benefits' lifespans. It's possible that, upon taking the latter into account, expanding access to hep C drugs costs the government money on net. Lots of things the government does cost money. That doesn't mean those aren't important functions that it makes sense to put some of our tax dollars toward. Hep C treatment, I think, fits in that list, even if it's not literally free from a budget standpoint. People who live longer, after all, often earn wages in those new years of life, wages that generate income and payroll tax revenues for the federal government. Moreover, people at the end of their careers are earning more money and hence paying more taxes than young people, meaning life extension helping people in their 50s and 60s might be especially good for tax revenue. The problem is that the CBO generally considers “how many workers paying taxes are there” to be an economic effect and only considers it in special “dynamic” scores of legislation, in which the economic consequences of them are taken into account. Dynamic scoring has been a topic of great controversy for decades, going back at least to the Bush II administration, but the rule Congress sets for CBO on when to use dynamic scoring results in CBO applying dynamic scoring very rarely in practice. A middle ground option, though, would be something called “population change” scoring, in which CBO considers the direct effects of a change in the population (through longer lifespans, say, or immigration) on the level of employment and tax revenue, without doing a full, more complicated dynamic score. One is the US's long-standing, bipartisan choice to run massive budget deficits, even during relative boom times. One arithmetic consequence of that choice is that it makes the continued existence of every American a net loss for the country's books. That's not the main reason to avoid large deficits during booms, but it's a somewhat toxic byproduct all the same. The other aspect driving this effect is the choice to invest government resources very heavily in seniors relative to other age groups. This is due in large measure to the US choice to provide universal health care for seniors but not other age groups, and due to our lack of investment in very young children and working-age adults compared to other rich nations. There is no law of nature saying the US has to weigh its priorities that way. As long as we do, the numbers will imply that it's better for the budget for people to die before they get old.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So, when organizers of usually small pro-Palestinian protests held every two weeks since Israel's 2023 invasion of Gaza detected a shift in community attitudes towards the grinding conflict – at home and abroad – they chose the bridge to make a global statement. “We thought that the kind of bold and somewhat audacious idea that we were going to march over Sydney Harbour Bridge would capture the imaginations of everyone out there who was horrified by what we were seeing,” said protest organizer Josh Lees, from the Palestinian Action Group. The group had been emboldened by artists making pro-Palestinian statements at Glastonbury and the victory of Democratic New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who received backing from some of the city's Jewish population despite his criticism of Israel. “We felt it here in Australia, too,” said Lee, adding that the “real uptick in horror and anger” had translated into pledges of support from church groups, unions and members of parliament representing “a much broader section of society” than had previously engaged in the group's protests. Last Sunday, at least 90,000 people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge clutching umbrellas, signs and flags, lashed by cold winds and heavy rain, according to police estimates. That so many people braved the elements for the hastily organized event – conceived just seven days before – suggests that Australians want their government to act, Lees said. “I think the distress of Australians on what we are seeing unfolding in Gaza, the catastrophic humanitarian situation, the deaths of women and children, the withholding of aid, I anticipated that we would see marches of this scale,” she told ABC Radio National. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government is under increasing pressure to join other US allies, the United Kingdom, France and Canada, in pledging formal recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. Albanese and senior ministers have in recent weeks laid the groundwork for a public announcement saying it's a matter of “when, not if.” Recognition by Australia would add to that isolation. Calling for recognition of Palestinian statehood wasn't on the list of four demands submitted by the Palestinian Action Group before Sunday's march. “What we marched for on Sunday, and what we've been protesting for two years, is not recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state that Israel is in the process of wiping out,” said Lees. “What we are demanding is that the Australian government sanction Israel and stop the two-way arms trade with Israel.” The group also called for aid to be allowed into Gaza, an immediate ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal. However, Australian businesses are part of a supply chain that provides parts for F-35s, the type of fighter jet that Israel uses to bomb Gaza. “Australian industry contributes components and parts, but the Australian Government does not have a direct bilateral arrangement with the Government of Israel in relation to the F-35 program,” a defense ministry spokesperson said. “Once they go to the United States, Australia has no control over them,” said Ian Parmeter, Research Scholar and Middle East Expert at the ANU Centre of Arab and Islamic Studies in Canberra. To date, Australia has sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, in a joint move with Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom in June. But whatever Australia does in response is likely nowhere near enough to pressure Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu to end the conflict, which his security cabinet agreed to extend Thursday with the occupation of Gaza City. “Frankly, the one person who has leverage over Netanyahu is (US President Donald) Trump,” said Kenneth Roth, former Human Rights Watch executive director and visiting professor at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs. “He alone could condition the arms sales and military aid on an end to the mass atrocity being committed in Gaza,” Roth told public broadcaster ABC Tuesday. They may be thousands of miles away but the conflict in Gaza has been deeply felt by members of Australia's Muslim and Jewish communities. Reports of both antisemitism and Islamophobia have surged in Australia since October 2023, according to the offices of two separate envoys appointed to address the issue. Last month, antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal presented a sweeping plan to combat what she said was a “wave of hate.” It included education campaigns, police and immigration reforms, and penalties for public institutions, particularly universities, who fail to act Police warnings of a crowd crush didn't eventuate, though there were so many people on the bridge that at one stage officers issued text messages and orders from loudspeakers on helicopters telling protestors to stop and walk back towards the city. “Obviously, we don't politically support Hamas,” said Lees, of the Palestinian Action Group. Australian media reflected the opposing views in vastly different front-page treatments. Alongside an image of a woman in a headscarf, The West Australian's headline read: “Bloody chaos: Baby dolls smeared in fake blood and Aussie flag burned as wild protests become our norm.” The march was noticed from Israel where Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar urged Australians to “wake up!” In a statement, the Australian Iranian Community Alliance also pointed to the photo and other imagery at the march and asked whether participants were “truly part of a movement seeking peace, or inadvertently amplifying forces opposed to it?” “I think we have, by holding this like immense demonstration on Sunday, helped to inspire people around the world to see that the tide is shifting, that masses of people now have seen through all of the kind of pro-Israel lies and propaganda that we've been bombarded with for so long, and are prepared and willing to stand up in bigger numbers than ever before to try to stop this genocide.”</p>
