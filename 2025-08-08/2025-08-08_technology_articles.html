                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ have made sustained investments over the years to lock their content down. New findings presented today at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas, though, indicate that streaming platforms used for things like internal corporate broadcasts and sports livestreams can contain basic design flaws that allow anyone to access a vast swath of content without logging in. Independent researcher Farzan Karimi first realized years ago that misconfigurations in application programming interfaces, or APIs, exposed streaming content to unauthorized access. Years later, he realized that by refining a technique for mapping how APIs retrieve data and interact, he could look for other vulnerable platforms. “You can see a bad pattern emerge in how easily you can circumvent authentication to access streams, but this class of issue was previously dismissed as requiring deep knowledge of a given business to identify.” APIs are services that fetch and return data to whoever requests it. Similarly, if you search for Brad Pitt, a set of APIs will interact to deliver Fight Club along with other movies he's starred in like Troy and Seven. Some of these APIs are designed to require proof of authentication before they will return results, but if a system hasn't been scrutinized deeply, it is common for other APIs to blindly return data without requiring proof of authorization on the assumption that only an authenticated requestor will be in a position to send queries. “Often there are basically four, five, some number of APIs that have all this metadata, and if you know how to trace through them, you can unlock paywalled content for free,” Karimi says. “It's a ‘security through obscurity' model where they would never think that someone would be able to manually connect the dots between these APIs. The automation I'm introducing, though, helps find these authorization flaws quickly at scale.” Karimi emphasizes that top streaming services are largely locked down and either corrected such API misconfigurations long ago or avoided them from the start. But he emphasizes that more utilitarian platforms for corporate streaming and other live events—including always-on cameras in sports arenas and other venues that are meant to only be accessible at certain times—are likely vulnerable and exposing video that is thought to be protected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as “Crescent Dune LLC” — an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. It's unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump's inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump's myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. The sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a steep discount from Nintendo's now-$90 Switch 2 Pro Controller, it's an easy recommendation. What you get instead is one of the best-feeling gamepads with the latest stick, trigger, and button technology that neither Nintendo nor any other major console maker still dares to touch. As much as I may enjoy the modern PS5 DualSense controller, I wonder what could have been if Sony had kept iterating on its older DualShock design. 8BitDo's Pro 3 tells us there was so much more to give. The peripheral maker's Pro series controllers bear a look that somehow combines the DualShock's thumbstick layout with an old-school, flat-bodied SNES gamepad. The 8BitDo Pro 3 has twin arms that fit adult-sized hands better than any old PlayStation controller. And just like the 8BitDo Pro 2 from 2021, you can get the gamepad in a Famicon-style off-white, a calming GameCube purple, or a PlayStation gray, but now it comes with an Ultimate 2-style dock, which doubles as a charging mount and easy 2.4GHz connection port for playing on PC, Mac, or Steam Deck. Any controller that wants to call itself “pro” needs a 2.4GHz connection for lower latency. Really important to note: the Pro 3 doesn't connect with PlayStation or Xbox consoles. The Pro 3's A, B, X, and Y face buttons are all magnetic. The controller comes with a small rubber doohickey tool with a magnet you use to swap your buttons around however you choose. This means you can use the 8BitDo Pro 3 in both Nintendo Switch or Xbox layouts without having to rely purely on muscle memory. The Pro 3 isn't nearly as modular as the $200 Turtle Beach Victrix Pro BFG, which lets you completely reconfigure the controller layout with magnetic modules, but for $70 there are few controllers that are nearly as customizable. Removing the buttons simply requires you to press the suction cup to each switch, then tug them out one at a time. With the new buttons reseated, I wasn't able to pry them out with my fingernails no matter how hard I dug. What's more, you can also remove the thumbstick caps. 8BitDo included two ball caps like you might find on a Japanese-style arcade stick. You need a fair bit of finger strength to release and attach the thumbstick caps, but once they were on, I didn't feel any amount of loose rocking on either the regular or arcade attachments. I would honestly be amazed if anybody used these for anything, let alone fighting games, but they look extra cute jutting out of the controller, as if combining three eras of gaming into one input device. Hall effect uses a magnetic field to detect the stick's orientation. TMR is more of an evolution of Hall effect, though so few controllers are making use of the technology, and promises to be more accurate than Hall effect while consuming much less power. What all this means in practice is the Pro 3 should last longer, both in terms of battery life and long-term use. Sony's PS5 controller normally lasts little more than three to four hours, at best. The 8BitDo Pro 3 powered through a three-hour session of Switch 2 gaming plus several more hours of tests on PC before the battery indicator turned red. The addition of the charging dock means you shouldn't have to worry much about running out of juice, so long as you keep it plugged in and close by. They're more stiff than some early, twig-like Hall effect joysticks. Each snaps back to center without a twinge of accidental input you get on cheaper controllers, which tend to “rubber band” when released. In games on Switch 2 like Donkey Kong Bananza, running around feels effortless and snappy. If you plan to take this controller into Call of Duty multiplayer, just know there are other high-end controllers that may offer more for truly competitive gaming. The D-pad and Hall-effect triggers are similarly exemplary. Every direction on the D-pad feels snappy, and I didn't have any issue with missed inputs depending on where I hit the buttons. You don't even need to remove the dongle from the dock for faster connection speeds, making playing on PC seamless. If you plan to use a 2.4GHz connection on Switch, you can enable the option if you hold the select and LB buttons for a few seconds, but it makes the experience worse since doing so disables motion controls and rumble. The stated distance is 10 meters, and I could still connect to a Switch 2 on the other side of my apartment through several walls and doors. The rest of the buttons have an oomph and a clickiness that may turn off some people who don't want to annoy their partner reading beside them on the couch, but I'm a gamer who prefers to feel every button press. Just like with the Pro 2, it's again disappointing there's no version of the controller compatible with either Xbox or PlayStation. The Rare 40th Anniversary Ultimate 3 is 8BitDo's first Xbox wireless controller, so there may be hope for future console-specific versions. If I had any more options, this controller could easily be my go-to for both Switch 2 and PC. But until 8BitDo finds a way to help it wake the Switch 2, it can't truly be my one and only.

Users who do not want to abandon Windows 10 yet but want to keep their systems secure must pay $30 to enroll in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program from the company, although you can also redeem it for 1,000 Microsoft Reward points, or use it for free if you're backing up your PC settings. However, the ESU program will not offer a lifetime of security updates to your old Windows 10 device. Instead, it just delays the inevitable and gives you a one-year extension until October 13, 2026. Furthermore, you do not get anything else with it, like technical support, so if something goes wrong with your system, you're on your own. Should you choose to enrol in the ESU, you also need your device to be running Windows 10 22H2 with the latest update installed and a Microsoft account. However, this is also likely contentious among users who refuse to install Windows 11 because of its Microsoft account requirement. Redmond has been trying hard to get Windows users to sign up for a Microsoft account, with the company closing loopholes that let you use Windows 11 without signing up for its services. Thankfully, we still have a few available options to create a local Windows 11 account, so you don't have to give the tech giant your information. This also applies to users who do not have eligible hardware, as Windows 11 refuses to support computers that do not have TPM 2.0 — but they at least have another year of security updates, if they choose to create a Microsoft account and pay the $30 fee (or redeem their Microsoft Rewards points).

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has written a letter to the company's employees after the U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to step down, pointing to alleged conflicts of interest linked to his past financial involvement with Chinese chipmakers, reports DigiTimes. According to corporate filings transpired earlier this year, Lip-Bu Tan controls more than 40 companies in China and holds minority stakes in over 600 others through investment firms he owns or manages, with a total value of at least $200 million. Some of these businesses supply or contract with the People's Liberation Army, and in many cases his stakes are co-held with Chinese state-owned enterprises or regional government-backed funds. While questions over Tan's background were already present when he became chief executive in March 2025, earlier this week Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board warning about national security risks that stem from Tan's investments while being the head of Walden International, the venture capital firm he founded in 1987 and still chairs, as well as two Hong Kong-registered entities — Sakarya Limited, which he owns outright, and Seine Limited, which is controlled by Walden. Intel responded by stressing both the company's and Tan's alignment with U.S. strategic interests. Tan said concerns of the Senator and Trump stem from 'misinformation,' which is why Intel is engaging with the administration to clarify the facts, reiterated support for national and economic security, and highlighted progress toward high-volume production of 18A-based processors later this year. He also stressed that the Intel Board fully supports his work. Industry insiders have suggested to DigiTimes a few possible reasons for the timing of Trump's concerns. Some believe Intel's advancement of its 14A and 18A process technologies may not align with the administration's vision for reshoring production. Others note that since Tan took over, job cuts have been deeper than anticipated, which include foundry divisions previously spared from reductions, which could run counter to Trump's stance on domestic employment. Interestingly, President Trump did not call Lip-Bu Tan's Intel leadership a concern for national security. Instead, he cited conflict of interests, which may point both at his financial interests as the chairman of Walden International and other investment entities, and to his backing of multiple Chinese tech firms, including some currently on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List for alleged links to China's government, military, and intelligence services. "The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately," Trump wrote. Thank you for your attention to this problem!"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, Sebastian Stan is set to star in his own ‘Frankenstein' adaptation. Jeff Sneider's latest Insneider Report newsletter claims that Robin plays a significant role in Matt Reeves' The Batman sequel, with its script described as a “big swing” from Reeves and co-writer Mattson Tomlin. During a recent interview with Cultura la dubă (via World of Reel), director Radu Jude (Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World) revealed Sebastian Stan is attached to star in his upcoming adaptation of Frankenstein set on “CIA black sites on Romanian soil.” I had the idea to develop a story that would begin with the reality of CIA black sites on Romanian soil from 20 years ago, and then merge that with another cinematic myth—the Frankenstein monster. So I've started writing the script, but it'll take some time. World of Reel additionally reports that the Hand That Rocks the Cradle remake, starring Maika Monroe and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, will now premiere on Disney+ this October. Bloody-Disgusting reports The Black Phone 2 has been officially rated “R” for “strong violent content, gore, teen drug use, and language.” Jordan Peele teases the “terrifying places” Him is willing to go in a new featurette.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A couple of years ago, a curious, then-16-year-old hacker named Reynaldo Vasquez-Garcia was on his laptop at his Portland-area high school, seeing what computer systems he could connect to via the Wi-Fi—“using the school network as a lab,” as he puts it—when he spotted a handful of mysterious devices with the identifier “IPVideo Corporation.” This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. As he read more, he was intrigued to learn that the Halo 3C goes beyond detecting smoke and vaping—including a distinct feature for discerning THC vaping in particular. Now, after months of reverse engineering and security testing, Vasquez-Garcia and a fellow hacker he's partnered with who goes by the pseudonym “Nyx,” have shown that it's possible to hack one of those Halo 3C gadgets—which they've taken to calling by the nickname “snitch puck”—and take full control of it. At the Defcon hacker conference today, they plan to show that by exploiting just a few relatively simple security vulnerabilities, any hacker on the same network could have hijacked a Halo 3C to turn it into a real-time audio eavesdropping bug, disabled its detection capabilities, created fake alerts for vaping or gunshots, or even played whatever sound or audio they chose out of the device's speaker. Motorola said it has since developed a firmware update to address those security flaws that will automatically push to cloud-connected devices by Friday. Many of the hackers' tricks are on display in a video demo below, which the Vasquez-Garcia and Nyx made ahead of their Defcon presentation: The sensor's capabilities also ignite fears that school administrators or even police could have done the same to eavesdrop on unsuspecting students in a school bathroom. One concern of the researchers is that technology like the Halo 3C could be turned against a student speaking about seeking an abortion, for instance. In marketing material, Motorola says the Halo 3C sensor “is ideal for observing health and safety in privacy-concern areas, such as restrooms and changing facilities, where video and audio recording is not permitted.” (Motorola said that the sensor is programmed with wake words, such as “Help, 911,” and does not record or stream audio.) “From up on the ceiling, you could totally listen to what somebody was saying, and we've made this happen.” Motorola also advertises its Halo sensors for use in public housing—including inside residents' homes—according to marketing material. Motorola pitches the Halo 3C as an “all-in-one intelligent security device” in its marketing material. After Vasquez-Garcia got curious about the Halo 3C two years ago, he and Nyx—an older hacker he met at his local hackerspace—bought one on eBay and took it apart. Their physical teardown revealed the Halo 3C is essentially a Raspberry Pi micro computer with a bunch of sensors attached, including one for temperature or humidity, an accelerometer, and others for air quality that detect different gases. A disassembled Halo 3C smoke and vape detector found to include microphones. That meant they could guess roughly 3,000 passwords a minute, and crack any insufficiently complex password relatively quickly. Once they had administrator access to a Halo 3C, they found they could update its firmware to whatever they chose: Despite its security measures that attempted to require those firmware updates to be encrypted with a certain cryptographic key, that key was in fact included in firmware updates available on the Halo's website. Marketing material available online says the Halo 3C uses a “Dynamic Vape Detection algorithm” which can sense nicotine, THC, and when someone is trying to mask their vaping with aerosols. Halo can also “alert security teams to motion after hours” and includes a “spoken keyword feature.” “The HALO Smart Sensor can detect specific spoken keywords that immediately alert security to a potential issue. Another section says the sensors can be used to detect “bullying or aggression” in schools. “Most people have an expectation that their home isn't bugged, right?” As sensors like the Halo 3C proliferate across schools and even homes, Vasquez-Garcia says the biggest takeaway from his and Nyx's findings ought to be that putting microphones and internet connections into every device in our lives as simple as a smoke detector is a decision that carries real risk. “If people remember one thing from this, it should be: Don't blindly trust every internet of things device just because it claims to be for safety,” Vasquez-Garcia says. The more we accept devices that say 'not recording' at face value, the more we normalize surveillance without really knowing what's inside or bothering to question it.” In your inbox: Five new newsletters by deeply sourced experts WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Their purpose is to get stuff done, so their shape is exclusively focused on getting stuff done. This is where the Hoto SnapBloq toolkit is unique: These tools emphasize style and design to prove that functionality doesn't need to have a rugged, utilitarian, and (typically) unappealing style. Hoto's SnapBloq line is a set of three small power tools meant for tinkerers and hobbyists. The entire kit features sleek, modern shapes that have become widespread in the world of tech today, bereft of fasteners, screws, and seams that reveal their manufactured and assembled nature. All three tools have an anodized aluminum outer housing with a plastic back plate. They feel fairly durable, being able to withstand basic drops without any damage, and weigh around 100 grams each. The grip areas have straight knurling to improve grip, and the buttons are a flexible rubberized panel with small switches underneath. There are no seams surrounding the buttons where dust or particles can become embedded, useful for tools that will likely create small, airborne particles. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. For casual tinkerers, this tool makes quick work of most small screws on and inside electronics. However, it's not meant for much more than that—with just 0.5 newton-meter of torque, this device struggled to loosen even somewhat-tight screws in my tests, and I couldn't get them particularly tight, either. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The drill was able to easily put holes in plastic, drywall, and even some brittle metals if you weren't as concerned about cleanliness. The circular shape meant the drill would often be slightly more difficult to precisely aim than a standard hand drill, but this trade-off was worth the more compact size and maneuverability. I used the drill to create guide holes for wall-mounted decorations, modify electronics, and customize model kits. During all of this, I never found the drill's power or speed to be lacking, and I was impressed by how quickly it operated at the maximum speed. It quickly ran out of power and had trouble maintaining a consistent speed during extended use. As long as I was conscious about letting the tool cool down, it worked great for basic grinding, cutting, and even polishing. Cuts were clean, edges were smooth, and I was even able to polish some metal parts down to a consistent finish. This isn't a huge issue in theory, since the speed can be intuited. The largest benefit this kit has over traditional tools is convenience. With an impressively small design and modular system of magnetized cases, these tools can easily be transported, maneuvered, and organized for use around the house or as a portable hobby station. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The cases themselves have an impressive selection of different accessories. The drill includes bits from 0.6 to 2.0 mm, along with a tool for alignment when drilling small objects, although I didn't find myself using it often. The rotary tool includes 30 bits of various shapes for grinding, polishing, cutting, and drilling, along with a block of polishing compound. While the compound worked for some metals, most users will be better off sourcing their own compound for their specific needs. The magnetized SnapBloq storage cases are functional but feel a bit contrived. While not terrible for a home hobbyist, this isn't ideal for on-the-go use or in a compact space. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. USB-C charging is a major boon to these devices. All three tools can be charged using standard power delivery cables, and the exposed USB-C ports on the back mean they can be charged during use without cables getting in the way, or when sitting in their storage cases. I only ran into battery life issues with the rotary tool. I left the tool plugged in for any longer polishing or cutting sessions, which was more convenient but made the tool somewhat less maneuverable. All three of these tools use brushless motors inside. These are entirely contact-free electromagnetic motors that can theoretically operate for over 10,000 hours of use. While each of these tools emits a small whining noise during use, I never found this particularly bothersome. All three are quieter than everyday tools that use brushed motors, and they feel incredibly smooth during operation; there's hardly any physical sensation of rumbling or grinding, even when operating at full power. More than that, they exist in an interesting cultural space. They are meant to take things apart; however, they share many design elements with technology that is actively meant to stay together. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The sleek designs of modern technology are impressive from a visual standpoint, but also represent a slew of anti-consumer design decisions where devices have to be taken apart in destructive and potentially irreversible ways: Adhesives, plastic clips, friction-fit components, and hidden fasteners all help to create a sense of cohesion, but hide the fact that products are assembled and manufactured. As a result, they hide the ability to disassemble them, and these devices become more opaque and disposable to consumers. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a reasonable way to take the Hoto tools apart for repairs. There are no exposed screws or fasteners, so I can only imagine that disassembly would require a lot of patience. The brushless motors inside are far less likely to fail compared to brushed motors, though, so maintenance is less of a concern overall. There is a central irony to the existence of these Hoto products. They use the imagery and aesthetics of non-repairable technology to make the idea of repairing and modifying seem more approachable or stylish. And while there may be some conceptual qualms to be had, I still think anything that might get people to repair and fix their existing devices is cool and compelling. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All three tools are entirely rounded, with no flat side or sculpted grip to orient them in your hands. While this isn't a huge issue, I found I couldn't always get the perfect grip, and that the tools would sometimes slip or twist when in use. However, this typically only happened when one of the tools was operating outside of its intended parameters, like over-tightening a screw or drilling into a hard metal surface. Because of the rounded shape, these tools like to roll when placed on inclined surfaces. Something I always say about other devices I use (typically cameras and keyboards, but it extends to everything) is that the best device for you isn't the theoretical “best” on paper; it's the one you like using. Hoto's SnapBloq isn't the “best,” but they fall into this category for me. The buttons are placed well with solid tactile feedback. The design is modern, stylish, and looks cool. They're far from perfect, and won't be an upgrade for a DIYer who already has a set of tools they enjoy. But they're a solid, functional, and practical set of power tools that are enjoyable to use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has always thrived on bold claims and the contradictions that follow. On July 23, he joined Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, the standard ritual in which executives talk up their company's performance and future. That day, he painted a glowing picture of the future of Dojo, Tesla's ultra-ambitious, custom-built supercomputer designed to train the neural networks for Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus. His tone and detail suggested Dojo was one of Tesla's most important projects, an active, thriving pillar of the company's identity as an AI leader. Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped a bombshell: citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet reported that Tesla had terminated its Dojo project entirely. In the space of weeks, Tesla appears to have gone from publicly championing Dojo's “spectacular” potential to quietly dismantling the team. If Bloomberg's reporting is confirmed, it would mark the end of a program Musk once pitched as central to Tesla's technological edge. It was widely seen as Tesla's attempt to reduce reliance on Nvidia's GPUs by building its own custom chips and training hardware. It was an expensive and technically risky strategy in a market dominated by chip giants. Losing talent to DensityAI, including key leaders, suggests mounting internal headwinds long before Bloomberg's scoop. On the July call, Musk fielded a question about whether his AI startup, xAI, might use Dojo. We expect Dojo 2 to be operating at scale within the next year. He went on: “And then AI Five, which is also really spectacular. Musk even looked further ahead, discussing an “intuitive” convergence between Dojo 3 and chips used in Tesla's cars and Optimus robots: “Thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI six in the first chip, it seems intuitively that we want to try to find convergence there. That seems sort of intuitively the way to go.” The Tesla community on X (formerly Twitter) lit up with debate. “As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years now, I'm well no stranger to his missed ambitious deadlines,” one user wrote. “But I think his commentary on FSD, Optimus, and Dojo over the past couple of years goes beyond that. Another replied: “As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years, taking a Bloomberg article about Tesla as entirely correct from day 1 is a bold choice. I suspect a specific part of Dojo has been canceled.” As somebody who's been invested in TSLA for over 10 years taking a Bloomberg article about Tesla as entirely correct on day 1 is a bold choice. I suspect a specific part of Dojo has been cancelled In October 2015, Musk declared: “Tesla will have a car that can do full autonomy in about three years.” Three months later, he repeated: “We're going to end up with complete autonomy,” adding: “And I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.” Nearly a decade later, Tesla cars still aren't fully autonomous. Musk has wielded it to set aggressive deadlines for robotaxis, Boring Company tunnels, and humanoid robots, often without delivering on time or at scale. If Dojo has indeed been scrapped just weeks after being presented as a near-future reality, the fallout could be significant. Investors may question whether Musk knowingly misled them in July, or whether a sudden, serious issue forced him to abandon what he once described as a cornerstone of Tesla's AI strategy. Either way, if confirmed, the shutdown would deal another blow to Musk's credibility, and deepen the question of where his vision ends and reality begins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Set to increase reliance on AMD and Nvidia hardware for now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Tesla's custom Dojo wafer-level processor has always been an ambitious and promising hardware project, but despite early success with the company's bespoke chip, Musk has still used Nvidia GPUs in addition to Dojo. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, has recently ordered the Dojo effort to be entirely wound down, according to the report. In fact, about 20 members of the team have left to join DensityAI, a startup created by former Tesla executives, in recent weeks, according to Bloomberg. Those who remain will be moved to other internal data centers and computing roles within Tesla, if the information is accurate. The company reportedly plans to deepen its partnerships with major suppliers of AI processors for data centers: Nvidia will keep supplying GPUs to Tesla, but Tesla will increase reliance on AMD. Tesla officially started its Dojo supercomputer project in 2021 and attempted to build wafer-scale processors for AI training. The company planned to use its own cluster built on its own proprietary hardware to train AI powering the full self-driving (FSD) capability of its cars and the Optimus humanoid robot. However, Tesla never completely relied on Dojo supercomputers and used third-party hardware as well. "We are pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo," Musk said at an earnings call in 2023. "But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. However, Dojo had its own limitations when it came to memory capacity, and servers based on a wafer-scale processor were hard to produce as they used a lot of proprietary components. In fact, the roll-out of Dojo 2 hardware has been pretty slow, and the company expected to have a cluster equivalent to 100,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs up and running in 2026. Essentially, this meant that Tesla would run a cluster equivalent to xAI's Colossus in Fall 2024, but two years later. […] That sort of seems like intuitively the sensible way to go."

If Tesla follows Musk's direction, it will continue developing its own hardware for both edge devices and data centers, this time based on a converged architecture that avoids relying on exotic design decisions and proprietary components.

It's an open-access site, people are going to write things you disagree with, and there isn't going to be a moderation rule saying, for instance, that only anti-carceral comments are allowed on the site.I spend a weird amount of time watching for specific patterns of nasty shit on HN (use the search bar to see if I've missed a race/IQ in the last year) and my experience has been the moderators are as repulsed by toxicity as I am, and they're quick to act.You're not the first of us to express concerns that the specific moderation principles HN uses are too accommodating to toxic edgelordism (another long-timer once noted that they appear to function as a kind of grooming academy for hateful rhetoric, allowing in almost any sentiment expressed coolly and without vitriol). A good exercise: if you think comment moderation is failing because the rules aren't right, propose the next guideline that would fix it.I've been doing that for years, and some of my guideline proposals have made it in (can't see everyone else's comment scores: you're welcome).
