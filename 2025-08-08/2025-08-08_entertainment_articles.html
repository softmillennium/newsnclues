                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Kelly Clarkson and her kids mourn the passing of her ex-husband and their dad, Brandon Blackstock, others mourning his death on August 7, 2025, include country superstar Reba McEntire. “The Voice” coach was married to Brandon's dad, talent manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015, and remained close with him and Clarkson, even through their own divorce, which Clarkson filed for in 2020. Brandon was Narvel's son from a previous marriage. In 2021, McEntire told Entertainment Tonight, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. When McEntire performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, it was a family affair. Her and Narvel's son Shelby Blackstock — Brandon's half-brother — shared photos from the event that showed Brandon attended the concert and was backstage with McEntire, along with three of his four kids. We had a blast in Houston watching @rissablackstock experience her first rodeo & being able to spend cherished time with family! Brandon had two kids with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth — Savannah, 22, and Seth, 18. He shared two kids with Clarkson — River Rose, 11, and Remington, 9. At the time of publication, McEntire had not spoken publicly about Brandon's passing. McEntire didn't take sides as Clarkson and Blackstock were going through their oftentimes contentious divorce, remaining connected to and supporting both of them. In 2021, she told Extra, “You know, I love them both. Before McEntire became a coach on “The Voice,” she was a Mega Mentor on the show in 2023, and got to work with Clarkson there. “Now, she's just matured into this wonderful woman that I am just so proud of and I love her with all my heart,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“American Idol” alum Kelly Clarkson is going through a tough time. Blackstock passed away at age 48 in August 2025 following a private, 3-year-long battle with cancer. Just hours before his passing, Kelly Clarkson publicly revealed that her ex-husband was “ill.” Before his relationship with Kelly, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth. While not much is known about her personal life, Ashworth reportedly worked as a secretary during her marriage to Blackstock. The former couple welcomed two children: Savannah and Seth. Blackstock became a father for the first time when he welcomed daughter Savannah with Ashworth. The two seemed to share a close bond. In December 2018, Savannah posted an Instagram photo from a father-daughter ski trip. Savannah, born in June 2002, is now a mother herself, giving birth to her daughter Lake Lee in January 2022, making Ashworth and Blackstock grandparents. One noteworthy fact is that Kelly Clarkson shares a warm bond with Savannah as she follows her on Instagram. She added, “I adore Kelly and Brandon as a couple, so if I say anything it's going to be positive.” Melissa has largely stayed out of the public eye over the years, though she later married a man named Chris White. Details about their life together remain unknown as Ashworth has continued to maintain her privacy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, South Park aired its second episode of the second Trump presidency, largely taking aim at secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem. Throughout the episode, the Noem character shoots every dog she comes across, sex trafficks Dora The Explorer, raids “brown people” from heaven, and is constantly getting re-made-up and getting botox shots as her face melts and at one point tries to flee from her. It's this last element that Noem has specifically condemned. Calling into Glenn Beck's radio show on Thursday (via The Daily Beast), Noem says that she “didn't get to see” the episode because she “was going over budget numbers and stuff.” Noem continues, “It never ends, but it's so lazy to constantly make fun of women for how they look. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can't, they just pick something petty like that.” In fairness, Noem says she didn't see the episode, and it inarguably does make fun of her appearance. But it also absolutely criticizes her job, and homeland security at large.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Line has enlisted screenwriters Ben Zazove and Evan Turner to pen a Space Invaders movie, inspired by the classic Taito arcade game, Deadline has learned. No word yet on specifics, as to the story they're spinning here. Weed Road Pictures' Akiva Goldsman will produce alongside Safehouse Pictures partners Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell, with Greg Lessans & Rachel Wizenberg overseeing for Weed Road, and Matt Schwartz overseeing for Safehouse Pictures. One of history's most iconic arcade games, and one of the pioneering titles in the shoot 'em up gaming genre, Space Invaders tasks players with defending Earth from an alien invasion, shooting down waves of invaders moving across the screen before they reach the ground. Tomohiro Nishikado developed the title, released by Taito in 1978. Writers Zazove and Turner are behind Officer Exchange, an action-comedy in development at Amazon MGM Studios, with The Safran Company producing and John Cena attached to star. Their previous film, The Out-Laws — an action comedy starring Adam Devine, Pierce Brosnan, and Ellen Barkin — debuted at #1 on Netflix. Also known for his work on Sherlock Gnomes, Zazove is repped by Verve, Kaplan/Perrone and attorneys Jeff Frankel and Farhad Amid. Turner is likewise repped by Verve and Kaplan/Perrone but has Dave Feldman as his attorney. Known for films like Without Remorse, Hancock, I Am Legend and Constantine, Weed Road recently announced the M3GAN franchise's Gerard Johnstone as the director for their live-action Monster High movie, based on the Mattel dolls. They're in post alongside Walden Media on The Billion Dollar Spy, a Cold War thriller starring Russell Crowe, and count a Constantine sequel among their other upcoming projects. Coming off the Jack Quaid actioner Novocaine, centered on a man incapable of feeling physical pain, Safehouse Pictures has most recently announced projects like a feature adaptation of the Jeremy Logan novel series at Amazon MGM Studios, the Paramount comedy Guys with No Friends, and the 20 actioner Test Drive based on a spec from Matt Venne.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Following a busy 2025 that included an Emmy nominated performance and a Marvel Studios movie, Pedro Pascal isn't looking to slow down as he is in talks to star in the Searchlight Pictures pic Behemoth! Searchlight recently came on to the project which Gilroy will write and direct. While the deal is not closed, sources say Pascal wants to do it and things are headed in the right direction. Plot details are vague at this time but Gilroy has said in interviews that the film revolves around a cellist. Gilroy would also produce with Sanne Wohlenberg. The film is set to begin principal photography this fall in Los Angeles, with release plans to be announced at a later date. All three projects premiered to widespread critical acclaim, with Materialists being A24's third highest grossing opening ever, and Fantastic Four: First Steps being Marvel's highest grossing opening of 2025. Fantastic Four kicked off the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Pascal recently wrapped production on the next Avengers movie, Avengers: Doomsday, which will premiere in 2026. On the TV side, Pascal most recently earned a Lead Actor Emmy nomination for his performance in season two of HBO's The Last of Us. Pascal garnered Lead Actor Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance in season 1. Other recent credits include Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, Freaky Tales and  Pedro Almodovar's A Strange Way Of Life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the course of his half-century career, Eddie Murphy has hung out with or met just about every famous person there is and shared some truly epic stories about Richard Pryor, Michael Jackson, Prince and Frank Sinatra, among others. But one A-list tale he's kept hidden until now is a special moment he shared with Beyoncé when they appeared together in the 2006 movie adaptation of beloved Broadway musical Dreamgirls. “I did Dreamgirls right when I was getting divorced,” Murphy told Complex's 360 With Speedy podcast this week about the period in 2005 when he was splitting with ex-wife Nicole Murphy after a dozen years together. 60th Anniversary of Beatles Show at Shea Stadium to Be Celebrated by New York Mets Damon Albarn, PinkPantheress & More Join Brian Eno's Together for Palestinian Relief Concert “I was kind of like on automatic pilot, and I don't remember a lot of making the movie,” he said of the Dec. 2006 release that featured Jamie Foxx playing a Berry Gordy Jr.-esque label boss, as well as Beyoncé as Deena Jones, a character inspired by Diana Ross. Murphy earned his first, and only, Oscar nomination to date for best supporting actor for his role as James Brown-like soul-stirrer James “Thunder” Early. He said that neither Beyoncé nor their co-star Jennifer Hudson — who won a best supporting actress Oscar in her debut film role as Effie White — know about a unique, sweet moment he observed  on set one day.

I came out, the world was very loud about me and my personal business. Still, to this day, there could have been zero drama, and you would never know, 'cause none of us have said one thing. It's all claims and things that have happened out of our control.” He says he was inspired to write the track following a bizarre fan encounter with a tourist in New York, who approached him and asked, “How did you fumble Megan Fox?” Treasury Secretary Admits Trump's Tariffs Are Paid by Americans Steven Tyler Accuser Blasts His Latest Bid to Dismiss Child Sex Lawsuit With Trial Looming “There is so much complexity in simplicity … every one of these, I got a story,” he said.

Gracie Abrams performed a song that wasn't hers at her Los Angeles concert Thursday night (Aug. 7), but her fans still knew every word all too well. During the B-stage portion of her Secret of Us Tour set at the Kia Forum, the singer-songwriter surprised her audience by covering Taylor Swift‘s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” in full — but not before giving her close friend and former tourmate a sweet shout-out. “I was talking to her earlier today,” Abrams said of the pop superstar. “It just is not lost on me that the reason that a lot of us know each other is because I got to meet many of you through doing the Eras Tour with Taylor,” she continued. 1 hit with the audience scream-singing each word of Swift's nostalgic verses, fiery bridge and haunting outro from start to finish. “Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much/ But maybe this thing was a masterpiece, 'til you tore it all up,” Abrams sang over the noise of the crowd, accompanying herself on a small red keyboard in the center of the arena. “It's like, I really don't have it that bad in terms of invasion of privacy, you know what I mean?” she said at the time. Abrams is now closing in on the end of her own headlining tour, with the star having just five more dates on her show calendar before the Secret of Us trek concludes Aug. 27 in Mexico City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two August pics are expected to end up in a close race for No. Horror could use a win after such box office bombs as Blumhouse and Atomic Monsters' M3GAN 2.0, which opened to only $10 million in June on its way to topping at $40 million worldwide, compared to $180 million for the first film. Josh Brolin and Julia Garner Clash in 'Weapons' But Their Bond Off-Screen Was "Cellular, Sibling Sh**" New Line is also home of Final Destination: Bloodlines, which earned $5.5 million in previews earlier this summer on its way to a domestic debut of $51.5 million (there's a lot more male-skewing product in the marketplace presently). Weapons, an original story, stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child, and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Aden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which will be playing on coveted Imax Screens (Imax is also rereleasing summer hit 51: The Movie on select screens this weekend before offering more showings the following week.) Freakier Friday will play in hundreds of other premium large format screens, including Dolby Cinema auditoriums. The family comedy — reuniting Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis 23 years after Freaky Friday opened — earned $3.1 million previews, including special sneaks on Wednesday. That lines up with what prerelease tracking shows for Freakier Friday. Already boasting a 94 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, It's the first event pic in weeks to target females, and should also benefit from the nostalgia factor. This time out, in a multigenerational twist, they find themselves swapping places, respectively, with the daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter of Tess. Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Vanessa Bayer, and Mark Harmon also star. Film studios execs across Hollywood lament how comedies have become an endangered species in the streaming age. Last weekend, Paramount's Naked Gun reboot bucked this trend in opening to nearly $17 million domestically. While that film is considered more of a straight-up comedy, versus a family comedy such as Freakier Friday, it will be good news for all if they both work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Aug. 4, fans of the HBO Max series Love Life were given a gift. For creator Sam Boyd, having Love Life return to streaming has been a welcome change. For a while it was on HBO Max, then Amazon Video to rent, then, for a time, on Tubi, with ads. He's glad people who loved the show will have another chance to watch it again, but the experience has touched on why he started — and still does — collect physical copies of his favorite shows and movies. “I used to get DVD box sets of shows that I loved that had only been on [for] a season or two,” he tells Rolling Stone. There was just something that felt fun and special. It's no surprise then, that at the same time Boyd is hopeful that a new batch of Love Life-heads are just a Netflix scroll away, television film collector culture is having a resurgence online. When streaming services first took off in the mid-2000s, they promised consumers a new world, where movie night didn't have to start with a drive to Blockbuster and pricy cable packages could be dropped without sacrificing your favorite shows. These days, consumers aren't entirely happy with the trade off. Licensing deals mean the film that was on Netflix for two years can leave and take a spin on a platform you don't pay for, older films can have controversial scenes edited out, or an original series can get cancelled and disappear entirely. For many of these series, like Love Life, box sets or DVDs have never been available to purchase, meaning streaming is the only way to see it. Physical media, on the other hand, doesn't have this issue. While streamers aren't necessarily losing customers, people who collect Blu-rays, DVDs, and VHS tapes tell Rolling Stone their trending culture isn't nostalgia bait. Gina Luzi, 33, first started her physical media collection without even realizing it. She grew up going to Blockbuster with her father for movie nights, and has fond memories of strolling the aisles of Barnes & Noble for everything from books to CDs. But in 2018, she began to take collecting far more seriously. Her focus: cheesy 1980s Italian horror and murder mystery films — also known as “giallos” — many of which aren't available on streaming platforms. “If I can find something that only one place has ever put out, or a movie that has just been restored for the first time in 30 years, that's so exciting for me,” Luzi tells Rolling Stone. “Living in L.A., we're so spoiled when it comes to physical media. “I got tired of paying for new streaming services,” Graves, 26, says. “I can't justify having more than two or three. Graves has always had a stack of DVDs in her home, but her collection changed when she found an old fashioned tube TV with a built-in VCR. Now, she seeks out VHS tapes of her most watched films. ‘Thursday Murder Club' Trailer Is ‘Only Murders' in the Retirement Home “I think the giant boom of physical media collecting is reflective of what's going on with the economy and also how people feel about media in general. Kemp says that there's a real knowledge gap for newer generations whose growth has been defined by leaping advancements in tech. On TikTok, Kemp shares her tips and tricks for those who are interested in both collecting old media and finding ways to archive their favorite digital entertainment — like YouTube videos or unreleased songs. There's a lot of curiosity about things some older generations take for granted,” she says. The obsession over obtaining physical copies of films has been driven in part by popular digital properties like Letterboxd and Criterion. Letterboxd is a film-logging app where users can mark what movies they've seen, review them, and discover new ones they might like. Their TikTok interview series “Four Favorites,” where celebrities are asked to name four favorite films on the spot, often goes viral. In a similar viral fashion, film company Criterion Collection has achieved massive success with their series “The Criterion Closet,” which invites stars, directors, and writers to tour a closet stacked to the ceiling with DVDs and pick out their favorite films. Josue Arellano, 27, says that a lot of his physical media collection is made up of Criterion titles, because the company often re-releases or restores films he's been desperate to see but hasn't been able to find. When the Criterion Van had an event in June, he and a friend got there around 3:30 a.m. “Even now, in the age of streaming, it's so important to be able to own your media, because you don't know what these companies can decide one day,” Arellano says. “Even editing is a big thing, how streamers will edit movies to be more child friendly. What Arrelano is referring to is just one of several situations where digital copies of films have been adjusted to fit modern sensibilities. Streaming companies have called these changes important to remove inappropriate or hurtful content, but many collectors see the changes as essentially creating more lost media — and forcing audiences to lose out on important context. “There's this false notion that everything is online and you can access anything. And it's just simply not true,” Kemp tells Rolling Stone. Treasury Secretary Admits Trump's Tariffs Are Paid by Americans Steven Tyler Accuser Blasts His Latest Bid to Dismiss Child Sex Lawsuit With Trial Looming (The 2022 film Batgirl was filmed and edited but never streamed, instead reportedly scrapped as a tax write off.) It's a fate that Love Life escaped, which is why Boyd really likes the idea that physical media collection is a trend once again. So, it makes sense that those kids still exist.

Night Shyamalan's “Old.” The breakout “The White Lotus” actor is lamenting how difficult it is for rising, younger stars to land roles in Hollywood due to older, more established actors extending their careers by way of plastic surgery; the augmentations allow for actors to play characters who were meant to be years younger than the stars' themselves. Nivola warns that the cycle is icing out new talent, and might leave a deficit in Hollywood after certain aging actors pass away. “The old movie stars are getting plastic surgery, and they're looking younger and they're staying young,” Nivola told Variety during a recent interview. With all due respect to those people, one day they won't be here any more, literally, and they will have to create new stars…” Related Stories Documentarian Amy Berg Obsessed Over Jeff Buckley for Decades — Then She Finally Got to Make a Film About Him ‘Weapons' Is the Original Summer Surprise We've Been Waiting for Nivola's role in “White Noise” led to his mother Emily Mortimer co-writing Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” which in part speaks to this trend: The much-anticipated ensemble film centers on an aging actor (George Clooney) grappling with his legacy. “He's one of a very few examples I could come up with. But it's a different kind of movie star; he's not huge and jacked.” Hopefully the next one will be something a little different.” Nivola isn't the only star speaking out against plastic surgery: Jamie Lee Curtis recently told The Guardian that plastic surgery has “wiped out a generation or two of natural human [appearance].” Curtis continued, “The concept that you can alter the way you look through chemicals, surgical procedures, fillers — there's a disfigurement of generations of predominantly women who are altering their appearances. The minute I lay a filter on and you see the before and after, it's hard not to go: ‘Oh, well that looks better.' And there are too many examples – I will not name them – but very recently we have had a big onslaught through media, many of those people.

TIFF's ode to auteur-driven experimental cinema includes titles from Kahlil Joseph, Ben Rivers, Blake Williams, Kamal Aljafari and Basma al-Sharif.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	The Toronto Film Festival has unveiled its Wavelengths program for artist-driven experimental films that includes the latest work from directors Lav Diaz, Kahlil Joseph and Kamal Aljafari.


	The sidebar has seven features in all, including North American premieres for Diaz's Magellan, where Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal plays the titular Portuguese explorer in the epic historical drama that bowed in Cannes; Ben Rivers' Mare's Nest, about a young girl traveling through a dystopian world without adults; Alexandre Koberidze's Dry Leaf, where a father searchs for his missing daughter in Georgia in a film shot on an antiquated Sony Ericsson phone; director Nicolás Pereda's political thriller Copper; and The Seasons, the solo directorial feature debut for Maureen Fazendeiro.

	There's a world premiere for Rhayne Vermette's Levers, a drama about humanity's uneasy relationship with the natural world; and a Canadian premiere for Kahlil Joseph's Sundance title BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions, a feature debut and a multimedia tribute to black experimental thinkers.


	The Wavelengths program will also pair two movies by Palestinian directors: a North American bow for Kamal Aljafari's With Hasan in Gaza, the Locarno competition opener and a journey round pre-war Gaza in 2001, with an international premiere for Basma al-Sharif's It's So Beautiful Here.


	The Wavelengths will also present short films, including world premieres for shorts by Viktoria Schmid, Björn Kämmerer, Blake Williams, Friedl vom Gröller, Fredj Moussa, Kaiwen Ren and Eri Saito. There's also an international premiere for another film by Basma al-Sharif, Morgenkreis. 

	











	On Friday, TIFF also announced the lineup for its Classics sidebar of film restorations, to include a 50th anniversary screening of Steven Spielberg‘s Jaws in 35mm; and 4K restorations of Manoel de Oliveira's Aniki-Bobo (1942); Bahram Beyzaie's Bashu, the Little Stranger (1986); Satyajit Ray's Days and Nights in the Forest (1970); Michael Almereyda's Nadja (1994); Ramesh Sippy's Sholay (1975); and T'ang Shushuen's The Arch (1968).


	The 50th edition of the Toronto Film Festival is set to run from Sept. 4 to 14.

IndieWire can announce that Grasshopper Film and Arbelos will be distributing “Nadja” in 4K. Grasshopper Film and Arbelos acquired the international distribution rights for the new version and will release it in North American theaters in late 2025, followed by a release on streaming platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The initial lineup has been announced for the Together for Palestine benefit concert at London's Wembley Arena on September 17. Executive produced by Brian Eno, who announced it last week, the concert will feature performances from Damon Albarn, Jamie xx, King Krule, Sampha, PinkPantheress, James Blake, Hot Chip, Obongjayar, and more. The shows will include collaborations and performances of new material created for the event, according to a press release. Completing the initial wave of artists are Greentea Peng, Mabel, Bastille, Abnan Joubran, Paloma Faith, Furaj Suleiman, Nai Barghouti, and Rachel Chinouriri. The announcement also lists “appearances,” described as “one-off contributions,” from PinkPantheress, Rina Sawayama, Riz Ahmed, and more to be announced. The entire ticket listed ticket price is being donated to Palestinian aid groups via Choose Love, a UK charity supporting local humanitarians in conflict zones. Es Devlin, who is leading production design, said in the press release, “Palestinian painters are producing some of the most powerful, beautiful and resonant works I have witnessed. I feel honoured to collaborate with Malak Mattar and a group of seminal Palestinian visual artists on a stage that will express the rich beauty of Palestinian culture.” Artists have always helped societies to point out injustice and imagine better futures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not a big mystery why Will Smith's latest Netflix movie, Fast And Loose, has had some trouble getting off the ground over the last three years. This turned out to be a pretty lucky decision for Leitch, since he made the choice just a week ahead of the 94th Academy Awards, during which Smith hopped up on stage and slapped the project straight into Netflix's “Let's sleep on this for a minute” pile. It took two years—and the success of Bad Boys: Ride Or Die—to get the streamer feeling enthusiastic again, now with Smith's original Bad Boys director Michael Bay attached. Because THR reports that Bay has now dropped out of the film, citing “creative differences” with his star. Still technically available to stream!—with the actor playing “a crime boss who loses his memory after an attack and gradually learns that he was leading a double life as a CIA agent.” It's not clear how much room there even is in that idea for creative differences to crop up, but Bay and Smith apparently found them. (Who, by dint of writing Battleship, The Meg, RED, and more, were really out there penning Netflix-style movies before Netflix-style movies were even a thing.) Deadline offers up at least a bit of speculation on where the split between Smith and Bay came from: The director reportedly wanted to amplify the movie's action elements, while Smith wanted to play up its comedic aspects. Now, of course, nobody gets anything—at least until Netflix lures a third director to get this possibly cursed effort to jumpstart Smith's stalled public rehabilitation off the ground.
