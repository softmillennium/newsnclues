                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you think of James Wan, the first thing that comes to mind is likely his participation in major Hollywood franchises like Fast & Furious and Aquaman, but those who've followed him since the start know of his strong horror background. Dead Silence, which was added to the Peacock library on October 1. In Dead Silence, Jamie and Lisa Ashen find a mysterious gift on their doorstep. Jamie opens the box and inside there's an eerie ventriloquist doll named Billy. What he finds upon his return is a derelict rural town that holds a few secrets that could be related to the tragedy. After his wife meets a grisly end, Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) returns to their creepy hometown of Ravens Fair to unravel the mystery of her murder. Once there, he discovers the legend of Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts), a murdered ventriloquist whose eerie presence still looms over the town. As he desperately digs for answers, Jamie encounters the curse that took his wife's life and threatens his own. Although Wan and Saw co-writer Leigh Whannell were still enjoying the ongoing success of their first film, Saw had already morphed into a franchise. Could the Wan/Whannell duo win again with a different formula? The film was released to a negative reception by critics and audiences, only grossing a little over $22 million against its $20 million production budget. Professional reviewers also failed to connect with the movie; today, it has a 21% critics' score at Rotten Tomatoes. While the director behind Insidious, Aquaman, and The Conjuring has made his fair share of big studio movies, Saw put him on the map as a talented storyteller capable of touching a nerve with disturbing visuals and a compelling narrative, and the horror universe is still arguably where Wan is able to best express his unique voice. Dead Silence, on the other hand, is his most underrated project to date. Though many accused it of being inconsistent, the film is Wan at his most unhinged. His approach to "haunted house" and "ghost story" tropes isn't wholly unique, but the opening sequence alone is enough to terrify viewers, and proves the director's skillset when designing scary films.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The following is an adapted version of an article written by Mátyás Bíró, originally published in Hungarian in Magyar Krónika. In its series about reading matters, this time Magyar Krónika recommends the 2013 work by well-known and popular Hungarian historian Péter Hahner on the Kennedy assassination, with a lesser-known Hungarian thread. This has permanently consigned many popular conspiracy theories to the dustbin of history. Péter Hahner presents the known facts and sources of the Kennedy assassination in an easy-to-read style, similar to his previous works on popular knowledge and dispelling historical misconceptions, based on facts. Those interested in history will particularly enjoy the introductory chapters, which cover political assassinations in world and American history, and then introduce the lives of John F Kennedy, his wife Jacqueline, the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald's killer Jack Ruby. As he argues, when it became known that Oswald declared himself a Marxist, Americans were suspicious of the Russians and the Cubans for a long time. The author adds that, of course, there are many historical events about which we do not know the full truth; for example, we do not know what Alexander the Great died of, or where King Attila the Hun was buried. Reading the book, we find his position quite convincing. President Kennedy, the greatest enemy of his hero, Fidel Castro, passed in front of his workplace with his convoy on 22 November 1963, and Oswald simply took advantage of the situation. The Warren Commission, after ten months of work, interviewing 489 people, and using the 4,600-page Secret Service dispatch, prepared its 26-volume report, which reads: ‘The Commission found no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby participated in any domestic or foreign conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.' Péter Hahner also writes that 98 per cent of the Warren Commission documents were already made public in 1992. He knew in advance that the documents that had been uncovered would not contain any significant new information regarding the Kennedy assassination. The book also mentions the publication in 2007 of a work by former New York prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi titled Reclaiming History, which convincingly proved Oswald's guilt and the baselessness of conspiracy theories. suspects whose names have come up in some form in connection with the case over the past decades. It is interesting from a Hungarian perspective that Ferenc Nagy, who was the prime minister of our country between February 1946 and March 1947, is also on the list. In 1967 New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison indicted Clay Shaw, an American businessman, former military officer, and CIA contact, for Kennedy's assassination, but the charges were eventually dropped. Shaw gave an interview to Penthouse magazine in which he said that around 1960, a young Italian man approached him in New Orleans and asked him to be a member of the board of directors of a planned world trade centre in Rome. ‘I looked into it, and it turned out that the head of the programme was a man named Imre Nagy, who was the last non-communist prime minister of Hungary,' Shaw said. Of course, he confused him with Ferenc Nagy, but what does that have to do with the Kennedy assassination? The only thing, writes Hahner, is that Ferenc Nagy announced the plan to build a world trade centre in Rome at a press conference in October 1958, in which a Swiss company called Permindex was also involved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black Star Canyon is a beautiful nature escape in Orange County, but did you know about the haunting legends and stories that take place there? Black Star Canyon is found in the Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County, California. The area features a popular hike to a seasonal waterfall, but it may be most famous for spectral rumors and stories that have endured throughout history. From the early-1800s massacre of Indigenous Tongva people to rumors of contemporary cult activity, there's much more to Black Star Canyon than it seems. Most ghostly rumors trace back to a violent confrontation between the Indigenous Tongva people and white fur trappers in 1831. A post shared by Haunted Orange County Ghost Tours (@hauntedorangecounty) Some visitors also report seeing the ghost of James Gregg, who was shot and killed by Thomas and Henry Hungerford at Hidden Ranch in 1899 over an unsettled monetary dispute. Reported phenomena include sudden temperature drops, disembodied voices, phantom apparitions, and rocks thrown from the darkness. While skeptics point to natural noises and sensations from the canyon's unique acoustics, ghost hunters and visitors maintain that it's caused by paranormal activity. If you're interested in learning more about the legends, history, and paranormal activity of Black Star Canyon, Haunted OC hosts spooky ghost tours hosted by naturalist Joel Robinson. Many visitors take the trail at 13333 Black Star Canyon Road, which leads to a 7-mile round-trip hike along a fire road and rocky creek bed. The Black Star Canyon Falls are at their peak flow during and after the rainy season, which is from late winter to early spring.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20 years later, and our love for Supernatural is still going strong. One such question: who is Sam and Dean's unnamed uncle? Did you even know that the Winchesters had an uncle? With so much tragedy in their family life, it's easy to just remember the highlights and forget the rest, but if you listen closely, we learn something quite interesting about their extended family in Season 2's "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things." Of course, the way Dean says it, there's been some debate on whether he's saying "her uncle" (as in Mary's uncle) or "our uncle" (as in Mary's brother), though the captioning on Netflix uses the latter. When Dean time-travels to the past in Season 4, meeting a younger version of his mother, we hear absolutely nothing about Mary's uncle or brother. If we're going based on the Netflix captioning, then Mary should have a sibling out there. Yet, "In the Beginning" not only makes no reference to another Campbell beyond Mary's father, Samuel (Mitch Pileggi), and mother, Deanna (Allison Hossack), but there's no physical evidence in their home that such a person ever existed. But there is one source that speaks more directly to this mysterious uncle... There is one piece of Supernatural media that expands on this mysterious uncle further. It's a great comic book that gives us some greater context into how John found himself getting into hunting in the first place. But it also reveals something about Sam and Dean's uncle, a man named Jacob Campbell. Here, Jacob is established as Mary's older brother who watched over her almost like a father when their parents died. But despite that, the six-issue comic book is no longer considered canon, making this a strange continuity error that Supernatural never took the time to resolve. To make matters more complicated, the Alex Irvine tie-in novel John Winchester's Journal also refers to a Jacob Campbell, though here he's presented as Mary's uncle from Illinois rather than her brother. Because neither tie-in story is technically canon to the show itself, fans can take this throwaway line by Dean to mean whatever they want, but one thing remains clear no matter if Jacob Campbell is Mary's brother or uncle: the Winchesters had another relative out there that they never knew. Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix in the U.S. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.
