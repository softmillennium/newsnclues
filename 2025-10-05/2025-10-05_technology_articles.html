                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI and Jony Ive face significant technical challenges as they work to develop a screen-less, AI-powered device, according to the Financial Times. Back in May, OpenAI acquired io, the device startup founded by the legendary Apple designer with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for $6.5 billion. The FT now says that OpenAI and Ive aim to create “a palm-sized device without a screen that can take audio and visual cues from the physical environment and respond to users' requests.” But unresolved issues around the device's “personality,” how it handles privacy, and computing infrastructure might delay the launch. For example, one source told the FT that rather than waiting for a specific verbal prompt, the device would take an “always on” approach — but the team has reportedly struggled to ensure it only speaks up when useful and ends its conversations at the appropriate time.

If you're curious what I mean by this, Sean Goedecke's post "How I Ship Projects At Big Tech Companies" [1] is a superb example, particularly his definition of "what does it mean to ship?" No idea whether he's somebody who would say "the humanities are important" but I don't think you can understand his thesis as a technical one. Mediocre blatherers like Jordan Peterson (to pick just one example) have captured the hearts and minds of young people because most "real" work in the humanities is locked behind not just academic paywalls but an impenetrable wall of inward-focused jargon. It also tends to deal with subjects that are not of interest to 90%+ of the public.A huge vacuum has been created, and it's been filled with shit because it's there so something's going to fill it.P.S. For the inevitable defenders of Jordan Peterson: go read Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, G.K. Chesterton, and CS Lewis, to name a few. Take away the authors he draws from and what's left is a mix of stoner-esque rambling (though apparently without the pot?) and something like an attempt at highbrow Andrew Tate. The latter is why I genuinely dislike the guy more than I would if he were just, say, a self-help quack, which he also is.

I'm giving it as an example because same disease, different patient. I think this neglects the stark opportunity cost: PhD students are devoting years of their life to this endeavor, which may pay modest living expenses during school but otherwise provides no current or future financial benefit to the student unless they get a job in their field. Those years become lost years in their lives, years they can never get back.Moreover, if the ultimate goal of training graduate students is to preserve human knowledge, how is that goal going to be accomplished when those students are forced to leave the field and find some other way of supporting themselves after grad school?

I'd like to juxtapose your quote against a famous quote of John Adams:The Science of Government it is my Duty to study, more than all other Sciences: the Art of Legislation and Administration and Negotiation, ought to take Place, indeed to exclude in a manner all other Arts. My sons ought to study Mathematicks and Philosophy, Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their Children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine.-- John Adams in a letter to Abigail Adams (12 May 1780)In this quote, John Adams offers the thesis that what subjects we deem appropriate to study is determined not wholly by our interests, but also by the situation (personal, economic, and political) we find ourselves in. Within your quote is an implicit sense of urgency that weighs against someone's desire to devote years of their lives to studying the arts.Perhaps we are returning to John Adams's tumultuous time? Then it should be wholly understandable for more students to choose pragmatism over personal calling when deciding on a course of study.

Then it should be wholly understandable for more students to choose pragmatism over personal calling when deciding on a course of study. That's a quite literal interpretation of the quote, which I did not intend. Studying political science today -- as an otherwise directionless middle-class student relying on loans and scholarships for tuition -- is not really hearing the call to favour pragmatism I believe Adams had intended. Yes, but considering the contemporary assault on democracy and the rule of law, it seems apt.> the call to favour pragmatism I believe Adams had intendedIt depends on what you mean by pragmatism. Otherwise, he could probably just accumulate person wealth and allow his literal descendants, and those only, to study whatever they want.

The University of Chicago is basically Number Go Up University.I don't see why this university, out of all of the high-prestige American schools, would care about humanities in a time when the conservative political movement has wholly embraced anti-intellectualism. The political movement no longer cares about presenting Number Go Up Theory as some kind of elite intellectual practice.

The political movement no longer cares about presenting Number Go Up Theory as some kind of elite intellectual practice. In the past people would be expected to take and pass many humanity courses. Seems now schools are interested in training only, not real education. The fact of the matter is that most jobs in most industries do not require virtuoso technical ability, but they do benefit from close reading, attention to detail, a willingness to look at the bigger picture and challenge mistaken assumptions baked into bad specifications. For what it's worth, I have enjoyed a very successful career in data science and software engineering after taking some AP STEM courses in high school, followed by three liberal arts degrees. Many of the best engineers I've known have had similar backgrounds. A good liberal arts education teaches one how to think and learn independently. It's also essential for an informed citizenry and functional democracy. This isn't revitalizing the sciences, as if the humanities are somehow at odds with engineering, it's a decline into Americas version of some kind of oligarchic Third Worldism. that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you don't work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 2.4 did it again. At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there's a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input. As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we're seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can't. In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn't break before they deployed it. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, as Google's senior director for dev tools recently told me, they're just as useful for validating AI-generated code. There's no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. We don't have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you'd asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by OpenAI's new Sora 2 model shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both obvious and subtle ways. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. To be clear, this isn't a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It's a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.

However, a Ukrainian invention that is tangling the efforts of the invaders to hit targets with their kamikaze drones has been revealed by a Russian Vlogger, reports Militarnyi. Farmland littered with fiber optic cabling has become an instantly recognizable vista in the Russia-Ukraine war. The hazy wisps of tangled cabling, snagged in wheat stalks and hedgerows, are the ghostly remnants of a fierce drone war. A successful anti-tank tethered drone strike back in May, by Ukraine's Birds of Magyar brigade, is said to have been completed from a distance of 42km (26 miles). Sometimes low tech solutions are the most practical for high-tech problems. This philosophy has given rise to the optical fiber tethered drone. Now, Ukraine has a similarly simple solution to tethered enemy drones crossing miles-and-miles into its territory. In a nutshell, the Ukrainian invention we see in the video consists of a rotating barbed wire, or razor wire, fence. We don't get any more information about the installation, but we'd expect parallel fences rotating in opposite directions to each other to maximize fiber snapping speeds.

Militarnyi also notes that it is too risky to install these fences near the front line, so they are mainly used to help prevent deeper Russian drone incursions.

The flagship cryptocurrency, abbreviated as BTC, previously hit $124,000 in August, driven by the White House's crypto-friendly policies and consequential interest from institutional investors. On the other hand, this jump is believed to be investors' reactions to the U.S. federal shutdown, with many looking for alternative assets while Washington is sorting out its mess. Although Bitcoin ETFs accept fiat currency, they still need to purchase the cryptocurrency whenever they get an inflow of investments, which is what is happening at the moment. Crypto tracking and analysis site CoinMarketCap also suggested that there is a dwindling supply of readily available Bitcoin in exchanges. For example, one investor moved 80,000 BTC from one dormant wallet in July, while 54,000 BTC (worth approximately $6.6 billion) was transferred out of Binance yesterday. Although prices have already dropped a bit, analysts suggest that many are still bullish on the cryptocurrency. At the moment, BTC's total market cap is nearing $2.5 trillion — meaning it's about to catch up with silver. Although it's still distant from gold's over $26 trillion market cap, this shows that Bitcoin is slowly turning from a niche investment vehicle into a mainstream financial asset.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days returns for round two this Oct. 7-8 and gives you a second chance at Prime Day-level deals ahead of the holiday shopping season fully kicking off. Amazon is already beginning to roll out pre-Black Friday savings in leading categories with among the deepest discounts appearing this Sunday, Oct. 5. This October iteration of Prime Day has grown exponentially in popularity since Amazon first introduced it as a fall counterpart to the July edition. While July Prime Day falls in the middle of summer (when most shoppers aren't shopping for big-ticket items), October positions itself perfectly in advance of Black Friday and the holiday shopping season. This gives the consumer a chance to grab gifts, upgrade their technology or refresh their home without having to fight the raw chaos of late November. Most have caught on that October Prime Day offers the same or better prices than Black Friday, especially on Amazon devices and a few big-name electronics lines. Apple products (which rarely get heavily discounted through authorized channels) are appearing on Amazon with massive discounts – especially the Mac Mini M4. Samsung has joined the advance savings deal bandwagon with discounts on tablets, smartphones and home appliances. Kindle e-readers have dropped to prices this Sunday morning that put them impulse-buy zone with many models establishing their year-to-date lowest price ever. Blink cameras, Amazon's budget security option, are becoming affordable with savings that drop them well below $50 for starter packages. The eero mesh WiFi systems are seeing fantastic offers and cure one of the most common home annoyances: dead zones and spotty internet access. Those Prime Big Deal Day deals matter because mesh systems typically come with high prices, and Amazon's aggressive discounting makes them accessible to mass consumers who've been tolerating crummy WiFi for years. All Echo devices of every size have been receiving price reductions. Fire TV streaming sticks and devices are hitting record lows, making it simple to break up with cable. The scope of these October Prime Day Amazon discounts is not coincidental: Prime Day events are used by the company to drive hard uptake of its ecosystem aggressively and hope that once customers possess an Echo, Kindle, or Fire device, they will be more invested in Amazon's services and more likely to be Prime members over the long haul. Early Sunday Prime Day deals begin to provide glimpses of what is to come when the full event commences on Tuesday morning. If you are not a member currently, Amazon offers a 30-day free trial that includes this Prime Day sale and gives you a full month to determine if the membership is worth it through the free shipping, Prime Video, and other perks. One tip in practice for Prime Day: add items to cart or wishlist in advance even if you don't plan on purchasing them at that time. Amazon's technology enables you to just track price drops on bookmarked items and you'll be notified if prices drop lower after the big event. This method prevents choice paralysis while browsing hundreds of deals simultaneously. Prices on all of the top gift categories, from high-tech gadgetry to kitchen appliances to toys, typically don't dip lower even on Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Tying up holiday gift purchases in advance avoids the December shipping issues, out-of-stock items, and last-minute aggravation that plague holiday shoppers year in and year out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Ninja Slushi doesn't go on sale often. What a difference a season makes: Now it's $50 off list price on an early Prime Day deal. It's among the most exciting and surprising early Prime Day deals, but check out our rundown for more. I received a Ninja Slushi to test at the beginning of summer, and it changed my year a lot more than I expected. The Slushi has been an unbridled hit since it first came out (then promptly sold out) last year. Just like my favorite soda maker, the Drinkmate Omnifizz ($133), the Slushi offered the chance to try pretty much every drink you already like … a different way. Fruity-sour craft beers slush like champions, it turns out, as do sweetly cheap wines from Grocery Outlet. I even nurtured by inner fraternity bro by making slushies from Bapple and Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade. Attempts at soft serve ice cream or milkshakes didn't really pan out, alas—you want a Ninja Swirl for that. But I dutifully lugged this thing to barbecues and to parties full of children—where the slushie machine was quickly commandeered for wholesome lemon-lime, strawberry, or orange-vanilla slush. Heck, I was named an honorary uncle to a tot and tween just for bringing this thing to a birthday party, and presumably bringing it again for the next one: You've gotta keep at least one slushie machine in the family, seems to be the idea. 10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers Business PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code LG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I hope someone puts these repugnant clowns behind bars in the next admin. Many presidential appointments are structured so that their terms outlast the president in question; Biden kept Chris Wray on, for example. It is impossible to imagine any Democratic or national unity president keeping Kash Patel in his job, or Brendan Carr in his, or whoever Trump finally installs at the Federal Reserve.Whoever takes over from Trump would legitimately have to purge and criminally charge essentially everyone he hired, and many, many people they hired, all the way down the chain. It would be the right thing to do but it will seem indistinguishable from what Trump is currently doing under false pretences.Even assuming Trump does not simply die of or retire from old age or ill health in office, he himself is essentially untouchable. So to his remaining supporters it will look like an unfair proxy war against him, targeting his employees and loyalists.Nothing is ever going to go back to the way it was before, and I think people will have to steel themselves for the possibility that the only thing that will provide any sort of foundation for rebuilding the federal USA is some sort of truth and reconciliation commission, and these people will, in fact, have to get away without meaningful sanction if the full truth is to be known.Apart from that, the only solution will be to dissolve the union and start from scratch.
