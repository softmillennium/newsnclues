                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of "food addiction," these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. Some experts argue that they're "specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximise consumption and corporate profits," hijacking our brain's reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs. Policymakers have proposed bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence? And what drives them to overeat - not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? We studied more than 3,000 UK adults and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward. Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists. We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognizable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams - more than 400 in total. We then compared these responses with three things: the foods' nutritional content (fat, sugar, fiber, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the widely used Nova system - a food classification method that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing - and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on). But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fiber had the opposite effect. In one survey, we could predict 78% of the variation in people's likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%). Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as "ultra-processed" added very little to our predictive models. Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating. Some of these products may be less healthy, but others can be helpful - especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition. People don't eat based on food labels alone. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that are actually beneficial, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what's genuinely unhealthy. They're calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food - and how we perceive them - matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it's time to stop demonizing food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices. “They Are Coming” – Scientists Warn That Destructive “Supershear” Earthquakes Could Devastate California New Pill Lowers Stubborn Blood Pressure and May Slow Kidney Disease Don't Miss October's Dazzling Supermoon and Twin Meteor Showers Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cumulative effect of social advantages across a lifetime - from parental warmth in childhood to friendship, community engagement and religious support in adulthood - may slow the biological processes of aging. These social advantages appear to set back "epigenetic clocks" such that a person's biological age, as measured by analyzing DNA methylation patterns, is younger than their chronological age. Anthony Ong, psychology professor at Cornell University, and fellow researchers found that people with higher levels of what they called "cumulative social advantage" showed slower epigenetic aging and lower levels of chronic inflammation. Adults with stronger, more sustained social networks showed significantly younger profiles on both clocks. The researchers hypothesized that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. Remarkably, they found that higher social advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule implicated in heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, however, there were no significant associations with short-term stress markers like cortisol or catecholamines. Unlike many earlier studies that looked at social factors in isolation - whether a person is married, for example, or how many friends they have - this work conceptualized "cumulative social advantage" as a multidimensional construct. "What's striking is the cumulative effect -- these social resources build on each other over time," Ong said. This doesn't mean a single friendship or volunteer stint can turn back the biological clock. The study adds weight to the growing view that social life is not just a matter of happiness or stress relief but a core determinant of physiological health. "Think of social connections like a retirement account," Ong said. Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional; they're biological. “They Are Coming” – Scientists Warn That Destructive “Supershear” Earthquakes Could Devastate California New Pill Lowers Stubborn Blood Pressure and May Slow Kidney Disease Don't Miss October's Dazzling Supermoon and Twin Meteor Showers Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The habitat of thirty species of sharks, rays, and chimaeras, also called ghost sharks, overlap with areas where proposed deep-sea mining may occur, according to new research published in Current Biology and led by University of Hawai'i at Mānoa oceanographers. Nearly two-thirds of these species are already threatened with extinction due to human impacts, so deep-sea mining, which will disrupt the seafloor and discharge large plumes of sediment into the water above, has the potential to elevate their extinction risk. Judah collaborated with an international team of experts to overlay the global maps of species ranges created by the IUCN Shark Specialist Group with contract areas and reserved areas allocated for deep-sea mining by the International Seabed Authority. The species they assessed included iconic examples such as the whale shark, manta rays, and the megamouth shark, and also many lesser known, but just as interesting deep-sea species, such as the pygmy shark, chocolate skate, and point-nosed chimaera, which comes from a unique group of cartilaginous fishes similar to sharks and rays, sometimes called ghost sharks. The team discovered that 30 species could be impacted by discharge plumes and 25 of the 30 species could also be impacted by seafloor disruptions associated with mining. "Sharks and their relatives are the second most threatened vertebrate group on the planet, mostly from overfishing," said Jeff Drazen, study senior author and professor of Oceanography at SOEST. "Because of their vulnerability, they should be considered in ongoing discussions of the environmental risks from deep-sea mining, and those responsible for monitoring their health should be aware that mining could pose an additional risk." These recommendations could be adopted by the International Seabed Authority in their regulations for creating environmental impact assessments, or by contractors in executing scientific baseline assessments. Judah continues to research and report species range extensions for animals not included in the initial assessment, which may add additional species to this group of animals at risk from mining impacts. “They Are Coming” – Scientists Warn That Destructive “Supershear” Earthquakes Could Devastate California New Pill Lowers Stubborn Blood Pressure and May Slow Kidney Disease Breakthrough Blood Test Detects Head and Neck Cancer up to 10 Years Before Symptoms Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A key switch for cellular energy balance has been discovered in cells: it could potentially become the target of new therapies for diseases ranging from Parkinson's to rare disorders caused by defects in the cell's powerhouses, the mitochondria. Experts from Università Cattolica, Rome campus, and Roma Tre Universty have observed that, by reducing its activity, it's possible to attenuate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's in a preclinical model of the disease. Mitochondria are highly complex cellular organelles, vital for cell survival. They are responsible for producing the energy cells need to survive. Their integrity is associated with several diseases, both widespread, such as Parkinson's, and rare, so-called mitochondrial diseases, which can affect various parts of the body, from muscles to eyes to the brain. In some diseases, however, this balance is disrupted, and if mitochondria are lost in excess, or if damaged organelles accumulate in the cell and are regularly not eliminated, the very survival of the cell is endangered. Experts have discovered that B55 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. "On the one hand," Professor Cecconi explains, "it promotes the removal of damaged mitochondria by stimulating mitophagy, a selective process for removing inefficient and potentially dangerous organelles. In this way, B55 not only promotes the degradation of damaged mitochondria, but also prevents excessive production of new organelles, thus maintaining a dynamic balance between mitochondrial elimination and synthesis. It is of great interest," the expert emphasizes, "that both these effects depend on the functional interaction between B55 and Parkin, a central protein in mitophagy mechanisms, implicated in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the deregulation of mitochondrial quality and number also underlies the plasticity of tumor cells and their ability to resist therapies, so controlling B55 could become a promising approach in oncology. This is why "our future studies will aim to identify safe molecules and therapeutic strategies to modulate B55 in preclinical and human cellular models, especially in order to analyze the effect of its regulation on other neurodegenerative and mitochondrial diseases," they conclude.
