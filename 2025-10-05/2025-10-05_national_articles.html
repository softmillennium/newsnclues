                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest AP Top 25 college football rankings show a major shakeup, with Penn State and Texas gone from the poll for the first time since 2022. Miami moved ahead of an idle Oregon to reclaim the No. 9 Texas Tech rose to its highest ranking since 2008. 6 Oklahoma slipped one notch, but the losses by Penn State and Texas made way for Indiana at No. 8, a two-spot promotion for the Crimson Tide. Follow live updates from The Associated Press below for game recaps, ranking analysis and voter answers to fan questions, all in one place. ▶ Show your appreciation for one of college football's longest-running traditions. The Bulldogs have already played Alabama and Tennessee and still have Auburn (a rivalry), Ole Miss, Florida (another rivalry), Mississippi State and Georgia Tech on the schedule.

You can follow him on X: @javonedmonds45 ▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll 4 Ole Miss was the only team with a bye week to retain its exact spot in the poll. Miami leapfrogged over Oregon, returning to No. 2 after a 28-22 win over Florida State. Indiana (7), Tennessee (12), Georgia Tech (13), Missouri (14) and Arizona State (21) each ascended in the rankings. 13 is Georgia Tech's highest ranking since 2014, when the Yellow Jackets went 11-3 and beat Mississippi State in the Orange Bowl. Iowa State dropped eight spots, falling from No. Florida State retained its AP Top 25 status but dropped seven spots, coming in at No. 25 after losing to Miami on Saturday night. I can't recall ever being more wrong about a college football team. Texas and Penn State are obvious candidates for most disappointing, too. Those programs have invested too much money into those rosters to be anything but top-five teams. And the first-round hype around Drew Allar should be gone by now.

Heating up: Miami (2), Alabama (8), Texas Tech (9), Michigan (15), Notre Dame (16), BYU (18), Virginia (19), Memphis (23), South Florida (24). Holding steady: Ohio State (1), Ole Miss (4). Are Ole Miss and Missouri undefeated? I can't penalize Georgia too much for losing to Alabama. What I will say, which I have to consider moving forward, is that the Florida State loss isn't looking as good for the Tide.

You can follow him on X: @javonedmonds45 Miami is the only team in the country with three wins over ranked teams so far this season. Miami's 21 first-place votes this week match its total from the last 354 polls combined, going back to midway through the 2003 season. The team has appeared in 24 consecutive AP polls, matching the fifth-longest streak in school history. I had Ole Miss out of the top 10 last week. However, I moved them into that tier this week. The losses by Texas and Penn State, whom I had little faith in already, made me rethink which résumés deserve a top-10 distinction. BYU, Michigan and Illinois also made some leaps on my ballot.

Americans for Public Trust executive director Caitlin Sutherland sounds the alarm on the 'dark money' purportedly paying for Democrats' protests on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Disgraced financier Howard Rubin's personal assistant allegedly indulged in a lavish life of luxury funded by the former Soros Fund Management portfolio manager, while luring women for him to sexually abuse for over a decade, according to federal prosecutors. Jennifer Powers, 45, appeared in Brooklyn federal court earlier this week to plead not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and transporting women in interstate commerce for sex acts with Rubin, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Federal prosecutors allege Rubin "funded virtually all aspects" of Powers' lifestyle from at least 2018 until 2023, including covering the costs of her Manhattan apartment, credit card bills, children's private schooling, and down payment and mortgage on the family's Texas home. Jennifer Powers, assistant to Howard Rubin, leaves Brooklyn federal court, Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Powers has been indicted on charges she helped run an alleged sex-trafficking scheme, prosecutors say. Powers and her husband, Stephen Powers, are facing additional charges stemming from allegations that the pair – who have been married since "at least 2012" – intentionally filed joint tax returns between 2018 and 2024 that did not disclose the millions of dollars in payments Rubin had provided, according to prosecutors. "Jennifer Powers did not report any wages or income from employment," the indictment alleges. Court documents reveal federal prosecutors' case against the couple, alleging the pair did not report any income from Jennifer Powers and only documented a gross income of $40,000 from Stephen Powers' disc jockey business in the tax years 2018 and 2019 combined. Howard Rubin, a retired New York financier, has been indicted alongside his longtime assistant on federal sex trafficking and bank fraud charges. Now-private Instagram posts reportedly show the family enjoying lavish vacations in Turks and Caicos, Italy and Colombia, according to the New York Post. Prosecutors now allege that, during the same time, Jennifer Powers played a key role in procuring women for Rubin to sexually abuse inside his Central Park penthouse in a soundproofed room referred to as "The Dungeon" from 2011 to 2019. According to court documents, Rubin and Powers spent over $1 million recruiting women, some of whom had been previously sexually abused or suffered from addiction, to partake in paid sex acts that often went beyond the scope of their consent. "The defendants allegedly exploited Rubin's status to ensnare their prospective victims and forced them to endure unthinkable physical trauma before silencing any outcries with threats of legal recourse," Christopher Raia, the FBI's assistant director for New York, said in a statement after the indictment was unsealed. Howard Rubin's Manhattan penthouse, located near Central Park, was allegedly converted into a soundproof "dungeon" where prosecutors say women endured violent abuse. Rubin also is accused of paying Powers' legal bills stemming from a 2017 lawsuit brought forth by several Playboy models he allegedly abused. A jury found that only Rubin was liable and awarded the women $3.9 million – a decision Rubin is currently appealing, according to The Associated Press. Jennifer Powers was released on an $850,000 bond and has been ordered to remain on house arrest while wearing an ankle monitor, according to court documents. She previously worked as a substitute teacher for the Carroll Independent School District in Texas, but has since been removed, according to CBS Texas. Rubin has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail until his next court date on Oct. 20. Jennifer Powers' attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — President Donald Trump is sending 300 California National Guard members to Oregon after a judge temporarily blocked  his administration from deploying that state's guard to Portland, California's governor said Sunday. Gavin Newsom pledged Sunday to fight the move in court. There was no official announcement from Washington that the California National Guard was being called up and sent to Oregon, just as was the case when Illinois' governor made a similar announcement Saturday about troops in his state being activated. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that California personnel were on their way Sunday and called the deployment “a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.” He said these troops were “federalized” and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Oregon on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard in Portland to protect federal property amid protests after Trump called the city “war-ravaged.” Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities. Trump authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard troops to protect federal officers and assets in Chicago on Saturday.</p>

President Donald Trump on Sunday placed the blame squarely on Democrats for the government shutdown, which is expected to trigger sweeping layoffs across the federal workforce. Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One that the looming layoffs are "up to them," referring to Democrats who voted against a bill to fund the government and avert the shutdown. ET on Wednesday, forcing agencies to send home workers in roles not considered essential. The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. These furloughs are temporary; once Congress resolves the standoff, employees typically return to work and receive back pay. As a result, past government shutdowns have been more political theater than economic shock, with markets and jobs rebounding quickly. This time, however, the Trump administration has warned that some furloughed workers may not return, turning a routine disruption into a potential blow to an already fragile labor market. Washington, D.C., home to a large share of federal employees, has been hit especially hard after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory board pushed for layoffs earlier this year. On Tuesday, when asked how many federal workers could be laid off, Trump told reporters at the White House, "We may do a lot," saying Democrats have made little progress to end the stalemate. At the same time, the administration is preparing to oversee what could become the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, with more than 100,000 federal employees scheduled to leave under its deferred resignation program. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that layoffs will start "if the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere." He said he's hopeful "we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that." If Democrats are "reasonable once they get back into town on Monday," Hassett added, then Trump will see "no reason for those layoffs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those detained between Wednesday and Friday were brought to Israel, where many remain in prison. On his return at Rome's Fiumicino Airport late Saturday, Italian journalist Saverio Tommasi said Israeli soldiers withheld medicines and treated prisoners “like monkeys.” Israel's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said the claims of mistreatment were “brazen lies.” Tommasi said Thunberg was singled out by Israeli forces after being arrested. “We also saw Greta Thunberg at the port, in that case with her arms tied and an Israeli flag next to her, just a mockery,” he said. “Let's say the mockery was part of the verbal and psychological violence they always carried out, in order to demean, ridicule and laugh in situations where there is nothing to laugh about.” This image taken from video released by the Israeli Foreign Ministry claims to show activist Greta Thunberg, right, as she is removed after the Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla carrying humanitarian aid towards Gaza on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. In a statement on social media, the ministry said all detainees' legal rights had been “fully upheld,” adding that Thunberg had not complained about the “ludicrous and baseless allegations — because they never occurred.” The interception of the flotilla came as U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to broker a fresh ceasefire initiative in Gaza, as he ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Another Italian journalist, Lorenzo D'Agostino, said detainees were repeatedly woken during the two nights he spent behind bars. They were also intimidated with dogs and by soldiers pointing the laser sights of their guns at prisoners “to scare us,” he said after landing at Istanbul Airport, where 137 activists from 13 countries arrived from Israel on Saturday. D'Agostino added that his belongings and money had been “stolen by the Israelis.” Activist Paolo De Montis described being crammed into a prison van for hours with his hands secured by zip ties. “You weren't allowed to look them in the face, always had to keep your head down and when I did look up, a man … came and shook me and slapped me on the back of the head. They forced us to stay on our knees for four hours.” In a statement, far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was “proud” of the way staff behaved at Ketziot prison, a facility in the Negev desert. “I was proud that we treat the ‘flotilla activists' as supporters of terrorism. Anyone who supports terrorism is a terrorist and deserves the conditions of terrorists,” he said. The arrests led to criticism from several governments including Turkey, Colombia and Pakistan. Greece, which had 27 of its nationals in Israeli custody, issued a “strong written protest” to Israel over the “unacceptable and inappropriate behavior of an Israeli minister.”</p>

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., spoke about being forcibly removed after interrupting a news conference with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on MSNBC's "The Beat. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in an interview that he never thought he would be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference as he tried to ask DHS secretary Kristi Noem a question in June, arguing it should be a "wake-up call." Padilla was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a June press conference Noem had in Los Angeles after he tried to ask a question of the head of Homeland Security, who was speaking about the anti-ICE riots in the city. Padilla has insisted he wasn't interrupting the press conference and just wanted to ask a question. Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, is removed from the room after interrupting a news conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles on June 12, 2025. "No apology, but honestly not surprised, just given how this administration tends to carry itself," he continued. She finally did say, ‘Well, I understand you're asking for more information. Padilla said his removal from the press conference should be a wake-up call, arguing it was part of a bigger problem with the Trump administration. "It was clear to me that if that's how this administration would respond to a senator with a question, imagine not just how they could treat so many other people, but how they are treating so many other people when the cameras are not on. This should be a wake-up call," he told the Times.

He knows who I am, but it's the way they choose to go about things," he said, referring to Vice President JD Vance calling Padilla "Jose" after the incident. Sen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Batters try all sorts to get themselves right when they're having a bad day at the plate. Shohei Ohtani found a simple solution in his playoff pitching debut on Saturday night: why not just go and strike out nine from the mound? “It's really never been done, certainly at this level,” Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of his star player's two-way performance against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 of their NLDS matchup. “I use the word compartmentalize a lot, this epitomizes compartmentalizing. I don't know any other human that can manage those emotions, how do you not take to the mound? Shohei Ohtani's two home runs in Dodgers win over Reds highlights night of MLB Wild Card action Ohtani's nine strikeouts were the third most ever made by a Dodgers pitcher in their career playoff debut. Only Don Newcombe – with 11 in the 1949 World Series – and Tim Belcher – with 10 in the 1988 NLCS – have racked up more. His excellent showing was even more impressive considering how much of an off day he had with the bat. Historically, Ohtani has misfired with the bat at Philadelphia – going into the game, none of his 250 career homers have come there. That did not change on Saturday as he produced an uncharacteristically shaky performance, going 0-for-4 with a walk and four strikeouts. But such is Ohtani's unique status in the game that he made history simply by stepping up to the plate – the 31-year-old is the first player in Major League history to start at least one game as a pitcher and at least one as a non-pitcher in the same postseason. He also became just the second starting pitcher to bat higher than eighth. “I was a little nervous imagining myself out there on the mound. But once I was on the mound and on the field, that went away, and it was really me focusing. I was able to enjoy the atmosphere,” Ohtani told reporters after Saturday's game. “The reason why I'm a two-way player is because that's who I am, it's what I can do and, at the same time, it's what the team wants.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to cede power and control of Gaza, amid ongoing efforts to push forward his proposed ceasefire plan. “Complete Obliteration!” Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked via text message on Saturday what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power. Tapper pressed the president on Hamas' response to his 20-point ceasefire proposal, citing Sen. Lindsey Graham's interpretation that Hamas had effectively rejected the plan by insisting on “no disarmament, keeping Gaza under Palestinian control and tying hostage release to negotiations.” The president said he expects clarity “soon” on whether Hamas is genuinely committed to peace. “Yes on Bibi,” Trump said, when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fully on board with ending the bombing campaign in Gaza and supporting the president's broader vision. Trump added that he is hopeful his ceasefire proposal will become a reality and emphasized that he's working hard to achieve it. Earlier on Saturday, the president said that Israel agreed to the initial withdrawal line outlined in his proposed ceasefire plan for Israel and Hamas. In a post on social media, he said the administration is now waiting for confirmation from Hamas. If Hamas agrees, Trump said, a ceasefire would be “immediately effective” and a hostage and prisoner exchange would begin. “After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump also said Saturday that Israel had temporarily halted its airstrikes on Gaza, calling it a critical step toward finalizing a ceasefire agreement, securing the release of hostages, and warned Hamas to act swiftly. Earlier on the same day, however, CNN reported that at least 67 people in Gaza died due to Israeli strikes, according to hospital officials in the enclave. Speaking in a video posted to Truth Social, Trump called it “a big day,” and described the developments as “unprecedented.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those developments came against the backdrop of continuing protests in Chicago and Portland against federal law enforcement carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration enforcement agenda. Trump and his administration have framed demonstrations in the two cities as “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” arguing that military deployments are necessary to protect federal immigration personnel and property – despite state and city leaders' insistence that the protests have been largely peaceful and any violence has been easily dealt with by local law enforcement. Tensions spiked in Chicago Saturday after US Customs and Border Protection agents fired “defensive shots” at a woman who the Department of Homeland Security said rammed her car into a federal law enforcement vehicle. The judge did note that recent incidents cited by the Trump administration of protesters clashing with federal officers “are inexcusable,” but said “they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces.” Judge temporarily blocks Trump's National Guard deployment in Portland Roughly 200 National Guard troops were undergoing training in preparation for a potential deployment to Portland, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN Friday. Tina Kotek for now, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said. Amid the legal victory for state leaders, crowds of protesters continued to gather late into the night Saturday outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland. Demonstrators both for and against the National Guard deployment rallied outside the building, according to CNN affiliate KATU, whose crews reported seeing federal agents deploying multiple rounds of pepper balls, flash bangs and tear gas to clear streets. Portland's police department said its officers did not see any crimes against people or property during Saturday's demonstration and that they made no arrests and did not use munitions. CNN reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for further information. “Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like (Illinois Gov. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.” “This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said on X Saturday. DHS says officers in Chicago fired at driver who ‘rammed the law enforcement vehicle' Tensions around anti-ICE protests in Chicago escalated earlier in the day after Customs and Border Protection agents shot at an armed woman after she rammed a law enforcement vehicle, according to the DHS. Officers fired “defensive shots” at the woman after she – along with the drivers of at least 10 other vehicles – rammed and boxed in officers, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a post on X. “Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. On Sunday, Pritzker told CNN's Jake Tapper that the Trump administration is releasing information before local officials have had a chance to assess. “What happens in these sorts of incidents is typically, ICE puts out a press release before anybody else can speak with the press and then it gets reported on social media and elsewhere,” Pritzker said on “State of the Union.” “They are just putting out their propaganda, and then we've got to later determine what actually happened.” Martinez was named in an intelligence bulletin last week “for doxing agents and posting online,” McLaughlin said. The two are facing federal charges related to Saturday's incident, authorities said Sunday in a news release. CNN is working to determine legal representation for Martinez and Ruiz. Law enforcement also deployed gas canisters at the protesters Saturday, according to footage from Reuters. The footage shows protesters screaming, running, and shielding themselves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If you're not quite sure why everything is suddenly Dubai chocolate or what exactly a Labubu is, you're not alone. Trends have such a tenuous connection to our culture at large that posters online have started to identify the phenomenon with word salad: “labubu matcha dubai chocolate crumbl cookie benson boone …” You get the gist. Amanda Mull, who's writes about consumerism and the internet for Bloomberg, says this miasma of trends is all a part of our algorithm-mediated world. When Mull looks back at fads of the past, like when everyone was collecting Beanie Babies back in the nineties, she can follow a clear trail of sociological phenomena and human actors that paved the way from cult status to ubiquity. But tastemakers don't control trends anymore; the algorithm does. What all of these new fads have in common is the ability to grab your attention while scrolling on TikTok or Instagram Reels. Something like the soothing green hue of a matcha latte or the rich textures of the kunafeh filling in a Dubai chocolate bar is perfectly positioned to make you pause as you scroll. Mull spoke with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram about how trends used to work pre-algorithm and what evolving social media consumption means for the trend cycles of the future. Below is an excerpt of their conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. Well, I have to give full credit for this to zoomer internet users who sort of created this grouping of trends on their own. This set of weird recent trends, I think, is indicative of how weird the trend cycles have gotten in consumer goods in the past. Trends have forever seemed a little bit weird, because the average person doesn't have a ton of insight on where something ultimately came from that is suddenly everywhere. You know, in the Devil Wears Prada scene about cerulean and blue sweaters sort of demonstrates that dynamic, and that's existed for a long time. But when you get down to it, a lot of random-seeming trends in consumer goods from decades past have a pretty easy way to explain them if you dig a little bit. Trends recently seem to have even less connective tissue to culture at large than they used to, which is a real change in how trends are produced, how people become aware of things, why people buy things. Yes, a lot of this is TikTok fueled, but in general, this I think is a phenomenon of algorithmic social media, because when you interact with things on these platforms, when you're presented with things on these platforms, you have very little context. That means that the things that catch on, the things that end up getting seen by a large audience, it's very, very difficult to trace where they came from, why they became interesting to so many people, or what any of it means. The algorithm certainly feels like a helpful explanation of how these random things sort of took the summer by storm. But I think you write in your piece about the fact that we have seen stuff like these things become popular before. I think the best example might be not Benson Boone, but, like, the Beanie Baby, because it's so close to a Labubu What was the difference then, and why did Beanie Babies happen? Yeah, well, Beanie Babies are a fascinating story, because they seem so random. But they're actually a really good demonstration of how trends are traditionally disseminated through culture. They came around as collectibles sold in gift shops and stationery stores by a relatively small toy company who was looking to increase sales by stoking demand through the sort of traditional, well-known marketing tactics of false scarcity, and limited editions, and things like that. But they really took off because eBay was launching at the same time. So, Americans were presented with this idea that anybody could resell anything to anybody else in the country, and you could do it from home, and you could quit your day job by selling random stuff. And how does that compare, then, to the Labubu thing? In the sort of traditional trend environment, like with Beanie Babies, it really mattered if the thing you were selling or buying was real. People had sort of rational beliefs about — and by rational, I don't mean reasonable, let me be clear — but they had reasons that were rational enough for wanting particular dolls at particular prices. With the Labubus, there's not quite so much of that at all. But alongside them, the market for fakes — which are adorably called Lafufus — has really exploded. The craze is fueled by people just wanting to clip one of these things onto their outfits. They're all kind of — no judgment — a little infantile? The way that algorithmically mediated social platforms work is by sort of collapsing your capacity to understand the context of what you're looking at. So, things that do well in these environments are sort of like maximally stimulating, and that means that you're going to get sold a lot of things that are mostly sold to kids, because the sort of maximal colorful, sweet, cuddly fun stuff is generally made for children. Because these are all, by and large, these are all objects, or things, or experiences that you need to get up and leave your house and go have. They are things that exist in physical reality. Viral objects are a way for people to emotionally, intellectually, bridge that gap that they are constantly straddling. And it, I think, gives people a little bit of a sense of participation and a sense of … that the stuff they look at on their phone is real. I mean, we talked about the infantilization of adults being a bad thing, but is getting out and making, I don't know, a thing you see on your phone, a tangible consensus reality good for us? People still want a little bit of consensus reality, that people aren't entirely, sort of, like, feed-brained at this point. How the Democrats came to embrace shutdown politics. Many used to worry about China's power over the app — but American control is troubling, too. ﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood? ﻿This program is likely to hurt American workers — and the whole economy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leaked text messages from 2022 show Jones called for former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to be shot and wished violence on his children. Miyares, along with many other Republican officials, is now calling for Jones to drop out of the race. “With the recent revelations, it's clear Jay Jones has shown he's reckless, biased, and willing to trade away his integrity, disqualifying himself from ever serving as Attorney General,” Miyares said on Saturday night. That authority must always be exercised with neutrality, integrity, and character because that's the only way every Virginian can trust the system meant to protect them. Now it's about basic fitness for public office,” he added. Jones is running against Miyares for attorney general in Virginia. The text messages reveal Jones said he would rather shoot former Republican Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert over dictators Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot. Jones went on to say he believes Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists.” The private messages offer a disturbing glimpse into how Jones — who is looking to oust incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares this fall — describes his political adversaries in private conversations. “This violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children is beyond disqualifying,” Gov. Jones doesn't have the morality or character to drop out of this race, and his running mates Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and every elected Democrat in Virginia don't have the courage to call on him to step away from this campaign in disgrace,” Youngkin added. “I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words.” Winsome Earle-Sears, who is the Republican gubernatorial nominee, blasted Spanberger for her response. “Jay Jones literally fantasized about killing a man and two children and Abigail Spanberger still doesn't have the guts to tell him to drop out,” Earle-Sears said. “So it is not enough for Jay Jones to drop out of the race. She and her party's irresponsible behavior have brought us to this point.” @winwithwinsome holds a press conference condemning @jonesjay violent text messages. Jones could still get votes even if he drops out of the race since ballots have been printed and early voting has already started. A recent poll from Christopher Newport University shows Jones leading Miyares by 7 points.</p>
