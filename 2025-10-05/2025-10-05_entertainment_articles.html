The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack returns to No. Five albums debut inside the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, led by Doja Cat's Vie at No. Also arriving in the region: Young Thug's UY SCUTI at No. 6, Mariah Carey's Here for It All at No. 7, Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving at No. Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. Of KPop Demon Hunters' 102,000 equivalent album units earned in the latest tracking week, SEA units comprise 84,000 (down 9%, equaling 117.48 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks; it holds at No. 2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 16,000 (up 56%; it rises 7-4 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 2,000 (down 13%).

The set's first-week sales were aided by the album's availability across eight vinyl variants (one signed), two CD editions (one signed), a deluxe CD boxed set (containing a signed CD and a branded T-shirt), standard and deluxe iTunes download editions, and a cassette. Vie was preceded by the Billboard Hot 100 hit “Jealous Type,” which debuted and peaked at No. 1 Man's Best Friend falls 4-5 with 57,000 equivalent album units (down 18%).

The artist also had a range of deluxe boxed sets available that contained a copy of the CD and branded clothing. UY SCUTI was preceded by the Hot 100 hit “Money on Money” (featuring Future), which debuted and peaked at No. Mariah Carey achieves her 19th top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as Here for It All bows at No. Carey becomes only the third woman with at least one new top 10-charted album in the 1990s, 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s, following Madonna and Shania Twain. Here for It All launches with 47,000 equivalent album units earned in its first week. Of that sum, album sales comprise a little more than 39,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise slightly more than 7,000 (equaling 9.53 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise less than 1,000. The album's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across four CD variants (one signed), four vinyl editions (one signed), two cassettes, and a deluxe digital download album with a bonus track. Here for It All was preceded by the single “Type Dangerous,” which reached No. 95 on the Hot 100 (marking Carey's 50th entry) and No. Ahead of them among women are only Barbra Streisand (34) and Madonna (23). English singer-songwriter Olivia Dean makes her Billboard 200 debut with her second studio effort, The Art of Loving, which arrives at No. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 32,000 (equaling 40.49 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks; it debuts at No. 8 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 11,000 (it debuts at No. 7 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for latest…: Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another had a fantastic hold in the sophomore session, dropping only 22% at the international box office. The Warner Bros title added $21.7M in 77 overseas markets this weekend to lift the international running cume to $58.9M with global passing the century mark to reach $101.7M through Sunday. Notable holds were in such markets as New Zealand (+7%), Germany (+5%), Chile (+2%), Denmark (+1%), Italy (-4%), Poland (-5%), Holland (-7%), Colombia (-13%), Belgium (-17%), UK (-19%), Mexico (-20%), Australia (-22%), France (-24%), Spain (-25%) and Brazil (-29%).

The IMAX running cume for overseas is now $5.4M. Up ahead, China will be the last market to open, on October 17. Meanwhile, Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl is forecast at $13M for the weekend in 54 offshore markets. This puts the estimated weekend global box office at $46M. The event “non-film” is only playing this weekend. We are hopeful for more clarity on overseas numbers tomorrow. Turning back to studio releases, New Line/Warner Bros' The Conjuring: Last Rites added an estimated $9.3M this weekend in 76 markets. 6 spot globally for 2025 so far, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle has now grossed $633M. Per Sony, that includes Japan and select other Asian markets. The latter added $10.2M this weekend, including $6.7M overseas from 62 offshore hubs. The Top 5 CR/Sony markets to date are: Mexico ($17.4M), Germany ($14.4M), France ($14.2M), India ($9.3M) and UK ($8.9M). And, in anticipation of James Cameron's next Na'vi movie, Disney re-released Avatar: The Way of Water to $6.8M overseas and $10M global. Avatar: Fire and Ash goes in December and there was a sneak peek on the current limited engagement for the latest title. This additional release overseas makes Avatar: The Way of Water the second highest grossing film of all time in Australia, behind only Avatar, and surpasses Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Additionally, in New Zealand, Avatar: The Way of Water is the first film to ever cross NZ$ 20M. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(There really isn't even room for guesswork about whether the government was involved with Kimmel's case, but we digress.) Trump makes some jabs about keeping an eye on the show to make sure it's not too mean to him and at Jost for not being at the Riyadh Comedy Festival (he wasn't invited, he mumbles from his frozen tableau). Mikey Day shows up as a dancing FCC head Brendan Carr, Trump asks ICE to keep an eye on cast member Marcello Hernandez and promises to keep scamming people, and then it's live from New York. (This morning, he posted on Truth Social, “It will be a big day with the Navy” and then, an hour later, he was railing against Fox News for being too “politically correct!”) While SNL has really leaned into this kind of fourth-wall-breaking set up for much of the second Trump administration, they don't seem to have bothered him as much as Alec Baldwin's impersonation did the first time around. In 2019, he threatened SNL and other late night shows with a FCC investigation. He's really committed to that strategy this time around, even if, so far, “hit both sides equally” Jimmy Fallon has gotten strangely more heat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five years after Alicia Witt last appeared in a Hallmark movie — 2020's “Christmas Tree Lane” — fans continue to ask her when and if she'll return to the network. On October 3, 2025, the singer and actress provided an update in the comment section of her latest social media post while promoting her upcoming holiday concert tour. Witt appeared in multiple Hallmark Christmas movies from 2014 to 2020, per IMDb. She has since navigated major personal hurdles, including fighting breast cancer and the tragic death of her parents. “I'm SO grateful for the movies i made for them,” Witt wrote, “especially since so many of you found my music this way ❤️ since the leadership at Hallmark changed over 5 years ago, i stopped getting offered movies there, along with some other ‘regulars. Witt continued, “and then i started getting a lot of work in feature films 🙂 you know what they say about god opening a window when a door closes 🌠 i have 4 theatrical movies coming out at this time – after having made Longlegs last year.” but please know it was never my choice to stop making them  🙃 hope to see you at one of the shows on my christmas tour! Hallmark Media has gone through multiple leadership changes since Witt was last on the network. In addition to navigating personnel changes at Hallmark, Witt was also sidelined for a while by some heavy personal hurdles. In December 2021, she quietly began treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, per People, deciding not to publicly disclose her diagnosis until she'd finished six rounds of chemotherapy and a unilateral mastectomy. Witt channeled some of her grief into her music, releasing an emotional song in March 2023 called “Witness”, which she described on social media at the time as “a deeply personal anthem about getting thru an unimaginably hard chapter – and coming out the other side, forever changed.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is embracing a new chapter after bringing her 19-year marriage to “American Idol” judge Keith Urban to an end. A source close to the actress told People that while the decision wasn't easy, Kidman is finding peace in focusing on family. Now that it's out, she's just focused on what's ahead and her girls.” As per People magazine, the Oscar winner filed for divorce in Nashville on September 30, citing irreconcilable differences and listing the same day as their official date of separation. “Nicole didn't want this,” an insider said. “She has been fighting to save the marriage.” Page Six reported that the “Moulin Rouge!” star received strong support from her sister, Antonia Kidman, and close family members. The two were spotted walking together in Nashville on October 1, marking Nicole's first public sighting since the divorce news became public. People reported that just days after filing for divorce, Urban returned to the stage for his High and Alive World Tour stop in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While performing “Heart Like a Hometown,” he kept a family photo featuring Kidman and their daughters in the slideshow that plays during the song — a quiet but emotional nod to his loved ones. Before launching into the song, Urban shared a personal story with the crowd about how his parents had supported his dream of pursuing music full-time. His bandmate Natalie Stovall rejoined him for the show after sitting out previous dates. Stovall's earlier absence had sparked speculation over Urban's connection to guitarist Maggie Baugh, who temporarily filled in during his Chicago performance. At that show, Urban ad-libbed, “I'll be your guitar player,” to Baugh while performing “The Fighter,” a song inspired by his romance with Kidman. “My husband Keith once asked, ‘How's your heart?' As she steps into a new chapter, Kidman is keeping that same spirit. Sources indicate that she remains focused on her daughters and moving forward with grace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny is the first Saturday Night Live guest officially booked on a season finale to then be booked on the following season's premiere. (I thought maybe Buck Henry or Steve Martin had managed this in the '70s as hosts; close, but no dice. Cast changes are nothing new for SNL—just a couple of years ago, there was a big post-COVID turnover—but with only 90 minutes of OK and familiar TV to go on, it's easy to focus on the weird on-paper push and pull of these particular changes. Like, for example, losing five cast members, which even with sadder departures can at least allow the ensemble to breathe a little more… only to hire five more featured players and keep the cast at a swollen 17. Or bringing in five new people without a single woman of color to make up for losing Ego Nwodim. Given all that, it makes sense to take the musical guest from last season's uninspired final stretch and make him your marquee name for the different-yet-same show in its premiere—and just to make it clear how cosmetic these changes are, kick things off with Colin Jost, a Trump sketch, a game show sketch, and a restaurant sketch. Later, Jost and Michael Che joked about how long the past nine months of Trump have felt well into their second decade doing the fake news on Weekend Update. It's sort of heartening, actually, that the show will go so all-in on a bilingual musician who performs largely in his first language of Spanish, even if there's a distinct sense that Lorne Michaels might erroneously think of the guy as his own special discovery. But that can be a fun exercise, especially when he seems so enthusiastic about bounding into live sketch comedy to play a would-be spontaneous sperm donor or hardcore KPop Demon Hunters fan. The problem is more that the Season 51 premiere also felt a bit like the show was taking Bad Bunny for granted as automatically delightful, a fixture who can elevate even pedestrian sketches about not knowing how to play Jeopardy! Just what the 2020s need: a new Timberlake ‘n Fallon duo. Still, at its best this episode had some back-to-basics fundamentals. It only featured one pretape—the funny if oddly overcrowded ad for ChatGPTio—and half a dozen live sketches, one of which was carried almost entirely by good old-fashioned sketch acting. Some material that might have been eye-rolling at the end of Season 50—Bowen Yang in elaborate makeup at the Update desk, Kenan mugging and wigging his way through a series of barely-there characters—was like seeing a bunch of old friends back at school. That's the show's eternal comfort and curse, isn't it? School isn't really supposed to last for half a century. Ashley Padilla is clearly very talented and exactly the kind of sketch-comedy pro who can help hold the show together during transitional or uncertain times. I've also sometimes felt that hardcore SNL fans are a little eager to anoint cast members the new so-and-so like that bit from Season 6 when Bill Murray hosted and tried to cheer up the dejected new cast. One of the best things about the sketch where Padilla played a stern school administrator who immediately pivots to awkwardly girlish flirtations once she meets a troubled student's handsome parent (Bad Bunny, naturally) is how immediately it felt like hers. (Sarah Sherman was only on Epstein's island for a layover!) sketch and the sperm donor sketch felt like they were about to take off into something weirder and funnier, and they really just left it at “you have to answer in the form of a question” and “donating sperm is kind of a weird idea, huh?”… which is to say they left both sketches in, oh, I don't know, 1988 maybe? I want to see her doing weird sketches with Dismukes and Yang. And while I used to find it a little cheesy when they'd get an old Update star to guest-anchor, yes, having someone who merely did Update for four years back at it would count as hugely refreshing at this point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift‘s special Life of a Showgirl album release event towered over the competition at the domestic box office — including films featuring two of the world's biggest stars, Dwayne Johnson and Leonardo DiCaprio — with an estimated weekend bounty of $33 million. The 89-minute big screen event is a mix of music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and a series of lyric videos for tracks on her new album. Taylor Swift's 'The Life of a Showgirl' Sells 2.7 Million Copies in First Day Release Taylor Swift Reveals 'The Life of a Showgirl' Acoustic Recordings in Limited CD Release Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl — which earned a coveted A+ CinemaScore, just as her history-making concert film Eras Tour did — easily came in No. She announced the Oct. 3-5 special event on Sept. 19 in a well-orchestrated social media post informing fans that advance tickets would go on sale that day at 12:12 local time for $12, in keeping with Swift's longtime relationship with numbers (Showgirl is her 12th studio album). However, consumers can expect to pay notably more than $12 for premium large-format screenings, which contributed 28 percent of the opening gross. In 2023, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour catapulted Swift to box office fame when it opened to a record-smashing $93.2 million domestically on its way to becoming the top-grossing concert film of all time with $261.6 million in global ticket sales. According to THR‘s review of Showgirl, “The 89-minute cinematic experience — neither visual album nor concert film, and not quite a documentary — is strictly for the diehards. But while there's something to be said for the communal experience of absorbing an album surrounded by dozens of like-minded fans, what's actually being served up on screen is more filler than killer.” Paul Thomas Anderson's critically acclaimed awards contender One Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, fell to second place in its sophomore outing as it crossed the $100 million mark globally. The movie is being closely scrutinized because of its $135 million net production budget, which is by far the most money Anderson has even been given. From filmmaker Benny Safdie, Smashing Machine came in third. The awards hopeful reunites Johnson with his Jungle Cruise co-star and good friend Emily Blunt, who played a key role in bringing Johnson and Safdie together. The movie is a radical departure for the actor, who is best known for anchoring big-budget action pics or broad, all-audience tentpoles. Swift's Showgirl isn't hurting Smashing Machine in terms of stealing away moviegoers, but it did swoop in and book a number of premium large-format screens that Smashing Machine had wanted. Insiders close to the Safdie's film say prerelease tracking was overly aggressive due to Johnson's star status, and that a $6 million start isn't uncommon during awards season. What's more important than a big opening weekend is sustaining momentum. While that's certainly true, many moviegoers don't seem to be connecting with Smashing Machine thus far, based on the worrisome B- CinemaScore (for an adult drama, that's like receiving a C). Box office pundits note that there could be consumer confusion since Johnson's fans aren't used to seeing him in roles like this. And in 2019, the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, starring Adam Sandler, became both an awards darling and a box office success despite receiving a C+ CinemaScore. One difference between Smashing Machine and those two films: A24 opened The Whale and Uncut Gems in only a handful of theaters in early December before expanding the two titles nationwide over Christmas (The Whale never played in more than 1,700 or so cinemas). Opening Smashing Machine in 3,345 locations is a far more aggressive move, although sources say A24 remains confident that the film will find its stride as word of mouth grows and becomes more positive. “The film presents a bold and deeply personal portrait of legendary MMA pioneer Mark Kerr and marks a dramatic turn from Johnson unlike anything he has done before,” A24 said in its Sunday box office note. “Matched by a powerhouse performance from the incomparable Emily Blunt, The Smashing Machine stands as a creative achievement that will resonate far beyond opening weekend.” IFC's Good Boy, the new drama-dark-comedy-thriller by Corpus Christi helmer Jan Komasa, didn't fare so well despite its provocative plotline. Among holdovers, Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie, from DreamWorks Animation/Universal, tumbled 62 percent in its second weekend to $5.2 million from 3,507 locations for a domestic tally of $21.6 million. Japanese box office sensation Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle placed sixth domestically with $3.5 million as it moved up the list of the year's top 10 grossing films to No. 6 after finishing Sunday with an estimated $633 million in worldwide ticket sales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC's Saturday Night Live thrives on skewering pop culture, so it was only natural for the show's first episode since May to acknowledge one of the biggest phenomena to emerge during its summer hiatus, Netflix's animated hit KPop Demon Hunters. The Season 51 premiere of SNL, hosted by Bad Bunny, featured a KPop Demon Hunters-themed skit about four friends (Bad Bunny, Mikey Day, Sarah Sherman, Chloe Fineman) reconnecting after a long time. While the others talk about their excitement over the new Paul Thomas Anderson movie One Battle After Another and Guillermo del Toro's upcoming Frankenstein, Bad Bunny's Thomas admits he likes KPop Demon Hunters. He has visions of Huntr/x's Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami performing. His friends don't take him seriously until Bowen Yang appears dressed as demon Jinu from the movie and demands their souls. He succeeds with Sherman's character who turns demonic. Amid panic and horror, Thomas summons Huntr/x for help. The sketch ends with Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami coming out to perform a portion from the film's biggest hit, “Golden.” KPop Demon Hunters has ruled pop culture since its June release, breaking Netflix viewership records with 325.1 million views to date, getting a box office-winning two-day sing-along theatrical run and ruling the music charts. Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami's surprise SNL appearance precedes their first announced televised appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Tuesday, October 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s season 51 premiere kicked off with Donald Trump and his Federal Communications Commission attack dog warning cast members not to go too far with their jokes—or face the consequences. Trump (James Austin Johnson) began by interrupting Secretary of Defense and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth (Colin Jost) instructing high-ranking members of the military on some new rules. Just hot, shredded, hairless men who are definitely not gay,” Hegseth said. We are facing the greatest threat to freedom and democracy the world has ever known, and we all know what that threat is.” “Late night TV!” Trump answered, referring to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's pressure last month on ABC and parent company Disney over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. I know late night TV like the back of my hands; not looking great right now!” he said, revealing the all-too common smear of non-matching makeup on the back of his right hand. We love the Saudis because they like to ‘saw these' journalists in half,” Trump joked, amid Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle and other comedians receiving criticism for taking money to perform in a nation with a dismal human rights record. Trump then addressed another big development since the season 50 finale in May: the contents of a creepy 2003 birthday letter to eventual sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that The Wall Street Journal reported was from Trump, but which he (dubiously) denies writing. “All right, Colin, those Spirit Airlines jokes aren't going to write themselves. “Oh, and Colin: ‘May every day be another wonderful secret.' Should have called it at 50, right?” Trump continued. “It's so sad to see something get old and confused yet still demand constant attention. “It's crazy that you think I care,” Trump replied.

Earlier in the week, Lewandowski spoke to Johnson as well. He told the podcaster when asked if ICE would be at the big game, “There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said. “There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,” Bad Bunny said.

Swift dropped four new CD variants of her latest album, each featuring two acoustic tracks not found on the standard version of Showgirl. Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Honored by Living Legends Foundation: 'We're Just Two Guys Who Like to Make Music' Taylor Swift Steals the Spotlight as 'Release Party of a Showgirl' Hits No. (Those who made it to a screening of The Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters this weekend will recognize the imagery.) So I went back into the studio with Max and Shellback to record acoustic/unplugged versions of a few of the Showgirl songs with brand new vocals and production! Cannot WAIT for you to hear,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post promoting the CDs. As Billboard revealed earlier on Saturday, initial first-day sales reports from data tracking firm Luminate say Swift sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the The Life of a Showgirl album available on its first day of release, Oct. 3. Only Adele has tracked a larger sales week since then, with 3.378 million copies of 25 sold within the first week of its release in 2015.
