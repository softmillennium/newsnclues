McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

Hamilton: ‘At then end I was catching Kimi and then the brakes gave up'

He didn't win the race. He didn't even make the podium. But he rightfully got your vote after an evening of never-say-die motor racing...

He may be the most experienced man on the grid, but it's no secret how much Fernando Alonso still relishes his racing. Nowhere was that clearer than on the streets of Singapore, where a typically feisty drive from the Spaniard saw him convert 10th on the grid into seventh at the flag - despite a botched pit stop that saw his Aston Martin stationary for over nine seconds. Here's how the voting broke down…

Fernando Alonso - 22.5%
George Russell - 16.4%
Max Verstappen - 14.5%
Lando Norris - 8.7%
Lewis Hamilton - 7.6%

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar Piastri admitted that he was surprised to see the Mercedes of George Russell outpace McLaren to take pole position in Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with the Australian having to settle for third while team mate Lando Norris was fifth on a day where he said the squad “weren't quick enough”. Piastri, meanwhile, was nearly four-tenths off Russell's time in third. I think there was a little bit left in it but not enough for pole. “Ultimately I thought it was a pretty good session. It's just been a pretty good weekend – very solid, no major hiccups or anything like that. I think the start of Qualifying we seemed pretty good, and then everyone else just seemed to find a lot of time and we didn't really. The tyres have been pretty tricky to switch on. “I think a few things changed from yesterday to today with the track and everyone's just been pretty close, and anyone that nails it has been towards the front. The Mercedes are much, much faster, and I'm sure between Oscar's and my lap is a tenth in it or something, or maybe a little bit more, but not the four that that we need or the three and a half that we need. In terms of whether having a better feeling in the car gives him an additional sense of confidence for Sunday's race, Norris answered: “Not really. This track's kind of where you qualify is more than likely where you're going to finish, but there are still chances so we'll have to wait and see.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Williams received some bad news after Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with both Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz being disqualified. Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have both been disqualified from Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix due to technical breaches on their Williams cars. Albon and Sainz placed 12th and 13th in Saturday night's session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit but will lose those results after the team failed post-Qualifying checks. “The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked on car numbers 23 (Albon) and 55 (Sainz),” read a note from FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer. As is standard procedure with such a scenario, the stewards later confirmed that Albon and Sainz had been disqualified from Qualifying. “The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked. “Accordingly, the standard penalty applicable to technical infringements is imposed.” Following the confirmation of the disqualification, Williams Team Principal James Vowles issued a statement saying: "During FIA scrutineering after Qualifying, the rear wings on both our cars failed DRS slot gap checks. As a result, Alex and Carlos have been disqualified from Qualifying for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix. At no point were we seeking a performance advantage and the rear wings had passed our own checks earlier in the day, but there is only one measurement that matters and we fully accept the FIA ruling. "We have a car capable of scoring points here this weekend and will do everything we can to fight from the back of the grid tomorrow, and will immediately review our processes to make sure this doesn't happen again."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Max Verstappen had to settle for second between George Russell and Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix. Max Verstappen shared mixed feelings after a hard-fought run to second position in Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix, having “struggled a lot” behind the wheel of his Red Bull throughout the race. Red Bull headed to the high-downforce Marina Bay Street Circuit aiming to validate the apparent progress they have made with their RB21, following back-to-back wins for Verstappen in low-downforce conditions at Monza and Baku. Verstappen was heard complaining about shift problems in particular, at one stage describing his car as “undriveable” after locking up and narrowly avoiding the barriers at Turn 14, but he survived to come home between George Russell's Mercedes and Lando Norris' McLaren. “It was a bit more difficult than I would have hoped for, to be honest,” Verstappen reflected afterwards. “The car was also not where I wanted it to be, unfortunately. A few things of course to learn from that, I think, from some decisions that we made throughout the weekend in terms of the set-up. Nonetheless, Verstappen added: “Even if the balance would have been perfect, I think second was still the best possible, because you can't pass around here. For me, that first stint was all about just managing to go long enough.” As for how much encouragement can be taken from the weekend, given that he finished ahead of both McLaren drivers once again despite the higher downforce track characteristics, Verstappen maintained a cautious tone. Verstappen's latest result has seen him make further progress in the Drivers' Championship, moving to within 41 points of Norris and 63 points of championship leader Oscar Piastri.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a dramatic start to the Singapore Grand Prix, with McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri banging wheels. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have shared their initial reactions after dramatically banging wheels on the first lap of Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix. While Mercedes' George Russell and Red Bull's Max Verstappen maintained P1 and P2 through the opening sequence of corners, there was drama behind when a fast-starting Norris boldly attacked Piastri. Norris went so deep at Turn 3 that he tagged the back of Verstappen's car, before making contact with Piastri's sister McLaren and emerging in third position – much to his team mate's frustration. “Yeah, I mean that wasn't very teamlike, but sure,” Piastri commented over the radio, before adding: “So, are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way?” Obviously there was contact, which is never ideal, but I'll go and have a look at the replays.” “I'm obviously very proud of the whole team,” added Piastri. “I gave it my all today,” added Norris, having just fallen short of overhauling Verstappen for second. “I got close, a few chances where we were side-by-side, and some good little bits of battling, but it's just too difficult to overtake. F1 will now roll on to Austin for the United States Grand Prix, with Piastri leading Norris by a reduced margin of 22 points in the Drivers' Championship, and Verstappen cutting his deficit to 63 points.</p>
