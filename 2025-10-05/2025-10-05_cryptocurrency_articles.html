                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reignited investor enthusiasm, pulling in more than $4.5 billion in net inflows last week. The strong reversal ended a brief period of outflows and set the tone for October — a month traders often call “Uptober” for its history of bullish crypto performance. Data from SoSo Value shows Bitcoin ETFs brought in roughly $3.2 billion in net inflows, marking their second-largest weekly total on record, just behind November 2024's $3.37 billion peak. During the trading period, ETF volumes surged to about $26 billion. The sharp increase signaled stronger investor participation and renewed confidence that an accumulation phase may be underway. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated inflows with $1.78 billion, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $692 million. The collective surge reflects growing institutional conviction and renewed retail interest in gaining Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. This pattern suggests institutional portfolios are rotating back into digital assets, seeking to capture early upside potential as macro sentiment stabilizes. That renewed optimism helped propel Bitcoin to a fresh all-time high above $125,000. It reinforced the belief that ETF-driven demand is doing more than fueling short-term speculation and may be establishing a base for a new market cycle. "Behind the scenes, billions of dollars in ETF inflows and a quiet shift in institutional behavior suggest that this breakout may have deeper roots. Even regulators are adding fuel to the fire, with new tax guidance that caught corporate treasuries off guard," it added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano and Ripple are quietly securing inflows, but the real chatter is around emerging projects with unique mechanics. That spotlight is now pointing at MoonBull ($MOBU), the meme-born token turning conviction into a full-scale ecosystem. MoonBull isn't here just to entertain—it's built with structure and sustainability. Running on Ethereum, it combines humor with serious tokenomics like auto-liquidity, burns, reflections, and a staggering 95% APY staking system. While Solana and Cardano continue pushing their chains' performance, $MOBU is making presale rounds with undeniable traction, stacking community support and locking in long-term relevance. Its 23 scarcity-driven presale stages are already pulling in participants who see it as more than hype. This balance of branding and mechanics is why MoonBull is quickly climbing into the conversation as one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4 closes. Tokenomics drive value back into the ecosystem through liquidity injections, holder rewards, and regular burns. By design, MoonBull is making scarcity part of its identity. This is what positions $MOBU as one of the best altcoins to buy in October 2025. The presale rollout is ambitious, spanning 23 stages that steadily increase scarcity and reward conviction. With locked liquidity and a full audit backing it, MoonBull's foundation looks strong. For anyone debating the best crypto to buy now, MoonBull offers something clear: it merges meme culture with real mechanics that reward holders while stabilizing long-term growth. For those seeking the best altcoins to buy, Moonbull presale delivers clear numbers. Over $200K has been raised, and more than 700 holders are already backing the project. A $5,000 entry today secures 96.7 million tokens, worth $595,975 when listing hits. Solana continues to be a name on everyone's lips in October 2025, and for good reason. Known for lightning-fast transactions and low fees, the chain has put downtime concerns behind it. NFT marketplaces and gaming projects are flowing onto Solana like traffic on a busy highway. In a month full of contenders, Solana's high-performance edge ensures it is not just surviving but thriving. That momentum makes it a natural pick for Q4's best altcoins to buy list. Beyond speed, Solana's ecosystem expansion is adding layers of confidence. Developers continue building decentralized finance platforms, gaming environments, and NFT ecosystems on its chain. This growth brings liquidity and community backing, fueling the market's faith in Solana as a top player. While others rely on narratives, Solana delivers real utility with proven adoption. Its ability to handle massive activity while keeping fees negligible makes it an appealing buy in October. BullZilla is pulling eyeballs this October with meme-fueled branding that's impossible to ignore. But it's not just loud visuals or community jokes making noise. Meme coins usually flame out fast, but BullZilla has avoided the dustbin by giving communities a token they actually want to hold. Its growing governance structure and clear community engagement strategy show this project wants longevity. Memes pull people in, but functional mechanics and tokenomics keep them around. The mix of humor and conviction makes this project a genuine outlier. For traders looking to balance meme culture with durability, BullZilla is proving itself as one of October's most attention-grabbing opportunities. La Culex has stepped into the spotlight with a unique flair that captures what meme coin culture is all about. Its rise is fueled by strong community conversations, playful branding, and a sense of shared identity that keeps participants engaged. In a market where visibility and excitement are everything, La Culex is quickly proving why many are calling it a top meme coin worth keeping an eye on this year. With growing recognition and energy, La Culex is making its mark as a top meme coin that could hold strong appeal in the months ahead. Cardano has always prided itself on a methodical approach, and that strategy is paying dividends in October 2025. Its DeFi ecosystem is finally hitting critical momentum, with smart contracts showing increased adoption. DeFi traction and interoperability growth are showing Cardano's strategy is gaining substance. Its ability to deliver low fees, high security, and reliable scalability is why Cardano remains a pillar project. It stands out in October as one of the best altcoins to buy. The October spotlight is also shining on Cardano's push toward interoperability. Projects are leveraging Cardano's security-first model to deploy dApps that benefit from reliable performance. Developers value its stability, and communities are embracing it as a safe hub for innovation. While some altcoins chase fast, flashy growth, Cardano's consistent, deliberate rise proves reliability matters in crypto. That balance of security, scalability, and adoption ensures Cardano's place in October's conversation, making it a pick with both immediate and long-term appeal for participants in the market. MoonBull ($MOBU) combines meme culture with serious mechanics, offering scarcity, staking, governance, and liquidity protections that set it apart. BullZilla has proven itself as the best meme coin contender, while Cardano delivers on reliability and security. MoonBull's unique presale features and launch protections solidify its position as not only a standout but also the best crypto to buy now. MoonBull is the coin participants will look back on as their second chance for breakout-level gains. Its staking program, referral system, and governance rollout ensure the project is shaping up to be more than hype. These names represent different strengths, but MoonBull dominates October's spotlight. The standout picks are MoonBull, Solana, BullZilla, and Cardano, each showing strength in Q4's market momentum. Yes, the MoonBull presale is open in October 2025, running through its 23 scarcity-driven stages with strong community demand. Cardano's DeFi traction and reliable scalability are proving it to be a secure, long-term project worth holding. MoonBull is leading discussions, and its structured presale suggests it could be one of the breakout tokens this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, the network unveiled plans to build a shared ledger platform that will let banks settle transactions involving stablecoins and tokenized assets across multiple blockchains. "The big development is SWIFT's changing business model to cope with blockchain disintermediation," said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. Acheson argued the new platform could act as a "switching" layer for digital currencies and tokenized assets, bridging otherwise siloed systems. However, she questioned whether SWIFT is still essential in a world of programmable money. Those connections could give SWIFT an edge as banks look for a path into the blockchain economy. SWIFT said over 30 financial institutions are already engaged with the project. O'Sullivan expects more to follow as demand and regulatory clarity increase. "Adoption, interoperability and regulatory alignment will take time," he said. "However, SWIFT is clearly positioning itself to play a meaningful role in shaping the evolving stablecoin and tokenised asset ecosystem." SWIFT's platform could also "materially lower" technical barriers and integration costs for financial institutions that want to embed stablecoins into their operations, said David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase. "Existing private stablecoins, CBDCs and regional solutions may continue to operate in parallel,” he said. Duong described SWIFT's initiative as a "watershed moment" for both crypto and traditional finance, but reminded that it has been years in the making. Developing its own shared ledger platform appears to be the next stage in that long-running transition, Duong said. Still, not everyone may see SWIFT as a neutral player. "It's not clear that its offering would stop the payment systems fragmentation, given global distrust following SWIFT's role in enforcing U.S. and EU sanctions,” she argued. Even so, SWIFT's decision underscores that the lines between traditional and blockchain finance are increasingly getting intertwined and the world's largest financial institutions are – slowly, then suddenly – taking initiative to stay relevant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technology mogul Jack Dorsey has long championed decentralized technologies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), suggesting their application in areas like artificial intelligence and social media. Speaking at the Africa Bitcoin Conference in December 2024, Dorsey expressed concerns about the growing power and influence of social media platforms, stating that users are unknowingly working for these companies “for free” every time they interact with posts. “Every time you hit the heart, every time you like a post, every time you retweet something, that's a signal to an algorithm which then takes that in a bunch of other variables and uses that as a way to push into someone else's feed,” Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, now X, said. “We need to own that protocol layer,” Dorsey, the CEO of Bitcoin-focused company Block Inc. (NYSE:XYZ), said. He warned that people act as the “product” for these centralized models and “will be replaced” and rendered irrelevant whenever the companies desire. In the same breath, Dorsey hailed Bitcoin's rise as a permissionless technology, predicting that it would grow even stronger in the future. Bitcoin's origins may have been rooted in decentralization, but its rapid adoption by Wall Street in the form of exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrency treasury companies, such as Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), could be steering it toward heavier influence from major institutions. Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $2.97, up 3.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock exhibited a very high growth score — a measure of the stock's combined historical expansion in earnings and revenue across multiple periods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, the next evolution of digital board games can be witnessed through Web3 and blockchain experiments. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. 100% of the first bet amount back + Rakeback up to 30% + 100 Freespins The transition from physical boards to digital versions is hardly new. While this version keeps the Monopoly branding, it transforms the mechanics into a casual, event-powered loop designed for mobile engagement. Players move solo around the board, unlock themed mini-events, and progress through monetized systems rather than the hours-long head-to-head sessions you might think of. Hasbro will also be modernizing the original board game itself. A version of the game called Monopoly App Banking removes the need for a human banker, converting the position to an app  to mitigate cheating and accelerate play. Scythe: Digital Edition streamlines  a popular but complex board game, automating the game's resource management so you can focus on the play. Carcassonne – Tiles & Tactics  digitizes the tile-laying classic, offering online multiplayer and expansions at the tap of a button. The key shift here is convenience and scale. Digital adaptations speed up play, reduce arguments, and allow asynchronous matches to take place across the world. These are physical board games enhanced with apps, sensors, or digital overlays, keeping the tactile joy of tokens while adding computational power. An experimental example is DungeonMaker , a hybrid board game (HBG) that projects board layouts onto an actual surface, tracks physical tokens, and even uses fabrication to damage or modify game pieces as needed. Commercially, devices like the Infinity Game Table  by Arcade1Up are taking off. It's a touchscreen coffee table loaded with digital board games like Monopoly or Scrabble, hence the infinity moniker. The product includes Wi-Fi for online play, zoomable boards, and even haptic feedback. These hybrid approaches help solve the problem of “bookkeeping drag,” or the downtime during times of management, such as when the Monopoly banker has to count and hand out money. Companion apps now automate dice rolls, spawn enemies, and can even track inventory. No more dealing with manual trading in Catan. This convergence suggests a near-future where board gaming is neither purely physical nor purely digital, per se, but a seamless blend of both. Now, the boldest experiments are happening on Web3 technology, where mechanics collide with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), token economies, and smart contracts. In these systems, property cards, dice rolls, or even the board itself can be tokenized, and tokenization means players can trade or even monetize their holdings. It's also important to note a player's familiarity with these classic games. It's much easier to learn a new technology through the lens of something you're used to, such as a tokenized chess piece or Monopoly property. While blockchain adds new layers and profit potential, it also introduces tension: Board games have endured for millennia because they strike a balance between strategy, luck, and social connection. to hybrid game tables and blockchain-based experiences, these classics are pushing their previous boundaries. If the Web3 industry finds the right balance, preserving fun while layering in technology, classics like Monopoly could thrive in formats our ancestors never imagined. If not, they risk becoming cautionary tales of over-monetization. Board games have survived for over 5,000 years because they connect people through play. If developers can balance tradition with innovation, preserving fun while unlocking digital scale, classics like Monopoly and Chess could thrive in entirely new forms. If players stake crypto or trade NFTs with real value, regulators may categorize the games as online gambling, which can bring strict licensing requirements. What role might AI play in the evolution of board games? AI could act as an adaptive opponent, referee, or even a dungeon master, providing storylines and challenges that evolve dynamically. Are physical board games at risk of becoming obsolete? Physical play taps into nostalgia, tactility, and face-to-face interaction, which digital formats can't fully replace. A Monopoly property NFT could one day be usable in another blockchain-based game. In practice, interoperability is rare and requires industry-wide standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current market dynamics are setting the stage for potentially explosive rallies across various altcoins, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory towards an ambitious $150,000 valuation. This period is characterized by both established altcoins like Avalanche and Litecoin making significant developmental strides and newer protocols like PayDax Protocol entering the scene with ambitious offerings. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged past $4.21 trillion as of October 2025, with October, or "Uptober," living up to its historical reputation by promising an average return of 21%. While Bitcoin's near-ATH surge to $124,000 on October 4th provided a strong foundation, the decreasing Bitcoin dominance is the clearest indicator of capital flowing into altcoins. Major altcoins historically maintain a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, typically in the 0.7-0.9 range. Should Bitcoin indeed climb towards the predicted $150,000 mark, this correlation suggests a cascading rally across the altcoin sector, with many poised for significant percentage gains. Avalanche (AVAX) is experiencing a period of intense institutional interest and surging developer activity. Its smart contracts have tripled year-over-year to over 44 million, coinciding with a record-breaking $2.2 billion in DEX volume over three days in early October. The Total Value Locked (TVL) on Avalanche doubled to $2.1 billion since April 2025, fueled by the Octane upgrade, VanEck's $100 million ecosystem fund, and growing gaming adoption. Furthermore, Avalanche Treasury Co. announced a definitive business combination agreement with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: MLAC) valued at over $675 million, aiming to create a public and integrated financial ecosystem for AVAX and acquire $1 billion in AVAX. Litecoin (LTC), often dubbed "digital silver," is navigating regulatory waters amidst a U.S. government shutdown, yet its price holds firm near $120. Despite the SEC missing its October 4th deadline for Canary Capital's spot Litecoin ETF due to bureaucratic gridlock, approval odds remain high (90% per Bloomberg) once the shutdown concludes. The anticipated approval of multiple Litecoin spot ETFs in October and the launch of a Litecoin Ecosystem Fund in Q4 2025 are significant catalysts for its price action. PayDax Protocol (PAYDAX) is a relatively new entrant generating considerable buzz with its ongoing token presale, which analysts are touting as a "100x opportunity." The protocol aims to revolutionize decentralized finance by re-engineering lending, borrowing, and insurance on Ethereum. PayDax allows users to borrow stablecoins against various collateral, including Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, gold, or luxury watches, offering high loan-to-value ratios (up to 97%). The project's emphasis on transparency, with KYC-audited team members, smart contracts audited by Assure DeFi, and partnerships with Chainlink Oracles, Sotheby's, and Brinks, aims to instill confidence. Currently, its presale is live at $0.015, positioning it as a high-potential, albeit higher-risk, investment in the evolving DeFi landscape. While it officially transitioned to its "Open Network" phase in February 2025, allowing limited trading, the full Mainnet launch (Phase 4) is contingent on widespread KYC verification for 15 million users and substantial dApp expansion, which is anticipated in the second half of 2025. Over 12 million Pioneers have been verified, and the introduction of AI-driven "Fast Track KYC" on September 18th aims to accelerate this process. Despite over 150 dApps launching on the Pi Mainnet and a 2025 Hackathon Finale set for October 15th, Pi Coin crashed nearly 48% in September to a new all-time low of $0.184. As of October 2025, it trades around $0.26, down 24% in the past month, amidst a broader market rally. The rising number of Pi tokens on centralized exchanges (over 445 million) and an upcoming unlock of over 110 million tokens in October could exert further selling pressure. The Global GCV Movement's conference on October 19th, advocating for a symbolic valuation of $314,159 per PI, highlights community divisions and speculative fervor, but the token's immediate future remains uncertain. The decreasing Bitcoin dominance is seen as a healthy sign of market maturity, indicating that investors are diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond the top two cryptocurrencies. The rebranding of AgriFORCE to AVAX One and the business combination with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. have generated considerable excitement, viewed as strong validation of Avalanche's ecosystem. The anticipation of SEC-approved AVAX ETFs in October is a hot topic, with many believing it will unlock massive institutional demand and significantly boost AVAX's price. Developers and users are also celebrating the network's record-breaking DEX volume and the continued growth of its smart contract activity, reinforcing confidence in its technological advancements. The high probability of eventual ETF approval, coupled with its breakout from a multi-year downtrend, has reignited enthusiasm. Discussions often revolve around Litecoin's historical significance and its potential to mirror past bull runs. Crypto influencers are highlighting LTC's strong fundamentals and its role as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. The transparency of its KYC-audited team and audited smart contracts is a key talking point, aiming to build trust in a space often plagued by rug pulls and unaudited projects. In stark contrast, the Pi Coin community is experiencing a mix of anticipation and frustration. Discussions often oscillate between fervent belief in its future potential (e.g., the Global GCV Movement's $314,159 valuation advocacy) and concerns over its practical utility and market viability. The ongoing KYC verification process and the upcoming token unlocks are critical points of discussion, with some users expressing worry about potential selling pressure, while others remain optimistic about the project's long-term vision once all technical hurdles are cleared. This scenario would likely trigger a further rotation of capital from BTC into ETH and then into smaller-cap altcoins, leading to substantial percentage gains across the board. The "Altcoin Season" index, currently at 67, suggests this trend is well underway. The increasing institutional interest, evidenced by major companies like AgriFORCE (AVAX One) and Avalanche Treasury Co. making significant moves into the space, signals a maturing market. The potential approval of various spot ETFs for altcoins like Avalanche and Litecoin could unlock unprecedented levels of institutional capital, fundamentally altering market dynamics and liquidity. Strategic considerations for projects involve focusing on robust technology, clear regulatory compliance, and fostering strong community engagement. Investors should remain vigilant, diversifying portfolios while carefully assessing the risk-reward profiles of newer projects like PayDax Protocol and established ones like Avalanche and Litecoin. Possible scenarios include a sustained bull run through Q4 2025, driven by Bitcoin's performance and increasing altcoin adoption, leading to new all-time highs for many assets. Alternatively, unforeseen macroeconomic headwinds or regulatory crackdowns could introduce volatility, causing temporary pullbacks. The continued expansion of layer-2 solutions, advancements in scalability, and the integration of real-world assets into blockchain ecosystems will be crucial developments to monitor. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, the current market dynamics present a compelling landscape of opportunity. While the prospect of Bitcoin hitting $150,000 is a powerful psychological and financial catalyst, it's the individual narratives and fundamental developments of altcoins that will determine their long-term success. Avalanche (AVAX) stands out with robust institutional backing, surging developer activity, and the strong potential for SEC-approved ETFs, making it a key asset to watch for significant upside. PayDax Protocol (PAYDAX) represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity within the DeFi space, promising innovative lending solutions and attractive yields, but requiring thorough due diligence. This period could mark a pivotal step towards broader crypto adoption, but investors must remain informed, strategic, and aware of the inherent volatility and risks associated with digital assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) is no stranger to turbulence in the crypto waters, and right now, it finds itself amidst a fierce battle between whale maneuvers and institutional heft. As market sentiment shifts, discerning the factors steering these colossal players becomes essential for anyone hoping to navigate the choppy tides of cryptocurrency trading. When we talk about the large holders of Ethereum, colloquially known as whales, their recent actions have sent ripples across the market. Between September 25 and September 27, 2025, an astounding 431,018 ETH, approximating a whopping $1.73 billion, was transferred from prominent exchanges like Kraken and Galaxy Digital into the cryptic embrace of 16 different wallets. Yet, amidst the optimistic maneuvers of whale accumulation looms a significant selling pressure that cannot be dismissed. A notable player, Trend Research, has offloaded over 102,000 ETH, raising eyebrows about market stability's fragility. Surprisingly, Ethereum's resilience remains impressive, with institutional buyers managing to uphold its price above the $4,590 mark, even as heavy sell-offs unfolded. Diving deeper into the nuances of trading volume, Ethereum's recent price movements have shown a measured pace, hovering around $4,590 with a slight uptick in daily activity. Many institutional investors continue to harbor faith in Ethereum's long-term potential, a sentiment echoed by a notable boost in market capitalization, which now flirts with $547.6 billion. Looking ahead, Ethereum grapples with pivotal resistance points that could dictate its fate. The $3,700 support level appears tenuous; an infringement could incite a wave of forced liquidations exacerbating downward trends. Yet, the present lowest exchange reserves in nearly ten years showcase significant accumulation, reflecting a diminished supply that offers some cushioning against potential declines. This has reignited conversations about Ethereum's viability as a store of value. Analysts caution that this influx, amplified by staking rewards, could dilute ETH's value proposition significantly and slow down its long-term appreciation. As the interplay of institutional movements and whale behaviors unfolds, the market is caught in a delicate balancing act between buying pressures and liquidity needs. In conclusion, the landscape surrounding Ethereum's trading is anything but simple; it demands a keen understanding of both institutional and retail dynamics. The significant tension between whale accumulation and systematic selling presents an engaging narrative that deserves attention. As the saga of Ethereum unfolds, adaptability will be crucial for those eager to seize the opportunities presented by this volatile market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Onchain dynamics point to a renewed accumulation phase that may see Bitcoin's price surpass $150,000 before the end of 2025, market analysts told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin (BTC) set a new all-time high above $125,700, and its market capitalization briefly crossed the $2.5 trillion milestone for the first time in crypto history, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Sunday. In the past, similar conditions have led to “major price milestones,” according to Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at digital asset banking group Sygnum Bank. The US government shutdown has “renewed discussion around Bitcoin's store-of-value role, as political dysfunction underscores interest in decentralised assets,” Dori told Cointelegraph. “Crypto markets could benefit from a shutdown resolution if it reduces uncertainty and pushes the Fed toward a more dovish stance,” Kennis added. While some analysts saw the government shutdown as a signal of a potential crypto market bottom, Kennis said it's “premature to call this a local market bottom,” as confirmation would require “multi-week stability above key support levels.” Related: Bitcoin ETFs kickstart ‘Uptober' with $3.2B in second-best week on record “Market data indicates the current price action may be linked to an accumulation phase,” said Sygnym Bank's Dori. Periods of “cooling speculative activity and steadier positioning” have historically preceded significant Bitcoin rallies, he added.

Slowing speculative activity may attract more attention to Bitcoin, reinforcing analyst predictions of a breakout to $150,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 if BTC can sustain its momentum above the key $120,000 psychological level, Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph at Token2049.

XRP's latest slip under $3 is a reminder that even old giants face limits. Even though XRP remains a familiar name, its challenges underline the limits of established coins when it comes to sharp price moves. By comparison, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is coming in with a burst of energy, and its presale success shows clear demand. Between its daily reward model, planned buybacks, and all-in-one trading app, $BFX has the ingredients to become one of the cycle's defining projects. XRP has long been known as a token built for cross-border payments. The token once touched all-time highs that fueled hopes of a breakout. But since then, it has often struggled to maintain momentum. Even now, with markets heating up again and the SEC case officially closed, XRP finds it hard to build a steady climb. Its large market size makes big moves harder to achieve. When a coin is already well established, doubling or tripling in price requires huge inflows of capital. This is why some traders are starting to look elsewhere for stronger upside potential. Don't wait, this offer ends on October 3rd at 2PM UTC. Unlike many tokens that live only on speculation, $BFX is directly tied to a working trading platform. The project is building a crypto super app, where users can trade not only digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, and CFDs. Everything happens inside one Web3 platform, which makes it simpler for traders to move between different asset classes. What truly sets $BFX apart is its profit-sharing model. Half of all trading fees from the platform flow back to token holders. Rewards are paid daily in both BFX and USDT, creating a steady stream of income for those who stake their tokens. $BFX is also offering unique benefits to early participants. For anyone looking to connect crypto with everyday spending, this is a clear step forward. The EXTRA30 bonus code offers presale participants an additional 30% worth of $BFX tokens as a gratitude for their purchase. It has been designed as a limited-time reward for early supporters, ensuring they receive extra value while securing their position in the BlockchainFX presale. That means early buyers could already see a 2x upside before the token even launches on major exchanges. Those who join early can pick up daily staking rewards, unlock trading credits, and even claim exclusive NFTs linked to founder tiers. These perks are limited to the presale, which makes acting early more appealing. Additional allocations are reserved for liquidity, exchange listings, and development, with strict measures in place to support stability. With buybacks and burns built into the system, the supply is expected to tighten over time, adding another layer of strength for holders. The contrast between XRP and $BFX is easy to see. XRP has history, a strong brand, and real-world use cases. The mix of a presale, daily staking payouts, and a platform that covers several markets makes it attractive to traders looking for real use and growth potential. In a bull market where investors chase both excitement and returns, $BFX holds clear advantages. Once connected to the presale site, they can choose a payment method including ETH, BTC, BNB, SOL, USDT, or even card payments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many market participants have built long positions on euro-denominated assets, expecting a positive outcome from the German stimulus plan and Rearm Europe projects. However, betting on a stronger euro may be optimistic considering the poor track record of these government plans, the rising fiscal challenges of France and other nations, the elevated debt and enormous unfunded liabilities, as well as the imminent implementation of a central bank digital currency. However, European banks are rightly concerned, as a central bank digital currency poses significant privacy risks as well as a grave erosion of the capacity of the banking sector to lend and perform adequately. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be a dangerous tool for their potential risks to privacy, financial stability, and the concentration of monetary power. A CBDC is not the same as electronic money. A digital euro would give unprecedented surveillance capabilities to the central bank. Unlike current electronic payments, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) gives monetary authorities full and direct access to every transaction and savings account, eliminating financial privacy for citizens. This could allow for monitoring, controlling, or even penalising financial behaviours that central authorities may consider undesirable. Bypassing commercial banks and credit mechanisms allows central banks to instantly increase the money supply and finance government spending, eroding traditional budget controls. The main arguments in favour of a digital euro, such as efficiency and enhanced monetary policy transmission, do not withstand scrutiny. If those were the real objectives, policymakers would encourage more decentralisation and competition instead of more central planning. The goal is more state control and rapid monetary financing of government spending, not real improvements for consumers or savers. They cover software development, security, and fraud management. The technology providers will help design and test several technical requirements, such as real-time fraud monitoring and offline use. None of these elements are reducing the widespread concern about privacy, control and erosion of the credit mechanisms as they exist. European commercial banks are distressed that a digital euro could hurt their main business models, and they are right. Lawmakers in the European Parliament are worried that a retail digital euro could force people to move a lot of money from commercial banks to central bank accounts, which would hurt the sector's private sector credit origination. The central bank would have access to all citizens' financial data, raising privacy concerns, even if they “promise” not to use it. Banks say that a digital euro that is legally deemed free of risk would take funds out of the private financial system, making it harder for financial institutions to lend and prioritising credit to governments over loans to families and businesses. A CBDC could let central banks watch almost all transactions and financial decisions by citizens, taking away the privacy that comes with cash and giving the government the power to investigate, limit, or even punish users' financial activities. The CBDC will inevitably push commercial banks into a marginal role, creating a dangerous concentration of financial power in the hands of policymakers and technocrats. However, centralisation is always a threat, and those laws and their alleged independence are widely questioned when the central bank has consistently bowed down to political pressure to use expansionary monetary tools for government financing. If governments want more efficiency, technology, and a stronger currency that is globally valued, they should encourage decentralisation and competition, not the opposite. Regrettably, privacy and independence receive no priority. European banks are concerned and rightly so. The risk of excessively loosening monetary policy and resulting in complete monetary financing of government spending is significant. A digital euro is surveillance disguised as money, and governments will do all they can to use it as a tool for direct monetary financing of deficits. If you believe that the same policymakers and governments that have done nothing to control debt accumulation and excessive spending are going to defend the purchasing power of the currency, you are dreaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market benchmark asset, Bitcoin, reached its all-time high after surging to more than $125,000 during Monday's market session, driven by strong volume and broader market-wide momentum on 5 October 2025. According to CoinMarketCap data, the digital currency gained more than 2% during the market session on Sunday, hitting its lifetime high level of $125,559.21. Bitcoin had a previous all-time high level of $1,24,500, which was achieved in August 2025. “This rally has been supported by the uptick in U.S. equities and renewed inflows into Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds. Investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as part of the ‘debasement trade,' with concerns over the U.S. government shutdown driving demand for safe-haven assets. Rising institutional adoption, coupled with global economic uncertainty, continues to strengthen Bitcoin's position as the ‘digital gold' of our time,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX. A poll conducted by CoinMarketCap among investors showed that, despite the cryptocurrency reaching its all-time high today, crypto investors are maintaining their bullish momentum. “With many assets including equities, gold and even collectables like Pokemon cards hitting all-time highs, it's no surprise Bitcoin is benefiting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, told the news agency AFP on Sunday. As of 3:03 p.m. (IST), the Bitcoin prices are trading nearly 1% higher at $123,632 on Sunday, 5 October 2025, compared to their previous levels on the previous day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors have shown interest in the business of stablecoins, the digital money some believe could one day displace cash. They're not generally seen as investments themselves—those pegged to the buck should cost a buck and be worth a buck, more or less—but the business of dealing in them is drawing in money. Take Tether Holdings and Circle Internet Group (CRCL), the world's largest stablecoin issuers. The former recently sought a private-market deal that would value the company at $500 billion, in line with the market capitalizations of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and rivaling the private value of OpenAI's. Circle has a stock more than 350% above its IPO price and a market cap of roughly $35 billion. Stablecoins are mainly used for crypto trading, a base currency for buying into bitcoin and other assets. But proponents say their other uses—like paying employees, buying coffee, or holding value in company treasuries—can do what banking services and credit cards can do, only faster, presenting trillions of dollars in opportunity. Stablecoins are a form of digital currency, typically pegged to a real-world currency like the dollar, that proponents believe are the future of money. While that sorts out, some companies have made inroads in establishing their coins, which has led to multibillion-dollar valuations for their businesses. Competition and legislation, however, will go a long way toward determining who wins in this business. Tether and Circle, which together have 85% market share of the roughly $300 billion-and-growing pie, according to rwa.xyz, look like the likeliest disruptors of the payments market. Their business models have been made legitimate with U.S. legislation, and have won over some central bankers. Now investors have the tricky task of determining whether the biggest stablecoin issuers can fight off banks and e-commerce giants to take share in payments and other markets that aren't explicitly crypto, supporting their valuations. "We're going to be involved," JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said on a recent conference call. Tether and Circle have similar business models: they make money from interest earned on the reserves they hold. The acquire more when users buy the stablecoins, and sell when they're redeemed. Lower interest rates could mean a hit to revenue, but it could also spur trading that could boost business: Demand for crypto can lift demand for stablecoins used to facilitate trading, data show. Circle generated $658 million in the second quarter, of which 96% was reserve income, and a net loss of $482 million due to non-cash related IPO expenses.Its reserves are managed by BlackRock (BLK) and its reserve rate for the quarter was 4.1%. Tether, a private company, doesn't disclose its financials as Securities and Exchange Commission-regulated companies do, but its most recent quarterly unaudited attestation report shows a net profit of $4.9 billion in the second quarter. While the U.S. in July passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, also known as GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are still locked in battle with the banking industry. The law forbids issuers themselves from passing on yield to stablecoin holders, but it doesn't explicitly disallow crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) from giving Circle's usdc holders a 4.1% reward, just a percentage point below the best saving accounts rates in the country. Therein lies one of the key issues: Banks are concerned that stablecoin yields will entice the masses to pull deposits from savings accounts to chase yields as good as or better than those they offer. Now, the Treasury Department has gotten involved, asking for public input on things like taxes and how anti-money laundering rules apply. And it's not just banks that want in: Companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are considering issuing their own stablecoins. "Monthly Total Stablecoin Trade Volume on Exchanges."
