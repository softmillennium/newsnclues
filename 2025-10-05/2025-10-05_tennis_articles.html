                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard secured a pair of significant breakthroughs in one swoop on Sunday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. 4 Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-5 to seal the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking. With his one-hour, 25-minute victory inside the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, one which avenged his painful loss to Fritz from two sets up at Wimbledon earlier this year, Mpetshi Perricard also booked his spot in the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time. Although Perricard secured his win in straight sets, humid conditions in Shanghai made Sunday's encounter a big physical test for both players. Mpetshi Perricard broke his opponent's serve in a dramatic 11th game of the second set in which Fritz let slip a 30/0 lead and struggled to put away winners in the slow conditions. 37 then served out successfully to wrap a victory in which he fired 12 aces and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ‚ÄúBefore this my record was not good, 0-6 [against Top 10 players],‚Äù said Mpetshi Perricard. ‚ÄúSome of the matches were tough losses for me. I was very close against [Lorenzo] Musetti, against [Fritz] at Wimbledon, and I had a lot of things to improve. I tried to do a few things better than at Wimbledon, and it worked today. ‚ÄúIt was a tough match, physically and mentally, but I did well and I'm very happy about it.‚Äù Statement winüò§@MpetshiG proves he is more than just a serve bot with a complete performance to take his first top 10 win in Shanghai üî•#TennisInsights | @atptour | @SH_RolexMasters pic.twitter.com/BcTS4YBIB0 He is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 450 points clear of Musetti in the final qualification spot. Mpetshi Perricard's next opponent will be another Turin hopeful, Holger Rune, who also enjoyed a Sunday success in Shanghai. ‚ÄúWe are both Europeans, so we're not quite used to this kind of weather, but I just told myself it's the same for him and I'm just going to try to stay strong,‚Äù said Rune when asked about the Shanghai humidity. "I think I had a good balance today of playing aggressive and making him work at the same time, making him run because we both feel when we run in this kind of weather, it's more tough. In other early Sunday matches, Gabriel Diallo and Zizou Bergs also advanced. Diallo advanced after his opponent David Goffin retired when trailing 0-3 in the first set. The Canadian's next opponent will be Bergs, who overcame 19th seed Francisco Cerundolo 7-6(1), 6-3.
