Marcus Rashford's stunning volley proved to be a consolation goal for Barcelona, who were hammered 4-1 in Seville. The defeat was compounded after Robert Lewandowski missed a penalty, but Sevilla were well worth the scoreline and it was only a fine performance from Wojciech Szczesny which kept the scoreline down. 

The hosts took the lead in the 11th minute after a clumsy challenge from Ronald Araujo on Isaac Romero, referee Alejandro Muniz Ruiz initially failed to give the penalty, but pointed to spot after reviewing the challenge on the pitchside video, and Alexis Sanchez sent his former Arsenal team-mate Szczesny the wrong way to give Sevilla the lead. 

The conditions in southern Spain were sweltering, hitting 33 degrees, and it was the hosts who were on fire, doubling their lead in the 37th minute, courtesy of a well-taken finish by Romero after Joules Kounde had been caught in possession. But Barcelona game themselves hope deep into time added on in the first-half, when Pedri picked out Rashford who timed his run to perfection and fired an unstoppable shot past Odysseas Vlachodimos. 

And while Hansi Flick's side were improved in the second half, Lewandowski fired his penalty wide in the 77th minute and the league champions conceded two further late goals to slump to a demoralising 4-1 defeat.

LONDON (AP) ‚Äî Martin Odegaard has been withdrawn from Norway's squad for its upcoming matches, including a World Cup qualifier against Israel, because of a knee injury sustained on Premier League duty with Arsenal, the English club said Sunday.

Odegaard, who is Norway's captain, suffered a medial collateral ligament injury to his left knee early in Arsenal's 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday, the club said. It marked the third time this season he has gone off in the first half of a match because of injury, with Odegaard having also been troubled by shoulder problems.

Arsenal didn't give an expected timescale for Odegaard's latest injury absence, only saying he will ‚Äúcontinue to be assessed and treated by our medical team ... with the aim of a return to action as soon as possible.‚Äù

Norway hosts Israel on Saturday and then plays a friendly against New Zealand three days later.

Barcelona must win to retake top spot in La Liga, but in the opening stages against Sevilla, they have fallen behind at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan.

Ronald Araujo was one of two changes made from the midweek defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, and he was at the heart of the incident that allowed Sevilla to score the opener. He was adjudged to have fouled Isaac Romero inside the penalty, with the decision being confirmed after a VAR check. That allowed Alexis Sanchez to step up from 12 yards, and he netted against his former club.

Alexis received a lovely message from Barcelona upon making his La Liga return with Sevilla, but right now, there will not be any warm feelings from the Catalans, who have been left incensed with the decision to away that penalty to Sevilla. Araujo protested his innocence, but in the end, it has not mattered, and Los Nervionenses have the early lead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now it's time for a new name on the trophy: Argentina. Forty eight years after they were defeated in the first final over the water in Montevideo, Argentina finally won the World Cup, on home soil in Buenos Aires. ‚ÄúArgentina to reach final ‚Äî but who else?‚Äù was the headline in World Soccer magazine's preview of the competition, for example. That, to a certain extent, was enough as they battled through the first group stage, opened up in the second group stage, then edged a memorable final with a 3-1 extra-time win over the Netherlands. The tall, thin, long-haired Cesar Luis Menotti was only 39 and most famous for smoking his way through the tournament. He distanced himself from power while also acknowledging the need to stay on decent terms with the regime. ‚ÄúHis great virtue was to give the players a lot of freedom,‚Äù said Kempes. ‚ÄúThe player had to handle the three or four tasks he assigned you, but beyond that, players had full freedom to do what they would usually do for their own club.‚Äù The 1970s had seen a mass exodus of Argentina's star players abroad, particularly to Spain, where a ban on foreign players had recently been lifted. But Menotti was keen to gather his players together for lengthy training camps ahead of the tournament, and this simply wasn't possible with the differences in European and South American football calendars. So not only did Menotti convince the country's football association to ban players under 25 from playing abroad, he initially committed to selecting only three overseas-based players for his squad, then eventually plumped for only one, Kempes. In the lead-up to the tournament, Argentina had played a series of friendlies without him, since Valencia refused to release him. But in the end, Menotti's decisions proved successful: both in terms of building a team of relatively modest, domestic-based players, and also providing an exemption for the man who would be the tournament's star. A legendary figure perhaps based more upon his philosophy rather than his success, he died last year at the age of 85, just one year after standing down from a position as a director for the Argentine national side. But Kempes had failed to score at the World Cup four years earlier, and started this tournament slowly. He was admonished in an awkward one-on-one interview by the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano for playing too high up the pitch against the man-marking Italians rather than dropping deep. He also created the other goal for Daniel Bertoni. Curiously, his goals in the final were his last for Argentina, at the age of just 23 ‚Äî four years later at World Cup 1982, he again failed to find the target. Menotti insisted on open, free-flowing attacking football; more in keeping with the spirit of Brazil and Dutch sides of the 1970s than Argentine sides of the past, who had earned a reputation for being defensive-minded and, above all else, extremely aggressive. The side's most striking feature, according to most reports from the time, was therefore their relative lack of brutality. Their defenders were all better going forward than stopping opponents, with the full-backs committed to overlapping. Even Passarella seemed to switch off regularly, but would suddenly push forward to provide an attacking threat, particularly with powerful left-footed free kicks, although he also had two good chances from open play in the final. Argentina were more flexible than previous World Cup-winning sides, who tended to have a default shape and only altered it if they felt a particular opponent needed marking. This Argentina varied the positions of their attackers more. Kempes, for example, played particularly deep in a goalless draw with Brazil in the second group phase, perhaps having remembered the criticism from Di Stefano. His role in this tournament was unusual: at various points he felt like a No 9, a No 10 and a midfielder and, while humble away from the pitch, he was quite a straightforward attacker, playing for himself rather than his team-mates even if his average position suggests he was a link man. At times, the midfield seemed pedestrian and lacking invention, with the obvious exception of Ardiles: a lovely quick dribbler, most obviously when he created a Kempes goal against Poland. They boasted two speedy wingers: Oscar Ortiz was particularly nippy down the left, Bertoni was highly energetic down the right, and Leopoldo Luque was a good foil for Kempes, scoring a spectacular long-range strike against France. Like the Dutch side who had finished runners-up four years earlier, Argentina's shirt numbers at the tournament were not based around position, but were assigned alphabetically. They had the same policy four years later, although one man was allowed an exception: Diego Maradona should have been No 12, but insisted on No 10, which bumped Kempes up to No 11. Once most of the ticker tape had been cleared from the pitch, and the game finally started, all this seemed to have rattled the Netherlands, who played an unusually physical brand of football, perhaps a precursor to their infamous 2010 final display against Spain. Tactically, the most notable feature of the final was how regularly the two goalkeepers found themselves in bizarre positions, rushing out to close down attackers in wide areas. But when the two goalkeepers were wearing the shirt numbers five and eight, maybe that was to be expected. After Kempes opened the scoring with a clever sliding finish past the advancing Jan Jongbloed, Argentine goalkeeper Fillol was caught too wide for Dick Nanninga's headed equaliser, and was similarly too far out when Dutch forward Rob Rensenbrink prodded against the post in stoppage time. For all the talk about the Dutch coming close in 1974, they came even closer ‚Äî with a less spectacular side ‚Äî in 1978. Kempes scored his second on the stroke of half-time in extra time, bundling his way past two Dutch defenders and goalkeeper Jongbloed before scrappily turning home a shot that deflected in off Wim Suurbier. Did a shave win Argentina the 1978 #FIFAWorldCup? Eventually, they did so with an even scrappier goal. Bertoni played the ball to Kempes in midfield, he dribbled forward, and then his return pass bounced off Bertoni's knee, then off Kempes' chest, then back off Bertoni and fell nicely for him to tuck the ball home. You can forgive Jongbloed for being bamboozled by the pinball nature of the move, but again he ended up in an odd position. ‚ÄúThey apparently forgot the main issue ‚Äî a soccer game that was watched by about a billion people round the world.‚Äù It was generally acknowledged that this was a World Cup without a genuinely outstanding team, after Brazil in 1970 and the Netherlands in 1974 had captured the world's imagination with forward-thinking football. It must also be added that Argentina benefited from various instances of good fortune: being hosts, some favourable refereeing decisions in a group-stage win over France, and the fact they knew what result they needed in their last second-round match, because Brazil had played earlier in the day. The Dutch were without Johan Cruyff and more functional than four years beforehand. France looked decent but exited, somewhat unfortunately, in the first group stage. ‚ÄúArgentina won the World Cup because they deserved to,‚Äù wrote World Soccer's Eric Batty, always reluctant to dish out praise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beating defending champions Liverpool with a late winner never does any harm to a head coach's chances of winning over a critical fanbase, but by going on a dash down the touchline to celebrate with his players, and being sent off for it after being awarded a second yellow card, Maresca has made his biggest breakthrough yet. Maresca has struggled to connect with Chelsea fans since he was hired in June last year. His CV, compared to the successful managers Chelsea used to hire, such as Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel, was underwhelming ‚Äî just 14 games at Parma and one full season at Leicester City in the Championship. Defeating Manchester United is never a bad thing, but they were putting the finishing touches on the worst Premier League season in their history, finishing 15th with 42 points. So what occurred on Saturday felt like a real housewarming. Unlike five months earlier, Chelsea faced a Liverpool side hungry for the three points. Meanwhile, Chelsea could not have been much weaker, especially defensively. Four centre-backs were ruled out through suspension and injury. Benoit Badiashile was starting his first Premier League game in seven months due to the injury issues he has suffered. Next to him was 19-year-old academy graduate Josh Acheampong, making just the fourth Premier League start of his career. Neither finished the game due to suffering some kind of niggle, which left Maresca having to move right-back Reece James inside. Initially, the England international was beside Acheampong, but after the teenager had to be substituted, he was operating next to 19-year-old summer buy Jorrel Hato. Meanwhile, Chelsea's best attacking player, Cole Palmer, was watching from the stands due to an ongoing groin problem. To win under these circumstances was extraordinary, but crucially, Maresca did not play it safe or react negatively. His changes after going down to 10 men in the recent losses to Manchester United and Brighton had caused frustration among Chelsea fans. Funnily enough, Maresca probably would have been forgiven for being cautious this time. But what will arguably carry more favour than the crucial three points is that Maresca allowed his guarded mask to slip. His stoic demeanour in the majority of press conferences has not won the hearts of many tuning in. There has been the odd flash of charisma, but more often than not, his delivery has been like some of his tactics: too cautious. He was a bundle of nervous energy in his technical area, barely sitting down over the 90 minutes. He was booked in the first half for his reaction to Anthony Taylor's refusal to award a penalty and remonstrated with Xavi Valero seconds later after seeing the Liverpool goalkeeping coach talking to the fourth official. This was Maresca standing up for his side, and the crowd responded to his passion as much as the team's willingness to fight against adversity. By running to join in the celebrations of his players following Estevao's neat winner, screaming as he did so, Maresca showed the fans that he cares just as much as they do. It was reminiscent of Mourinho's own touchline celebrations in 2004 when his Porto side drew at Old Trafford in the Champions League to send them through ‚Äî and that comparison will also do him no harm. Assistant coach Willy Caballero, who had to do the media duties because of Maresca's dismissal, feels it can be a starting point to making playing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge a more intimidating prospect. But any victory in the last second, any victory against Liverpool, Arsenal, big teams, strong teams, can give you a little bit more. And that's what we want to create, that environment that is nasty for the away team and gives you a little bit more legs or wings to run in the last couple of minutes. So, hopefully, we can create this environment for more games.‚Äù Simon Johnson  has spent the majority of his career as a sports reporter since 2000 covering Chelsea, firstly for Hayters and then the London Evening Standard. This included going to every game home and away as the west London club secured the Champions League in 2012.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A coalition of community organizations and documentary filmmaker Billy Corben on Thursday called again on FIFA and Miami-Dade to use their influence to protect soccer fans from federal immigration agents roaming stadiums during next year's World Cup tournament. At a demonstration in front of FIFA's Coral Gables office, they pressured officials to protect World Cup attendees from "overzealous immigration enforcement" and to reinvest Miami-Dade County tax dollars set aside for the World Cup into the local community. "Miami-Dade is a proud county of immigrants, and we are subsidizing the World Cup with over $60 million in public cash and resources," Corben said during Thursday's press conference. The activists say their fears about immigration agents are warranted, citing last week's New York Times report that revealed "FIFA was alerted to 145 human rights concerns at Club World Cup games, including federal policies and enforcement."

"The potential for due process abuses, racial profiling, and for fans to lose their liberties and freedoms is far too great," they said, noting that the backdrop in Florida "includes the reopening of the Everglades [Alligator Alcatraz] facility and news of a Mexican national on a tourist visa who was detained and deported." "The Trump Administration's recent immigration policies have affected both staff and fans," they said. Since the first protest on June 30, activists said an official of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee contacted them, according to Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, Policy Coordinator with American Friends Service Committee. She said no meeting date with FIFA has been set. Amy Morales, director of advocacy and policy for Engage Miami, said community nonprofits had to fight for full funding before county commissioners at the same time the World Cup was getting $46 million in subsidies from the county. "What we're saying here today is that we do not want our taxpayer dollars funding the separation of families ‚Äî funding deportations," Morales said to WLRN. Luna Plaza, a migrant justice committee member of the Florida Student Power Network attended both protests. "Sports, in general, shapes all of our lives," Plaza told WLRN. "It's really saddening to hear that so many safe spaces are being taken away for undocumented folks ‚Äî including sports.</p>
