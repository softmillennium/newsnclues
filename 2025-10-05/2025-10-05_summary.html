Live Updates


            • US President Donald Trump told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if it refuses to cede power in Gaza, as Trump pressures Israel and the militant group to move forward with his ceasefire proposal.
    


            • Delegations from Hamas, Israel and the United States are headed to Egypt to try to finalize an agreement based on the president's 20-point plan. Talks are expected to start tomorrow.
    


            • Trump says Israel has agreed to an initial withdrawal line, and that a ceasefire would be “immediately effective” if Hamas approves. The White House is “convinced” the plan is possible, Israel's opposition leader said.
    


• Despite Trump's assertion that Israel has temporarily stopped bombing Gaza, dozens of people have been killed in Israeli strikes over the weekend, according to hospitals in the enclave.
    


            Some residents in Gaza have reported a decrease in Israeli strikes today, as negotiators prepare to meet in Egypt for ceasefire talks.
    


            While the relative calm has offered brief respite for the Palestinians CNN spoke with, they said they can still hear explosions and are cautious in their optimism.
    


Ismail Zaydeh, who is currently sheltering at Gaza Port, said he heard airstrikes around dawn, including around Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa and al-Sabra neighborhoods and the beach encampment west of the city.
    


                    “The sounds of the strikes have lessened compared with previous days but not by much,” Zaydeh said, adding: “I'd say the intensity is down by about 20%. Aircraft are still flying overhead intermittently.”
                





Hatem Abu Rahma, who had been living in Gaza City's Al-Shifa neighborhood but traveled an hour away to the Al-Saraya area for his safety, told CNN the situation across the enclave feels “much calmer” this weekend in comparison with Friday.
    


                    “There's a noticeable difference,” he said. “There's still gunfire and shelling that we can hear, but it's far lighter than in previous days.”
                





Asmaa Ziyad from Gaza City's Al-Sahaba neighborhood also noted a change, saying: “Yesterday and the night before, there were many airstrikes, but the bombardment is lighter than it was two days ago. We still hear the sounds of aircraft and distant explosions, but not like before.”
    


Abu Rahma, from the Al-Shifa neighborhood, said he returned there over the weekend but found the situation “still dangerous.”
    


                    “The quadcopter drones never leave the skies, and the threat is constant,” he said. “Enough already … we're exhausted, from hunger, from soaring prices, from displacement, from exploitation and from the loss of security.”
                





Deadly strikes: On Friday, US President Donald Trump called on Israel to “immediately stop the bombing.” But Israeli airstrikes have continued to batter the enclave, with the number of dead and injured rising by the dozens this weekend.
    


            We're hearing from another Trump administration Cabinet official, after we brought you updates on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks earlier.
    


            If Hamas doesn't follow through with the terms of a ceasefire deal, “Israel can finish the job,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on FOX News' “The Sunday Briefing.”
    


            “Israel can go in there and make sure Hamas is obliterated,” Hegseth said.
    


                    “If Hamas can live up to it, step up to the moment, then it looks like we're on the precipice of something real, really different in the Middle East, which creates a whole different set of possibilities,” the defense secretary added. “So we're proud to be a part of supporting and defending Israel.”
                





            US President Donald Trump spoke to reporters a short time ago at the White House, saying negotiations on the Gaza ceasefire deal are going “very well.”
    


                    “They're in negotiation, right now, as we speak, they've started the negotiation. It'll last a couple of days,” Trump said as he departed the South Lawn for an event in Norfolk, Virginia, later today. “We'll see how it turns out. But I'm hearing it's going very well.”
                





            Trump described his 20-point ceasefire proposal as a “great deal” for Israel and “the entire Arab world.”
    


            Trump said the deal does not need any further flexibility and that the hostages released by Hamas under the agreement would need to come back “almost immediately.”
    


Remember: Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources. Negotiators, including a US delegation, are headed to Cairo now.
    


CNN's Tal Shalev contributed reporting to this post.



            Hamas' chief negotiator, Khalil Al-Hayya, was seen in a video for the first time since the Israeli assassination attempt in Doha nearly one month ago.
    


            In the two-and-a-half-minute video, only Al-Hayya's head and chest can be seen, and it's unclear if he is suffering from any injuries as a result of the earlier attack. It's also unclear where the video was shot. According to Hamas, the video was recorded on Saturday.
    


            Al-Hayya mourns his son, who was killed in the Israeli strike on September 9, and says, “We are heartbroken over the loss of thousands in Gaza. God has honored us by counting among the martyrs our sons and grandchildren.”
    


            The strike hit a residential building near the center of Doha, targeting senior Hamas leaders, including Al-Hayya and others. The Israeli strike drew international condemnation, including from US President Donald Trump.
    


            Al-Hayya is set to head the Hamas delegation for discussions about Trump's 20-point ceasefire proposal, according to an Egyptian official.
    


            Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has commended US President Donald Trump's “huge mission” to secure the release of the remaining captives in Gaza while voicing his optimism that a hostage deal could be close.
    


                    “I want to thank President Donald Trump for all his efforts regarding this huge mission of bringing our hostages back home,” Gideon Sa'ar, who has spoken out in support of ending the war in Gaza, said at a prayer event on Sunday. “We are yearning to see them come home – very soon.”
                





            Israel is now working to implement the first step of the Trump administration's ceasefire plan, which focuses on the release of Israeli hostages, he added.
    


            Three Israeli anti-war activists have been released from detention and placed under house arrest after attempting to break through the Gaza border, a spokesperson for the their network, Mesarvot, said Sunday.
    


            Itamar Greenberg, Roman Levin and Roy Elani were arrested and detained in Beersheba District Court after crossing briefly into the Gaza border on Friday.
    


            The activists are part of a small but loud group of Israelis who have decried their country's military actions in Gaza and who have marched toward the Gaza fence for weeks in solidarity with the Sumud Flotilla, aiming “to break the siege on Gaza.”
    


            “We demanded an immediate end to the genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by Israel,” a video posted to Greenberg's Instagram on September 19.

            Greenberg, 19, is a conscious objector, having refused to enlist for military service, which is compulsory for most Jewish Israelis - and some minorities - over the age of 18.
    


            Greenberg was in and out of prison over the last year for objecting to serving in the military. He served a total of 197 days over five consecutive sentences before being released in March 2025.
    


            He said his refusal to serve came at the “culmination of a long process of learning and moral reckoning.”
    


            “The more I learned, the more I knew I couldn't wear a uniform that symbolizes killing and oppression,” he told CNN earlier this year, explaining that Israel's war in Gaza solidified his decision to refuse.
    


            “There is genocide,” he said. “So we don't need good reasons (to refuse).”
    


            The Israeli government has vehemently denied accusations of genocide.
    


For context: An independent United Nations inquiry concluded for the first time last month that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and that the country's top leaders have incited genocide, in what it described as the “most authoritative UN finding to date.”

            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said today that US President Donald Trump's team is “convinced” their ceasefire proposal is not only possible, but “should happen.”
    


                    “Over the past two days I conducted a series of conversations with President Trump's team. They are convinced it (the ceasefire plan) is possible. They are convinced it should happen,” Lapid said at the start of a political party meeting.
                





            “This deal was shaped thanks to President Trump, and despite (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu. I saw yesterday Netanyahu trying, as usual, to steal the credit for it,” Lapid added.
    


            The opposition leader went on to say that Netanyahu has “no political impediment” to finish what Trump started, before adding: “This deal can be done; this deal must be done.”
    


            More now from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also speaking earlier today on ABC's “This Week.” He said the administration's hope is to have “90 percent” of negotiations completed by the time White House officials arrive in Cairo.
    


As we've reported, delegations from the US, Israel and Hamas are heading to Egypt to discuss the proposal, and indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are expected to start Monday, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources.
    


            Rubio said that while he does not fully trust Hamas leaders, there is still progress being made during negotiations.
    


                    “I'm not telling you here that these are people I trust 100%, nor should we, but they have said basically that they agreed to his proposal and the framework for releasing the hostages,” Rubio said. “That's an enormous achievement.”
                





            When pressed on if hostages will be released as soon as this week, Rubio said that the administration is hoping it happens “as quickly as possible.”
    


                    “It needs to happen as quickly as possible and we will know very quickly whether Hamas is serious or not by how these technical talks go in terms of the logistics, but absolutely, we want these hostages all of them, living and deceased, released as soon as possible,” Rubio said.
                





            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been on the Sunday political shows today and we can bring you some of his remarks.
    


            Securing the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza is “priority number one” for the Trump administration as it works to reach a deal with Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza, Rubio told NBC's “Meet the Press”
    


            Rubio said it's a goal the administration believes “we can achieve something very quickly on,” specifying that the release would be “in exchange for Israel moving back to” the initial withdrawal line outlined in President Donald Trump's proposed ceasefire plan, “which is basically where they stood at the middle part of last month of August.”
    


            “Even as I speak to you now, there are people meeting on that,” Rubio added.
    


            As we've been reporting, negotiators from the US, Israel and Hamas are heading for Egypt for talks on a Gaza ceasefire. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh tomorrow.
    


            The US delegation will include special envoy Steve Witkoff, and also Jared Kushner, who is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.
    


            After leaving the White House in 2021, Kushner launched a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The UAE and Qatar have also invested large amounts into his firm.
    


            These deals came shortly after Kushner helped lead Middle East policy during the first Trump administration, including the Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and several Arab states. Kushner has denied these investments are a conflict of interest.
    


            Critics from across party lines and human rights organizations argue that Kushner continues to profit from relationships he built while in public office, renewing questions about whether his financial ties with Riyadh and other Gulf players could influence US policy under his father-in-law.
    


            His firm invests heavily in Israeli companies, and Kushner praised the “very valuable” potential of Gaza's “waterfront property” last year, suggesting that Israel should move Palestinians “out and then clean it up” — raising further questions about his impartiality in acting as a mediator as he re-enters diplomatic circles.
    


            Detained activists of the recently intercepted Gaza-bound aid flotilla have suffered “serious abuses” in Israeli custody, including being denied access to medication and – for some – physical violence, according to a legal team representing the group.
    


            The claims come days after the same lawyers said some detained activists had been forced to “kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours.”
    


            Adalah, a legal organization for Arab minority rights in Israel, said in a statement Sunday that their attorneys had met with more than 80 participants of the flotilla over the past two days at Ktziot Prison in southern Israel.
    


            According to the testimonies of these individuals, Adalah said that, as of Saturday, participants were denied access to essential medications, including prescriptions for conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer.
    


            “The participants are detained in overcrowded cells, and some participants were forced to sleep on the floor under harsh and unsanitary conditions,” Adalah said. “Several participants reported that they were interrogated by unidentified personnel and others reported mistreatment and abuse by prison guards.”
    


            Adalah said that Israeli authorities “used physical violence against some detainees, with at least one participant sustaining injuries to his hands.” Other members of the flotilla were blindfolded and handcuffed for prolonged periods, Adalah said.
    


            Israel's Foreign Ministry said today that the claims of mistreatment are “brazen lies.”
    


            “All the detainees' legal rights are fully upheld,” the ministry posted on X.
    


            In a statement to CNN, the Foreign Ministry also said, “Of course they are receiving food, water and medication, and they are not mistreated.”
    


            US President Donald Trump has told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to cede power and control of Gaza, amid ongoing efforts to push forward his proposed ceasefire plan.
    


            “Complete Obliteration!” Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked via text message yesterday what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power.
    


            Tapper pressed the president on Hamas' response to his 20-point ceasefire proposal, citing Sen. Lindsey Graham's interpretation that Hamas had effectively rejected the plan by insisting on “no disarmament, keeping Gaza under Palestinian control and tying hostage release to negotiations.”
    


            “Is he wrong?” Tapper asked.
    


            “We will find out. Only time will tell!!!” Trump responded.
    


            The president said he expects clarity “soon” on whether Hamas is genuinely committed to peace.
    


            “Yes on Bibi,” Trump said, when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fully on board with ending the bombing campaign in Gaza and supporting the president's broader vision.
    


            Trump added that he is hopeful his ceasefire proposal will become a reality and emphasized that he's working hard to achieve it.
    


            While we await delegations from Hamas, Israel and the US to continue talks in Egypt, let's take a look at how Hamas responded to parts of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan.
    


            The militant group's response opened the door to potential negotiations to finalize a deal, and Trump quickly hailed it as victory, saying Hamas was “ready for lasting peace.”
    


            But the response was conditional, and it entirely left out some of the key parts of Trump's proposal.
    


            Crucially, it accepted two of the most important demands of the Trump plan: the release of all of the hostages at the beginning of the ceasefire and Hamas ceding governance in Gaza.
    


            Hamas agreed to the “exchange formula” laid out in the plan: all 48 remaining hostages for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7. The militant group also said it was willing to hand over power in Gaza to independent Palestinian technocrats, closely mirroring the language in the US plan.
    


            But missing in Hamas' response is any mention of the international oversight committee led by Trump, called the “Board of Peace,” that's supposed to supervise the local Palestinian governance. It's unclear if they accept this oversight or not.
    


            Hamas' response also fails to address the issue of disarmament: a key condition of the Trump proposal and a demand of the international community. Hamas has repeatedly refused to disarm.
    


            The Hamas statement only says that “other issues” mentioned in the Trump plan “will be discussed through a comprehensive national Palestinian framework.” Hamas also insists that it will be a part of this framework, defying the Trump proposal's demand that it “not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.”
    


            These issues — and the lack of clarity around Hamas' position — mean the outlook for potential negotiations to finalize a deal are not certain. Trump may be celebrating, but there are still delicate talks ahead on some of the most sensitive issues.
    


            Pope Leo XIV said Sunday he is concerned about the rise of “antisemitic hatred” in the world while referencing the synagogue attack in Manchester, northern England, earlier this week.
    


            Leo also said he continues to be “saddened” by the suffering of Palestinian people in Gaza.
    


                    “I express my concern about the rise of antisemitic hatred in the world, as unfortunately we saw with the terrorist attack in Manchester a few days ago. I continue to be saddened by the immense suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza,” Leo said during his Sunday Angelus prayer.
                





            Leo, the first Amercian pope, acknowledged that “some significant steps” have been taken in ceasefire negotiations, which he hoped would achieve the “desired results as soon as possible.”
    


            “I ask all those in positions of responsibility to commit themselves to this path, to bring about a ceasefire and to release the hostages,” Leo said.
    


            At least 15 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since dawn today, hospital authorities said.
    


            Israeli strikes continue to batter the enclave, despite US President Donald Trump's Friday call for Israel to “immediately stop the bombing” and as delegations from the United States, Israel and Hamas head to Egypt to discuss his ceasefire proposal.
    


            Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are expected to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources - as we reported earlier.



            At least 67 people were killed in Gaza yesterday as Israeli bombardment continued, hospital officials said. Seventeen – many of them children – were killed after a strike hit a home in Gaza City, which recorded most of the deaths in the enclave Saturday.
    


            The number of injured also continues to rise. More than 460 people were treated at Gaza City's Al-Ahli Arab hospital Saturday, said Dr. Fadel Naim, who works there.
    


            “The medical teams are still fighting to save lives amid severe shortages of staff, supplies and medicines, and an overwhelming number of patients requiring urgent surgery,” he said.
    


            Meanwhile, at the Al-Shiffa Hospital in Gaza City, director Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya told CNN that there are few hospitals still operating in the city and they are able to provide only the minimum level of service.
    


            “The medical and humanitarian situation in Gaza City remains catastrophic in every sense of the word, he said.
    


For context: More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, 2023, according to the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Many more have been left with life-changing injures, according to the ministry. In total, 169,583 people have been injured since the start of the war, it said Sunday.



            On a hot Friday morning in September, dozens of Israelis turned up at Gaza's border fence – not as soldiers, but as dissenters. Their demand: an end to the siege they say is being carried out in their name.
    


            The activists, mostly Jewish Israelis, marched toward the fence, calling on the international community to sanction and isolate their country, to “stop the genocide and end the decades-long Zionist apartheid regime.”
    


            “We are fully aware that the government is not going to stop, so we are here to call on the world to boycott us, as ridiculous as it sounds,” Sapir Sluzker Amran, one of the participants, told CNN.
    


            Almost two years into the war in Gaza, Sluzker Amran represents a minority in Israel, and she is aware of it.
    


            “It's a shame that we don't have more people with us today, but I think we need to keep challenging our own society. … They're in denial, and I think the best way to get out of this denial is to keep shocking them until everyone faces the horrible truth that we are committing genocide.”
    


            In September, an independent UN inquiry concluded for the first time that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a finding which the Israeli government has rejected.
    


            Only a short drive away, the extreme distance between the protesters' view and that of most Israelis is made clear.
    


            Read the full story here.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he would not move forward with the entirety of the Trump administration's ceasefire plan until all hostages are freed.
    


                    “We will not move on to any of the 21 clauses until the first clause – the release of all the hostages, the living and the dead – until the very last hostage, every single one, has crossed into Israeli territory,” Netanyahu said.
                





            “Only then will we proceed to any other clause,” Netanyahu added.
    


            He was speaking to Israel's Heroes Forum, a group of families whose loved ones were killed during Hamas' October 7 attacks or in the war in Gaza that followed.
    


            A total of 251 people in Israel were taken on October 7. This is how many are still there as of today.
    


            Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources.
    


            These negotiations, also known as proximity talks, are a critical step in finalizing an agreement based on US President Donald Trump's 20-point ceasefire proposal.
    


            Sharm el-Sheikh, a city on the southern edge of the Sinai peninsula, has hosted numerous peace talks over the years.
    


            Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz has been speaking today, and has claimed the Israeli military's Gaza City offensive “created the basis” for the Trump administration's ceasefire plan.
    


            “The reason for the possible reversal in Hamas's position is the intensity of the pressure Israel is exerting on the city of Gaza,” Katz said during a speech at a state memorial ceremony, adding that the military's occupation of Gaza City has placed enormous pressure on Hamas and “created the basis for President Trump's decisive initiative.”
    


                    “We now expect the first stage to be implemented in the near future and the immediate release of all the hostages,” he said. “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is in the heart of the city of Gaza and prepared for every possibility.”
                





            The Israeli minister also warned Hamas that if they refuse to release the hostages remaining in Gaza, the Israeli military will “once again increase the intensity of the fire until Hamas is defeated.”
    


For context: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday he was hopeful that all of the Israeli hostages will be released within days, while the Israel Defense Forces remains deployed deep inside the Gaza Strip. Take a look at his remarks here.

Federal Judge Karin Immergut blocked Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to Portland, citing lack of evidence.

Top Trump administration adviser Stephen Miller was accused of spreading dangerous “propaganda” Saturday night regarding the federal judge who ruled that the White House could not deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

The White House deputy chief of staff accused U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, of “legal insurrection” after she found that the president's claims about violent protests at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland were “untethered to facts,” and that residents' expressions of opposition to ICE do not meet the high legal standard for calling the National Guard.

Miller claimed authorities in Oregon and Portland are aiding “an organized terrorist attack on the federal government and its officers” by refusing to aid ICE agents, and claimed Immergut was attempting to assume the role of “commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces” by siding with state officials and issuing a temporary restraining order blocking the National Guard deployment, which was expected to begin this weekend.

Immergut said the state had provided “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the president's directive.”

Portland residents who oppose Trump's mass deportation agenda began holding nightly demonstrations at the ICE facility over the summer, with some trying to block vehicles from entering and exiting the property. Crowds have dispersed quickly during the daytime, while at night federal officers have sometimes used tear gas and other weapons to move people away from the building. The Portland police have reported 27 arrests since early June at the protests, and at least two dozen people have been arrested by federal officers.

While the president has described Portland as “war-ravaged,” Immergut said that the protests fall far below the threshold for ordering federal troops to Portland, which the president has the authority to do only in times of foreign invasion, a rebellion, or when local authorities are unable to maintain order.

“The protests have been such a minor issue that the normal nightlife in downtown Portland has required more police resources than the ICE facility,” said Immergut.

The judge added that the U.S  “has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs… This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of the nation.”

Miller's accusation that Immergut was taking part in a “legal insurrection” by rejecting Trump's false claims about the nature of the protests was “reckless,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“It's authoritarian propaganda, plain and simple. Stephen Miller should be fired,” said the Democrat.

New York Times columnist David French added that Miller's claims put Immergut in potential danger, as right-wing counterprotesters have arrived in Portland in recent days.

This kind of rhetoric is incredibly dangerous for the judge. Miller constantly deploys deranged rhetoric, even as he claims the left incites violence with its own language.If Miller believes that rhetoric can lead to violence, then he knows exactly what he is doing. https://t.co/iGNcWYVnMb

Immergut's temporary order is set to expire in two weeks, but she is expected to rule on the state's request for a more permanent injunction barring the deployment of the National Guard.

The Trump administration on Saturday night appealed Immergut's ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously ruled that Trump could send the National Guard to Los Angeles to stop anti-ICE protests after a federal judge had decided that deployment should be halted.

In addition to seeking the National Guard deployment, the administration has reportedly discussed sending the Army's 82nd Airborne division, which is typically deployed in hostile foreign territory, into Portland.

On Saturday, Miller repeated claims that “there is a large and growing movement of left-wing terrorism in this country” that is “well organized and funded” and ”shielded by far-left Democrat judges.” Immergut is a Republican.

“The only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks,” said Miller.

Since the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last month, the president and his allies have insisted that left-wing groups are fomenting violence, with Trump signing an executive order falsely claiming he has the authority to designate “antifa” as a “domestic terrorist organization” — despite the fact that no “antifa” organization exists.

The president also signed National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7), which mandates a “national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts.”

On Saturday, Miller said on Newsmax that the administration intends to apply NSPM-7 in Portland, initiating investigations into what he called a “domestic terrorist network” whenever federal agents make an arrest at a protest.

NSPM-7 will be applied to Portland, Trump's homeland security advisor Stephen Miller says.STEPHEN MILLER:  Every time we make an arrest, we are initiating an investigation into the entire domestic terrorist network. The president issued a national security presidential… pic.twitter.com/BJcMnPyjVH

Miller, said investigative reporter Jim Stewartson, “collapsed Democrats, ‘far-left Democrat judges', and ‘antifa' into a single domestic terror threat as a pretext for mass arrests.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Many families who lost nearly everything to the storm are still slogging through red tape a year later.

Slogging through a thick slop of mud and rock, Brian Hill passed the roof that Hurricane Helene's floodwaters had just ripped off someone's barn and dumped into his yard. Then he peered into the unrecognizable chaos inside what had been his family's dream home.

The century-old white farmhouse, surrounded by the rugged peaks of western North Carolina, sat less than 15 yards from the normally tranquil Cattail Creek. As Helene's rainfall barrelled down the Black Mountains last September, the creek swelled into a raging river that encircled the house. Its waves pounded the walls, tore off doors, smashed windows and devoured the front and back porches.

Brian and his wife, Susie, had just bought the house a year earlier. They had a 30-year mortgage — and, now, no house to live in. Because their home didn't sit in the 100-year floodplain, they had not purchased flood insurance.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Across Helene's devastating path through the Southeast, people like the Hills turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA doles out financial help after a major disaster for everything from home repairs to rental assistance. Once she could get a cell signal, Susie applied.

It took months of persistence, but eventually the Hills were among the lucky ones. They received close to $40,000, just shy of the maximum amount FEMA provides for rebuilding and repairs.

But farther up Cattail Creek, a man whose wife was killed in floodwaters said he checked his FEMA application one day and noticed it was marked “withdrawn,” a surprise since he'd received no explanation. Elsewhere in Yancey, another man said he realized FEMA had denied him aid because his birthdate was a year off on his application. A third man said his application — which he filled out just days after hiking down a mountain severely injured — seemingly vanished from the system.

FEMA's application process can be onerous, particularly for people who've lost their homes. And it can be especially daunting for those with lower incomes who may have fewer resources.

An analysis by ProPublica and The Assembly found that among the more rural counties hardest hit by Helene, the households that got the most housing assistance tended to have the highest incomes. The income disparity is especially stark in Yancey County, where the Hills live.

A ProPublica investigation earlier this year found that despite dire warnings from the National Weather Service, many people in Yancey were unaware of the enormity of danger Helene posed. The storm killed 11 people there, the highest per-capita loss of life for any county in North Carolina.

The Hills, who are both public school teachers, do not fall in the highest-income brackets FEMA identified. Households in the middle range tended to get about as much FEMA housing assistance money as the lower-income ones, or even a little less. But experts say the Hills did have something in common with the highest-income households: They had the luxury of time to pursue every dollar of federal aid that they were qualified to receive. That's because they received full pay for seven weeks while schools were closed. That allowed them to navigate FEMA's bureaucracy during a crucial time when, for many others, pursuing the aid felt insurmountable.

Our analysis looked at counties with the highest per-capita rate of households receiving FEMA aid for housing assistance, an indicator of where Helene hit people the hardest. Housing assistance includes separate buckets of money that cover both rental assistance and home repairs and rebuilding. Apart from Buncombe County — home to Asheville and by far the most urban county in the region — lower- and middle-income households overall got lower amounts of this aid compared to the highest-income earners.

In some counties, the highest-income homeowners received two to three times as much housing assistance as those with lower incomes.

Yet income isn't supposed to play a role. FEMA aid for home repairs and rebuilding is intended to help begin replacing a primary home or make it safe and habitable again, not restore one to its prior state. In theory, a couple living in a million-dollar home and another in a starter house should be eligible for the same level of assistance. For instance, couples who live alone generally would qualify for aid to cover one bedroom, one bathroom and one refrigerator, even if they had three of each.

FEMA did not respond to ProPublica and The Assembly's requests for comment. The agency previously told the Government Accountability Office, according to a 2020 report, that it encourages all survivors with property damage to apply, and those with minimal damage are “driving down the average award amount.”

Disparities in who receives FEMA aid have long been known to researchers, including Sarah Labowitz, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies and writes about disasters and publishes the Disaster Dollar Database.

“Disasters pull back the curtain on inequity,” Labowitz said. “It's a vicious combination of things that make it so much harder for people without a lot of money to get what they need from FEMA.” She pointed to FEMA inspectors who undervalue damage to more modest homes, FEMA's onerous documentation requirements and a “brutal and discouraging” appeals process.

The agency itself has also known about the problems. Several years ago, NPR obtained an internal FEMA analysis showing that the poorest homeowners received about half as much to rebuild their homes compared with higher-income homeowners. The 2020 GAO report noted that homeowners in communities with the most socioeconomic vulnerabilities, like being below the poverty line and not having a high school diploma, received significantly less assistance than those in less vulnerable communities.

The disparity we found in Yancey was equally striking in Haywood County, where water flows down 13 peaks towering above 6,000 feet. Households there making more than $175,000 typically received $11,000 in housing assistance; households below that threshold received about $5,000.

Michelle and Jeff Parker, who live about 70 miles southwest of the Hills, in Haywood, had evacuated during the storm. Like the Hills, they returned to find their house had been filled with water. They too had lost virtually everything, down to their wedding photographs.

But the Parkers had been here before. In 2023, they finished repairing their 936-square-foot home after Tropical Storm Fred's floodwaters filled it with 4 feet of water in 2021. That time, their house had been rebuilt by a state-run program. They received $50,000 from their flood insurance and just $1,644 from FEMA for rental assistance.

When Helene hit just a year after they got back into their home, they decided the risk of rebuilding was too great. Jeff, a former wastewater treatment plant operator, was on disability. Michelle was working as a medical assistant and could take only a couple of weeks off after Helene. They applied for a hazard mitigation buyout, another program offered through FEMA, instead. It would pay them the property's appraised value before the storm and turn it into green space.

But that process could take years, and their home was unlivable. They figured they would at least get rental assistance from FEMA in the meantime.

The couples' situations diverged in important ways, and they applied for different pots of FEMA housing assistance. But their journeys underscore how disaster survivors with varying resources are able to navigate FEMA's application process.

Susie and Michelle spent hours plodding through FEMA's online system, uploading documents, deciphering bureaucratic letters and making myriad phone calls to the agency.

After weeks of pestering FEMA, the Hills received just under the maximum $42,500 for home repair and rebuild assistance for damage to things like the home's walls, windows and doors, plus about $9,000 from other FEMA aid programs. The money played a critical role in helping them start rebuilding.

The Parkers received $2,210 for the first two months of rental assistance to help pay for temporary housing. Michelle continued to nag FEMA for months seeking longer-term help; the agency will pay rental assistance for up to 18 months, which could translate to an additional $7,500.

Then Jeff died from cardiac arrest in June at age 56. Michelle felt like she was operating in a fog. She couldn't handle another stressor.

So when FEMA's call wait times soared to two to three hours after the deadly Texas floods on July 4, she gave up on pursuing additional rental assistance from FEMA.

“I got tired of calling,” she said.

After disasters strike, households with lower incomes can face major challenges, beginning with the early steps of the rebuilding process, which include finding temporary housing and transportation. Some residents lack reliable internet access or cell service. They have less money to pay professionals for estimates or attorneys for advice. Throw in the added hurdles of rugged topography, and western North Carolina posed particular challenges to those faced with rebuilding after Helene.

Alicia Edwards, who directs the Disaster Relief Project for Legal Aid of North Carolina, said she wasn't surprised by our analysis, which found that in six of the 10 counties most impacted by Helene, the lowest-income households got less in FEMA's housing assistance than those at the highest income level.

“People with lower incomes are at a huge disadvantage,” Edwards said.

The application process can be onerous and overwhelming, particularly for people who just survived raging floodwaters and the destruction of their homes and communities. And it can feel downright impossible to navigate for those with less money or other resources.

In Buncombe County, our analysis found the opposite trend. The lowest-income families there typically received more housing assistance than those with higher incomes. It's also where residents tend to have better access to resources, as many regional nonprofits are based there. Pisgah Legal Services has had an office in Asheville for decades.

Several of the counties with pronounced income disparities are among the most rural counties heavily impacted by Helene. Yancey, Mitchell and Polk all have populations under 21,000.

The region also is home to both higher-income retirees, who can have more free time and more experience navigating complicated finances, and lower-income multigenerational families. In more rural areas, many of the latter tend to distrust the federal government and are reluctant to pursue assistance, said Morgan Monshaugen, disaster recovery program director with the Housing Assistance Corp., a nonprofit that serves Henderson, Polk and Transylvania counties.

The month before Helene struck, Tulane University researchers released a literature review of 25 years of research on barriers to equitable disaster recovery. They noted common themes, including the confusing aid process and challenges navigating bureaucracies. They also pointed to research that shows inspectors' biases and time pressures can play a role.

Before 2020, inspectors would go through a long checklist of items that could qualify for repair or replacement money. Someone with more things could therefore get more aid.

After FEMA changed that system, inspectors now record notes about standardized factors such as roof damage and the height of flood marks inside. The amount of damage puts a household into one of several levels, each of which determines how much and what type of repair and rebuild assistance it can get. Some households get additional money for things like heating, venting and air conditioning or septic systems.

“It shouldn't have to do with anything other than what was damaged and what was repaired,” Edwards said. But she worries biases can still creep in. “If they feel you are a credible person, they could give you a little more assistance, even subconsciously,” she said.

The agency's decisions come in the form of mailed letters, each regarding a different pot of money. Some letters might have a dollar amount granted. Others might announce denials. It isn't always obvious that survivors can appeal — an even more arduous process for many.

“It makes it impossibly hard for people to navigate,” Edwards said.

Susie Hill knew her family would need every dollar they could get to rebuild. So she filled out a FEMA application online and talked to someone at the agency by phone.

Slowly, aid from FEMA started arriving in their bank account — $3,514 first, a set amount for people displaced, then an initial $13,687 for home repair. In October, it reached about $22,000, roughly half of the $42,500 maximum in 2024 for home repair and replacement.

Then the money stopped.

As hope for more aid began to fizzle, Susie pestered FEMA. “I was anxious about getting lost in the mix of so many people across the region in need,” she said. The Hills' application was one of nearly 1.5 million that FEMA received across the six-state region devastated by Helene.

The Hills got more estimates, uploaded more documents. They set up a GoFundMe campaign that raised more than $53,000. And finally, in late November, they came close to reaching the maximum $42,500 payout from FEMA for home repairs, along with smaller amounts from the agency's other aid buckets.

“Unfortunately,” Susie said, “I think it is a bit of a socioeconomic situation where we have jobs, where we know people that know people, that maybe have money or that are able to help us, or that have the skills to help us, where other people are just trying to make it day to day.”

Yancey is home to the most families per capita — about 175, or roughly 1 in 36 homeowners — who got the top amount of FEMA home rebuild and repair assistance. Our analysis of more than 75,000 North Carolina homeowners who applied for the assistance in the counties hardest hit by Helene found roughly 1,300 homeowners, or just 1.7%, received the maximum payout.

The Hills had decided to relocate their historic house to a spot on their property farther back from the creek. The FEMA money would cover most of that cost, a critical first step toward gutting it and rebuilding.

On an icy cold day in mid-January, house movers put I-beams underneath the water-damaged structure and used hydraulic lifts to raise it. Then, they hauled it to safer ground.

A family in Tennessee donated a camper for the Hills to live in. After three months of bouncing around, they parked it near the shell of their house. Standing at the front door, to the right, they could see the vast destruction along Cattail Creek. To the left, they could watch their home slowly come back to life.

Susie had to wash their clothes at the elementary school where she works. For other things, they used water carried from a neighbor's well. Brian had to haul the contents of the toilet to the septic tank. But it was a home.

An hour's drive away, the Parkers had sought refuge during the storm at Michelle's mother's house. Jeff had fractured his ankle two months before the storm and used a wheelchair. They weren't taking chances after fleeing their home under darkness — Michelle carrying their two Chihuahuas, one under each arm — when Tropical Storm Fred hit three years earlier.

When they returned home after Helene, their shed was gone. Instead, other people's structures lay in their yard. Inside, the contents looked like everything had been spun around. Their refrigerator lay on its side. The washing machine sat wedged on top of the dryer.

“It ruined everything — everything,” Michelle said. “I was ready to just die right there. I was like, I can't go through this again.”

A friend set up a GoFundMe, which raised $1,875. The Parkers' flood insurance paid out $80,000, far below the $209,000 the home had been appraised for a year before. Michelle remembers FEMA offering a free hotel, more than 60 miles away in Tennessee, a distance made farther as Helene's waters took out parts of Interstate 40. Michelle and Jeff were grateful to receive a donated camper to live in. But their property still had no water or electricity, and they had to rent a place to park it.

The rent for that gravel parking space is $900 a month. Donors paid half, but Michelle has to come up with the rest.

Michelle turned to FEMA. She requested more rental assistance and uploaded an employer letter, a rental agreement, utility bills and a rent receipt. She called FEMA repeatedly.

FEMA has faced years of criticism from people applying for assistance. Chief among their complaints: inconsistent payouts, the onerous application process, incomprehensible communication and confusing rules.

Jeremiah Isom lost his home and work tools in the Yancey County floodwaters and has since been living here and there. He's struggled to find a job and has grappled with a FEMA application, complicated by deaths in his family and property ownership issues. It doesn't help that he's reluctant to ask for help, much less aggressively seek it from the federal government. Just plowing through each day is hard enough.

“Everyone is so eaten up with PTSD,” Isom said. “It's got your head so scrambled.”

FEMA has been working on improving its application process. From 2021 to 2024, it announced changes aimed at improving access and equity, including making home repair money available to underinsured households. Another change cut an onerous rule requiring applicants to first apply for a U.S. Small Business Administration loan, which approved less than 4% of all applicants from 2016 to 2018.

Before President Donald Trump took office in January, FEMA also had spent more than a year hiring a team of engineers, designers and product managers to help modernize the online application process. They faced a key challenge: The back-end system that runs much of the process at disasterassistance.gov is 27 years old.

A key problem is that when survivors check their application status, they often see simply that it's pending. They get no indication of where the application is in the process or why. The FEMA team was working to change that.

Michael Coen, the agency's chief of staff when the team was formed, noted that people are used to going on Amazon and getting updates about when their order is out for delivery and when it's about to arrive. Coen said survivors wonder, “Why can't FEMA do that?”

Yet since the Trump administration began slashing the agency's workforce, the team focusing on improvements to the online application process has disintegrated. In January, the team had at least 10 people. Now, it's down to two. The rest took the deferred resignation offer or were pushed from their posts, current and former FEMA employees told ProPublica and The Assembly.

“They all are gone,” said Alexandra Ferčak, who until May was chief of service delivery enhancement, part of a relatively new office at FEMA. Her team worked closely with the digital team. “We had so much knowledge and expertise, it was unprecedented,” she said.

Without that in-house expertise, major changes are “not going to be effective,” said a FEMA employee who worked with the team but asked not to be named out of fear of retribution.

FEMA did not respond to questions about the team. But in late August, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed a public letter to Congress warning that cuts to the agency's full-time staff risk kneecapping its disaster response capabilities.

In response, Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes FEMA, said she is working hard to “streamline this bloated organization into a tool that actually benefits Americans in crisis.” The agency then suspended most who had signed their names to the letter.

The Hills had their house moved back from Cattail Creek and temporarily propped up until they could get a new foundation laid. But the foundation work depended on the weather, which was varying degrees of terrible all winter.

Heavy rain triggered flashbacks to Helene, and in February it poured. But one Sunday morning, the Hills turned on the gas fireplace in their camper as the temperatures plummeted and the gray rain turned to snowflakes. Despite the gloom outside, they were gleeful.

A retired contractor from Texas volunteering his skills had become the guiding force in their rebuilding. Volunteers from other states also showed up to help. A group from a church in Georgia who work in construction had just visited. They asked what the Hills wanted in their house.

The Hills mostly wanted to add a bathroom so that their daughter, Lucy, who was 9 at the time, would have her own. The men would try to add one. When they left, the Hills went out to dinner using a gift card and declared it the best day ever, or at least something that had been hard to come by since the storm: a great day.

A few months later, a feeling of hope spread across western North Carolina as the dogwoods and redbuds bloomed in puffs of purple and white. Dandelions dotted patches of grass amid the persistent brown muck of mud and fallen trees. Friends and volunteers became fixtures at the Hills' house. They depended on so much kindness from people. Brian spent every spare minute working on repairs as well.

Without that initial FEMA money, the Hills' wrecked house might still be sitting in the moonscape of mud and destruction that persists along Cattail Creek. Instead, as summer waned, the house had electricity, siding, floors, insulation, drywall — and a bathroom for Lucy.

On this one-year anniversary of Helene's destruction, the Hills expect to move back in any day. Thousands of others aren't even close.

Michelle now lives alone in the camper. For the past year, donors have been paying half the rent for the lot where she parks the camper. In November, that assistance will come to an end. Michelle has a job working with autistic children but cannot afford the $900 a month on her own.

“It's just a gravel spot,” she said.

Like the Hills, Michelle credits friends and nonprofits for getting her through the last year. “They just swarmed in and started helping — and lots of them,” she said.

In the spring, Mountain Projects, a local nonprofit that provided the camper, offered her a discounted modular home and a plot of land. Other nonprofits like United Way and Salvation Army have offered to help cover some of the home's expenses, but Michelle still must come up with $81,000 not yet covered by her insurance or donations.

The buyout program she applied for would pay her the fair market value of her home before the storm, minus her insurance payout. But if she is approved, it could be years before she sees that money. “I'm worried,” she said.

She and Jeff were preapproved for a mortgage loan, but without his income, she isn't sure she will still qualify. Michelle is thankful for so much help. But a year after Helene, moving into a permanent home feels more unreachable than ever.

The US treasury is planning to mint a $1 coin featuring Donald Trump to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.

Draft designs show Mr Trump's side-profile, surrounded by the word “liberty”. The opposite side depicts Mr Trump standing with a clenched fist in front of an American flag and the words “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT”, which he shouted after surviving the assassination attempt last year.

Although a final design has not yet been decided on, the coin is intended to reflect the “enduring spirit” of America, a treasury department spokesman told Politico.

“Despite the radical Left's forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before,” said the spokesman.

“While a final $1 coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States' semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.”

Congress passed a law in 2020 authorising the treasury to issue $1 coins during the 2026 calendar year to celebrate the nation's anniversary. Under the law, the design of the coin should be “emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial”.

Brandon Beach, the US treasurer, confirmed reports about the proposed coin were accurate, writing on X: “No fake news here. These first drafts honouring America's 250th birthday and @POTUS are real.

“Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.”

US law currently prohibits the image of living presidents from adorning the country's money. Presidents may only feature on a coin two or more years after they have died, according to the US code governing coin design.

Minting a coin with the president's face on it is the latest effort by the Trump administration to re-cast American cultural institutions in his image.

Mr Trump has redecorated the Oval Office with gold flourishes, paved over the White House Rose Garden and is building a $200m (£148m) ballroom at the property, which he referred to as a “gift to the country”.

Republicans have also introduced a bill to rename the Kennedy Centre, which Mr Trump took over as chairman in February, the “Donald J Trump Centre for Performing Arts”.

Responding to questions about the ceremonial coin on Friday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters she wasn't sure whether Mr Trump was aware of the plans.

“I'm not sure if he's seen it but I'm sure he'll love it,” she said

Opposing ICE in the US while backing genocide in Gaza is senseless. These struggles are intertwined.

On July 12, 2025, Homeland Security agents shoved Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) out the door of a department press conference when he tried to ask a question of Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. The secretary had deployed hundreds of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the sanctuary city of Los Angeles, where they unleashed tear gas on outraged residents. Video of security agents in LA knocking Padilla to the ground, ordering him to “lay flat” while handcuffing him, went viral on social media. Overnight, the son of Mexican immigrants became a symbol of resistance to MAGA race hatred.

Yet, three weeks later, the liberal darling would join Adam Schiff, California's other senator and one of the biggest recipients of AIPAC largess, to vote against Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vermont) resolution to block nearly $676 million in weapons to Israel. In the midst of overwhelming U.S. public opposition — including 92 percent of Democratic Party voters — to Israel's military onslaught in Gaza, Padilla sided with a minority of Senate Democrats to continue arming a genocide so inhumane it led to the coining of a new humanitarian crisis term: “Wounded Child, No Surviving Family” (WCNSF).

It was as though the ICE raids at home were separate and apart from Israel's bombardment and mass starvation of 2 million people in Gaza. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Despite the presence of Palestinian flags at ICE protests, lawmakers and mainstream Democrats often refuse to make the clear connection between ICE agents ethnically cleansing U.S. militarized communities and Israeli soldiers ethnically cleansing occupied Palestine. 

In actuality, the Trump administration and the Israeli government are operating from the same playbook to realize their vision of ethnic or racial supremacy. For Donald Trump and his MAGA base, the goal is a white, Christian, cisgender America where the country's past crimes — Indigenous genocide, African slavery, racial segregation, Japanese incarceration — are erased from the classroom, from the history books, and from the collective memory; for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters, the goal is an ever-expanding Jewish supremacist state purged of Palestinians, their expulsion never taught nor acknowledged, their culture — from falafel to dabke to oud music — appropriated to erase all signs of Palestine, only to resurface under the false name of “Israeli culture.” In this playbook, Israel's critics are labeled antisemites in order to shut down debate.

In 2017, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) launched the Deadly Exchange campaign to 

sever the decades-long collaboration between U.S. law enforcement and the Israeli military. JVP said its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests revealed that well over a thousand police, sheriffs and federal agents, including the FBI, ICE, and Homeland Security, had flown to Israel for training in surveillance, racial profiling, crowd control, detention, and deportation. 

In 2018, Researching the American-Israeli Alliance (RAIA), in partnership with JVP, produced “Deadly Exchange: The Dangerous Consequences of American Law Enforcement in Israel.” In this report, the authors examined how U.S. law enforcement in Israel studied visual monitoring in public places, internet surveillance, racial profiling of communities of color, treatment of protesters as enemy combatants and coordination of media reporting on state-sponsored violence.

Eran Efrati, then executive director of RAIA, told Al Jazeera in 2020 that U.S. law enforcement who travelled to Israel witnessed “live demonstrations of repressive violence in real-time, in protests across the West Bank, patrols in East Jerusalem, and visits to the Gaza border.” 

This was not an intercontinental Zoom call. This was on-the-ground modeling and information sharing. Efrati told Al Jazeera, “Delegates meet with the Shin Bet and chief officers in Israeli military prisons to discuss investigation tactics, with Palestinian Authority agents and police, to learn about how Israel uses their collaboration in suppressing Palestinian dissent.”

JVP's FOIA requests revealed that, in 2015, Peter Edge, then the associate director of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, accepted an invitation from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to attend a “counterterrorism” seminar in Israel. FOIA requests also turned up ADL documents in which Edge, prior to visiting Israel, said he was looking forward to “learning more about how the law enforcement community manages perpetual and elevated threat levels, both internally and from neighboring countries, how/whether they are effective, and how those techniques can be applied more broadly.”

Both the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Israeli Ministry of Defense exploit religious doctrine to legitimize their aims and couch their crimes in lofty yet chilling language.

On the eve of Israel's October 2023 ground invasion of Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invoked the biblical image of the nomadic nation of Amalek, which — according to the ancient text — ambushed exhausted Israelites escaping slavery under Egypt's Pharaoh. During a televised press conference, Netanyahu boasted about the determination of Israeli soldiers to avenge the murders of October 7th. “They are committed to eradicating this evil from the world,” he said. “Remember what Amalek did to you,” he added, quoting the biblical tale of how Amalekites killed the weakest Israelites — the old, the sick — before Moses could lead his people to the Promised Land of Canaan.

On the eve of Passover in April 2024, six months into Israel's slaughter in Gaza, Netanyahu delivered a speech in which he compared Hamas to the brutal Egyptian Pharaoh, who in the Book of Exodus calls on Egyptians to hurl Hebrew boys into the Nile River.

In reference to Hamas, Netanyahu exhorted, “It hardens its heart, and refuses to let our people go. Therefore, we will land additional and painful plagues upon it — and this will happen soon.” Though Netanyahu never calls himself the modern-day Moses, he alludes to the analogy when he speaks of the Hebrew prophet who, as the Torah describes, stretched out his hand to part the Red Sea so Israelites could escape the Pharaoh's army.

Similarly, the Facebook page of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), depicts immigration agents as saviors protecting the people from dark forces. In a recruitment video, men in military uniforms — helmets, infrared night vision goggles, holding big guns — hunt down faceless people hidden in the shadows of some underground hell.

Ominous music plays in the background. A caption reads, “THE WICKED FLEE WHEN NO MAN PURSUETH; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION.” (Proverbs 28:1) In the Old Testament, the sage Solomon teaches that the wicked are fearful and constantly on edge, while the righteous are confident and courageous because they walk with God at their side. 

In other words, “wicked” people — non-U.S. citizens on U.S. soil — can only hide underground in the shadows for so long; eventually the fierce lion, the border patrol agent, whose point of view we share in the video, will hunt them like cornered prey.

One need not be a Madison Avenue huckster to understand why politicians and their PR teams grab the Bible to promote otherwise repugnant messages. The Old Testament lends authority, gravitas and the Lord's nod to racist propaganda while the propagators build rapport between the institutional power and the fanatical base. In this case, the base is white supremacists, Zionist Jews, and the estimated 30 million Christian fundamentalists in the U.S.

If the Trump administration envisions a white Christian nation, it need only look to Israel for a model of an ethno-supremacist state that institutionalizes racial profiling to subjugate an entire population.

In Gaza, Israel indiscriminately bombs and starves civilians simply for the crime of being Palestinian, blocking hundreds of truckloads of water, food, and medicine. On October 9, 2023, two days after the Hamas-led raid into Israel, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said, “I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” adding, “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”

Israel also targets Palestinians on the basis of their ethnicity in Occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israel's massive biometric surveillance network — 1,000 cameras with AI-driven software — tracks, monitors and spies on Palestinians in public spaces, including checkpoints, where Palestinians' faces are scanned without their permission or even knowledge. 

Israel calls this Orwellian system Red Wolf, in keeping with similar names for Israel's other surveillance technologies, such as Wolf Pack, a gargantuan database that profiles Palestinians, including photos of their family members, and Blue Wolf, a smartphone app that sends Israeli soldiers a color-coded signal to order the Palestinian either detained or free to pass.

In 2016, following a mass shooting in Florida, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump took a cue from Israel, telling Face the Nation that the U.S. must consider racial profiling: “Other countries do it, you look at Israel and you look at others, they do it and they do it successfully.” 

In July 2025, Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, went a step further to endorse racial profiling while appearing on Fox News: “Look, people need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol, they don't need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them. They just need the totality of the circumstances, right?”

Wrong. A Central California lower court ruled that prohibited agencies like ICE and CBP from arresting and detaining people based on their race or ethnicity, language, or accent. After the Trump administration kicked and screamed and appealed the lower court ruling, the US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, sided with the White House to lift the temporary restraining order that restricted immigration agents from racially profiling. The high court ruling was issued as an emergency stay of the lower court ruling, leaving the underlying case unresolved as masked ICE agents abducted brown people in broad daylight.

Ethnic supremacists in Israel and the United States rely on the tech behemoths — Google, Palantir, Amazon, Microsoft, and Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons developer — to surveil the movements of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories, as well as the movements of immigrant communities and Palestinian rights activists in the United States. 

Since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and CBP, has signed $235 million in contracts with Elbit Systems. That includes a $23.9 million contract with Elbit's U.S. subsidiary for new surveillance towers, complete with cameras and radar systems, for an integrated virtual border wall, awarded during former President Joe Biden's tenure. Sam Chambers, a research associate at the University of Arizona, notes that immigrants wishing to avoid the virtual wall traverse isolated and mountainous paths, where some never make it out alive.

Another DHS-Elbit contract for night vision goggles would allow the CPB to track immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexican border in darkness or fog. The words “REAL. RAPID. READY.” are headlined across Elbit America's website that boasts of AI-powered technology for a 98 percent detection rate of illegal border crossings. “Our fully autonomous systems are field-proven, rapidly deployed, and ready today,” reads the website.

While Elbit positions itself as the “warrior” protecting the border from invaders, Google adopts a more nuanced approach to high-tech surveillance of people resisting colonization. Google engineer recruitment ads tout cultural pride and innovation, not facilitation of Israel's military's occupation.

Google's 86,000-square-foot Tel Aviv campus, featuring panoramic views, colorful rooms and recessed lighting, occupies eight floors of a building with a mythological name: Electra Tower, named after the Greek mythological figure. In the Oresteia trilogy, Electra plots with her brother to kill their mother for conspiring to kill their father. At the Tel Aviv campus, employees who develop AI technology for the Israeli military can avail themselves of yoga and wellness classes.

In the United States, however, Google employees are anything but well.Since April 2024, Google has fired 50 employees for conducting sit-ins at offices in California and New York. Organized by No Tech for Apartheid, the protesters demanded Google abandon Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract Google and Amazon signed in 2021 to provide Israel with AI-driven cloud computing. Critics charge the technology is used to surveil Palestinians in the West Bank and select bombing targets in Gaza.

Follow the money all the way to the Arizona-Mexico border. In April 2025, The Intercept reported that Google will collaborate with the Trump administration to provide a central database for video surveillance at an upgraded “50 towers with up to 100 cameras across 6 sites in the Tucson Sector.” Although CPB is tasked with arresting immigrants at the border, the agency also shares its data with ICE for abductions, detentions, and deportations in the interior, 100 miles from the Mexican border.

Co-founded by billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel, Palantir collaborates with intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense for war and surveillance. In June 2025, the Department of Defense, according to The Software Report, signed a $1.3 billion contract for Palantir's Project Maven, which analyzes drone footage of so-called enemy combatants to “enable units to make hundreds of real-time decisions per hour using AI-driven tools.”

UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese released a report in June 2025, calling out the “corporate machinery” of 48 companies profiting from complicity in Israel's occupation and genocide in Palestine. According to Albanese's research, there was “reasonable grounds” to believe Palantir supplied Israel with predictive policing software to make on-the-spot battlefield decisions, including to generate hit lists through AI systems with benign sounding names like “Lavender,” “Gospel,” and “Where's Daddy?”

Palantir co-founder Alex Karp, the self-described “progressive warrior” and son of civil rights activists, appears unfazed by accusations of complicity in genocide. Celebrating a stock market valuation of Palantir at $300 billion, Karp told investors in February 2025, “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and when it's necessary to scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” 

For Karp, Thiel, and other co-founders, the cash keeps rolling in, as the Trump administration awards Palantir a “$30M contract to track ‘self-deportations' and identify priority deportation cases, particularly visa overstays.”

In a victory for insurgent tech workers, Microsoft announced on September 18, 2025, that it would no longer allow Israel's elite cyberwarfare agency Unit 8200 to employ its cloud products to conduct mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. A blog post from Microsoft President Brad Smith came after an investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine and Local Call, a Hebrew news site, revealed that the Israeli military intelligence unit for signals intelligence, decryption, and cyberwarfare had relied on Microsoft technology to store recordings of Palestinian civilian cell phone calls that would otherwise overload Israel's storage systems. The goal of Unit 8200? Store “a million calls an hour.”

The reporters' investigation followed protests by the worker-led “No Tech for Apartheid,” as well as another group called No Azure for Apartheid, named after Microsoft's “Azure” cloud computing program. The organization posted on Instagram in August 2025 that current and former employees of Microsoft, Google, and Oracle occupied the offices of Microsoft President Smith at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters. The post read, “This is part of a global call for the Worker Intifada: an uprising of workers who refuse to allow their labor to be used for genocide.”

No Azure for Apartheid demanded Microsoft cut ties with Israel and pay reparations to Palestinian victims. Seven people were arrested, with another 18 later rounded up on trespassing and malicious mischief charges after allegedly splashing red paint, symbolizing blood, over the company's stone sculpture logo in Microsoft's Redmond plaza, where a makeshift body bag also doused in red paint sat atop the base of the sculpture. 

No Tech for ICE, a project of the intersectional Latinx organization Mijente, organizes with college students to stop Big Tech's career recruitment for the deportation and surveillance industries. Another resistance campaign, Purge Palantir, argues Palantir seeks to “lay the groundwork for algorithmic governance via a system built and controlled entirely by them.” In a San Jose Mercury op-ed, Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the collaboration between Palantir and the Trump administration for personal data capture was “a dream scenario for both authoritarians and thieves.”

In California, rank-and-file teachers have launched CalSTRS Divest from Genocide to petition the country's second largest pension fund, sitting atop a $374 billion teacher portfolio, to sell off its Palantir shares, valued at $79 million, and its General Dynamics (Elbit subcontractor) shares valued at $115 million, among others. Endorsed by United Teachers Los Angeles and the California Federation of Teachers, the CalSTRS Divest 4 Palestine campaign is not taking no for an answer after receiving a letter from CalSTRS “respectfully” declining further meetings to discuss divestment. “This is not over for us until CalSTRS takes meaningful action to end its complicity in the Gaza genocide,” reads the campaign's Instagram account.

In the UK, Palestine Action — which the government has proscribed under purportedly anti-terror laws – occupied Elbit's rooftop and blockaded its facilities, while activists in the U.S. chased an Elbit subsidiary out of Cambridge, Mass. The subsidiary's exit followed months of pro-Palestinian protests, in which outraged residents brought signs that read, “Shut Elbit the F*** Down” and “Elbit Profits from Genocide.”

Meanwhile, Amnesty International in Europe is sounding the alarm over Paragon Solutions's Graphite spyware, which the human rights group says targets journalists by infecting electronic devices to access text messages. Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, co-founded Paragon with Ehud Schneorson, a former commander of the Israeli military's cyber warfare agency Unit 8200. Undeterred, the Trump administration announced in 2025 that it will move ahead on a stalled contract with Paragon Solutions for spyware to hack into cell phones and read messages on encrypted apps like Signal. 

It is time to break free from our movement silos and connect the dots.

Trump and his billionaire cronies want to make the United States into a white Christian nation, just as Netanyahu and his fellow Zionists want Israel to be a Jewish supremacist state. Their soft power lies in biblical analogies and victim narratives; their hard power in a wired dystopia ruled by billionaire tech bros, evangelical fanatics and grifter politicians.

Activists must show how these two fascist plots are interwoven by issuing a unified call for demilitarization and decolonization. “No Kings Day” protests must broaden their scope to challenge the U.S. surveillance state that targets the innocent abroad and at home. Take the signs that scream, “No Kings in America, No fascists in America” to the doorsteps of Google and Amazon to unmask their alliance with authoritarians in the U.S. and Israel.

No longer should politicians — like Senators Padilla, Schiff, or marathon emoter Cory Booker — get away with challenging ICE raids while voting to arm Israel's genocide in Gaza. Make these performance artists say, “Genocide!” Demand federal, state and local electeds refuse money from AIPAC and other organizations in the orbit of the Israel lobby. No platforms for the PEP — Progressive Except for Palestine — lawmakers who rail against Trump while pushing censorship legislation in California and elsewhere to police instruction on Palestine.

No union campaign endorsements for genocide funders and duplicitous censors who conflate antisemitism with criticism of Israel. 

The ruse is over.

Homeland security secretary takes aim at city's mayor who has called deployment of national guard ‘unhinged'

Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, called Chicago “a war zone” on Sunday after federal agents shot a woman and the governor of Illinois accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday morning, Noem took aim at the city's mayor, Brandon Johnson, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's Ice raids and deployment of the national guard in Illinois, a measure he called “unhinged and unhealthy”.

“It's wrong, there should be consequences for that and for leaders that stand up and knowingly lie about the situation on the ground,” Noem said. “His city is a war zone and he's lying so that criminals can go in there and destroy people's lives.”

Noem's remarks followed Trump's authorization to deploy 300 members of the Illinois national guard to Chicago, with orders to protect federal officers and property. The move came just weeks after national guard troops were sent to Washington, where the president federalized the city's police force in what he described as a “crackdown” on crime, a pattern now extending to a string of other US cities. “We're going to be doing Chicago probably next,” Trump had said at the time.

Noem defended the administration's course of action, insisting on Fox that residents supported the government intervention. “They understand that where we have gone we have made it much more free,” she said. “People are much safer, we have got a thousand criminals that are off the streets of Chicago, just because we've been there.”

Appearing on CNN's State of the Union with Jake Tapper on Sunday, the Democratic Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. “They are the ones who are making it a war zone,” he said.

“They need to get out of Chicago. If they're not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they are going to do, they need to get the heck out.”

Border patrol agents on Saturday shot and injured a woman while firing at someone who tried to run them over. The woman who was shot was a US citizen and was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, noting that the woman was accused in a US Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin last week of doxing agents.

Pritzker also condemned the deployment in a post on X on Saturday, writing: “The Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.” Pritzker called the decision “absolutely outrageous and un-American,” and added that it had been made “against our will”.

Kyiv's Independence Square has turned into a makeshift memorial for Ukrainians killed in the last three years of war.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

KYIV, Ukraine — During his speech at the U.N. General Assembly on September 24, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged world leaders to take action to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end as it has created “the most destructive arms race in human history.”

Both Russia and Ukraine, more than three years into a war that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, are doubling down on their spending on military technology, as any slight improvement in drone warfare technology has the potential to shift the balance of power. Still, as of now, the front in the east of Ukraine is largely frozen; with the constant threat of drone attacks and the reality of a new age of warfare slowing advances, Russia has continued its attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine's largest cities, including its capital, Kyiv. 

President Donald Trump hosted a controversial summit in Anchorage, Alaska, with Russian President Vladimir Putin in August in an attempt to secure an end to the war, which he promised during his campaign to be able to do “in 24 hours.” However, Trump's relationship with Putin has soured, after, in his words, he realized Putin was talking “a lot of bullshit” on Ukraine. Amidst stalled negotiations and Russia's provocation of NATO countries by flying fighter jets and drones into Estonian and Polish airspace, respectively, the European continent is on edge, waiting to see if there will be further escalation.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

However, on the ground in Kyiv, the story is different. During the day, it is hard to imagine that the country is in the midst of a full-scale war. Cafes are bustling in the downtown Shevchenkivskyi District, and even at night, when the risk of a drone or missile attack is heightened, families walk down the streets with their pets. Three years into the war, Ukrainians have grown accustomed to the reality of regular air raid alerts, and many, even when there is an alarm, choose not to head to the shelters. 

On the table during the U.S.-led peace talks in August was the prospect of an immediate ceasefire along the entire frontline — which Russia was hesitant to agree to due to its slow by steady territorial gains. Zelenskyy has stated that Ukraine is determined to recapture all territory it has lost to Russia since 2014, including occupied Crimea. Russia currently controls about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, but claims much more, including Luhansk and Donetsk, two provinces in Ukraine's East, which Russia has demanded full control of in exchange for ending the war.

Whatever the outcome of the U.S.-led talks, what is clear is that Ukrainian civilians have continued to pay the price for Russia's full-scale invasion. Kyiv, which is located far into the heart of Ukrainian territory, is subject to almost daily air raids as Russia continues its aerial bombardment campaign. Early in the war, Russia would launch frequent waves of drones and missiles in small quantities, but as the war dragged on and took a significant toll on Russia's economy, its tactics shifted to coordinating larger and more precise strikes, but less frequently. 

At the end of August, Russia launched a strike on Kyiv that killed 18 civilians and was widely condemned by the international community, drawing even rebuke from President Trump, who said he was “not happy”  about the attack.

Kyiv's Independence Square, which was the site of the mass demonstrations in 2013 and 2014 that forced then-President Viktor Yanukovych out of power, has turned into a makeshift memorial for Ukrainians killed during the last three years of war. Ukrainian flags and portraits of the dead dot the plaza, as Ukrainians continue to gather and mourn the devastating cost of the war.

Some Ukrainians are uncertain about what is slowly becoming a forever war. Polina, 17, who was visiting Kyiv on a guided day trip, said, “We really hope the war ends as soon as possible, by any means. And the buildings, and everything that was destroyed, we want it to be preserved and restored quickly.” According to a recent Gallup poll, 69 percent of Ukrainians would prefer a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible

The reality is that without both the rhetorical and logistical support from the U.S. and its allies, Ukraine would not be able to sustain any resistance to Russia's growing occupation of Ukrainian territory. The front has shifted slowly westward over the past month, as, despite Ukrainian counteroffensives, Russia has continued to gain territory, kilometer by kilometer in the Eastern provinces, where the majority of the fighting has taken place.

The prevailing sentiment that I heard for myself at Independence Square was quite different from what polling found, perhaps due to area's status as an unofficial site of memorial. Ukrainians I spoke with remain steadfast in their commitment to gain back the territory lost to Russia since the start of the invasion in 2022. What was incredibly clear from speaking with various Ukrainians on the plaza is that, despite the fatigue from living in a country at war for the past three years, many feel they cannot accept land concessions — not after the cost they have paid for the war, the donations to soldiers and their families, and the struggles to the Ukrainian economy as it grapples with a labor shortage. 

Marina, 28, who was visiting the plaza from Odessa, a city located a six-hour drive to the south of Kyiv, said, “They want to destroy us without conditions, that's what negotiations are becoming. Every decision and negotiation has great significance when those deals try to eliminate us as a nation.”

For Ukrainians, the war is a struggle against an impending “Ukrainian genocide,” as multiple Ukrainians with whom I spoke described it, so in their view, there is no other option than to keep fighting. Valeriy Petrovych Ustynenko, 73, who has two sons fighting in the Ukrainian military, said, “But if the time comes, when even people like me, people my age, have to go to the front, then we will fight.”

Ukrainian men aged between 25 and 60 are currently eligible for conscription into the Ukrainian military, and since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has maintained a travel ban on Ukrainian men between 18 to 60 years of age, regardless of  whether or not they are eligible for conscription, preventing them from leaving the country. The conscription policy has grown contentious  in Ukraine, as the death toll grows and the reality of a war entering its third year with no end in sight becomes clearer. To appease critics, President Zelenskyy lifted the travel ban for 18- to 22-year-olds in September, in the hope that they would choose to remain in the country, study, instead of fleeing abroad never to return. 

During the interview, Ustynenko, who was on the verge of tears, was adamant that he was willing to pay whatever cost it would take to defeat Russia, but that the U.S. and its allies must keep the promises made to Ukraine. “I know one fact: The U.S. promised to help us, and now, something is missing,” he said, referring to Trump's decision to pause U.S. military aid to Ukraine in March.

Natalia, 54, who is from Kharkiv, a city located on the frontlines of the conflict in the East, said, “We need protection, military protection, not just humanitarian aid, not just sympathy.” 

Elina, 52, who lives on the outskirts of Kyiv, which is subject to more frequent bombardment than the city center, said during an interview with Truthout, “All those speeches by Trump, they're a bit strange, absolutely strange. Because it seems like his decisions depend on where he had lunch or dinner. And that's very sad, honestly. It's very painful.”

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, at least 6.9 million Ukrainians have been externally displaced by the fighting, fleeing to neighboring countries such as Romania and Moldova, and 3.7 remain internally displaced, forced to flee their homes in the Eastern provinces due to the heavy fighting. According to UN estimates, the war has also claimed the lives of thousands of civilians, and injured many more.

The war continues to drag on, but as Natalia said, “We are hard-working people, and we have the vision to protect our country.”

Israel and Hamas prepared for indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, as hopes for a possible ceasefire in Gaza began to build after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a truce and hostage release could be announced this week.

U.S. President Donald Trump has welcomed the militant group's statement accepting some elements of the U.S. peace plan. Israel has said it supported the new U.S. effort. Under the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages – about 20 believed to be alive – within three days. It would give up power and disarm.

Monday's discussions will focus on the proposed exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, Egypt's foreign ministry said. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is joining the talks, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief reporters.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the current situation is “the closest we've come to getting all of the hostages released.” But he warned that “there are a lot of opportunities here for whoever wants to sabotage it to do so.”

Netanyahu says he hopes to announce release of hostages from Gaza ‘in the coming days'

Speaking on ABC's This Week, he described two phases after Hamas accepts Trump's framework: The hostages are released and Israel pulls back in Gaza to the “yellow line,” where it was in August.

Rubio told CBS that Hamas should release hostages as they are ready, and that bombardment needs to end so they can be released.

The U.S. plan also addresses Gaza's future. In a text exchange with CNN's Jake Tapper, Trump said there would be “complete obliteration” if Hamas stayed in power there. Trump also texted that Netanyahu was on board for ending the bombing and peace in Gaza but added, “soon on the rest.”

“I hope that we are closest to a hostage deal since the (ceasefire) deal in January,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said in a speech Sunday.

Anxious relatives of hostages gathered near Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, with some urging Trump to continue to apply pressure. Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza City led many to fear for the hostages' lives.

“We cannot allow such a historic agreement to be sacrificed again,” said Michel Ilouz, father of Guy Ilouz.

As hundreds of thousands of people marched across several European cities and elsewhere Sunday in support of Palestinians, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issued a joint statement welcoming steps toward a possible ceasefire.

In backing Hamas' willingness to hand over the running of Gaza to a transitional committee, the ministers called for an “immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal.”

They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank and reaching an agreement on security leading to a “full Israeli withdrawal” from Gaza.

Rubio told ABC that decisions regarding a governing structure or international group to manage Gaza can take place simultaneously with the first step of the ceasefire.

“That's the part that I think is going to be a little tougher to work through, but that's what's going to provide permanency to the end of the conflict,” he said.

Trump has ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza, but residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the territory.

“While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time,” Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Badrosian told journalists. She also said Netanyahu is in “regular contact” with Trump and that the prime minister has stressed that the talks in Egypt “will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for manoeuvres that will delay talks by Hamas.”

At least eight people were killed Sunday in multiple strikes in Gaza City, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the casualties.

Four other people were shot dead near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the shooting and did not immediately comment on the strikes.

“We're on the brink, and we don't know whether one will die of a strike or starvation,” said Mahmoud Hashem, a Palestinian father sheltering in a tent in Gaza City.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war reached 67,139 on Sunday, with nearly 170,000 injured. The ministry does not differentiate how many of those killed were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up about half of the dead. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

The Israeli military said Saturday it is continuing to work to dismantle Hamas infrastructure across the strip and warned residents not to return to northern Gaza.

The US president's recent behavior is strange to many, from reposting a false AI video of himself to confusing comments during press conferences

To many observers, both in the US and abroad, Donald Trump has been behaving strangely recently. Especially online.

As a government shutdown loomed in the US last week, the president posted an AI video which depicted Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black House minority leader, wearing a sombrero and exaggerated moustache, with mariachi music playing in the background.

Hispanic groups criticized Trump's posts as “racist”, “dangerous” and “reprehensible”, but Trump doubled down, posting a new video which showed himself wearing a sombrero and playing the guitar behind a rendering of Jeffries.

It wasn't the only situation where Trump's behavior has seemed unusual. Last weekend Trump reposted to Truth Social an AI-generated fake video which promoted “med bed hospitals”. Trump has reposted AI content before, but the difference was that this video showed an AI version of himself speaking.

“Every American will soon receive their own med bed card,” the AI rendering of Trump, apparently seated in the Oval Office, said. “With it, you'll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world.”

Setting aside the fact that the idea of “med beds” is a rightwing conspiracy theory – one version of the theory posits that the government and/or a group of wealthy Americans have access to medical bed-like devices that can cure almost every illness, but are withholding the technology – Trump's post prompted a number of questions.

Did Trump, 79, believe that the video really showed him announcing med bed hospitals? Does the president think he gave a speech about med beds at the White House? Does he believe that his government is about to send “med bed cards” to every US citizen?

The post was ultimately deleted, but it remains baffling, and the White House's response did little to allay the confusion.

“I think the president saw the video and posted it, and then took it down,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said when asked about the video on Wednesday.

“And he has the right to do that. It's his social media. He's incredibly transparent, as you all know. You hear from him directly on social media. He likes to share memes, he likes to share videos, he likes to repost things that he sees other people post on social media as well and I think it's quite refreshing that we have a president who is so open and honest.”

Leavitt's words did little to explain Trump's thinking as to why he might have posted the fake video. But, in truth, it was only the most recent example of increasingly odd behavior from Trump, who has – like his predecessor Joe Biden – been subject to questions over his mental acuity in recent months.

In a recent speech at the White House where Trump claimed – against most existing evidence – that Tylenol could contribute to autism if women take it during pregnancy, Trump confusingly spoke of “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby”.

Announcing that 13 grants would be awarded to investigate autism, Trump added: “They have to move quickly. They, they – when the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let's do it now. I was just saying to Bobby [health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr] and the group, let's do it now. Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”

A week earlier, during a press conference with British prime minister Keir Starmer, Trump confused Albania with Armenia when discussing a peace deal struck between Armenia and Azerbaijan – a mistake Trump also made during an appearance on Fox News.

Back in the social media world, on Sunday Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had “been briefed” on a shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan which killed four people. “The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do,” Trump wrote.

He did indeed post again. But it was not an update on the still unfolding tragedy in Michigan. Instead, three hours later, he shared a video which showed an array of gold fixtures and fittings.

“Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House. Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, ‘freak out' when they see the quality and beauty. Best Oval Office ever, in terms of success and look!!! President DJT,” he wrote.

He did not comment again that day on the Michigan shooting, although he did complain about the new NFL kickoff rule.

Setting aside Trump's confusing online behavior, the president's in-person appearances have also become odd.

On Tuesday, Trump summoned the country's top military commanders to a meeting in Virginia. Addressing the top military brass, Trump, sounding drained, touted his alleged successes and lauded the US bombing of an Iran nuclear facility – something which may have violated international law – before saying:

“America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy's falling down stairs.”

Trump continued: “I said: ‘It's not our president. We can't have it.' I'm very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I'm on stairs, like these stairs, I'm very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn't work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.

“We don't want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don't have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don't, don't bop down the stairs. That's the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I've never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he'd go down the stairs, wouldn't hold on. I said, it's great, I don't want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”

In the same speech, Trump claimed that cities including San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles are “very unsafe places and we're going to straighten them out one by one”. The president then casually mentioned that he had told Pete Hegseth, the newly-annointed secretary of war, that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military”.

The address prompted immediate concern, including from former military members. Barry McCaffrey, a retired general, told MSNBC that Trump's performance was “one of the most bizarre, unsettling events I've ever encountered”.

“The president sounded incoherent, exhausted, rabidly partisan, at times stupid, meandering, couldn't hold a thought together,” McCaffrey said.

Trump's speech was enough for Madeleine Dean, a Democratic congresswoman from Pennsylvania, to confront the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, in Washington on Wednesday, although Johnson appeared unconcerned.

“The president is unhinged. He is unwell,” Dean told Johnson, in an encounter filmed by journalists.

“Well a lot of folks on your side are too,” Johnson responded.

MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. The United Kingdom, Germany, and France are seeking to stage a color revolution in Serbia to destabilize and divide the country, Milorad Dodik, President of the Republic of Srpska (one of the two constituent entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina), told TASS.

"Now, no one rules out that it is about the so-called color revolution imposed from outside - by the British, Germans, and the French in a bid to weaken Serbia. The objective is not only in destabilizing the country but, actually, in dividing it, which would inevitably weaken Serbia's role in the Balkans," he said.

According to Dodik, there are certain structures, which formally brand themselves as independent, but "are actually governed from external centers of power, which control relevant processes." "These processes involve a lot of people who, as a matter of fact, are acting against Serbia," he noted. "President [of Serbia Aleksandar] Vucic and his policy are supported by the electoral majority. This fact is acknowledged by everyone and if elections are held today, their results would demonstrate that the current Vucic-led authorities enjoy support to continue their work."

"However, it should be noted that is these circles continue operating as they are instructed to or at their own initiative continue playing the role imposed on them, these elections will have no sense. Th whole thing would recur again."

At the same time, he drew attention to another process: "what has failed in Serbia is now unfolding in the Republic of Srpska."

"A process against the Republic of Srpska president has been initiated via externally-imposed illegal, non-constitutional courts. And this is being done to destabilize the situation in the republic," he emphasized. "Obviously, they have lost a favorable moment. They will fail both in Serbia and in the Republic of Srpska. Some destabilizing factors may remain but Serbia and the Republic of Srpska will stay strong together.".

A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland, ruling Saturday in a lawsuit brought by the state and city.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement – we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president's war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theatre.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Opinion: Trump is turning the National Guard into his personal police force

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 375 square kilometres and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

In Portland, fears grow that Trump's crackdown is coming and will make life worse

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.

The government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.

MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. A potential US decision to supply Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may ruin the positive trend in relations between Russia and the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin in a comment.

"This (potential decision to send Tomahawk missiles to Kiev - TASS) will ruin our relations (between Russia and the United States - TASS), or at least the emerging positive trend in these relations," the Russian leader said.

Commenting on his speech at the plenary session of the Valdai Discussion Club on Thursday, Putin said he gave an honest overview of the situation. "And, well, how to react to that is up to my counterparts (Western leaders - TASS). I am always sincere in my speeches," he emphasized.

US Vice President JD Vandce confirmed on September 28 that Washington was considering providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to other NATO countries for a subsequent transfer to Ukraine. According to him, the final decision on the matter will be made by US President Donald Trump.

Six people killed and 18 injured in heavy drone and missile attacks across Ukraine early on Sunday

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused the west of “zero real reaction” to Russia's escalating bombing campaign against Ukraine, after a massive attack on Sunday killed six people and injured 18.

The western city of Lviv, normally considered one of the safest in the country, suffered its most sustained and serious bombardment since the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion.

For five hours, Russian Shahed drones and missiles targeted the city, which is about 70km from the Polish border. Large explosions were audible from the centre, a Unesco world heritage site.

Victims included a 15-year-old girl, who died with three members of her family when their house was flattened in the village of Lapaivka in the Lviv region. Eight others were hurt in the same strike. One person died in the city of Zaporizhzhia when drones struck an apartment block.

In a video address, Zelenskyy said Russia had refused all offers to stop its all-out war. It was deliberately trying to destroy civilian infrastructure – in particular Ukraine's gas and energy system – ahead of winter, he said.

He added: “There is no worthy, strong reaction from the world to everything that is happening. To the constant increase in the scale and audacity of the strikes. That is why Putin is doing this: he is simply laughing at the west, at its silence and lack of strong action in response.”

Ukraine's president promised his country would respond “so Russia feels the answers”. He said the weapons used in Sunday's attack – about 500 drones and more than 50 missiles – included components from western countries, including the US and UK. Stronger export controls were needed, he said.

Poland's air force said it scrambled jets and took preventive action on Sunday to secure its airspace, after an incursion last month by Russian decoy drones. There were numerous drone sightings last week in EU countries including Germany and Denmark.

Part of Lviv was left without electricity, according to the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. Large fires broke out in several locations, including a civilian industrial park in the south of the city, he reported. A school, kindergarten and church were also damaged.

As the acrid smell of smoke and fumes engulfed Lviv, the regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, urged residents to close their windows and avoid going out or to use gas masks or respirators.

On Sunday morning, ash was still falling on the streets of Lviv, as exhausted residents ventured out and attended church services. The twisted metal remains of a Russian drone lay on a pavement outside a block of flats, cordoned off with red tape.

Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had carried out a combined attack featuring cruse missiles, Iranian-designed Shaheds and Kinzhal ballistic missiles.

Numerous regions were hit, including Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west of the country, as well as Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Zelenskyy called on Ukraine's allies to help boost air defences and to impose a no-fly zone – something they have so far been reluctant to do.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas said Moscow was waging terror attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure to mask its “failed summer offensive”. She said it would not stop “until it was forced to”, adding that the EU would support Kyiv for as long as it took.

In recent days, Russia has targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing power blackouts in several areas, a tactic it has repeated in the run-up to winter for the past three years. Ukraine, meanwhile, continues to hit oil production facilities deep inside Russia with its own long-range drones.

Lviv was partway through the annual Lviv BookForum, with writers and audiences gathered in the city for one of the largest book festivals in eastern Europe.

Alongside Ukrainian writers, including poets Artur Dron and Julia Musakovska, there were international speakers including the British Forward prizewinning poet Fiona Benson, and, joining by video link, the Booker prize-winner Bernardine Evaristo, and the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk.

KOFU — Craft beer brand Uchu Brewing, which does its brewing in the city of Hokuto, Yamanashi Prefecture, has won the World Beer Cup's top award for the best juicy or hazy pale ale. The cup is the world's largest beer competition and is held in the United States.

The winning beer features a fruity flavor and stylish label. It was created by two people who moved from Kochi Prefecture and studied brewing on their own, and who used “uchu,” meaning “space,” as their watchword.

At the competition, thousands of beers entered from around the world are judged by category, and gold, silver and bronze awards are presented. This year's award ceremony was held in Indiana in May, and Uchu Brewing's flagship product, Uchu Relax, won gold for its hoppy aroma and hazy look.

The brewery's founders, Masahiro Kusunose and Rumiko Suzuki, met through design work in Kochi Prefecture and moved to Hokuto about 15 years ago. Believing that “all activity on earth, from humans to microorganisms, is an expression of the cosmos,” they called themselves “space farmers” and began cultivating food without pesticides. They also worked on fermented foods like miso and koji rice mold.

The turning point came in 2016 when the pair visited Portland, Ore. At a local brewpub, they tasted American beers with hoppy aromas and varying levels of alcohol, and they were shocked by the rich flavors. They resolved to create their own beers to rival those from the United States.

After returning to Japan, they began growing hops and discovered that Hokuto was once a major area for the crop. Suzuki felt it was fate and fully immersed herself in brewing.

In 2017, Kusunose and Suzuki built a brewery and set up Uchu Co. They began full-scale production, importing high-quality hops from the United States and elsewhere.

Initially, they only sold their beers online, not at the brewery. However, they grabbed attention with their unique, cocktail-like flavors cooked up by Kusunose and their labels designed by Suzuki. Orders surged, primarily from Tokyo and surrounding areas. In 2021, they opened a flagship store in Hokuto's Kobuchisawa district, and they opened another shop this spring in Tokyo's Toranomon district. They now produce about 150 varieties of beer each year, and about 1 million cans.

“I want to create a one-of-a-kind beer that surprises people with its fruity taste,” said an enthusiastic Kusunose.

“In the age of social media, design is crucial, and so is building a fan base,” noted Suzuki. Some of the company's labels feature fantastic colors on a black background, and the beers have such distinctive names as “Ukiyoe” and “Ronin.”

Kusunose and Suzuki have donated to medical efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and to help areas recover from the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, as they look to be a socially minded business. “Our beer was created as an expression of the cosmos, and we want more people to experience joy and surprise at how good it tastes,” Kusunose said.

Having Ukraine separate Hungary from Russia is in Budapest's interest, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview with Hetek published Oct. 4.

"The good thing is that there is a territory between Hungary and Russia that is now called Ukraine. This is a strategic interest of Hungary that Ukraine exists. This is not a geopolitical point of view... But from the point of view of the Hungarian national interest," Orban said in an interview.

Despite Orban's latest remarks, the Hungarian leader on Sept. 29 claimed that Ukraine is not a sovereign state amid allegations from Kyiv that Hungarian drones had violated Ukraine's airspace.

Orban has repeatedly voiced opposition to Ukraine's EU bid and for the bloc's support to Kyiv as it fends off Russia's war. Hungarian authorities are widely considered the most Moscow-friendly within the EU.

"We support a strategic agreement with Ukraine. A strategic agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Not a membership, but an agreement," Orban said in the interview.

On Oct. 3, Orban said that Hungary will oppose Ukraine's accession to the EU, claiming that admitting Kyiv would drag the bloc into war with Russia.

"Ukraine is a country with a very difficult fate. Why should we share in this difficult fate? We have our own fate, which is much easier than that of the Ukrainians," he said.

Orban on Oct. 3 also voiced opposition to the EU providing Ukraine with long-term military and financial aid, calling it "an illusion" based on false assumptions about Russia's economic collapse.

Hungary has repeatedly vetoed EU sanctions against Moscow in response to Russia's war against Ukraine and is currently preventing progress in Ukraine's EU accession.

In response, EU officials are exploring reforms to the bloc's unanimous decision-making process, which would allow accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova to continue despite the Hungarian veto, Politico reported on Sept. 29.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.

Russia launched 500 drones and 50 missiles, including ballistic ones, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on the wave of unidentified drone sightings across Europe — from Denmark to France — that have sparked airport closures, military investigations, and renewed calls to shoot them down.



Putin's message comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a more hostile stance against Russia in recent weeks after a summer of courtship that saw the U.S. roll out the red carpet for Putin during the Alaskan Summit in August. 

The Georgian Dream candidates won all cities and municipalities in Georgia, with Kakha Kaladze receiving 77.4% of the vote in Tbilisi, cementing his third term as mayor of the country's capital. 

The bombing campaign hit an apartment building, injuring two women, three men, and a child.

The number includes 870 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"The good thing is that there is a territory between Hungary and Russia that is now called Ukraine. This is a strategic interest of Hungary that Ukraine exists," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

Lithuania's main airport was closed late on Oct. 4 following a sighting of 13 "contraband" balloons flying towards the site, Lithuanian outlet LRT reported.

Some protesters attempted to break through the palace fences, prompting Georgia's Interior Ministry to declare the demonstration illegal and order the crowd dispersed. 

Ano party leader and billionaire Andrej Babis said on Oct. 4 that Ukraine is "not ready" to join the EU and that the Czech ammunition initiative should be taken over by NATO. 

One of the sanctioned companies is Hardberry-Rusfactor, which produces drones and counter-UAV systems as well as neural network systems for automatic equipment recognition and target designation. 

"The Russians have not abandoned their intentions to plunge Ukraine into darkness on the eve of the new heating season," Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said. 



A Russian drone struck the station in the city of Shostka, Sumy Oblast. Passengers and Ukrzaliznytsia workers were on the site at the moment of the attack, according to Zelensky.

Lithuania's main airport was closed late on Oct. 4 following a sighting of 13 "contraband" balloons flying towards the site, Lithuanian outlet LRT reported.

"Attention: The airspace over Vilnius Airport is closed until 4:30 a.m.," a notice on the airport's online homepage read.

Unidentified drones have violated European airspace several times in recent weeks, prompting airport closures throughout the continent.

Russia has been increasingly suspected of being behind the drone sightings over NATO territory, following known Russian violations of the defense alliance's Eastern Flank in September.

Flying objects were detected near Baltoji Voke, with disruptions expected to last several hours, Vilmantas Vitkauskas, head of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center (NKVC), told LRT.

The airport's airspace was closed as the NKVC determined it was unsafe for aircraft to depart and land in Vilnius, the agency later said.

Baltoji Voke is a town located near Lithuania's capital. Vilnius itself is situated only 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the country's border with Belarus.

Unidentified drones prompted airport closures several times in Denmark in recent days. Drone sightings have also caused disruptions in several other European countries, including Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, authorities have not ruled out that the drones may be Russian.

Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory in a first for any NATO member in over three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Russian drones again violated EU and NATO airspace, flying over Romanian territory on Sept. 13

Three Russian jets violated Estonian airspace on Sept. 19 in an escalation from drones as Moscow continues its provocations. The breach occurred over the Gulf of Finland, where Russian jets crossed into Estonian territory without permission before departing, the Estonian Defense Forces confirmed.

Russia launched 500 drones and 50 missiles, including ballistic ones, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on the wave of unidentified drone sightings across Europe — from Denmark to France — that have sparked airport closures, military investigations, and renewed calls to shoot them down.



Putin's message comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a more hostile stance against Russia in recent weeks after a summer of courtship that saw the U.S. roll out the red carpet for Putin during the Alaskan Summit in August. 

The Georgian Dream candidates won all cities and municipalities in Georgia, with Kakha Kaladze receiving 77.4% of the vote in Tbilisi, cementing his third term as mayor of the country's capital. 

The bombing campaign hit an apartment building, injuring two women, three men, and a child.

The number includes 870 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"The good thing is that there is a territory between Hungary and Russia that is now called Ukraine. This is a strategic interest of Hungary that Ukraine exists," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

Lithuania's main airport was closed late on Oct. 4 following a sighting of 13 "contraband" balloons flying towards the site, Lithuanian outlet LRT reported.

Some protesters attempted to break through the palace fences, prompting Georgia's Interior Ministry to declare the demonstration illegal and order the crowd dispersed. 

Ano party leader and billionaire Andrej Babis said on Oct. 4 that Ukraine is "not ready" to join the EU and that the Czech ammunition initiative should be taken over by NATO. 

One of the sanctioned companies is Hardberry-Rusfactor, which produces drones and counter-UAV systems as well as neural network systems for automatic equipment recognition and target designation. 

"The Russians have not abandoned their intentions to plunge Ukraine into darkness on the eve of the new heating season," Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said. 



A Russian drone struck the station in the city of Shostka, Sumy Oblast. Passengers and Ukrzaliznytsia workers were on the site at the moment of the attack, according to Zelensky.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is sprayed with Gatorade after defeating the New York Yankees on Saturday.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

The Toronto Blue Jays won't begin paying Vladimir Guerrero Jr. his half-billion dollars until next year, but he started earning it on Saturday. First thing on his to-do list - transform himself from Yankee irritant to “Yankee killer.”

Throughout September, the team's biggest name was so marginal a figure that you'd have to check his punch card to be sure he'd shown up for work. Only two home runs, and none since the first week of the month. 

It wasn't just the numbers. It was how Guerrero looked - tired, and out of sorts. The Jays said he was feeling fine. A day before the playoffs began, Guerrero was keeping it mysterious, saying the team had to win “regardless of how I feel.”

That's the sort of thing I say when I'm getting ready to call out sick on a Friday. 

Blue Jays topple Yankees 10-1 in first ALDS playoff game

In response, most of Toronto's pre-game chatter avoided him. Players and the manager wanted to talk about how great George Springer was playing, or how Kevin Gausman is a Buddhist monk in cleats. In the hours before Game 1 started, the focus shifted to rookie pitcher Trey Yesavage, who will start Game 2. 

There's only two ways that's going to go over - bold genius or desperate boner - and which it is depends entirely on the game's outcome. Guerrero was a peripheral talking point. Nobody wanted to jinx the guy. 

When he came to bat in the first inning, the Rogers Centre was in a nervy state. They'd spent the top of the first inning cheering every Yankee out like it was the last. 

“It was so loud,” Gausman said. “It was crazy.”

It was a lot of noise, but you didn't get the sense that it was born of extreme confidence. More the opposite thing. 

Then Guerrero, who has spent a month looking like he's swinging at soap bubbles, planted a ball into the stands behind the left-field bullpen. And that was his second most impressive play to start the game.

Nobody expects Guerrero to be a great first baseman, as long as he's not a colander. In the second, the Yankees got a hitter on base - the disruptive Jazz Chisholm. The next man up, Ryan McMahon, cracked his bat in half hitting a ropey line drive in Guerrero's direction. 

The barrel of the bat was twirling so unpredictably toward first that the umpire fled his position. Guerrero lasered in on the ball, jumping to his right, catching the fly and then springing up to tag the base. An unassisted double play - you don't see many of those by men Guerrero's size. 

There was a lot of game to go, but after those two plays, the building relaxed. This wasn't going to be one of those post-season pile-ups the Jays had become famous for. 

In the end, Toronto annihilated New York 10-1. The Yankees are in it up to their chin now. 

The Blue Jays' year started out rocky. Now it's monumental. Here's what changed

There were plenty of back pats to go around. Gausman pitched six, largely error free innings. Most importantly, he struck out Aaron Judge with the bases loaded. If the Jays win this series, that was the other moment they started to do so. 

Judge has been good in the post-season, just not Aaron-Judge-type good. Now the Yankees are worrying about when - or if - he will impose himself on this series.

Alejandro Kirk hit two more home runs. That's five in his last three games. At this rate, he will surpass Mickey Mantle in a couple of weeks. 

The back half of the order was unstoppable. The bullpen was rock solid. Even Anthony Santander appeared to be awake. 

Everything that could go right did, but all of it flowed from Guerrero's autumn renaissance. When he has his mojo, so do the Jays. 

Afterward, reporters tried to coax Guerrero into kicking something off with the Yankees line-up. He hasn't been shy in the past. In an interview a few years ago with a Spanish-language outlet, he said, “I like to kill the Yankees” and that “I would never sign with the Yankees, not even (when I'm) dead.”

As the Blue Jays head to the playoffs, a new turn in our family baseball drama

But that was a different Guerrero - the treat ‘em mean to keep ‘em keen Guerrero. Telling the Yankees that you hate them and will destroy them is how great players flirt with New York. Your goal is getting the Bronx crowd so turned on that they pay you a shocking amount of money just for the pleasure of watching you take it all back. 

This is a new Guerrero. The settled-down, Toronto-in-sickness-and-in-health Guerrero. 

“My goal is always to win a World Series, to bring the World Series here,” Guerrero said. About the Yankees, he would not say a mumbling word. 

“There was something a little different about Vlad today,” Jays manager John Schneider said, thought he couldn't identify what exactly. 

Maybe I can. Six years in, this was the first time Guerrero was the player everyone imagined he might be back when all you knew about him was some home-movie-type footage and a ton of hype. That Guerrero wasn't just going to play well. He was going to beat people by sheer magnetism, a la golden age Yankees like Derek Jeter. 

Guerrero had never had the chance to show that quality before, shrinking along with his teammates in three brief playoff appearances.

Now he's in there hacking at the foundation of the biggest club in baseball, making himself known. By tomorrow morning, Guerrero will be Public Enemy No. 1 in every borough but Queens. All his old quotes will be resurfaced and pored over. 

Gausman put it best - Guerrero is becoming New York's “arch-nemesis.”

Lots of Toronto players have been Bronx nemeses, but the arch one? That's a first.

This is why they paid the guy so much money. Not to hit home runs at home in June, but to inspire fear and loathing in October. 

Toronto makes its New York playoff debut on Tuesday night. After a laugher in Game 1, they should be feeling okay about themselves then, however things go in Sunday afternoon's Game 2. 

But there is a difference between liking your chances, and swaggering in behind a guy who's made it his mission to humiliate the opposition.

LUGANSK, October 5. /TASS/. Russian units are advancing and straightening the front line near Volchansk in the Kharkov region, despite the reinforcement of Ukrainian armed forces around the city by the forces' command, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

"Regarding Volchansk: over the past week, our troops have made progress in the Liptsov direction - advancing and consolidating new positions. In the Volchansk area, the line of contact has been straightened and new positions have been consolidated. The Russian army is also currently building up its forces and assets for further advancement in this area," he said. Marochko noted that the Ukrainian armed forces command regularly sends additional forces and resources to Vovchansk, including from the command reserve.

The latest AP Top 25 college football rankings show a major shakeup, with Penn State and Texas gone from the poll for the first time since 2022. Miami moved ahead of an idle Oregon to reclaim the No. 2 spot and No. 9 Texas Tech rose to its highest ranking since 2008.

No. 1 Ohio State stayed put thanks to a win over Minnesota, but the Buckeyes' number of first-place votes dwindled to 40, the lowest since the team claimed the top spot five weeks ago.

No. 6 Oklahoma slipped one notch, but the losses by Penn State and Texas made way for Indiana at No. 7 and Alabama at No. 8, a two-spot promotion for the Crimson Tide. No. 10 Georgia also climbed two spots.

Follow live updates from The Associated Press below for game recaps, ranking analysis and voter answers to fan questions, all in one place.

Here's what to know: 



▶ Show your appreciation for one of college football's longest-running traditions. Donate to AP.

The Bulldogs have already played Alabama and Tennessee and still have Auburn (a rivalry), Ole Miss, Florida (another rivalry), Mississippi State and Georgia Tech on the schedule. 

That looks like an opportunity to finish with the best résumé in the country.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

No. 4 Ole Miss was the only team with a bye week to retain its exact spot in the poll.

Miami leapfrogged over Oregon, returning to No. 2 after a 28-22 win over Florida State. Indiana (7), Tennessee (12), Georgia Tech (13), Missouri (14) and Arizona State (21) each ascended in the rankings.

No. 13 is Georgia Tech's highest ranking since 2014, when the Yellow Jackets went 11-3 and beat Mississippi State in the Orange Bowl.

Iowa State dropped eight spots, falling from No. 14 to No. 22 after losing to unranked Cincinnati.

Florida State retained its AP Top 25 status but dropped seven spots, coming in at No. 25 after losing to Miami on Saturday night. 

My biggest disappointment is Clemson. 

I believed the Tigers were a national championship contender in the summer. We dropped them out of the poll after the Georgia Tech loss, and I was in the press box for the Syracuse loss.

I can't recall ever being more wrong about a college football team.

Texas and Penn State are obvious candidates for most disappointing, too. Those programs have invested too much money into those rosters to be anything but top-five teams. 

I think the country is learning that Arch Manning isn't some generational quarterback. And the first-round hype around Drew Allar should be gone by now.

Heating up: Miami (2), Alabama (8), Texas Tech (9), Michigan (15), Notre Dame (16), BYU (18), Virginia (19), Memphis (23), South Florida (24).

Cooling off: Penn State, Texas, Vanderbilt (20), Iowa State (22), Florida State (25).

Holding steady: Ohio State (1), Ole Miss (4).



I believe context is needed.

Are Ole Miss and Missouri undefeated? Yes. 

Have they played anyone as good as Alabama or Georgia? No. 

I can't penalize Georgia too much for losing to Alabama. What I will say, which I have to consider moving forward, is that the Florida State loss isn't looking as good for the Tide.

Miami is the only team in the country with three wins over ranked teams so far this season.

The Hurricanes beat then-No. 6 Notre Dame, then-No. 18 South Florida and then-No. 18 Florida State. Miami's 21 first-place votes this week match its total from the last 354 polls combined, going back to midway through the 2003 season.

The team has appeared in 24 consecutive AP polls, matching the fifth-longest streak in school history.

I had Ole Miss out of the top 10 last week. 

I am not one that believes they are the fourth-best team in the country. However, I moved them into that tier this week. 

The losses by Texas and Penn State, whom I had little faith in already, made me rethink which résumés deserve a top-10 distinction.

BYU, Michigan and Illinois also made some leaps on my ballot. I think we're learning that there aren't as many elite teams this season as we initially believed.

The No. 2 Hurricanes picked up 21 first-place votes after beating a ranked Florida State team, reaching 1,579 points – their highest total this season. 

Ohio State's margin at No. 1 narrowed, earning a season-low 40 first-place votes despite a 42-3 triumph over Minnesota.

Texas and Penn State, the top two teams in the preseason AP Top 25, are out of the poll after losing to unranked teams.

Texas lost to Florida and Penn State fell to UCLA on the road. The Longhorns and Nittany Lions had held steady in the top 10 all season, but now they are both out of the rankings for the first time since 2022. The result? Two of the biggest declines since the poll began in 1936.

That made room for other teams to rise. Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Indiana each moved up a spot. Alabama rose from No. 10 to No. 8, and Texas Tech and Georgia broke into the top 10.

No. 2 Oregon, No. 4 Ole Miss, No. 8 Indiana, No. 15 Tennessee, No. 17 Georgia Tech, No. 19 Missouri and No. 25 Arizona State each had the week off and will return to game action next weekend.

The bye week came at a good time following hard-fought battles in Week 5. Oregon, Tennessee and Georgia Tech beat opponents in overtime. Arizona State, Ole Miss and Indiana each won by a touchdown or less.

The Aggies are in my top 5. I think Mike Elko has a team that's to his liking, and Marcel Reed's feet opens a lot for that offense. 

That's a team that could be in the SEC title game.

Georgia responded to its first loss of the season with a 35-14 win against Kentucky.

Quarterback Gunner Stockton ran the ball in for two touchdowns in the first quarter, giving the Bulldogs an early 14-0 lead. Kentucky responded with a score in the second quarter before Georgia's Dillon Bell notched two rushing touchdowns.

Cash Jones put the game away in the third quarter, connecting with Stockton for a 16-yard touchdown. It was a much-needed win for the Bulldogs, who dropped 24-21 to Alabama in Week 5.

They didn't receive a vote from me and shouldn't receive one from anyone else. They are simply undeserving in every sense of the word.

I have the Red Raiders at No. 10. 

I can't help but ask how good this team would be if Quenton Joyner weren't injured. 

My thing is, they have no ranked wins. Utah and Houston are good teams, but they aren't knocking my socks off. Résumé is hurting Texas Tech at the moment.

That is the basis of my voting process. Who did you play and how good did you look? I don't really think there's any other way to vote. 

In the early parts of the season, voting based on belief in the roster can be acceptable. But that has to phase out as the year progresses.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

UCLA pulled off the biggest upset of the week with a 42-37 win over No. 7 Penn State. 

Bruins' quarterback Nico Iamaleava accounted for five touchdowns, running three in and connecting with Kwazi Gilmer and Titus Mokiao-Atimalala for two more.

A struggling Florida team exposed No. 9 Texas, beating the Longhorns 29-21 on Saturday. Texas — once ranked No. 1 in the poll — is now at risk of slipping out of the rankings altogether.

Stock up: Alabama, Notre Dame, BYU, Texas Tech.

Stock down: Florida State, Penn State, Texas, Iowa State.







Miami is expected to pick up a bunch of first-place votes in the Top 25 this week, and you've had the Hurricanes at No. 1. 

Describe what you see in them over other top teams like Ohio State and Oregon.

Once Ohio State and Oregon play some more competition, I'll consider them for No. 1. Right now, Miami has the best combination of talent and résumé.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

It's simple for me: Play good teams and you'll be rewarded. 

Simply being in a conference doesn't qualify you as a good team (see Kentucky and Rutgers). I watch as many games as I can on Saturdays and catch up on whichever ones I missed. 

I care about the body of work, not the rhetoric.

Miami moved from No. 2 to No. 3 in the poll after a Sept. 27 bye.

While the Hurricanes had time off, Oregon topped Penn State in double overtime, moving up to No. 2. The roles were reversed this week, as Oregon had the week off for rest and recovery, while Miami delivered a convincing 28-22 win against No. 18 Florida State.

Meanwhile, Ohio State returned to action with a 42-3 victory over Minnesota, likely making the Buckeyes untouchable at No. 1.

Cincinnati knocked off No. 14 Iowa State on Saturday, outscoring the Cyclones 38-30 and improving to 4-1.

It's the fourth straight win for the Bearcats, who are beginning to make a case for a Top 25 ranking.

Memphis improved to 6-0 with a dominant 45-7 win over Tulsa on Saturday. The Tigers rank second in the American Conference behind Navy, which has the edge with a 3-0 conference record.

South Florida could return to the rankings after a 54-26 win against Charlotte. The Bulls received 53 votes in the poll last week, more than any other team still outside the Top 25.

No organization has been ranking teams and naming a major college football national champion longer than The Associated Press, since 1936.

AP employees don't vote themselves, but they do choose the voters. AP Top 25 voters comprise around 60 writers and broadcasters who cover college football for AP members and other select outlets. The goal is to have every state with a Football Bowl Subdivision school represented by at least one voter.



There is a 1-25 point system, with a team voted No. 1 receiving 25 points down to 1 point for a 25th-place vote. After that, it's simple: The poll lists the teams with the most points from 1 to 25, and others receiving votes are also noted.



Voting is done online, and the tabulation is automated.

The latest AP Top 25 college football rankings show a major shakeup, with Penn State and Texas gone from the poll for the first time since 2022. Miami moved ahead of an idle Oregon to reclaim the No. 2 spot and No. 9 Texas Tech rose to its highest ranking since 2008.

No. 1 Ohio State stayed put thanks to a win over Minnesota, but the Buckeyes' number of first-place votes dwindled to 40, the lowest since the team claimed the top spot five weeks ago.

No. 6 Oklahoma slipped one notch, but the losses by Penn State and Texas made way for Indiana at No. 7 and Alabama at No. 8, a two-spot promotion for the Crimson Tide. No. 10 Georgia also climbed two spots.

I believe context is needed.

Are Ole Miss and Missouri undefeated? Yes. 

Have they played anyone as good as Alabama or Georgia? No. 

I can't penalize Georgia too much for losing to Alabama. What I will say, which I have to consider moving forward, is that the Florida State loss isn't looking as good for the Tide.

Miami is the only team in the country with three wins over ranked teams so far this season.

The Hurricanes beat then-No. 6 Notre Dame, then-No. 18 South Florida and then-No. 18 Florida State. Miami's 21 first-place votes this week match its total from the last 354 polls combined, going back to midway through the 2003 season.

The team has appeared in 24 consecutive AP polls, matching the fifth-longest streak in school history.

I had Ole Miss out of the top 10 last week. 

I am not one that believes they are the fourth-best team in the country. However, I moved them into that tier this week. 

The losses to Texas and Penn State, whom I had little faith in already, made me rethink which résumés deserve a top-10 distinction.

The No. 2 Hurricanes picked up 21 first-place votes after beating a ranked Florida State team, reaching 1,579 points – their highest total this season. 

Ohio State's margin at No. 1 narrowed, earning a season-low 40 first-place votes despite a 42-3 triumph over Minnesota.

Texas and Penn State, the top two teams in the preseason AP Top 25, are out of the poll after losing to unranked teams.

Texas lost to Florida and Penn State fell to UCLA on the road. The Longhorns and Nittany Lions had held steady in the top 10 all season, but now they are both out of the rankings for the first time since 2022. The result? Two of the biggest declines since the poll began in 1936.

That made room for other teams to rise. Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Indiana each moved up a spot. Alabama rose from No. 10 to No. 8, and Texas Tech and Georgia broke into the top 10.

No. 2 Oregon, No. 4 Ole Miss, No. 8 Indiana, No. 15 Tennessee, No. 17 Georgia Tech, No. 19 Missouri and No. 25 Arizona State each had the week off and will return to game action next weekend.

The bye week came at a good time following hard-fought battles in Week 5. Oregon, Tennessee and Georgia Tech beat opponents in overtime. Arizona State, Ole Miss and Indiana each won by a touchdown or less.

The Aggies are in my top 5. I think Mike Elko has a team that's to his liking, and Marcel Reed's feet opens a lot for that offense. 

That's a team that could be in the SEC title game.

Georgia responded to its first loss of the season with a 35-14 win against Kentucky.

Quarterback Gunner Stockton ran the ball in for two touchdowns in the first quarter, giving the Bulldogs an early 14-0 lead. Kentucky responded with a score in the second quarter before Georgia's Dillon Bell notched two rushing touchdowns.

Cash Jones put the game away in the third quarter, connecting with Stockton for a 16-yard touchdown. It was a much-needed win for the Bulldogs, who dropped 24-21 to Alabama in Week 5.

They didn't receive a vote from me and shouldn't receive one from anyone else. They are simply undeserving in every sense of the word.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

I have the Red Raiders at No. 10. 

I can't help but ask how good this team would be if Quenton Joyner weren't injured. 

My thing is, they have no ranked wins. Utah and Houston are good teams, but they aren't knocking my socks off. Résumé is hurting Texas Tech at the moment.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

That is the basis of my voting process. Who did you play and how good did you look? I don't really think there's any other way to vote. 

In the early parts of the season, voting based on belief in the roster can be acceptable. But that has to phase out as the year progresses.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

UCLA pulled off the biggest upset of the week with a 42-37 win over No. 7 Penn State. 

Bruins' quarterback Nico Iamaleava accounted for five touchdowns, running three in and connecting with Kwazi Gilmer and Titus Mokiao-Atimalala for two more.

A struggling Florida team exposed No. 9 Texas, beating the Longhorns 29-21 on Saturday. Texas — once ranked No. 1 in the poll — is now at risk of slipping out of the rankings altogether.

Stock up: Alabama, Notre Dame, BYU, Texas Tech.

Stock down: Florida State, Penn State, Texas, Iowa State.







Miami is expected to pick up a bunch of first-place votes in the Top 25 this week, and you've had the Hurricanes at No. 1. 

Describe what you see in them over other top teams like Ohio State and Oregon.

Once Ohio State and Oregon play some more competition, I'll consider them for No. 1. Right now, Miami has the best combination of talent and résumé.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

It's simple for me: Play good teams and you'll be rewarded. 

Simply being in a conference doesn't qualify you as a good team (see Kentucky and Rutgers). I watch as many games as I can on Saturdays and catch up on whichever ones I missed. 

I care about the body of work, not the rhetoric.

Miami moved from No. 2 to No. 3 in the poll after a Sept. 27 bye.

While the Hurricanes had time off, Oregon topped Penn State in double overtime, moving up to No. 2. The roles were reversed this week, as Oregon had the week off for rest and recovery, while Miami delivered a convincing 28-22 win against No. 18 Florida State.

Meanwhile, Ohio State returned to action with a 42-3 victory over Minnesota, likely making the Buckeyes untouchable at No. 1.

Cincinnati knocked off No. 14 Iowa State on Saturday, outscoring the Cyclones 38-30 and improving to 4-1.

It's the fourth straight win for the Bearcats, who are beginning to make a case for a Top 25 ranking.

Memphis improved to 6-0 with a dominant 45-7 win over Tulsa on Saturday. The Tigers rank second in the American Conference behind Navy, which has the edge with a 3-0 conference record.

South Florida could return to the rankings after a 54-26 win against Charlotte. The Bulls received 53 votes in the poll last week, more than any other team still outside the Top 25.

College football writer and Top 25 voter Javon Edmonds will answer a few questions while we wait for the rankings to drop.

The New York Giants will officially start their 1st-round pick Jaxson Dart this Sunday, benching Russell Wilson. Colin Cowherd reacts to the news and sets expectations for the young QB.

New York Giants rookie Jaxson Dart broke out in the first half with two touchdown passes against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday afternoon.

As the broadcast panned to Dart's family, his mother appeared to steal the show away from the former Ole Miss standout on social media.

Kara Dart became the talk among NFL fans on social media early in the game. She has routinely been spotted in the stands supporting her son, along with her husband Brandon. She took a photo with the rookie quarterback following a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills back in August. The two were with Tommy DeVito and his mother.

Kara Dart, a Utah native, runs a fitness program. People magazine pointed out that she suffered a foot injury in 2019 that forced her to rethink the way she exercises.

Jaxson Dart also credited his mom for giving him fashion advice.

"My mom's into it, and she's done a great job of letting me choose and find things that I like and just giving me options," he told GQ in 2024. "At the same time, it's just something that I've come to really love and to express myself in different ways."

Kara and Brandon Dart have been at the Giants' games since Dart turned pro.

Americans for Public Trust executive director Caitlin Sutherland sounds the alarm on the 'dark money' purportedly paying for Democrats' protests on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Disgraced financier Howard Rubin's personal assistant allegedly indulged in a lavish life of luxury funded by the former Soros Fund Management portfolio manager, while luring women for him to sexually abuse for over a decade, according to federal prosecutors. 

Jennifer Powers, 45, appeared in Brooklyn federal court earlier this week to plead not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and transporting women in interstate commerce for sex acts with Rubin, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Federal prosecutors allege Rubin "funded virtually all aspects" of Powers' lifestyle from at least 2018 until 2023, including covering the costs of her Manhattan apartment, credit card bills, children's private schooling, and down payment and mortgage on the family's Texas home.

Powers and her husband, Stephen Powers, are facing additional charges stemming from allegations that the pair – who have been married since "at least 2012" – intentionally filed joint tax returns between 2018 and 2024 that did not disclose the millions of dollars in payments Rubin had provided, according to prosecutors. 

"Jennifer Powers did not report any wages or income from employment," the indictment alleges. 

Court documents reveal federal prosecutors' case against the couple, alleging the pair did not report any income from Jennifer Powers and only documented a gross income of $40,000 from Stephen Powers' disc jockey business in the tax years 2018 and 2019 combined.

Now-private Instagram posts reportedly show the family enjoying lavish vacations in Turks and Caicos, Italy and Colombia, according to the New York Post. 

Prosecutors now allege that, during the same time, Jennifer Powers played a key role in procuring women for Rubin to sexually abuse inside his Central Park penthouse in a soundproofed room referred to as "The Dungeon" from 2011 to 2019. 

According to court documents, Rubin and Powers spent over $1 million recruiting women, some of whom had been previously sexually abused or suffered from addiction, to partake in paid sex acts that often went beyond the scope of their consent. 

"The defendants allegedly exploited Rubin's status to ensnare their prospective victims and forced them to endure unthinkable physical trauma before silencing any outcries with threats of legal recourse," Christopher Raia, the FBI's assistant director for New York, said in a statement after the indictment was unsealed.

Rubin also is accused of paying Powers' legal bills stemming from a 2017 lawsuit brought forth by several Playboy models he allegedly abused. A jury found that only Rubin was liable and awarded the women $3.9 million – a decision Rubin is currently appealing, according to The Associated Press. 

Jennifer Powers was released on an $850,000 bond and has been ordered to remain on house arrest while wearing an ankle monitor, according to court documents. She previously worked as a substitute teacher for the Carroll Independent School District in Texas, but has since been removed, according to CBS Texas.

Rubin has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail until his next court date on Oct. 20. 

Jennifer Powers' attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Fox News Digital was unable to immediately locate attorneys assigned to Rubin and Stephen Powers.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — President Donald Trump is sending 300 California National Guard members to Oregon after a judge temporarily blocked  his administration from deploying that state's guard to Portland, California's governor said Sunday.

Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged Sunday to fight the move in court. 

There was no official announcement from Washington that the California National Guard was being called up and sent to Oregon, just as was the case when Illinois' governor made a similar announcement Saturday about troops in his state being activated. 

The California National Guard referred questions to the Defense Department. A department spokesperson declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from the White House. 

Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that California personnel were on their way Sunday and called the deployment “a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.” He said these troops were “federalized” and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.

“The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,” Newsom said in the statement. “We will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the president of the United States.”

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Oregon on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard in Portland to protect federal property amid protests after Trump called the city “war-ravaged.” Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.




The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland has recently been the site of nightly protests.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, calling the former a “war zone” and suggesting apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.

Trump authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard troops to protect federal officers and assets in Chicago on Saturday.

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the second week of the government shutdown and the people who are attempting to end it.

President Donald Trump on Sunday placed the blame squarely on Democrats for the government shutdown, which is expected to trigger sweeping layoffs across the federal workforce.

Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One that the looming layoffs are "up to them," referring to Democrats who voted against a bill to fund the government and avert the shutdown.

The federal government shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, forcing agencies to send home workers in roles not considered essential.

SHUTDOWN EXPLAINED: WHO WORKS, WHO DOESN'T AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS

These furloughs are temporary; once Congress resolves the standoff, employees typically return to work and receive back pay. As a result, past government shutdowns have been more political theater than economic shock, with markets and jobs rebounding quickly.

This time, however, the Trump administration has warned that some furloughed workers may not return, turning a routine disruption into a potential blow to an already fragile labor market.

SHUTDOWN FIGHT CASTS A SHADOW OVER JOBS AS TRUMP PREPARES FOR LARGEST FEDERAL RESIGNATION IN US HISTORY

Washington, D.C., home to a large share of federal employees, has been hit especially hard after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory board pushed for layoffs earlier this year.

On Tuesday, when asked how many federal workers could be laid off, Trump told reporters at the White House, "We may do a lot," saying Democrats have made little progress to end the stalemate.

At the same time, the administration is preparing to oversee what could become the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, with more than 100,000 federal employees scheduled to leave under its deferred resignation program.

National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that layoffs will start "if the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere."

He said he's hopeful "we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that."

If Democrats are "reasonable once they get back into town on Monday," Hassett added, then Trump will see "no reason for those layoffs."

ROME (AP) — Some of the activists detained while trying to reach Gaza by sea have returned to their home countries to describe mistreatment at the hands of Israeli guards, claims that Israel denies.

Some 450 activists were arrested as Israeli forces intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, a fleet of 42 boats seeking to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and deliver a symbolic amount of aid to the famine-stricken territory. Those detained between Wednesday and Friday were brought to Israel, where many remain in prison. 

The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it offered voluntary deportation to all of the activists and those that remain in detention chose to stay there in order to go through a legal deportation process. 

On his return at Rome's Fiumicino Airport late Saturday, Italian journalist Saverio Tommasi said Israeli soldiers withheld medicines and treated prisoners “like monkeys.”

Israel's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said the claims of mistreatment were “brazen lies.”

Among those detained were Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, Nelson Mandela's grandson Mandla Mandela and several European lawmakers.

Tommasi said Thunberg was singled out by Israeli forces after being arrested.

“We also saw Greta Thunberg at the port, in that case with her arms tied and an Israeli flag next to her, just a mockery,” he said. “Let's say the mockery was part of the verbal and psychological violence they always carried out, in order to demean, ridicule and laugh in situations where there is nothing to laugh about.”

In a statement on social media, the ministry said all detainees' legal rights had been “fully upheld,” adding that Thunberg had not complained about the “ludicrous and baseless allegations — because they never occurred.”

The interception of the flotilla came as U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to broker a fresh ceasefire initiative in Gaza, as he ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Israel said it had accepted Trump's proposal, and Hamas has said it accepts some aspects. Negotiators are expected in Cairo on Monday. 

Another Italian journalist, Lorenzo D'Agostino, said detainees were repeatedly woken during the two nights he spent behind bars. They were also intimidated with dogs and by soldiers pointing the laser sights of their guns at prisoners “to scare us,” he said after landing at Istanbul Airport, where 137 activists from 13 countries arrived from Israel on Saturday.

D'Agostino added that his belongings and money had been “stolen by the Israelis.”

Activist Paolo De Montis described being crammed into a prison van for hours with his hands secured by zip ties.

“Constant stress and humiliation,” he said. “You weren't allowed to look them in the face, always had to keep your head down and when I did look up, a man … came and shook me and slapped me on the back of the head. They forced us to stay on our knees for four hours.”

In a statement, far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was “proud” of the way staff behaved at Ketziot prison, a facility in the Negev desert.

“I was proud that we treat the ‘flotilla activists' as supporters of terrorism. Anyone who supports terrorism is a terrorist and deserves the conditions of terrorists,” he said.

“If any of them thought they would come here and receive a red carpet and trumpets — they were mistaken. They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again.”

The arrests led to criticism from several governments including Turkey, Colombia and Pakistan. Greece, which had 27 of its nationals in Israeli custody, issued a “strong written protest” to Israel over the “unacceptable and inappropriate behavior of an Israeli minister.”

The complaint is thought to refer to footage of Ben-Gvir upbraiding the activists for supporting “terrorism” and mocking their aid initiative after they were brought ashore at the southern port of Ashdod on Friday.

The Swedish Foreign Ministry said it had “acted intensively to ensure that the detained Swedes' rights are observed.”

The interception of the flotilla also led to large-scale demonstrations in cities across the world.

Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., spoke about being forcibly removed after interrupting a news conference with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on MSNBC's "The Beat. 

Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in an interview that he never thought he would be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference as he tried to ask DHS secretary Kristi Noem a question in June, arguing it should be a "wake-up call."

"Never would I have imagined that that would have happened — that that would be a response to a question, especially to a senator trying to ask a question," he told The New York Times' Lulu Garcia Navarro. 

Padilla was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a June press conference Noem had in Los Angeles after he tried to ask a question of the head of Homeland Security, who was speaking about the anti-ICE riots in the city. 

The NYT asked Padilla if Noem had apologized to him in their conversation after the incident. Padilla has insisted he wasn't interrupting the press conference and just wanted to ask a question.

CROCKETT SAID SHE 'BROKE DOWN IN TEARS' WATCHING ALEX PADILLA GET FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM PRESS CONFERENCE

"No apology, but honestly not surprised, just given how this administration tends to carry itself," he continued. "I wish I could say it was more substantive or more constructive. She finally did say, ‘Well, I understand you're asking for more information. What's your question?'" 

Padilla said his removal from the press conference should be a wake-up call, arguing it was part of a bigger problem with the Trump administration. 

"It was clear to me that if that's how this administration would respond to a senator with a question, imagine not just how they could treat so many other people, but how they are treating so many other people when the cameras are not on. This should be a wake-up call," he told the Times. 

The Democratic senator pointed to National Guard presence in cities such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and said it was a "heady time" for the country.

Asked if he thought his removal was deliberate or a mistake, Padilla said, "At minimum, it was a hell of an overreaction."

"But they knew who I was. Just like Vice President Vance knows my name, but he chose to call me Jose. We served together for two years in the Senate, for Christ's sake. He knows who I am, but it's the way they choose to go about things," he said, referring to Vice President JD Vance calling Padilla "Jose" after the incident.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has decided not to let the government shutdown interfere with a stop in Norfolk, Virginia, on Sunday to salute the Navy as it celebrates its 250th anniversary.

“I believe, ‘THE SHOW MUST GO ON!'” Trump posted Friday night on his social media site, Truth Social. And he wrote before leaving the White House for Naval Station Norfolk, “This will be a show of Naval aptitude and strength.”

The government shutdown that began Wednesday has sparked a series of partisan blame games as military personnel are working without pay, several thousand federal employees are furloughed and key infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic-run areas such as New York and Chicago have been put on hold. 

There is the possibility that an event designed to honor the Navy could be dragged into the bitter politics.

Trump accused Democrats in his post of enabling the shutdown and trying “to destroy this wonderful celebration of the U.S. Navy's Birthday.”

Senate Democrats rejected efforts to preserve a continuation of government operations when the new budget year started on Wednesday. They cited the lapse in subsidies that could cause health insurance costs to climb rapidly for people who get coverage through the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Democratic lawmakers also have sought to reverse cuts to Medicaid that Trump signed into law.

On top of that, both sides cite a mutual sense of distrust. 

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Democrats oppose Trump's move to have his administration decline to spend congressionally approved funds, saying it undermines the budgeting process, among other concerns. Meanwhile, Trump has explored laying off federal workers at what he called “Democrat Agencies.”




Scheduled to join Trump are first lady Melania Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan.

Trump on Tuesday addressed a gathering of military leaders abruptly summoned from across the globe to Virginia by Hegseth. The Republican president proposed using U.S. cities as training grounds for the armed forces and he spoke of needing military might to combat what he called the “invasion from within.” Hegseth declared an end to “woke” culture and announced new directives for troops that include “gender-neutral” or “male-level” standards for physical fitness.

The administration is seeking to reshape Pentagon culture and use military resources for the president's priorities, including quelling domestic unrest and violent crime.

Trump has also engaged the military in an armed conflict with drug cartels, leading to four strikes on boats in the Caribbean that Washington says were involved in trafficking.

Tom Brady and Colin Cowherd discuss how former Michigan QB J.J. McCarthy is set up for success with the Minnesota Vikings following their Week 1 win over the Chicago Bears. 

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz went into the locker room before the first half was finished on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns with a left shoulder issue.

Wentz scrambled trying to get a first down late in the second quarter. He ran off the field and went into the blue medical tent before he jogged back to the locker room to get checked out.

The Vikings were already down a quarterback as J.J. McCarthy was on the mend with a right high ankle sprain. Wentz, a veteran who was signed in the offseason, had performed well in the first two starts he received but the injury in London raised eyebrows.

Former NFL linebacker Jonathan Vilma was on the call for the NFL Network with Kenny Albert. He was critical of Wentz's decision-making in the game knowing that the team was relying on him heavily in this circumstance.

NFL HOLDS MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR VICTIMS OF YOM KIPPUR TERROR ATTACK IN ENGLAND

"That's an understatement to say, ‘huge loss' if he's not gonna come back," the three-time Pro Bowl defender said. "I was actually surprised, frankly, a little disappointed in Wentz knowing that you are the only guy. Brosmer is a rookie quarterback. You don't want to take those shots. 

"Usually veterans, you see them across the league, they'll just go down, and instead, it's fourth down and they'll call it a day. That was actually the second time he didn't go down and tried to run for a first down. I get the competitive nature but that is tough."

Wentz was initially questionable to return to the field, but he was back under center for the team in the third quarter with a pad around his left shoulder.

Criminal defense attorney Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital prosecutors will try to "dirty up' Tyler Robinson when the case eventually reaches trial.

Tyler Robinson's motive for why he allegedly assassinated TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk may be more important during the sentencing phase as prosecutors will try to "dirty up" the suspect in hopes that jurors return a death sentence, according to a former assistant U.S. attorney.

Robinson is accused of assassinating Kirk during a TPUSA event on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley Univerisity in Orem, Utah, officials said. He's been charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, two counts of witness tampering and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.

Officials claim Robinson allegedly said he killed Kirk because he "had enough of his hatred," adding that "some hate can't be negotiated out."

Court documents indicate that Robinson texted his roommate, Lance Twiggs, asking him to "look under my keyboard."

Sheriff's Office)

"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it," read a note photographed by Robinson's roommate, according to authorities.

"You weren't the one who did it right????" the roommate allegedly wrote to Robinson.

"I am, I'm sorry," Robinson said, according to the court documents.

"It's going to dirty up Robinson. The jurors are not going to like him because not only is there no legal justification for what he did, but there's really no moral one whatsoever."

While prosecutors are still piecing together a motive, Utah Gov. Spencer said Kirk's death was a "political assassination." He said that one of the bullets allegedly used by Robinson had an engraving that read "Hey fascist, catch."

"I think that speaks for itself," Cox said during a news conference.

Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital that prosecutors are going to rely on this evidence more during the penalty phase in order to convince jurors to hand down a death sentence for Robinson.

"The Utah County prosecutor is going to try to put Robinson to death and the motive for the killing is going to be something that is key evidence in the case. It's going to dirty up Robinson," Rahmani said.

Robinson will only face the death sentence if 12 out of 12 jurors agree he should be killed for his alleged crimes, which only makes it more important for prosecutors to outline a clear, detailed motive, Rahmani said.

"To the extent that the prosecution has to get 12 out of 12 jurors to return that death sentence. The motive for the crime will be an important reason why the prosecution may get there," he said. "So when jurors are weighing the death penalty, the reason why someone killed another human being, if it was for political reasons, that's certainly an aggravated factor."

"Even one or two jurors could save Tyler Robinson's life. And just from a pure numbers perspective, there are some people that have a difficult time looking another human being in the eye and giving them lethal injection or the firing squad," Rahmani added. "The other possibility, of course, is they try to defend the case in the guilt phase. It's going to be very hard to defend, but they'll have to argue some sort of radicalization."

While Robinson's attorney, Kathryn Nester, hasn't yet responded to prosecutors' claims on why their client killed Kirk, she said during a Monday court hearing that the defense is reserving the right to call for a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors would be forced to disclose evidence and allow for cross-examination before the case proceeds.

Robinson is due back in court on Oct. 30.

Moshe Lavi, the brother-in-law of Israeli hostage Omri Miran, discusses the Trump administration's efforts to make a peace deal between Israel and Hamas on ‘Saturday in America.'

On June 11, Hadas Levy became the first woman to give birth to a child fathered by a soldier killed in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the Oct. 7 massacre that claimed 1,200 lives.

Capt. (res.) Netanel Silberg, Levy's fiancé, was killed in combat in Gaza in December 2023. The couple met on a blind date arranged by friends in May 2022.

"He was very handsome. He came to pick me up and waited for me outside his car, like a man from another era. He was tall — about 1.80 meters (approximately 5 feet, 11 inches) — well-built, and when he removed his glasses, he had the most beautiful green eyes. He was the whole package," Levy told Fox News Digital.

As the full extent of the Oct. 7 carnage emerged, Silberg answered the call to arms. Although his age and rank exempted him from serving in Gaza, he joined the first wave of soldiers deployed there.

"I kept telling him not to go, but he was restless. He went to pick up his army gear from his parents and said he would come back, but instead he went to the battlefield," Levy recalled.

While on leave the following month, Silberg bought a ring and proposed.

"We got engaged around November, but we didn't have a party. We never spoke about what I would do if something happened to him, because it wasn't an option," Levy said.

On Dec. 18, 2023, Silberg was killed in action.

"I was working that morning. I'm not a spiritual person, but I felt such intense nausea that I had to spit into a garbage can. I went home early, and it turned out the nausea struck at the same time he was killed," Levy recalled.

Because the couple was not married, Levy received no official notification; she learned of Silberg's death through a phone call from his mother. It was on that call when Levy asked his mother the question that would continue on his legacy.

"I just remember lying on the carpet and begging his mother on the phone to ask them to perform the procedure to collect Netanel's sperm. She said yes immediately," Levy said.

BODY OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE WHO WAS HELD FOR NEARLY 700 DAYS IN GAZA IS RECOVERED

The procedure of collecting the deceased male's sperm, once rare, became common after Oct. 7, Dr. Eran Altman, director of the sperm bank and men's infertility clinic at Rabin Medical Center–Beilinson Hospital, told Fox News Digital. The procedure is similar to one performed on infertile living men.

"In the week after Oct. 7, because of the mass killings, it took time to identify the bodies. We received them several days later and tried to retrieve sperm, but we found that after more than 72 hours, and usually after 48 hours, the sperm is no longer viable," he said.

Since then, the Israeli army has become more efficient at transporting bodies quickly, ensuring casualties arrive in their uniforms and gear to avoid delaying the procedure.

The sperm is preserved in liquid nitrogen at –196 degrees Celsius, where it can remain viable for decades.

Previously, a court order was required to collect the samples from fallen soldiers. Since Oct. 7, the law has been temporarily amended: the procedure can now be performed without a court order, but the sperm cannot be used without one. Altman's clinic at Rabin Medical Center–Beilinson Hospital collected eleven sperm samples from Silberg.

During shiva, the seven-day Jewish mourning period, Levy told Silberg's mother that she would begin the process of conceiving using his samples.

"I felt like there was no life without him and that I couldn't continue. I felt it was the only living thing that I could still get from him. I wanted something from him growing inside me," Levy said.

ARMED FOR SURVIVAL: HOW OCT 7 HAMAS MASSACRE TRANSFORMED GUN CULTURE IN ISRAEL

Levy described the challenges of navigating her pregnancy without her partner. She said she had to take every test alone and explain his absence whenever asked about the father. With Netanel deceased, she was unable to undergo genetic screenings and often had to rely on his mother for information about his family.

In June, Levy gave birth to her son via C-section at Hadassah University Hospital on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem, where she had also undergone insemination accompanied by Dr. Efrat Esh-Broder from the IVF unit.

"I love him because he is who he is, not because he is his father's son. I didn't call him Netanel. He is not a gravestone," she told Fox News Digital.

Three months later, her son has his father's nose and ears. Levy said Silberg would have been upset, as he never liked his own features.

"We look at pictures of Netanel already. He needs to be proud of his dad, his dad's story is one of bravery. He needs to know he has a dad and a family," she said.

Levy is frequently approached by women seeking guidance on the process. In addition to her, around six other IDF widows are pursuing parenthood using sperm retrieved from their deceased husbands.

The IDF Widows and Orphans Organization (IDFWO) offers comprehensive support throughout the process, helping families navigate emotional, legal, and medical challenges.

"You must want the child for the child and not for his father who was killed. It's something that is forgotten sometimes. The child can't only be his father's son, it's not fair. To the girls who want to do it, I say do it. It's continuity, it's life and it's amazing," Levy said.

            Batters try all sorts to get themselves right when they're having a bad day at the plate.
    


            Some go and splash some water on their face. Others offer up a prayer.
    


Shohei Ohtani found a simple solution in his playoff pitching debut on Saturday night: why not just go and strike out nine from the mound?
    


            “It's really never been done, certainly at this level,” Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of his star player's two-way performance against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 of their NLDS matchup. “I use the word compartmentalize a lot, this epitomizes compartmentalizing. He's essentially two people in one game.
    


            “To look at the at-bats he took tonight and how he struggled offensively, to separate that and just be a pitcher … and keep us in the ballgame. I don't know any other human that can manage those emotions, how do you not take to the mound? We continue to just witness history.”
    


Shohei Ohtani's two home runs in Dodgers win over Reds highlights night of MLB Wild Card action



            Ohtani's nine strikeouts were the third most ever made by a Dodgers pitcher in their career playoff debut. Only Don Newcombe – with 11 in the 1949 World Series – and Tim Belcher – with 10 in the 1988 NLCS – have racked up more.
    


            The Japanese superstar threw 89 pitches across six innings, giving up three runs in the second but recovering by sitting down 15 of the last 17 hitters he faced. Even the Phillies' biggest hitters like Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper couldn't muster a hit against Ohtani, who earned the win as the Dodgers prevailed 5-3.
    


            His excellent showing was even more impressive considering how much of an off day he had with the bat.
    


            Historically, Ohtani has misfired with the bat at Philadelphia – going into the game, none of his 250 career homers have come there. That did not change on Saturday as he produced an uncharacteristically shaky performance, going 0-for-4 with a walk and four strikeouts.
    


            But such is Ohtani's unique status in the game that he made history simply by stepping up to the plate – the 31-year-old is the first player in Major League history to start at least one game as a pitcher and at least one as a non-pitcher in the same postseason.
    


            He also became just the second starting pitcher to bat higher than eighth. Babe Ruth – who was sixth in the lineup for the Boston Red Sox in Game 4 of the World Series in 1918 – was the first.
    


            “I was a little nervous imagining myself out there on the mound. But once I was on the mound and on the field, that went away, and it was really me focusing. I was able to enjoy the atmosphere,” Ohtani told reporters after Saturday's game.
    


            “The reason why I'm a two-way player is because that's who I am, it's what I can do and, at the same time, it's what the team wants.”
    


            The Dodgers claimed their eighth World Series title last year partly on the back of Ohtani's historic season at the plate. Keep this up, and he has a shot at pitching Los Angeles to a repeat.

            President Donald Trump told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to cede power and control of Gaza, amid ongoing efforts to push forward his proposed ceasefire plan.
    


            “Complete Obliteration!” Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked via text message on Saturday what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power.
    


            Tapper pressed the president on Hamas' response to his 20-point ceasefire proposal, citing Sen. Lindsey Graham's interpretation that Hamas had effectively rejected the plan by insisting on “no disarmament, keeping Gaza under Palestinian control and tying hostage release to negotiations.”
    


            “Is he wrong?” Tapper asked.
    


            “We will find out. Only time will tell!!!” Trump responded.
    


            The president said he expects clarity “soon” on whether Hamas is genuinely committed to peace.
    


            “Yes on Bibi,” Trump said, when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fully on board with ending the bombing campaign in Gaza and supporting the president's broader vision.
    


            Trump added that he is hopeful his ceasefire proposal will become a reality and emphasized that he's working hard to achieve it.
    


            Earlier on Saturday, the president said that Israel agreed to the initial withdrawal line outlined in his proposed ceasefire plan for Israel and Hamas.
    


            In a post on social media, he said the administration is now waiting for confirmation from Hamas.
    


            If Hamas agrees, Trump said, a ceasefire would be “immediately effective” and a hostage and prisoner exchange would begin.
    


            “After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.



            Trump also said Saturday that Israel had temporarily halted its airstrikes on Gaza, calling it a critical step toward finalizing a ceasefire agreement, securing the release of hostages, and warned Hamas to act swiftly.
    


            Earlier on the same day, however, CNN reported that at least 67 people in Gaza died due to Israeli strikes, according to hospital officials in the enclave.
    


            The president revealed Friday that Hamas had responded positively to his 20-point proposal aimed at ending the conflict. Speaking in a video posted to Truth Social, Trump called it “a big day,” and described the developments as “unprecedented.”

Former Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., talks about how recent attacks on conservatives may galvanize voters in key elections.

EXCLUSIVE: Much has changed in the political landscape since former Rep. Dave Brat's upset win over then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., though conservatives have repeatedly managed to gain ground over time.

Democrats have been lambasted as of late for heated political rhetoric that has led – whether directly or indirectly – to death threats and attacks on Republicans and conservatives.

Brat, now vice provost at Liberty University in Lynchburg, noted he was speaking for himself and discussed how the politics of "rage" made their way to Virginia in recent weeks.

Recordings of former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, telling crowds to "let your rage fuel you" have made the rounds amid already heightened political tensions following assassination attempts on President Donald Trump, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the murder of Charlie Kirk.

"I was on a radio show earlier this morning and Spanberger -- all political views are my own again -- gave out the secret sauce on the left: Let your rage out, right. That's her new line," Brat said, citing those remarks.

Spanberger dismissed any contention that she is encouraging violence, telling Fox News Digital through a spokesperson that she will "continue to condemn comments that continue to make light of or justify violence of any kind – full stop."

Brat was unconvinced, adding that he has looked into "psychological underpinnings" of political movements including the nascent transgender rights issues that have been front-and-center in Virginia schools and public spaces.

"We (Republicans) believe in protecting the rights of all people. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness for everybody. We're the ones where the Judeo-Christian West is the tradition. They gave you human rights in the 12th century all the way up through protections in our Constitution. So that's now what's at stake."

Within the last week, multiple reports of death threats against Virginia lawmakers came to light.

Del. Geary Higgins, R-Lovettsville, told Fox News Digital a man allegedly threatened to shoot him at his next rally in response to a defense of GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears after she was faced with racist signage at a protest.

Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, faced a similar threat – telling Fox News Digital a man allegedly threatened to kill her while claiming Republicans are ruining the country.

Some on the left have harnessed such "rage" politics in their latest attempt to paint the Judeo-Christian right as the "judgmental, bad people" as they have in past elections, Brat said.

"When minority [groups] get to act like they're the majority and put these crazy sexual stuff in kindergarten textbooks. That's we're against. And then when the trans folks are out with quotes saying ‘When we come alive and find out who we are, the emotions come out full force. And it ends up, you know, letting us, in a sense of rage' -- and this is in quotes out on the web all over the place, a bunch of other emotions as well," Brat said.

"And so, for the left to be using these folks as a political tool, for me, it's just obscene."

The right, he said, is the actual political wing that created the "protection of minority rights."

Similar public derision by conservatives is not new, and is something he had to deal with during his own time in office, Brat contended, when asked what has changed in the decade-plus since.

"What else has changed: There's been a MAGA revolution," he said – adding it was much different even on the right when he was in office and conservatives were out of vogue.

WHO IS VIRGINIA'S NEXT GLENN YOUNGKIN: HOW THE GOP WINS STATEWIDE AGAIN

Brat spoke about the friction he and the new crop of conservatives had with the proverbial "old guard" during their time, remarking that now-Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard – then a Hawaii Democrat – was one of few to even acknowledge them.

"We were backbenchers. Tulsi Gabbard would come back and hang out with us because we were fun," he quipped.

Brat also clashed with top Republicans including anti-Trump then-Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., the leader of the House Ethics Committee.

Dent later denied Brat's claim he wanted to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the GOP conference for not toeing the line.

The Freedom Caucus, which included Brat, also played a pivotal role in ousting then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio – a role for which the man Brat beat, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., was seen as heir apparent.

I'M A DEMOCRAT, AND CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER MUST UNITE ALL AMERICANS AGAINST VIOLENCE

While the caucus remains, currently under the leadership of Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the "MAGA Revolution" and Tesla CEO Elon Musk's split from the Silicon Valley establishment have greatly affected body politic, Brat said.

Those, he said, should be a boon to Earle-Sears and the Virginia GOP ticket.

"So nothing's really changed, it's the same ingredients."

Brat said the one condition of U.S. politics that has changed since his own win or Youngkin's win has been events like the murder of Charlie Kirk, which also connects to the theme of rage in politics.

Brat said that after 9/11, church attendance briefly rose and "nationalism kicked in" – but faded quickly.

Kirk's murder and other recent threats against lawmakers are likely to stick longer in voters' minds, Brat predicted. Kirk's murder has also been linked by some to leftist "rage."

Kirk combined faith with constitutional principles, Brat said, adding younger people are becoming educated in that way through people like the TPUSA leader.

"Charlie was all about faith and reason together in the university -- that's what a university is supposed to do is unite faith and reason," said Brat.

"If that comes to fruition right now, we could see some shockers in Virginia and New Jersey."

HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. (AP) — By the roiling rapids of converging rivers, President Donald Trump's campaign to have the government tell a happier story of American history confronts its toughest challenge. There is no positive spin to be put on slavery.

At frozen-in-time Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, people in the National Park Service are navigating shoals that federal storytellers across the nation must now negotiate. How do you tell the truth if it might not be the whole truth?

As part of a broader Trump directive reaching across the government and the country, the park service is under orders to review interpretive materials at all its historical properties and remove or alter descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” or otherwise sully the American story. This comes as the Republican president has complained about institutions that go too deep, in his view, on “how bad slavery was.”

It's too soon to know whether his directive is causing the arc of history to bend toward sanitized revisionism. There are at least scattered indications that the reviewers may be treading carefully in reshaping America's core stories.




Brianna Wheeler hopes they stay true to history. She is a direct descendant of one of abolitionist John Brown's anti-slavery raiders who laid siege to the U.S. armory at Harpers Ferry in a bloody 1859 assault that set the stage for the Civil War. The shame of slavery must not be ignored, she said.

“You can't wipe that,” she told The Associated Press. “You can't erase that. It's our obligation to not let that be erased.”

At some parks, employees on the ground told the AP, brochures with references to “enslavers” have been pulled for revision and everything is getting a hard look.

Yet in the guided tour about Brown's raid, the story presented about slavery remains unflinching. And at Fort Pulaski National Monument outside Savannah, Georgia, a photo of a whipped yet dignified man with welts across his back still occupied its prominent spot on an exhibit in the visitors center during a recent visit.

Its caption: “The enforcement of the slave regime relied on violence.” 

The deadline recently passed for parks officials to remove “inappropriate content” from public display. More than 80 Democratic lawmakers then asked the National Park Service chief for a full accounting of changes made in the “pursuit of censorship and erasure.”

The Sierra Club, which is tracking changes nationally, said more than 1,000 items were flagged for review at national parks. But it has only confirmed one example of signage being removed. It was at Muir Woods National Monument in California. 

It was changed during the Biden administration to highlight the violent displacement of Indigenous peoples, their enslavement by missionaries and other harms wrought by privileged classes. Yellow sticky notes were attached to existing wording to round out that story. Now that the signage is gone.

The Interior Department order covers more than history. At the nature parks, material that “emphasizes matters unrelated to the beauty, abundance, or grandeur” also is to be flagged. That means references to climate change or other human degradations of nature.

At Acadia National Park in Maine, 10 signs citing climate change are now gone, said Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine. 

“Our national parks are not billboards for propaganda,” she told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a letter. “They are places where millions of people come each year to learn, reflect, and confront both the beauty and the difficult truths of our shared history.” The Interior Department would not confirm changes at Acadia, saying the review there continues.

Pressure to brighten the American story has also come to the Smithsonian Institution museums, which get most of their money from the government.

Trump posted on social media that museum exhibits are about “how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been,” and threatened to cut funding. In fact, the history museum reflects bountiful achievements in industry, science, culture and war as well as the legacies of injustice.

In the review at parks, a decision was made locally, not from Washington, that the 1863 photograph of a lashed Black man that was on display at Fort Pulaski should be removed, said a federal official involved in the national review who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Two federal officials said the photograph was not taken down at Fort Pulaski, nor will it be removed from any other park service sites.

One of the officials, National Park Service spokesperson Elizabeth Peace, told the AP: “If any interpretive materials are found to have been removed or altered prematurely or in error, the Department will review the circumstances and take corrective action as appropriate. Our goal is accuracy and balance, not removal for its own sake.”

The man depicted in the photo had escaped a Louisiana plantation to enlist in the Union Army. It became one of the Civil War's most powerful images, exposing the brutality of slavery, according to the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery. 

Still, under marching orders from the Interior Department, national historical parks must focus on “solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing.”

A far more complex story was told in a recent guided tour at Harpers Ferry. Brown was held up as a transformational figure whose audacious and deadly raid swelled Northern anti-slavery sentiment on the cusp of a war that produced “a new birth of freedom.” 

So said the park ranger speaking to a crowd on a bluff overlooking where the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers smash together like the forces of North and South once did.

Whether Brown is a hero is explicitly left for you to decide. This fierce abolitionist had plenty of blood on his hands even before he set foot in Harpers Ferry. Witnesses said he and his band killed five pro-slavery men and boys in a Kansas massacre sparked by enmity between pro-slavery and anti-slavery Kansans.

Wheeler is a descendant of Dangerfield Newby, the first of Brown's raiders to die in the Harpers Ferry fighting. 

One of more than 20 children from a white enslaver and a Black enslaved woman, Newby was freed in Ohio while his common law wife, Harriet, and their children remained in bondage in Virginia. He was saving up to buy and liberate them when he joined Brown's band of men. 

Newby was shot dead by a musket loaded with a railroad spike in a street battle between townspeople and the raiders. His body was mutilated. Wheeler said that the chilling scene with her ancestor and the broader experience of millions of enslaved people are as much a part of the American story as the uplifting episodes. 

This country must know “what really made America,” Wheeler said. “Who bled, whose blood is in these stones and on these streets. Harpers Ferry is a huge thread in that tapestry.”

So is Brown a hero in the eyes of his descendant? “Yes,” says Wheeler, because he gave up everything, including his life, for a monumental cause. But “he's not a superhero. He's a flawed character.”

He's complicated. Like history itself.

            The ongoing battle between the Trump administration and Democrat-led cities intensified this weekend, with a federal judge in Oregon hitting pause on the president's plan to deploy federal troops in Portland, and the White House announcing authorization for hundreds of National Guard members to be sent to Chicago.
    


            Those developments came against the backdrop of continuing protests in Chicago and Portland against federal law enforcement carrying out President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration enforcement agenda.
    


            Trump and his administration have framed demonstrations in the two cities as “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” arguing that military deployments are necessary to protect federal immigration personnel and property – despite state and city leaders' insistence that the protests have been largely peaceful and any violence has been easily dealt with by local law enforcement.
    


            Tensions spiked in Chicago Saturday after US Customs and Border Protection agents fired “defensive shots” at a woman who the Department of Homeland Security said rammed her car into a federal law enforcement vehicle. DHS said the woman is in FBI custody after being discharged from the hospital, and she and another person are now facing federal criminal charges in connection with the incident.
    


            Here's the latest:
    


            District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order Saturday blocking Trump from sending the National Guard to Portland, ruling that city and Oregon officials “are likely to succeed on their claim that the President exceeded his constitutional authority and violated the Tenth Amendment” in ordering the deployment.
    


            Immergut – a Trump appointee – said the president appeared to have federalized the Oregon National Guard “absent constitutional authority” and that protests in Portland “did not pose a ‘danger of a rebellion.'” The judge said Oregon attorneys showed “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent” leading up to the president's directive.
    


            The Trump administration swiftly filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
    


            The judge did note that recent incidents cited by the Trump administration of protesters clashing with federal officers “are inexcusable,” but said “they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces.”
    


            Immergut warned some of the arguments offered by the Trump administration “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power—to the detriment of this nation.”
    


Judge temporarily blocks Trump's National Guard deployment in Portland



            Roughly 200 National Guard troops were undergoing training in preparation for a potential deployment to Portland, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN Friday. The new ruling places the National Guard back under the command of Gov. Tina Kotek for now, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.
    


            The temporary restraining order expires in 14 days, but the state plans to request an extension, Rayfield said. CNN reached out to the governor's office for details on any changes to the Oregon National Guard's status.
    


            Amid the legal victory for state leaders, crowds of protesters continued to gather late into the night Saturday outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland.
    


            Demonstrators both for and against the National Guard deployment rallied outside the building, according to CNN affiliate KATU, whose crews reported seeing federal agents deploying multiple rounds of pepper balls, flash bangs and tear gas to clear streets.
    


            Portland's police department said its officers did not see any crimes against people or property during Saturday's demonstration and that they made no arrests and did not use munitions. The department referred CNN's questions regarding reports of law enforcement's use of munitions to federal authorities.
    


            CNN reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for further information.
    


            On Saturday, the White House announced the president had authorized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to “protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago, a move Trump has been promising for weeks.
    


            “Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like (Illinois Gov. JB) Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.”
    


            Hours before the announcement, the Illinois governor said he was dealt an “ultimatum.”
    


            “This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said on X Saturday. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”
    


DHS says officers in Chicago fired at driver who ‘rammed the law enforcement vehicle'



            Tensions around anti-ICE protests in Chicago escalated earlier in the day after Customs and Border Protection agents shot at an armed woman after she rammed a law enforcement vehicle, according to the DHS.
    


            Officers fired “defensive shots” at the woman after she – along with the drivers of at least 10 other vehicles – rammed and boxed in officers, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a post on X.
    


            “Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” McLaughlin said in her post. “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds.”
    


            On Sunday, Pritzker told CNN's Jake Tapper that the Trump administration is releasing information before local officials have had a chance to assess.
    


            “What happens in these sorts of incidents is typically, ICE puts out a press release before anybody else can speak with the press and then it gets reported on social media and elsewhere,” Pritzker said on “State of the Union.” “They are just putting out their propaganda, and then we've got to later determine what actually happened.”
    


            DHS later identified the woman as 30-year-old Marimar Martinez and said she is in FBI custody after being discharged from the hospital. Martinez was named in an intelligence bulletin last week “for doxing agents and posting online,” McLaughlin said.
    


            Another person, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, 21, was “involved in the ramming” and is in law enforcement custody, DHS said. The two are facing federal charges related to Saturday's incident, authorities said Sunday in a news release. 



            Court documents say the two “forcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded, intimidated, and interfered with an officer of the United States.”
    


            CNN is working to determine legal representation for Martinez and Ruiz.
    


            Law enforcement also deployed gas canisters at the protesters Saturday, according to footage from Reuters. The footage shows protesters screaming, running, and shielding themselves.
    


            “This is Brighton Park, this is not a war zone,” one woman told a journalist.

            This isn't the first time Charles Munger Jr. has fought to safeguard California's independent redistricting.
    


            When a suit filed by Arizona Republicans to disband their state's commission threatened to topple California's five-year-old panel, Munger rallied his former allies and braced for battle.
    


            “I'm a redistricting reform zealot,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015.
    


            Now, Munger is launching a new crusade, squaring off against Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats in a November race that could reshape the rest of President Donald Trump's term and the future of gerrymandering reform.
    


            Newsom is leading the push to convince voters to allow his party to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by the Munger-backed commission to create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats. The governor has argued California must “fight fire with fire” after Republicans in Texas and other states redrew their US House maps at the behest of Trump, who is trying to prevent Democrats from regaining House control in next year's midterm elections.
    


            If Proposition 50 passes, the state would reimplement independent congressional lines in 2031. But Munger and other critics argue the measure would permanently undermine attempts to end gerrymandering.
    


            Munger, who spent more than a decade as a dominating force in California politics before stepping back in 2016, has already spent more than $30 million to defend the reforms he helped pass more than 15 years ago.
    


            That spending has made him a target of Democrats, who have made him the face of a recent ad arguing he's “spending millions to help Trump rig the election.” Supporters of Proposition 50 have also pointed to donations he's made to groups that oppose abortion and gay marriage to paint him as a far-right conservative seeking simply to aid his party.
    


            A spokesperson for Munger, who declined to be interviewed, offered a simpler explanation for his activism.
    


            “Charles has no motive beyond preserving these landmark reforms,” Amy Thoma Tan said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Like his seven siblings, Munger inherited his political fortune from his father and namesake, Charles T. Munger Sr., the right-hand man of Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. Munger Sr. raised his kids “to be skeptical, even contrarian,” Charles' half-sister Molly Munger, a prolific liberal donor in her own right, said in “Poor Charlie's Almanack,” a collection of the elder Munger's talks and speeches.
    


            Munger Sr., who Forbes estimated had a net worth of $2.6 billion upon his death in 2023, started distributing his fortune to his children while he was still alive.
    


            The younger Munger favored physics over business. He graduated with a PhD in atomic physics from the University of California at Berkeley and spent much of his professional career working as an experimental physicist.
    


            After a brief stint as a Democrat – he made calls on behalf of former President Jimmy Carter during his first presidential run – he joined the Republican Party.
    


            Those who've worked with him over the years say he tends to avoid the spotlight, but is always wearing one of his signature bow ties when he is in public. He applies the same level of academic rigor to politics as he does to his scientific pursuits.
    


            “Not to diminish the finances that he provided the state party and Republican candidates, but I found his advice and counsel worth more than the dollars he gave,” said Jim Brulte, a former California Republican Party chair who made Munger chair of his initiatives committee.
    


            Dan Schnur, a former Republican who got to know Munger while working on redistricting issues nearly twenty years ago, described Munger as “quirky,” a scientist by training who brought a similarly bookish approach to politics.
    


            The two also crossed paths at the Lincoln Club of Northern California, a Bay Area fundraising organization for “old school,” economically conservative but socially moderate Republicans of which Munger was a member. Munger was unlike most major donors, many of whom Schnur said can be loud, opinionated and full of themselves.
    


            “If anything, Charles was just the opposite of that – he tended to be very quiet, very circumspect, and when he did speak up, it tended to be in a much more solicitous manner,” Schnur said. “You'd never know from the way he conducted himself that he was worth more than the rest of the room combined.”
    


            Frustrated with the way Palo Alto schools taught math, Munger joined the state's curriculum commission in 2003. He waded into major political spending in 2005, when he gave $100,000 to an unsuccessful redistricting measure backed by former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
    


            Three years later, he was brought on as a funder to support Proposition 11, which created the Citizens Redistricting Commission tasked with drawing legislative maps. In 2010, Munger co-authored Proposition 20, which would also transfer the power to draw congressional lines to the independent commission.
    


            He spent about $14 million on the two measures, but reformers who worked with him at the time said he gave more than just his money.
    


            “He went over everything with a fine-toothed comb,” Kathay Feng, the former president of Common Cause, told the New York Times in 2010. “But it forced us to do our homework. He's a thoughtful, geeky guy.”
    


            Beyond his direct contributions to Proposition 20, Munger also helped finance the distribution of “Gerrymandering,” a documentary on legislative map drawing released in September 2010. Munger helped mail 660,000 free DVDs of the film to California voters and sponsored its theatrical release.
    


            A rival coalition backed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued the redistricting commission was a costly, confusing system that handed power to unelected bureaucrats and mandated “Jim Crow economic districts.”
    


            Duf Sundheim, a former California GOP chair and Munger-backed 2016 US Senate candidate, said he recalled sitting in the lobby of the Silicon Valley Stanford Park Hotel with Munger, looking at mailers from opponents of the redistricting commission. Munger would laugh and ask if he recognized the person being described.
    


            “At one level, he thought it was just so ridiculous,” Sundheim told CNN. “At another level, I think he probably would have preferred it that he just not be involved in it at all.”
    


            Then and now, Munger has been accused of being motivated primarily by a desire to help Republicans. The Yes on 50 campaign has spent $600,000 on a recent TV ad tying Munger to Trump, according to recent data from AdImpact.
    


            “Munger was always eyed with suspicion by the right-wing, Tea Party types in the party because Munger was a big tent Republican. He knew that a successful party in California had to grow beyond its insignificant base,” said Rob Stutzman, a California-based GOP strategist who previously worked for Schwarzenegger. “Any notion to tie him to carrying Trump's agenda is, frankly, it's a lie.”
    


            Allies of the Yes on 50 campaign have pointed to a Politico report on $158,000 in charitable contributions he's given over the last 25 years to groups that oppose LGBTQ rights and abortion. They've also noted his donations to more conservative ballot initiatives, such as the more than $35 million he spent in 2012 on a failed proposition that would have restricted unions' political spending.
    


            “Munger is doing the dirty work of this dangerous, dictatorial president,” Yes on 50 spokesperson Hannah Milgrom said in a statement to CNN. “His millions are empowering Trump and helping him rig the 2026 election. If Munger succeeds, Trump wins - and our democracy loses.”
    


            The height of Munger's political activity concluded in 2016, when he spent more than $10 million to fund Proposition 54, which required state lawmakers to make legislation public 72 hours before passing it, put legislative meetings online and allow people to film their own videos of meetings.
    


            Munger and his allies argued the rule would prevent politicians from rushing through backroom deals, while the opposition argued that lawmakers needed the flexibility to reach agreements without extended outside pressure.
    


            Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist who managed the campaign to oppose Proposition 54, said he believed that Munger is “in his heart of hearts, a do-gooder,” but had an unrealistic view of how the legislative process works.
    


            “For somebody who's not involved with government, at all, he believes that that process is important,” Maviglio told CNN. “It's a sort of amateurish view of the way government works, because if you haven't experienced [it], you don't really know the ugly side of sausage making.”
    


            This time, Munger's fight is lonelier. Though he and Schwarzenegger have discussed the current redistricting push in person, according to the latter's spokesperson, the former governor is not part of any campaign. Munger's campaign has spent $1.9 million running a TV ad featuring Schwarzenegger's criticism of the Newsom plan, according to AdImpact data.
    


            The California League of Women Voters is also not opposing Proposition 50. And while Common Cause California initially opposed Proposition 50, the national organization said it would not oppose mid-decade redistricting efforts in the state and sent a fundraising pitch off its decision to return $200,000 Munger had given the group to help fight the new measure.
    


            “Common Cause won't be bought,” the group wrote. “That's what we said in our letter to Munger, and we hope it's as important to you as it is to us.”
    


            Asked for comment on the split with Common Cause, Munger said in a statement that he “had hoped to partner” with the organization and the League of Women Voters, and it was “unfortunate both organizations reversed course.”
    


            “I am disappointed that both have (so far) been silenced in this campaign, and hope that in the future each will return to the principles on which they were founded,” the statement reads.
    


            Munger vowed to fight Proposition 50 in a post on X and laid out his opposition to the measure in a New York Times op-ed. While he condemned mid-decade redistricting in Texas, he warned that “returning to the evils of partisan gerrymandering in California is not the solution.”
    


            He also acknowledged that, given the unique circumstances surrounding Trump's involvement in redistricting, he faced two options himself: stand back as redistricting reform was undermined, or fight a longshot bid to defend the commission, and be labeled “a cat's paw for Republicans seeking to gain House seats.”
    


            “I'm choosing the latter option,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is planning a significant aid package to U.S. soybean farmers to help them survive China's boycott of American beans in response to his trade war even as the president says he is still seeking a soybean deal with Beijing.

But farmers are worried that time is quickly running out to reach a deal in time to sell any of this year's crop to their biggest customer.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday said on CNBC that the public could expect news of “substantial support for our farmers, especially the soybean farmers” as soon as Tuesday.

Details of the aid package are unknown, but it would come as the world's two largest economies have been unable to reach a trade deal and China has halted purchases of U.S. beans. China, the biggest foreign buyer of American soybeans for many years, last bought American beans in May and has not bought any for this harvest season, which began in September.

“The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating' reasons only, not buying,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. “We've made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers.”

“I'll be meeting with President Xi, of China, in four weeks, and Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion,” Trump wrote.

The soybeans that China imports largely for oil extraction and animal feed are an important crop for U.S. agriculture because they are the top U.S. food export, accounting for about 14% of all farm goods sent overseas and China has been buying 25% of all American soybeans in recent years. 




U.S. farmers grew $60.7 billion worth of soybeans, or nearly 4.3 billion bushels, in the 2022-2023 marketing year, according to the American Soybean Association. Just over half were exported. Illinois is the top soybean growing state, but Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota are also large producers.

Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping, to be held at the end of October in South Korea.

In Trump's first trade war with China, he gave American farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 and nearly $46 billion in 2020, though the latter also included aid related to the COVID pandemic.

Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who serves as president of the American Soybean Association, welcomed Trump acknowledging the difficulties faced by farmers. He said actions are needed to prevent many farmers from going out of business.

Before the trade war, farmers were already pinched by high costs and low crop prices, he said. Then, their biggest customer vanished.

“It's just unfortunate that we're being used as a bargaining chip in this trade war that's not of our own doing,” Ragland said.

He said time is running low for the two governments to strike a deal, because China has already ordered soybeans from countries such as Brazil and Argentina for deliveries through December and, if there's no soybean deal soon, China could skip the U.S. entirely.

“If they get another couple months, they're into new crop soybeans in Brazil and Argentina. And they're going to bypass us altogether if we're not careful,” Ragland said.

China has slapped 20% tariffs on U.S. soybeans since Trump announced his tariffs on the world in the spring, making U.S. beans uncompetitive in price.

The retaliatory tariffs are in response to Trump's new import taxes on Chinese goods over allegations that Beijing has failed to stem the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl as well as Trump's across-the-board “Liberation Day” tariffs, which have been reduced to the 10% baseline rate.

Observers say China could ease tariffs on U.S. farm goods should the White House walk back on fentanyl-related tariffs. That has yet to happen.

The White House “has not prioritized fentanyl” since this spring, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. She said Wang Xiaohong, China's public security minister, showed up in Geneva in May but met no counterpart from the U.S. to negotiate with.

But it is not time yet to write off a soybean deal, she said. “China still needs to have something to show for at the leadership meeting in South Korea,” Sun said.

Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said a soybean deal is “the lowest-hanging fruit” for both governments. 

“China needs beans, and the U.S. has them to sell. It costs China basically nothing to shift towards U.S. beans and away from Brazil and Argentina,” Wildau said. “If Washington and Beijing can't reach a deal on soybeans, then they don't have much hope of reaching a deal on thornier issues like export controls.”

Argentina is a sore subject for U.S. farmers right now because on September 24, Beijing took advantage of a tax holiday in Argentina and ordered nearly 2 million tons of Argentine soybean and soy products. The tax holiday came after the U.S. signaled it would provide a $20 billion support package to help stabilize the Latin American country's economy. 

“That situation was angering to many farmers,” Ragland said. “And while I don't think the specific intent was just to give a big chunk, give $20 billion to Argentina so that they could send China soybeans. That was the result. And the optics of it look absolutely terrible.”

Government aid might be necessary to help farmers get through this year if they cannot sell to China, but farmers say they would rather sell their crops on the market.

“All farmers are proud of what they do and they don't like handouts. We'd rather make it with our own two hands than have it handed to us,” Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt said. 

Meanwhile, farmers like Ryan Mackenthun, a fifth-generation farmer in south-central Minnesota, say they will do everything they can to survive.

“It's definitely tighten the belt, to look at the inputs, look at the previous investments I made in fertilizer and see if I can stretch another year or two out of them to reduce costs but maintain the same yield projections, run equipment longer,” Mackenthun said.

﻿It's not just you. Today's fads are harder to follow now.

If you're not quite sure why everything is suddenly Dubai chocolate or what exactly a Labubu is, you're not alone. Trends have such a tenuous connection to our culture at large that posters online have started to identify the phenomenon with word salad: “labubu matcha dubai chocolate crumbl cookie benson boone …” You get the gist.

Amanda Mull, who's writes about consumerism and the internet for Bloomberg, says this miasma of trends is all a part of our algorithm-mediated world.

When Mull looks back at fads of the past, like when everyone was collecting Beanie Babies back in the nineties, she can follow a clear trail of sociological phenomena and human actors that paved the way from cult status to ubiquity.

But tastemakers don't control trends anymore; the algorithm does. What all of these new fads have in common is the ability to grab your attention while scrolling on TikTok or Instagram Reels. Something like the soothing green hue of a matcha latte or the rich textures of the kunafeh filling in a Dubai chocolate bar is perfectly positioned to make you pause as you scroll.

Mull spoke with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram about how trends used to work pre-algorithm and what evolving social media consumption means for the trend cycles of the future. Below is an excerpt of their conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You wrote about a strange group of items that had a very big summer. 

Well, I have to give full credit for this to zoomer internet users who sort of created this grouping of trends on their own. The matcha lattes go along with Dubai chocolat,e and Labubus, and Love Island, and Benson Boone — and you can sort of spiral out from there.

This set of weird recent trends, I think, is indicative of how weird the trend cycles have gotten in consumer goods in the past. Trends have forever seemed a little bit weird, because the average person doesn't have a ton of insight on where something ultimately came from that is suddenly everywhere. You know, in the Devil Wears Prada scene about cerulean and blue sweaters sort of demonstrates that dynamic, and that's existed for a long time.

But when you get down to it, a lot of random-seeming trends in consumer goods from decades past have a pretty easy way to explain them if you dig a little bit. Trends recently seem to have even less connective tissue to culture at large than they used to, which is a real change in how trends are produced, how people become aware of things, why people buy things.

So what binds all these things together? 

Yes, a lot of this is TikTok fueled, but in general, this I think is a phenomenon of algorithmic social media, because when you interact with things on these platforms, when you're presented with things on these platforms, you have very little context. So, you don't have the sort of traditional methods of learning about new pieces of culture, whether that's word of mouth or dissemination through traditional media. That means that the things that catch on, the things that end up getting seen by a large audience, it's very, very difficult to trace where they came from, why they became interesting to so many people, or what any of it means.

The algorithm certainly feels like a helpful explanation of how these random things sort of took the summer by storm. But I think you write in your piece about the fact that we have seen stuff like these things become popular before. I think the best example might be not Benson Boone, but, like, the Beanie Baby, because it's so close to a Labubu What was the difference then, and why did Beanie Babies happen?

Yeah, well, Beanie Babies are a fascinating story, because they seem so random. But they're actually a really good demonstration of how trends are traditionally disseminated through culture.

They came around as collectibles sold in gift shops and stationery stores by a relatively small toy company who was looking to increase sales by stoking demand through the sort of traditional, well-known marketing tactics of false scarcity, and limited editions, and things like that. But they really took off because eBay was launching at the same time. So, Americans were presented with this idea that anybody could resell anything to anybody else in the country, and you could do it from home, and you could quit your day job by selling random stuff. Beanie Babies as a financial instrument, that was the response to a new type of commerce. That's what really fueled them.

And how does that compare, then, to the Labubu thing?

In the sort of traditional trend environment, like with Beanie Babies, it really mattered if the thing you were selling or buying was real. People had sort of rational beliefs about — and by rational, I don't mean reasonable, let me be clear — but they had reasons that were rational enough for wanting particular dolls at particular prices. With the Labubus, there's not quite so much of that at all.

In fact, there's very real demand for real Labubus. But alongside them, the market for fakes — which are adorably called Lafufus — has really exploded. The craze is fueled by people just wanting to clip one of these things onto their outfits. It's not about the Labubus themselves really.

They're all kind of — no judgment — a little infantile? We're talking about sweet treats, and toys, and Benson Boone.

Yeah, I think so. The way that algorithmically mediated social platforms work is by sort of collapsing your capacity to understand the context of what you're looking at. If you're being served things that you don't know why you're seeing this, you don't really know what it is, and then suddenly that thing is everywhere, you sort of lose your capacity to use some of your more mature emotional skills to limit your reactions, because you get, sort of, a split second to react to things.

That is why stuff on social media tends to do the best if it's highly stimulating — if it's colorful, or incredibly delicious looking, or outrageous, or maddening, or offensive. These are the sort of emotional reactions that the algorithmic social media values, because they stoke engagement, they increase people's time on the platforms. So, things that do well in these environments are sort of like maximally stimulating, and that means that you're going to get sold a lot of things that are mostly sold to kids, because the sort of maximal colorful, sweet, cuddly fun stuff is generally made for children.

How do we feel about that, Amanda? 

That's pretty bad. I think that that's not doing anybody any favors culturally. The sort of persistent interest and staying power in a few of these trends is also indicative of a real desire on the part of people who use these platforms to try to make sense of the internet and online life in real life in physical reality. Because these are all, by and large, these are all objects, or things, or experiences that you need to get up and leave your house and go have. They are things that exist in physical reality.

People want to reconcile their online lives with their offline lives. Those are not really separate anymore. Viral objects are a way for people to emotionally, intellectually, bridge that gap that they are constantly straddling. It's like a consensus experience. And it, I think, gives people a little bit of a sense of participation and a sense of … that the stuff they look at on their phone is real.

And is that a good thing? I mean, we talked about the infantilization of adults being a bad thing, but is getting out and making, I don't know, a thing you see on your phone, a tangible consensus reality good for us?

People still want a little bit of consensus reality, that people aren't entirely, sort of, like, feed-brained at this point. People aren't fully satisfied just with seeing things online and participating online. I think that any indicator that we have that people want to have normal, physical, social experiences with each other is probably a good one.

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Deion Sanders said he was “hurting like crazy” after Colorado's loss Saturday night at TCU and believes he has more blood clots in his leg.

“Cat's out of the bag, all right. I think I've got more blood clots,” Sanders said. “It don't make sense. I'm hurting like crazy. ... I'm not getting blood to my leg. That's why my leg is throbbing.”

The 58-year-old Colorado coach sat at times late during the 35-21 loss, and said he had a doctor's appointment Monday to see about the issue. 

“Sorry to get that out, but thank you for noticing,” he said when responding to a question after his health. 

Sanders spent time away from the Buffaloes (2-4, 0-3 Big 12) this summer as he went through treatment for bladder cancer. His doctor said before the season that he was cured from that. It was also revealed that a section of Sanders' intestine was reconstructed to function as a bladder.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame player, who also played Major League Baseball, has struggled with his left foot since having two toes amputated in 2021 because of blood clot issues while at Jackson State. He also missed Pac-12 media day in 2023, his first year at Colorado, after a procedure to remove a blood clot from his right leg and another to straighten toes on his left foot.

Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares reacted to his opponent in the 2025 race, Jay Jones, calling for the death of a former state official, blasting the comments as “disqualifying.”

Leaked text messages from 2022 show Jones called for former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to be shot and wished violence on his children. Miyares, along with many other Republican officials, is now calling for Jones to drop out of the race.

VANCE CALLS ON ‘DERANGED' JAY JONES TO DROP OUT OF VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE AFTER VIOLENT TEXTS EMERGE

“With the recent revelations, it's clear Jay Jones has shown he's reckless, biased, and willing to trade away his integrity, disqualifying himself from ever serving as Attorney General,” Miyares said on Saturday night. “Jay Jones wished for the violent death of a political opponent and then fantasized about that opponent's children dying in their mother's arms.”

“Prior to this week, this race was about competing views on public safety. Now it's about basic fitness for public office,” he added. 

Jones is running against Miyares for attorney general in Virginia. 

The text messages reveal Jones said he would rather shoot former Republican Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert over dictators Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot. 

Jones went on to say he believes Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists.”

“This violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children is beyond disqualifying,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) posted on X. 

“There is no ‘gosh, I'm sorry' here. Jones doesn't have the morality or character to drop out of this race, and his running mates Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and every elected Democrat in Virginia don't have the courage to call on him to step away from this campaign in disgrace,” Youngkin added.

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic candidate for governor, said she spoke to Jones about the text messages but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. 

“I spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted,” Spanberger wrote in a statement. “I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words.”

Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is the Republican gubernatorial nominee, blasted Spanberger for her response.

“Jay Jones literally fantasized about killing a man and two children and Abigail Spanberger still doesn't have the guts to tell him to drop out,” Earle-Sears said.

Earle-Sears went a step further to call for Spanberger to be disqualified for office.

“The unstable pull the triggers but they are inspired by the hate tolerated and encouraged by the leadership of the Democrat Party,” Earle-Sears said during a press conference on Saturday night. “So it is not enough for Jay Jones to drop out of the race. Let me be clear, Spanberger's continuing support for Jay Jones is also disqualifying her for office. ‘Let your rage fuel you,' remember, Abigail said. She and her party's irresponsible behavior have brought us to this point.”

Jones has apologized, saying he takes “full responsibility” for his comments and that he reached out to Gilbert to apologize to him and his family.

Jones could still get votes even if he drops out of the race since ballots have been printed and early voting has already started. 

A recent poll from Christopher Newport University shows Jones leading Miyares by 7 points. But as voting continues through Nov. 4, the scandal could have a major impact on the election.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that layoffs for federal employees will begin if President Donald Trump decides that congressional negotiations to end the government shutdown "are absolutely going nowhere."

"I think that everybody's still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that," Hassett said on CNN's "State of the Union."

His comments come as the government shutdown enters its fifth day, with no clear offramp in sight.

Democrats are holding their ground on their health-care demands, pushing to include a permanent extension of enhanced premium tax credits in any government funding legislation.

Republicans, however, argue that those conversations should happen in December — not as part of government shutdown negotiations — escalating the standoff.

Democrats continue to dig in on their demands as the shutdown enters a new week.

The Senate again on Friday failed to pass two funding bills that would have ended the shutdown. The Republican measure would have funded the government through late November, while Democrats' version included additional health-care funding.

The resolutions previously failed multiple times in the upper chamber last week.

The Trump administration has repeatedly warned of mass layoffs during a government shutdown, saying last week that they would be "imminent."

Trump also said that the shutdown offered him an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash the size of federal agencies and lay off government workers, although the administration has not yet followed through on its threat.

Hassett said Sunday that Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought are "lining things up and getting ready to act if they have to, but hoping that they don't."

Still, Hassett expressed optimism that negotiations this week could resolve the impasse.

"We think the Democrats, there's a chance that they'll be reasonable once they get back into town on Monday," Hassett said on CNN.

"And if they are, then I think there's no reason for those layoffs."

Taylor Swift gave the box office a boost this weekend.

In partnership with AMC, the singer-songwriter brought a 90-minute movie to cinemas for one weekend only to celebrate the release of her 12th album, "The Life of a Showgirl."

The three-day event tallied an estimated $33 million domestically, the biggest album debut event in cinema history. Internationally, the film snared $13 million, bringing the estimated global box office total to $46 million for the weekend.

"On behalf of AMC Theatres and the entire theatrical exhibition industry, I extend our sincerest appreciation to the iconic Taylor Swift for bringing her brilliance and magic to movie theatres this weekend," AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement Sunday. "Her vision to add a cinematic element to her incredible album debut was nothing less than a triumph."

Swift's "The Official Release Party of a Showgirl" featured a music video for the song "The Fate of Ophelia," as well as behind-the-scenes footage from the music video shoot, lyric videos for other songs on the album and personal reflections from the singer.

This is the second collaboration between Swift and AMC. In 2023, the theater chain secured the rights to distribute a filmed version of Swift's Eras Tour concert. The concert film generated more than $261 million at the global box office. It is currently the highest-grossing concert film of all time.

Israel and Hamas prepared for indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, as hopes for a possible ceasefire began to build and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a truce and hostage release could take shape this week.

The negotiations will take place after President Donald Trump welcomed the militant group's statement it has accepted some elements of the U.S. plan. Israel had previously said it supported the new U.S. effort to end the war.

Egypt will host delegations from Israel and Hamas on Monday to discuss the proposed exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, the country's foreign ministry said. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is also joining the talks, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief reporters.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the current situation is "the closest we've come to getting all of the hostages released."

Speaking on ABC's "This Week,'' he described two phases after Hamas accepts Trump's framework: the hostages are released and Israel pulls back to the "yellow line," where it was in August 2024.

The foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issued a joint statement Sunday welcoming steps toward a possible ceasefire.

In backing Hamas' willingness to hand over the running of Gaza to a transitional committee, the ministers called for an "immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal."

They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, and reaching an agreement on security leading to a "full Israeli withdrawal" from Gaza.

Rubio noted that these decisions regarding a governing structure or international group to manage Gaza can take place simultaneously with the first step of the ceasefire, an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel.

"That's the part that I think is goin; g to be a little tougher to work through, but that's what's going to provide permanency to the end of the conflict," he said.

Trump has also ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza, but residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the Gaza Strip over the weekend.

"While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time," Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Badrosian told journalists. She also said Netanyahu is in "regular contact" with Trump and that the prime minister has stressed that the talks in Egypt "will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for maneuvers that will delay talks by Hamas."

At least eight people were killed Sunday in multiple strikes in the city, according to the Shifa hospital, which received the casualties. Half of them were killed in a strike that hit a group of people in Gaza City, the hospital said.

Four people also were killed in a shooting near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser hospital. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the shooting and did not immediately comment on the strikes.

"We're on the brink, and we don't know whether one will die of a strike or starvation," said Mahmoud Hashem, a Palestinian father of five, who is forced to shelter in a tent in the center of Gaza City.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war reached 67,139 on Sunday, with nearly 170,000 injured. The Health Ministry does not differentiate how many of those killed were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up about half of the dead. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

The Israeli military said Saturday it is continuing to work to dismantle Hamas infrastructure across the strip and warned residents not to return to northern Gaza.

Rubio said the U.S. will look into Israel's operations over the weekend, because Israel cannot be engaged in active combat if they are moving toward a deal.

"The Israelis have said that they would only deal with imminent threats, so we'll look into any of that because that's going to be a key component," Rubio said.

"We have to make sure Hamas is also doing their part in this regard. But, there are a lot of opportunities here for whoever wants to sabotage it to do so," he added.

Van Buren County is a rural redoubt in southwestern Michigan, a quiet corner of a swing state. Pillow soft sand dunes shift and shape along the shores of Lake Michigan. And the county seat – Paw Paw – is named after a quintessentially Midwestern fruit.

"It is a beautiful natural environment with gorgeous sand dunes that you don't see in other parts of the world," says Daywi Cook, whose family has lived in this area for five generations. "A lot of folks like to live here because of the solitude."

Covert Township's tranquility seems to belie its place as the vanguard to a potential nuclear transformation. The Van Buren County township has been home to the Palisades Nuclear Plant since 1971. The aging plant was decommissioned in 2022 but is being brought back into service through an over $1 billion loan secured under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, with the first installment provided by the federal government this year. In addition to reactivating the plant, the site is also expected to house the nation's first small modular reactors (SMRs).

Small modular reactors are factory-built nuclear power plants that are much smaller than traditional reactors (typically 300 megawatts or less). The SMRs are usually designed to be mass-produced and shipped to sites for faster, less costly installation.

The future of energy in the U.S. may be unfolding in this unassuming corner of Michigan where the Holtec Corporation is constructing two SMR-300 units which will be co-located with the existing 800-megawatt Palisades plant. The SMRs are planned to be operational by the early 2030s.

"There are still some unknowns but Holtec has been inviting us into the conversation," said Cook, who is the township supervisor. She says the area's familiarity with nuclear energy and the plant's safety record has gone a long way to assuage the county's residents.

Holtec did not respond to a request for comment.

Cook is hoping the recommissioned legacy plant and the SMRs will give the county some needed economic stability which is guided largely by seasonal swings.

"We are known as the Catskills of Chicago. There are a lot of short-term rentals that boom in the summer," Cook said, which she explained then sit empty in the winter. "It would be nice to have year-round stability," Cook added.

Zach Morris, executive director of Market One, a local association of business and government leaders that promotes economic growth in Cass and Van Buren Counties, Michigan, says that the area is uniquely positioned to be the leading edge of the nation's nuclear renaissance. Because of the existing plant, the nuclear knowledge is ready and in the workforce, and the area has ample power to make power.

Morris says the recommissioned legacy nuclear plant will employ 600 people, and the two SMRs will employ a combined 300 people with salaries averaging $107,000. "That is $32 million in payroll annually, resulting in significant money being spent in groceries, restaurants, and donations to non-profits," Morris said. And with the area's nuclear past, there's been little opposition to the arrival of SMRs, which he pointed out have been around for awhile, used in the military for years in submarines and aircraft carriers. "This is not a new technology, but there has not been a need for it until now," Morris said.

A Holtec SMR will provide enough power for 300,000 homes or a data center or two, a drop-in-the-bucket in the sating of demand.

"We have a national issue, it is a national crisis that we didn't anticipate five years ago," Morris said. "Five years ago nobody saw this coming. Their collective genius didn't anticipate this," he said of data centers coming online without enough power and people who don't want to give up their AI, streaming services, or cameras. "That means we have to adapt to the crisis. SMRs are the future," Morris said.

To illustrate how much the world of power generation has been upended in short order, Morris offers a stark comparison. "Five years ago we were worried about how we were going to put up with the demand from a 20 megawatt marijuana farm," he said, referring to a planned cannabis operation, and adding, "that is a fraction of what the data centers are asking for."

People are using AI for everything from identifying the animal tracks in their backyard to analyzing 10 years of sales data for corporate reports. And this torrent of requests for AI is leading to a torrent of demand for data centers to do the complex computing needed for instant answers. And the demand for data centers — constructed by tech titans Google, Amazon, and others — has led to a torrent of demand for electricity.

While the industry works on smaller, scalable nuclear solutions, big tech is taking decommissioned legacy plants out of mothballs. Constellation Energy plans to restart the 835-MW Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear generating station in Pennsylvania in 2028, with Microsoft agreeing to buy electricity from the reactivated power plant to power their data centers. And Google recently entered into an agreement with Kairos Power and the TVA for a new nuclear plant.

Bill Gates has been among the tech titans leading the charge, investing $1 billion in the technology and co-founding TerraPower, which is building a next generation nuclear plant in Wyoming. Gate's company also announced plans recently to explore building a nuclear facility in Kansas.

"Both fission and fusion are fundamental technologies for humanity to power everything we do. We're on the cusp of massive breakthroughs, and it's clearer now than even before: The future of energy is subatomic," Gates wrote in Power Magazine this week.

Oklo, which OpenAI's Sam Altman helped to take public before stepping back from his role as chairman in April, remains a highly speculative public stock market play on the nuclear potential, with no revenue or power purchase agreements, and is at least several years away from commercial operations. But its shares have boomed since its 2024 IPO.

Much of the industry excitement surrounds SMRs and their commercial deployment.

Everett Hansen, vice-president of energy and power for Marsh, a leading insurance broker that helps businesses manage risk and secure coverage, sees nuclear, whether it is an SMR or a legacy system, as a safe bet.

"Nuclear power plants are probably the best engineered," Hansen said, when comparing to other power sources. "Their design is incredibly thorough and detailed," he added.

Hansen says that part of the design process is exhaustive loss modeling and casualty analysis. Casualty in the industry parlance refers to an "incident," and in the analysis a casualty could be something minor to very severe.

Hansen says that when it comes to nuclear, people's reaction is to think of it on its worst day. Think Chernobyl, Fukushima or Three Mile Island. But nuclear has come a long way.

"They are very well-studied. There are not many things that could happen in a nuclear plant which are unknown or haven't been looked at," Hansen said. "The effective management of physical hazards, financial risks, strategy risks, all of that materially contributes to the commercial pathways being viable," Hansen said, describing himself as "optimistic" about the SMRs' viability.

There is the expense of deploying SMRs, but Hansen thinks that, too, will be overcome.

"The assets are very expensive to construct, and SMRs are trying to get at that problem by reducing product capex. But being the first of a kind nature, the risk is economic," Hansen said. Costs should come down over time after the first builds as developers act on plans to scale the business model.

"Collectively we will all be surprised a year or a few years from now with respect to what has changed. There will be a shift and things will happen," he added.

Still, opinions vary about how ready SMRs are for prime time.

Whit Johnson, a Salt Lake City-based partner at Foley & Lardner LLP, who counsels a portfolio of tech clients, agrees that the specter of nuclear disasters haunt to this day, but the industry has seen many changes since then.

"Nuclear power is not what it was nearly 40 years ago when the Chernobyl meltdown created fear for many about nuclear power. The technology has come a long, long way," Johnson said, comparing today's nuclear with dial-up internet vs. cloud computing. "Still, there remains in the public perception a lingering stigma about nuclear power, but it may be time to create an opportunity for society to rethink nuclear," Johnson said.

"While SMRs clearly offer potential, their viability remains largely based on projections, not operational evidence," said Gilbert Michaud, assistant professor of environmental policy at the School of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University Chicago, and Coordinator of the School's "Climate & Energy" Focus Area.

While Hansen said regulators in the U.S. are another reason to be confident in the nuclear revival, Michaud says the existing regulatory framework hasn't yet caught up with the planned deployment of SMRs. "The regulatory framework for nuclear is based on large reactors, and adapting rules for SMRs remains a work in progress," he said.

Before widespread deployment of SMRs, Michaud said more planning and preparation protocols are needed. "Deploying these in or near populated areas necessitates the need for better emergency preparedness and better public trust," he said, with fuel handling and storage, and mitigating cyber threats among issues that require better testing and better data.

That leads him to believe widespread deployment of SMRs will take longer than the most optimistic forecasts.

"I don't think that SMRs will be that common over the next 5-10 years. While there is obvious potential, there are still major regulatory, cost, timeline, and community acceptance challenges. Widespread commercial rollout may be slow," Michaud said.

Even by the 2030s, SMRs are likely to be pilot projects at industrial sites and not tucked away in a strip mall or subdivision, according to Michaud, with costs, financing challenges and maintaining an adequate supply chain among key obstacles.

"SMRs are newer and have seen major cost overruns and delays. Because they are unproven at scale, projects are likely to go over budget, and these dollars could have been invested in proven technologies like wind, solar, and storage. This provides risk to energy developers, utilities, and even ratepayers," Michaud says.

An SMR planned in Idaho last year was cancelled due to multiple factors, including cost overruns.

The Palisades plant in Michigan, meanwhile, needs major repairs to restart safely, according to regulatory filing made by Holtec.

But public opinion is shifting. A Pew poll from last August found a majority of Americans (56%) in support of more nuclear power for electricity generation. That was unchanged year over year, and Pew noted that Americans remain more likely to favor expanding solar power and wind power. But the public support for nuclear has increased from 43% a decade ago, while overall support for solar and wind power has declined by double digits in recent years, according to Pew, as more Republicans voice support for nuclear power.

In Covert Township, Cook says the future is nuclear, and the focus for now is primarily on getting the legacy plant back up and running and then she thinks people will pay more attention to the SMRs.

"With SMRs you will get more skepticism because it is newer technology and there will be questions," Cook said.

A lot of parents struggle with the idea of giving their kids access to smartphones or other connected devices. How old should they be when they get their first phone or tablet? What parental controls, if any, should you use?

No matter what you decide, you need to follow one "imperative" rule to help your kids grow up to be happy, successful adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge: "No electronic devices in the bedroom overnight."

"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, "10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World," published on September 2.

Twenge has spent much of the past decade warning parents about the risks of giving young adolescents unlimited access to smartphones and social media. She's cited research connecting their usage to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, including anxiety and depression.

Some other parenting and medical experts have issued similar warnings: In 2023, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory warning that the risks of social media and connected devices have helped create "a national youth mental health crisis," for example.

In her book, Twenge advocates for parents to wait as long as possible before handing over smartphones to their kids, or allowing them on social media platforms. She recommends keeping kids from joining social media until they're 16 or older, and from having full access to their own smartphone until they have a driver's license and are expected to "get around independently."

But banning devices from kids' rooms overnight is her No. 1 rule because of its potential to improve their sleep habits, she says. Doing so is "absolutely crucial for both physical and mental health," she notes in her book.

"If you have the bandwidth to fully follow only one rule in this book, make it this one," writes Twenge. "No devices in the bedroom overnight is very straightforward and costs nothing."

Devices in bedrooms can easily cut into sleeping time, whether your teen puts off shutting their eyes to continue scrolling through social media or the sounds of notifications keep waking them up, research shows.

More than two-thirds of adolescents surveyed by Common Sense Media in 2023 reported missing out on sleep "sometimes" or "often" due to using phones or other devices late at night in their bedrooms. Overall, 77% of teens get an insufficient amount of sleep, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed," Twenge writes in her book.

Looking at screens in bed is connected to higher rates of mental and physical health issues for adults, too. But healthy sleeping habits are even more important for kids, because their brains are still developing. Sleep can help enable their cognitive development and mental health, including their ability to learn and regulate their emotions — traits they'll need to develop to grow up and become happy, healthy and successful adults.

"If you can only do one thing, [this rule] might end up making the biggest difference," says Twenge.

Any of Twenge's rules will likely be met with resistance from kids, especially teenagers who already regularly use their smartphones and other devices at all times of day, she says. You can more easily implement and enforce these types of policies by communicating them to your kids at an early age, she advises.

Twenge recommends having conversations about the dangers of smartphones — and the need for strict rules around their use — as soon as elementary school. "Kids are getting these devices younger and younger" and your child might have friends who are already using connected devices at that age, she says.

Parents of older kids can also backtrack and put new, stricter rules in place. That's what Twenge did with her own three teenage daughters, after initially allowing them to use their laptops overnight, she says. Retroactively establishing strict rules isn't easy, she adds: "The first few days might be tough, and you might get some slammed doors."

Her advice is to be transparent, but firm, about your decision process. "You should be honest with your kid [and say], 'Look, I made a mistake. I now know more, I've learned more, and we're going to do it differently going forward,'" says Twenge.

Fears about the impact of a government shutdown, a slowing labor market, and elevated stock valuations are weighing on investor sentiment. Given the ongoing uncertainty, investors looking for stable returns can consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios.

Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help investors pick stocks of dividend-paying companies that have strong fundamentals to support consistent dividend payments.  

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's dividend list is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP), a global infrastructure company that owns and operates diversified, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, midstream, and data sectors. BIP paid a dividend of 43 cents per unit on Sept. 29, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $1.72 per unit, BIP stock offers a dividend yield of 5.2%.

Following the recently held Investor Day event, BMO Capital analyst Devin Dodge reiterated a buy rating on Brookfield Infrastructure stock with a price forecast of $42. The 5-star analyst stated that the presentations by management at the event reflected the robust underlying organic growth trends across BIP's portfolio, which he expects to become more evident in the upcoming quarters.

Dodge highlighted that the number of high-growth platforms in BIP's portfolio continues to increase, and there are significant investment opportunities across most of its sectors. In particular, he mentioned the robust digital infrastructure investment opportunity. With hyperscalers' capital spending estimated to increase by 50% this year, there is a strong growth potential for BIP's data center platforms over the intermediate term.

The analyst pointed out that BIP's funds from operations per unit (FFO/unit) growth is nearing an inflection point. He noted that over the past five years, BIP's FFO/unit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% despite foreign exchange headwinds and high interest rates. However, Dodge expects these challenges to ease in the near term, which could drive visible FFO growth.  

"As FFO/unit growth shifts higher, we believe there are positive implications for distribution growth and valuation," said Dodge. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on BIP stock with a price target of $33.

Dodge ranks No. 377 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 73% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.2%. See Brookfield Infrastructure Statistics on TipRanks.

We move to Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. Ares pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share. At an annualized dividend of $1.92 per share, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.4%.

In an update on business development companies, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on Ares Capital stock with a price target of $24. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on ARCC stock with a price target of $25.

In the current scenario, Lee prefers ARCC, Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL), and Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) stocks. "ARCC has a long track record of successfully managing risks through cycles," noted Lee.

The 5-star analyst specified that ARCC is a market-leading BDC with scale. He believes that the company's access to the Ares global credit platform is one of its major competitive advantages. Lee is confident about Ares Capital's potential to generate above peer-average return on equity.

Lee views Ares Capital's experienced senior management team as one of its key strengths. He also pointed out that ARCC's dividends are backed by the company's core earnings per share generation and potential net realized gains.

Lee ranks No. 59 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 72% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.7%. See Ares Capital Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at ONE Gas (OGS), a 100% regulated natural gas utility that provides affordable energy to over 2.3 million customers in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. At a quarterly dividend of 67 cents per share (annualized dividend of $2.68 per share), OGS stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.

Recently, Mizuho analyst Gabe Moreen upgraded OGS stock to buy from hold and increased his price forecast to $86 from $77, citing several reasons, such as the benefits from the Texas HB 4384 legislation (enables recovery of certain costs associated with a gas utility's plant, facilities, or equipment placed in service) and lower interest rates. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on OGS stock with a price target of $81.

Moreen sees the possibility of HB 4384 generating a full-year benefit of about 18 cents in incremental EPS in fiscal 2026. He added that this benefit is not one-time in nature, and will grow with ONE Gas' yearly Texas capital spending. It is worth noting that Texas constitutes about 32% of OGS' rate base. "We believe this will place a floor under OGS' growth outlook at the higher-end of its 4-6%," said Moreen.

The top-rated analyst noted that elevated short-term interest rates were one of the reasons that forced OGS to revise its guidance in 2023 and 2024. He expects the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts to benefit the company, as they will ease relative interest expense from prior periods.

Additionally, Moreen highlighted notable growth opportunities for OGS, thanks to the growing natural gas demand from data centers and advanced manufacturers. He believes that all these catalysts, along with a growing customer base and a solid balance sheet, make OGS stock an attractive pick at the current valuation. In fact, Moreen expects OGS to rebound to its historical premium valuation levels, at which the stock traded before the company restated its guidance in 2023 and 2024.

Moreen ranks No. 142 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.3%. See ONE Gas Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

It may have been the quietest attraction of the day.

On a clear Saturday afternoon, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, two California-based companies focused on making electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, or eVTOLs — pronounced ee-vee-tols — demonstrated their aircraft in front of a public crowd for the first time at the California International Airshow in Monterey County.

The 10-minute demos came and went with nothing more than a pither. Only the sound of a slight hum and the crowd chatter could be heard during both flights.

"This is the future," an announcer said over the mic. "Try to listen to it. It will be a challenge."

That's one of the main selling points for Joby and Archer.

The companies are envisioning a ride-share-like service in dense urban regions — except they're relying on a zero-emissions, all-electric aircraft to transport passengers. Enter the flying taxis.

To achieve public acceptance of a fleet of small aircraft constantly hovering over people's heads, noise — along with safety — is among the top priorities.

"It almost sounds like a whoosh," Didier Papadopoulos, Joby's president of aircraft OEM, told Business Insider at the airshow. "And that allows it to blend in with the cities and the noise."

Public opinion is only part of the hurdle. EVTOLs are a capital-intensive and highly regulated space. Companies undergo numerous tests and, in the US, must obtain several certifications to demonstrate airworthiness to the Federal Aviation Administration.

Joby, which was founded in 2009, has said that it aims to take its first passengers by 2026 in Dubai.

Archer, a seven-year-old company, announced in May that it would partner with the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics to transport VIPs and fans between key venues for the games, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and other visitor hubs such as the Los Angeles International Airport.

An Archer Aviation representative could not be reached for comment during the weekend.

Joby's aircraft features six tilting propellers that can rotate mid-flight, enabling the vehicle to seamlessly transition from vertical takeoff to forward flight. It also allows the aircraft to hover in place.

During the 10-minute showcase, Joby demonstrated a 540-degree spin as it hovered in a single position.

The combination of shorter blades and an electric propulsion system makes the Joby aircraft quieter, according to Papadopoulos.

"Because of the electric propulsion, you don't actually have to spin the motor as fast to get the torque that you need," he said.

The cockpit of Joby's eVTOL was designed to be simple, Papadopoulos told BI. The simplicity is intended to make flying Joby feel intuitive.

"This is one of the most advanced fly-by-wire flight control systems that you would see. It was really built on decades of research by NASA, Air Force, and so on," the executive said. "We see it when we bring in people who do not have aviation experience. It takes them about 20 minutes in the simulator of flying, and they are like totally natural."

Archer's "Midnight" eVTOL demonstrated a conventional, non-vertical take-off, starting on a runway before taking flight during the 10-minute demonstration at the airshow.

Unlike the Joby, the Midnight has 12 propellers — six tilt propellers and six fixed propellers — that provide the aircraft with vertical and forward flight capabilities.

A mock display of the Midnight was not available at the airshow.

Archer Aviation envisions cutting down travel time, such as commutes between Newark Liberty International Airport and downtown Manhattan — a corridor currently served by noisier helicopters — to under 10 minutes.

Papadopoulos, the Joby executive, told BI that the company's eVTOL has demonstrated a 150-mile range, but the purpose is more optimized for short, critical, and high-density missions that are often 20 to 30 miles long.

"Last week, I was in Japan at the Osaka World Expo," he said. "It took me an hour and a half to go from the airport to the expo. It would've taken eight minutes exactly if I took this aircraft."

Oops, something went wrong

US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reignited investor enthusiasm, pulling in more than $4.5 billion in net inflows last week. 

The strong reversal ended a brief period of outflows and set the tone for October — a month traders often call “Uptober” for its history of bullish crypto performance.

Data from SoSo Value shows Bitcoin ETFs brought in roughly $3.2 billion in net inflows, marking their second-largest weekly total on record, just behind November 2024's $3.37 billion peak.

During the trading period, ETF volumes surged to about $26 billion. The sharp increase signaled stronger investor participation and renewed confidence that an accumulation phase may be underway.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated inflows with $1.78 billion, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $692 million. Ark 21Shares added $254 million, while Bitwise captured another $212 million.

The collective surge reflects growing institutional conviction and renewed retail interest in gaining Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products.

Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs mirrored this momentum, attracting $1.29 billion in inflows and generating nearly $10 billion in weekly trading volume.

BlackRock's ETHA fund led with $687 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's $305 million. Grayscale recorded $175 million, while Bitwise added $83 million.

Together, these figures indicate that investors are positioning for a broader market recovery rather than focusing on a single asset.

The synchronized inflows across both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs made last week one of the busiest trading periods in recent memory.

This pattern suggests institutional portfolios are rotating back into digital assets, seeking to capture early upside potential as macro sentiment stabilizes.

That renewed optimism helped propel Bitcoin to a fresh all-time high above $125,000. It reinforced the belief that ETF-driven demand is doing more than fueling short-term speculation and may be establishing a base for a new market cycle.

Crypto research firm 10x Research noted that the scale of these inflows is unprecedented. It added that subtle shifts in institutional allocation strategies point to deeper structural support than in previous rallies.

"Behind the scenes, billions of dollars in ETF inflows and a quiet shift in institutional behavior suggest that this breakout may have deeper roots. Even regulators are adding fuel to the fire, with new tax guidance that caught corporate treasuries off guard," it added.

Best altcoins to buy is the phrase echoing across the market as October trading lights up like a festival. Charts are flashing green, liquidity is flowing, and participants are scanning for the projects that can carry portfolios into Q4 2025 with strength. Bitcoin is steadying sentiment, Ethereum is pressing against key resistance, and Solana is proving speed is still a narrative that pays. Cardano and Ripple are quietly securing inflows, but the real chatter is around emerging projects with unique mechanics. That spotlight is now pointing at MoonBull ($MOBU), the meme-born token turning conviction into a full-scale ecosystem.

MoonBull isn't here just to entertain—it's built with structure and sustainability. Running on Ethereum, it combines humor with serious tokenomics like auto-liquidity, burns, reflections, and a staggering 95% APY staking system. While Solana and Cardano continue pushing their chains' performance, $MOBU is making presale rounds with undeniable traction, stacking community support and locking in long-term relevance. Its 23 scarcity-driven presale stages are already pulling in participants who see it as more than hype. This balance of branding and mechanics is why MoonBull is quickly climbing into the conversation as one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4 closes.

MoonBull ($MOBU) is a meme coin, but not the kind that flames out after a week of hype. It is structured to make every trade count. Tokenomics drive value back into the ecosystem through liquidity injections, holder rewards, and regular burns. Each sell pumps liquidity, rewards participants, and reduces supply. That cycle fuels growth instead of draining momentum. By design, MoonBull is making scarcity part of its identity. This is what positions $MOBU as one of the best altcoins to buy in October 2025. Scarcity fuels value, and $MOBU is running that play smartly.

The presale rollout is ambitious, spanning 23 stages that steadily increase scarcity and reward conviction. Features like 95% APY staking, referral bonuses, and decentralized governance ensure the community isn't just holding tokens but actively shaping the project's future. With locked liquidity and a full audit backing it, MoonBull's foundation looks strong. Early adopters don't just get access, they get protection. For anyone debating the best crypto to buy now, MoonBull offers something clear: it merges meme culture with real mechanics that reward holders while stabilizing long-term growth. That's a rare combination in October's market lineup.



For those seeking the best altcoins to buy, Moonbull presale delivers clear numbers. Stage 4 tokens are priced at $0.00005168, with ROI projections stretching to 11,800% at the $0.00616 listing price. Over $200K has been raised, and more than 700 holders are already backing the project. A $5,000 entry today secures 96.7 million tokens, worth $595,975 when listing hits. With another 27.40% surge on the horizon, Moonbull is quickly proving itself to be one of the strongest altcoin entries of 2025.

Solana continues to be a name on everyone's lips in October 2025, and for good reason. Known for lightning-fast transactions and low fees, the chain has put downtime concerns behind it. Its October resurgence comes with record transaction volumes, showing that demand is strong and adoption is spreading. NFT marketplaces and gaming projects are flowing onto Solana like traffic on a busy highway. In a month full of contenders, Solana's high-performance edge ensures it is not just surviving but thriving. That momentum makes it a natural pick for Q4's best altcoins to buy list.

Beyond speed, Solana's ecosystem expansion is adding layers of confidence. Developers continue building decentralized finance platforms, gaming environments, and NFT ecosystems on its chain. This growth brings liquidity and community backing, fueling the market's faith in Solana as a top player. While others rely on narratives, Solana delivers real utility with proven adoption. Its ability to handle massive activity while keeping fees negligible makes it an appealing buy in October. With October shaping up to be competitive, Solana's combination of scalability and resilience positions it as one of Q4's top names worth serious attention.

BullZilla is pulling eyeballs this October with meme-fueled branding that's impossible to ignore. But it's not just loud visuals or community jokes making noise. BullZilla is carving its place as the top meme coin to buy now, balancing meme energy with stronger fundamentals than most in the category. Meme coins usually flame out fast, but BullZilla has avoided the dustbin by giving communities a token they actually want to hold. Early adopters aren't just buying memes; they are supporting a growing network of participants driving liquidity into the system. That's what makes BullZilla stand tall.

October's rallying cry for BullZilla is simple: it's not just a seasonal meme, it's aiming to be a mainstay. Its growing governance structure and clear community engagement strategy show this project wants longevity. Memes pull people in, but functional mechanics and tokenomics keep them around. By October, it is clear BullZilla is locking down loyalty while continuing to expand reach. The mix of humor and conviction makes this project a genuine outlier. For traders looking to balance meme culture with durability, BullZilla is proving itself as one of October's most attention-grabbing opportunities.

La Culex has stepped into the spotlight with a unique flair that captures what meme coin culture is all about. Its rise is fueled by strong community conversations, playful branding, and a sense of shared identity that keeps participants engaged. In a market where visibility and excitement are everything, La Culex is quickly proving why many are calling it a top meme coin worth keeping an eye on this year.

The momentum behind La Culex doesn't just come from hype alone—it comes from consistent participation and a narrative that resonates with its supporters. By keeping engagement alive and delivering a token that feels fresh, the project is securing its place among the most-discussed meme coins of 2025. With growing recognition and energy, La Culex is making its mark as a top meme coin that could hold strong appeal in the months ahead.



Cardano has always prided itself on a methodical approach, and that strategy is paying dividends in October 2025. Its DeFi ecosystem is finally hitting critical momentum, with smart contracts showing increased adoption. Cardano's steady, academic foundation has been mocked for being too slow in the past, but the October data paints a different picture. DeFi traction and interoperability growth are showing Cardano's strategy is gaining substance. Its ability to deliver low fees, high security, and reliable scalability is why Cardano remains a pillar project. It stands out in October as one of the best altcoins to buy.

The October spotlight is also shining on Cardano's push toward interoperability. Projects are leveraging Cardano's security-first model to deploy dApps that benefit from reliable performance. Developers value its stability, and communities are embracing it as a safe hub for innovation. While some altcoins chase fast, flashy growth, Cardano's consistent, deliberate rise proves reliability matters in crypto. Its Q4 momentum reflects years of careful building and refinement. That balance of security, scalability, and adoption ensures Cardano's place in October's conversation, making it a pick with both immediate and long-term appeal for participants in the market.

October 2025 has been a stage where altcoins prove their staying power, and the picks here tell the story. MoonBull ($MOBU) combines meme culture with serious mechanics, offering scarcity, staking, governance, and liquidity protections that set it apart. Solana has reclaimed its high-performance crown with expanding adoption. BullZilla has proven itself as the best meme coin contender, while Cardano delivers on reliability and security. Together, they highlight the best altcoins to buy in Q4 2025. MoonBull's unique presale features and launch protections solidify its position as not only a standout but also the best crypto to buy now.

MoonBull is the coin participants will look back on as their second chance for breakout-level gains. Its staking program, referral system, and governance rollout ensure the project is shaping up to be more than hype. Solana offers speed and scalability, BullZilla proves memes can mean business, and Cardano shows the value of steady growth. These names represent different strengths, but MoonBull dominates October's spotlight. Its community-first model and launch mechanics fuel conviction. That's why the MoonBull presale is drawing attention across Q4. Missing it could turn into one of 2025's biggest regrets.



The standout picks are MoonBull, Solana, BullZilla, and Cardano, each showing strength in Q4's market momentum.

Yes, the MoonBull presale is open in October 2025, running through its 23 scarcity-driven stages with strong community demand.

Cardano's DeFi traction and reliable scalability are proving it to be a secure, long-term project worth holding.

MoonBull is leading discussions, and its structured presale suggests it could be one of the breakout tokens this year.

Participants are focusing on MoonBull for utility-driven tokenomics and BullZilla for meme-powered traction.

SWIFT, the backbone of the global financial messaging system, is taking a step toward becoming a full-fledged blockchain infrastructure provider.

This week, the network unveiled plans to build a shared ledger platform that will let banks settle transactions involving stablecoins and tokenized assets across multiple blockchains.

While SWIFT has long served as the messaging layer for cross-border money movement, the new platform would put it closer to the center of value transfer.

That's a major shift for a more than 50-year-old traditional financial organization known for handling communications between more than 11,500 banks, not for moving money itself.

"The big development is SWIFT's changing business model to cope with blockchain disintermediation," said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. “SWIFT, today, does not transfer value; it sends messages. Onchain, the message and the transfer are the same thing.

Acheson argued the new platform could act as a "switching" layer for digital currencies and tokenized assets, bridging otherwise siloed systems. However, she questioned whether SWIFT is still essential in a world of programmable money.

"Is SWIFT necessary in a tokenized financial system? No, it's not—but it does have connections with virtually all global banks," she said.

Those connections could give SWIFT an edge as banks look for a path into the blockchain economy.

"The industry is moving at a rapid pace, and stablecoins are being adopted globally at such a speed that traditional banks are having to take notice,” said Barry O'Sullivan, director of banking and payments at OpenPayd.

SWIFT said over 30 financial institutions are already engaged with the project. O'Sullivan expects more to follow as demand and regulatory clarity increase. "Adoption, interoperability and regulatory alignment will take time," he said. "However, SWIFT is clearly positioning itself to play a meaningful role in shaping the evolving stablecoin and tokenised asset ecosystem."

SWIFT's platform could also "materially lower" technical barriers and integration costs for financial institutions that want to embed stablecoins into their operations, said David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase.

O'Sullivan noted that the platform could bring "some standardization to the global stablecoin ecosystem," though fragmentation will likely persist. "Existing private stablecoins, CBDCs and regional solutions may continue to operate in parallel,” he said.

Duong described SWIFT's initiative as a "watershed moment" for both crypto and traditional finance, but reminded that it has been years in the making. The company has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology since 2017, Duong said, including conducting pilot projects with Chainlink, tokenized securities platforms Clearstream and SETL and interoperability tests with CBDCs. Developing its own shared ledger platform appears to be the next stage in that long-running transition, Duong said.

Still, not everyone may see SWIFT as a neutral player. Its role in enforcing sanctions has led to distrust in countries where banks were cut off from the network, Acheson said.

"It's not clear that its offering would stop the payment systems fragmentation, given global distrust following SWIFT's role in enforcing U.S. and EU sanctions,” she argued.

Even so, SWIFT's decision underscores that the lines between traditional and blockchain finance are increasingly getting intertwined and the world's largest financial institutions are – slowly, then suddenly – taking initiative to stay relevant.

Technology mogul Jack Dorsey has long championed decentralized technologies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), suggesting their application in areas like artificial intelligence and social media.

Speaking at the Africa Bitcoin Conference in December 2024, Dorsey expressed concerns about the growing power and influence of social media platforms, stating that users are unknowingly working for these companies “for free” every time they interact with posts.

“Every time you hit the heart, every time you like a post, every time you retweet something, that's a signal to an algorithm which then takes that in a bunch of other variables and uses that as a way to push into someone else's feed,” Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, now X, said. “That company has successfully made you an employee without paying you a thing.”

Dorsey said the same was happening in the field of artificial intelligence, where the collective intelligence of the people is locked up within five big companies, which then decide how one interacts with systems.

“We need to own that protocol layer,” Dorsey, the CEO of Bitcoin-focused company Block Inc. (NYSE:XYZ), said. “I should not have to ask Google whether to build a feature, nor should I be Reliant upon Google's algorithm to tell me what I should pay attention to.”

He warned that people act as the “product” for these centralized models and “will be replaced” and rendered irrelevant whenever the companies desire.

In the same breath, Dorsey hailed Bitcoin's rise as a permissionless technology, predicting that it would grow even stronger in the future.

Bitcoin's origins may have been rooted in decentralization, but its rapid adoption by Wall Street in the form of exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrency treasury companies, such as Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), could be steering it toward heavier influence from major institutions.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $2.97, up 3.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Block shares were down 0.14% in after-hours trading after closing 4.65% higher at $76.81 during Thursday's regular trading session.

The stock exhibited a very high growth score — a measure of the stock's combined historical expansion in earnings and revenue across multiple periods. How does it compare with Strategy and other cryptocurrency-linked stocks? Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to find out.

Key Takeaways

Ancient Egypt's proliferation of board games has persisted across over 5,000 years of human evolution. Despite the ability to transport ourselves to a fully-realized virtual world, through VR headsets, a good old physical gaming session, be it a card-based tournament or a game of chess, remains a timeless ritual.

But the physical board and cardboard tokens are no longer the only canvas for these classics. The 2010s introduced fully digitized, mobile, and PC versions of Monopoly, Catan, and countless others. 

Now, the next evolution of digital board games can be witnessed through Web3 and blockchain experiments.

Let's dive deeper.

The transition from physical boards to digital versions is hardly new. For decades, developers have ported chess, Scrabble, and Risk into video games and apps. But what's changing now is more than the porting, it's a reimagining of the gameplay itself. 

A prime example is Monopoly Go!, launched as a mobile app in 2023 by Scopely. While this version keeps the Monopoly branding, it transforms the mechanics into a casual, event-powered loop designed for mobile engagement. Players move solo around the board, unlock themed mini-events, and progress through monetized systems rather than the hours-long head-to-head sessions you might think of. The result? Over $5 billion in revenue  across two years.

Hasbro will also be modernizing the original board game itself. A version of the game called Monopoly App Banking removes the need for a human banker, converting the position to an app  to mitigate cheating and accelerate play.

Other games have followed suit.  

Scythe: Digital Edition streamlines  a popular but complex board game, automating the game's resource management so you can focus on the play. Carcassonne – Tiles & Tactics  digitizes the tile-laying classic, offering online multiplayer and expansions at the tap of a button.

The key shift here is convenience and scale. Digital adaptations speed up play, reduce arguments, and allow asynchronous matches to take place across the world. They also unlock live events, dynamic boards, and analytics, or streamlining that physical boards could never provide.

Between fully physical and fully digital lies a hybrid approach. These are physical board games enhanced with apps, sensors, or digital overlays, keeping the tactile joy of tokens while adding computational power.

An experimental example is DungeonMaker , a hybrid board game (HBG) that projects board layouts onto an actual surface, tracks physical tokens, and even uses fabrication to damage or modify game pieces as needed.

Commercially, devices like the Infinity Game Table  by Arcade1Up are taking off. It's a touchscreen coffee table loaded with digital board games like Monopoly or Scrabble, hence the infinity moniker. The product includes Wi-Fi for online play, zoomable boards, and even haptic feedback.



These hybrid approaches help solve the problem of “bookkeeping drag,” or the downtime during times of management, such as when the Monopoly banker has to count and hand out money. Companion apps now automate dice rolls, spawn enemies, and can even track inventory. No more dealing with manual trading in Catan.

This convergence suggests a near-future where board gaming is neither purely physical nor purely digital, per se, but a seamless blend of both.

Now, the boldest experiments are happening on Web3 technology, where mechanics collide with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), token economies, and smart contracts. In these systems, property cards, dice rolls, or even the board itself can be tokenized, and tokenization means players can trade or even monetize their holdings.

Why do these games use the blockchain? Largely to provide ownership and profit potential:

It's also important to note a player's familiarity with these classic games. It's much easier to learn a new technology through the lens of something you're used to, such as a tokenized chess piece or Monopoly property.  

While blockchain adds new layers and profit potential, it also introduces tension:

Board games have endured for millennia because they strike a balance between strategy, luck, and social connection. Now, they're entering new territory. From billion-dollar mobile apps like Monopoly Go! to hybrid game tables and blockchain-based experiences, these classics are pushing their previous boundaries.

But with every innovation comes trade-offs. Digital versions sacrifice some of the tactile joy of playing a physical game while eliminating the in-person benefits of competing with your friends locally. Blockchain projects promise ownership and interoperability, but they flirt with speculation and volatility.

If the Web3 industry finds the right balance, preserving fun while layering in technology, classics like Monopoly could thrive in formats our ancestors never imagined. If not, they risk becoming cautionary tales of over-monetization.

Board games have survived for over 5,000 years because they connect people through play. Now, as they cross into mobile apps, hybrid tables, and blockchain platforms, they stand at a crossroads.

If developers can balance tradition with innovation, preserving fun while unlocking digital scale, classics like Monopoly and Chess could thrive in entirely new forms. If not, they risk losing the timeless magic that made them endure in the first place.






Could blockchain board games face gambling regulations?


Yes. If players stake crypto or trade NFTs with real value, regulators may categorize the games as online gambling, which can bring strict licensing requirements.




What role might AI play in the evolution of board games?


AI could act as an adaptive opponent, referee, or even a dungeon master, providing storylines and challenges that evolve dynamically.




Are physical board games at risk of becoming obsolete?


Unlikely. Physical play taps into nostalgia, tactility, and face-to-face interaction, which digital formats can't fully replace. Both formats are sure to coexist.




Could blockchain make board games interoperable?


In theory, yes. A Monopoly property NFT could one day be usable in another blockchain-based game. In practice, interoperability is rare and requires industry-wide standards.

October 5, 2025 – The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with fervent optimism as the long-anticipated "Altcoin Season" appears to be in full swing. With Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrating remarkable stability above $116,000 and Ethereum (ETH) firmly holding the $4,300-$4,500 range, capital is noticeably rotating into the broader altcoin market. This shift, highlighted by a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance below 59% and a 40-50% surge in Google searches for "altcoins" in late September, signals a renewed investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward digital assets. The current market dynamics are setting the stage for potentially explosive rallies across various altcoins, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory towards an ambitious $150,000 valuation.

The current environment is critical for the crypto ecosystem, as a robust altcoin market often signifies broader adoption and diversification beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. This period is characterized by both established altcoins like Avalanche and Litecoin making significant developmental strides and newer protocols like PayDax Protocol entering the scene with ambitious offerings. Conversely, projects like Pi Coin are navigating complex technical and community challenges, underscoring the diverse and often volatile nature of the altcoin landscape. The collective performance and individual narratives of these altcoins will be crucial in determining the market's direction through the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged past $4.21 trillion as of October 2025, with October, or "Uptober," living up to its historical reputation by promising an average return of 21%. While Bitcoin's near-ATH surge to $124,000 on October 4th provided a strong foundation, the decreasing Bitcoin dominance is the clearest indicator of capital flowing into altcoins. Major altcoins historically maintain a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, typically in the 0.7-0.9 range. Should Bitcoin indeed climb towards the predicted $150,000 mark, this correlation suggests a cascading rally across the altcoin sector, with many poised for significant percentage gains.

Avalanche (AVAX) is experiencing a period of intense institutional interest and surging developer activity. Its smart contracts have tripled year-over-year to over 44 million, coinciding with a record-breaking $2.2 billion in DEX volume over three days in early October. The Total Value Locked (TVL) on Avalanche doubled to $2.1 billion since April 2025, fueled by the Octane upgrade, VanEck's $100 million ecosystem fund, and growing gaming adoption. Notably, AgriFORCE (NASDAQ: AGRI) rebranded to AVAX One in late September, planning to raise $550 million to accumulate and stake AVAX. Furthermore, Avalanche Treasury Co. announced a definitive business combination agreement with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: MLAC) valued at over $675 million, aiming to create a public and integrated financial ecosystem for AVAX and acquire $1 billion in AVAX. The expectation of SEC approval for several AVAX ETFs in October could further propel demand, setting AVAX up for substantial price appreciation.

Litecoin (LTC), often dubbed "digital silver," is navigating regulatory waters amidst a U.S. government shutdown, yet its price holds firm near $120. Despite the SEC missing its October 4th deadline for Canary Capital's spot Litecoin ETF due to bureaucratic gridlock, approval odds remain high (90% per Bloomberg) once the shutdown concludes. Litecoin broke out of an 8-year downtrend, surpassing $117 and trading near $120 as of October 4th, marking a 13% weekly gain. Analysts are targeting $135 as the next resistance, with some predicting a rally to $354, and potentially even $648 or $842.68, drawing parallels to its 2017 bull run. The anticipated approval of multiple Litecoin spot ETFs in October and the launch of a Litecoin Ecosystem Fund in Q4 2025 are significant catalysts for its price action.

PayDax Protocol (PAYDAX) is a relatively new entrant generating considerable buzz with its ongoing token presale, which analysts are touting as a "100x opportunity." The protocol aims to revolutionize decentralized finance by re-engineering lending, borrowing, and insurance on Ethereum. PayDax allows users to borrow stablecoins against various collateral, including Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, gold, or luxury watches, offering high loan-to-value ratios (up to 97%). The project's emphasis on transparency, with KYC-audited team members, smart contracts audited by Assure DeFi, and partnerships with Chainlink Oracles, Sotheby's, and Brinks, aims to instill confidence. Currently, its presale is live at $0.015, positioning it as a high-potential, albeit higher-risk, investment in the evolving DeFi landscape.

In contrast, Pi Coin (PI) is contending with significant technical hurdles and price struggles despite community momentum. While it officially transitioned to its "Open Network" phase in February 2025, allowing limited trading, the full Mainnet launch (Phase 4) is contingent on widespread KYC verification for 15 million users and substantial dApp expansion, which is anticipated in the second half of 2025. Over 12 million Pioneers have been verified, and the introduction of AI-driven "Fast Track KYC" on September 18th aims to accelerate this process. Despite over 150 dApps launching on the Pi Mainnet and a 2025 Hackathon Finale set for October 15th, Pi Coin crashed nearly 48% in September to a new all-time low of $0.184. As of October 2025, it trades around $0.26, down 24% in the past month, amidst a broader market rally. The rising number of Pi tokens on centralized exchanges (over 445 million) and an upcoming unlock of over 110 million tokens in October could exert further selling pressure. The Global GCV Movement's conference on October 19th, advocating for a symbolic valuation of $314,159 per PI, highlights community divisions and speculative fervor, but the token's immediate future remains uncertain.

The crypto community's sentiment surrounding the current altcoin market is overwhelmingly bullish, largely fueled by the anticipation of Bitcoin's continued ascent. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit are buzzing with "Altcoin Season" narratives, with influencers and thought leaders actively promoting various projects and discussing potential catalysts. The decreasing Bitcoin dominance is seen as a healthy sign of market maturity, indicating that investors are diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond the top two cryptocurrencies.

For Avalanche, the community response is highly positive, driven by the significant institutional investments and strategic partnerships. The rebranding of AgriFORCE to AVAX One and the business combination with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. have generated considerable excitement, viewed as strong validation of Avalanche's ecosystem. The anticipation of SEC-approved AVAX ETFs in October is a hot topic, with many believing it will unlock massive institutional demand and significantly boost AVAX's price. Developers and users are also celebrating the network's record-breaking DEX volume and the continued growth of its smart contract activity, reinforcing confidence in its technological advancements.

Litecoin's community remains resilient despite the ETF limbo. The high probability of eventual ETF approval, coupled with its breakout from a multi-year downtrend, has reignited enthusiasm. Discussions often revolve around Litecoin's historical significance and its potential to mirror past bull runs. Crypto influencers are highlighting LTC's strong fundamentals and its role as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. The proposed Litecoin Ecosystem Fund and LitVM Public Beta are also generating positive discussions, signaling continued development and expansion.

The PayDax Protocol presale is attracting significant attention, with early investors and crypto enthusiasts discussing its innovative approach to decentralized lending and borrowing. The promise of high APYs for lenders and stakers, combined with the ability to collateralize real-world assets, resonates strongly within the DeFi community. The transparency of its KYC-audited team and audited smart contracts is a key talking point, aiming to build trust in a space often plagued by rug pulls and unaudited projects.

In stark contrast, the Pi Coin community is experiencing a mix of anticipation and frustration. While "Pioneers" remain dedicated to the project's vision of widespread cryptocurrency adoption through mobile mining, the repeated delays in the full Mainnet launch and the token's significant price struggles have led to growing impatience. Discussions often oscillate between fervent belief in its future potential (e.g., the Global GCV Movement's $314,159 valuation advocacy) and concerns over its practical utility and market viability. The ongoing KYC verification process and the upcoming token unlocks are critical points of discussion, with some users expressing worry about potential selling pressure, while others remain optimistic about the project's long-term vision once all technical hurdles are cleared. The introduction of DeFi tools on the Testnet is seen as a positive step towards ecosystem development, but the community's overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, tinged with a desire for concrete progress.

The short-term outlook for the crypto market, particularly for altcoins, is largely dependent on Bitcoin's continued performance. If Bitcoin successfully breaches and sustains above the $125,000 mark and continues its march towards $150,000, a significant altcoin rally is highly probable. This scenario would likely trigger a further rotation of capital from BTC into ETH and then into smaller-cap altcoins, leading to substantial percentage gains across the board. The "Altcoin Season" index, currently at 67, suggests this trend is well underway. Key catalysts to watch include the successful conclusion of the U.S. government shutdown, which could pave the way for pending spot ETF approvals for assets like Litecoin and potentially Avalanche. The ongoing development and adoption of new DeFi protocols and Web3 applications, particularly those demonstrating real-world utility, will also drive investor interest.

In the long term, the implications for the crypto market are profound. The increasing institutional interest, evidenced by major companies like AgriFORCE (AVAX One) and Avalanche Treasury Co. making significant moves into the space, signals a maturing market. The potential approval of various spot ETFs for altcoins like Avalanche and Litecoin could unlock unprecedented levels of institutional capital, fundamentally altering market dynamics and liquidity. Strategic considerations for projects involve focusing on robust technology, clear regulatory compliance, and fostering strong community engagement. Investors should remain vigilant, diversifying portfolios while carefully assessing the risk-reward profiles of newer projects like PayDax Protocol and established ones like Avalanche and Litecoin.

Possible scenarios include a sustained bull run through Q4 2025, driven by Bitcoin's performance and increasing altcoin adoption, leading to new all-time highs for many assets. Alternatively, unforeseen macroeconomic headwinds or regulatory crackdowns could introduce volatility, causing temporary pullbacks. However, with the current momentum and the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, a significant market downturn seems less likely in the immediate future. The continued expansion of layer-2 solutions, advancements in scalability, and the integration of real-world assets into blockchain ecosystems will be crucial developments to monitor. For projects like Pi Coin, the successful completion of KYC for its vast user base and a full, functional Mainnet launch are critical for its long-term viability and market perception.

For crypto investors and enthusiasts, the current market dynamics present a compelling landscape of opportunity. The overarching takeaway is that "Altcoin Season" is here, driven by Bitcoin's strong performance and a broader market rotation. While the prospect of Bitcoin hitting $150,000 is a powerful psychological and financial catalyst, it's the individual narratives and fundamental developments of altcoins that will determine their long-term success.

Avalanche (AVAX) stands out with robust institutional backing, surging developer activity, and the strong potential for SEC-approved ETFs, making it a key asset to watch for significant upside. Litecoin (LTC), despite regulatory delays, shows strong technical breakout potential and high odds for ETF approvals, positioning it for a potential resurgence. PayDax Protocol (PAYDAX) represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity within the DeFi space, promising innovative lending solutions and attractive yields, but requiring thorough due diligence. Pi Coin (PI), while boasting a massive user base, faces critical challenges related to KYC completion, Mainnet launch, and price stability; its future hinges on successfully transitioning from a mining project to a fully functional blockchain ecosystem.

Key dates and metrics to monitor include the conclusion of the U.S. government shutdown, SEC decisions on various spot ETFs (especially for LTC and AVAX), Pi Network's KYC completion rates and Mainnet launch updates, and the ongoing performance of Bitcoin dominance. The long-term significance of this period lies in the increasing maturity and diversification of the crypto market, with institutional players taking a more active role and innovative protocols pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance. This period could mark a pivotal step towards broader crypto adoption, but investors must remain informed, strategic, and aware of the inherent volatility and risks associated with digital assets.

Ethereum (ETH) is no stranger to turbulence in the crypto waters, and right now, it finds itself amidst a fierce battle between whale maneuvers and institutional heft. As market sentiment shifts, discerning the factors steering these colossal players becomes essential for anyone hoping to navigate the choppy tides of cryptocurrency trading.

When we talk about the large holders of Ethereum, colloquially known as whales, their recent actions have sent ripples across the market. Between September 25 and September 27, 2025, an astounding 431,018 ETH, approximating a whopping $1.73 billion, was transferred from prominent exchanges like Kraken and Galaxy Digital into the cryptic embrace of 16 different wallets. Such transactions typically denote a robust holding strategy, signaling these whales are in for the long haul rather than a quick cash-out. This behavior cultivates a narrative of scarcity, potentially enticing a wave of new investors eager to grab a slice of the action.

Yet, amidst the optimistic maneuvers of whale accumulation looms a significant selling pressure that cannot be dismissed. A notable player, Trend Research, has offloaded over 102,000 ETH, raising eyebrows about market stability's fragility. Surprisingly, Ethereum's resilience remains impressive, with institutional buyers managing to uphold its price above the $4,590 mark, even as heavy sell-offs unfolded. The net inflow patterns suggest that savvy investors are counterbalancing the circulating supply, underscoring a complex market dynamic.

Diving deeper into the nuances of trading volume, Ethereum's recent price movements have shown a measured pace, hovering around $4,590 with a slight uptick in daily activity. However, a staggering drop of 41.63% in trading volume hints at a prevalent wait-and-see attitude among traders, suggesting trepidation in the air. The cryptocurrency is currently wrestling to establish a critical support level near the psychological threshold of $4,000 — a barrier that could determine its trajectory in the face of mounting downward pressures.

The unfolding drama between whale accumulation and relentless selling will undoubtedly shape Ethereum's prospects in the immediate future. Many institutional investors continue to harbor faith in Ethereum's long-term potential, a sentiment echoed by a notable boost in market capitalization, which now flirts with $547.6 billion. However, a stark contrast emerges among retail traders, whose cautious sentiment reveals a divided outlook that could influence broader market movements.

Looking ahead, Ethereum grapples with pivotal resistance points that could dictate its fate. The $3,700 support level appears tenuous; an infringement could incite a wave of forced liquidations exacerbating downward trends. Yet, the present lowest exchange reserves in nearly ten years showcase significant accumulation, reflecting a diminished supply that offers some cushioning against potential declines. Should market conditions stabilize, Ethereum might once again eye the coveted $4,673 mark, with aspirations of hitting the $4,800 level.

Further complicating these market dynamics is the Ethereum Foundation's recent announcement regarding the sale of 1,000 ETH, utilizing CowSwap's unique TWAP feature. This has reignited conversations about Ethereum's viability as a store of value. Analysts caution that this influx, amplified by staking rewards, could dilute ETH's value proposition significantly and slow down its long-term appreciation. As the interplay of institutional movements and whale behaviors unfolds, the market is caught in a delicate balancing act between buying pressures and liquidity needs.

In conclusion, the landscape surrounding Ethereum's trading is anything but simple; it demands a keen understanding of both institutional and retail dynamics. The significant tension between whale accumulation and systematic selling presents an engaging narrative that deserves attention. Investors would be wise to keep their fingers on the pulse of critical price points and the evolving movements within the Ethereum ecosystem. As the saga of Ethereum unfolds, adaptability will be crucial for those eager to seize the opportunities presented by this volatile market. The game is on, and knowledge is your best ally.

 Onchain dynamics point to a renewed accumulation phase that may see Bitcoin's price surpass $150,000 before the end of 2025, market analysts told Cointelegraph. 

Bitcoin breached a new all-time high over the weekend, prompting analysts to call for a renewed accumulation phase that could fuel a rally to $150,000 before the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new all-time high above $125,700, and its market capitalization briefly crossed the $2.5 trillion milestone for the first time in crypto history, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Sunday.

The rally was supported by multiple macroeconomic factors, including the recent US government shutdown — the first since 2018 — which some analysts say has renewed interest in Bitcoin's store-of-value role.

In the past, similar conditions have led to “major price milestones,” according to Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at digital asset banking group Sygnum Bank.

The US government shutdown has “renewed discussion around Bitcoin's store-of-value role, as political dysfunction underscores interest in decentralised assets,” Dori told Cointelegraph. “At the same time, the broader environment — characterised by loose liquidity conditions, a service-led acceleration in the business cycle, and narrowing underperformance relative to equities and gold — has drawn attention to digital assets,” he added.

However, the extent of the government shutdown's tailwind effect on the crypto market will ultimately depend on how it influences the US Federal Reserve's perspective on interest rate decisions, Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, told Cointelegraph.

“Crypto markets could benefit from a shutdown resolution if it reduces uncertainty and pushes the Fed toward a more dovish stance,” Kennis added.

While some analysts saw the government shutdown as a signal of a potential crypto market bottom, Kennis said it's “premature to call this a local market bottom,” as confirmation would require “multi-week stability above key support levels.”

Some analysts view Bitcoin's recent growth as a sign of a new accumulation phase by large entities, as onchain data suggests a decline in selling pressure from whales.

“Market data indicates the current price action may be linked to an accumulation phase,” said Sygnym Bank's Dori.

Periods of “cooling speculative activity and steadier positioning” have historically preceded significant Bitcoin rallies, he added.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's open interest “reset sharply” after last week's options expiry, which may “set the stage” for the fourth quarter, according to blockchain data platform Glassnode.

Slowing speculative activity may attract more attention to Bitcoin, reinforcing analyst predictions of a breakout to $150,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 if BTC can sustain its momentum above the key $120,000 psychological level, Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph at Token2049.

Ethereum's rally in Q4 2025 is not only strengthening investor confidence but also shining a spotlight on Remittix (RTX), a fast-rising PayFi altcoin that could surge from $0.11 to $4 this quarter.

As Ethereum's price moves up to $4,542.22, gaining 2.23% in the last 24 hours, the wider crypto market is being shaped by two forces: the reliability of legacy platforms like Ethereum and the disruptive potential of new projects like Remittix.

Such factors are raising Ethereum Price Prediction outlooks toward $5,000 and drawing focus to tokens that solve practical problems.



Ethereum holds its place as the driving force behind decentralized finance. With a market capitalization near $541.78 billion and daily trading volumes of $47.11 billion, ETH is far from being sidelined. Instead, it remains central to the market's confidence in blockchain's future.

The strength of Ethereum lies not just in its price but in its role powering decentralized apps and finance. This leadership is drawing attention to altcoins focused on real-world problems, from costly fees to slow payments and global money transfers.

With Ethereum's base secure, investors are eager for the next DeFi token with room to grow.



One such project is Remittix (RTX), a cross-chain PayFi solution focused on international payments. Currently priced at $0.1130 per token, Remittix has raised more than $27 million in its presale, selling over 674 million tokens. Analysts believe RTX could surge to $4 this quarter, positioning it as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025.

Ethereum's path toward $5,000 signals strong confidence in established blockchains, while Remittix showcases how innovation is shifting toward real-world payment solutions.

Together, they reflect a market trend where proven networks like Ethereum fuel trust and emerging projects like Remittix offer outsized growth potential. For investors, Q4 2025 could be pivotal, with Ethereum aiming higher and Remittix positioning itself as the next big PayFi success.

Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world's largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin BTC$123,195.05 holders themselves are barely engaging.

Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending.

The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector's promise and its actual reach. 

“There's an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement.

That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector's trust and complexity problem.

Perhaps most striking is how invisible the industry still is. GoMining found that 65% of Bitcoin holders couldn't name a single BTCFi project. 

Despite millions in venture funding, BTCFi platforms appear to be speaking mainly to themselves rather than the market they're built to serve.

The report argues that BTCFi's adoption problem may stem from its reliance on Ethereum's DeFi model. Bitcoin users, GoMining suggests, are more conservative: they favor custodial services, regulated ETFs and simplicity over self-custody experiments and complex protocols.

“Bitcoin holders aren't ether ETH$4,521.97 users,” Zalan said. “Coinbase and Bitcoin ETFs succeeded because they prioritized accessibility. BTCFi platforms that focus on education and user experience, rather than complex features, will capture this market."

For the industry, the survey is both a warning and an opportunity. Millions of Bitcoin holders want the yield and liquidity BTCFi promises, but they need to be met with products they can trust and understand.

However, it should be kept in mind that the survey respondents were a "random selection" of just 700 GoMining users.

GoMining is a digital BTC mining platform that connects users to real-world mining operations through Digital Miners non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a gamified ecosystem, so the survey's findings are subject to the extent to which its users represent typical bitcoin users.

"Our user base represents the bitcoin holders universe quite nicely," a GoMining spokesperson told CoinDesk over email. "More than 80% of our users open their first crypto wallet with us and enter the Bitcoin ecosystem through our digital mining product."

XRP's latest slip under $3 is a reminder that even old giants face limits.

On the other hand, BlockchainFX's explosive $8 million presale shows where the new energy lies.

Even though XRP remains a familiar name, its challenges underline the limits of established coins when it comes to sharp price moves. By comparison, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is coming in with a burst of energy, and its presale success shows clear demand.

Between its daily reward model, planned buybacks, and all-in-one trading app, $BFX has the ingredients to become one of the cycle's defining projects.

XRP has long been known as a token built for cross-border payments. It was designed to help banks and payment services move money quickly and cheaply across the world. Yet despite its strong use case, its price history has been uneven.

The token once touched all-time highs that fueled hopes of a breakout. But since then, it has often struggled to maintain momentum. Legal challenges, including the well-known case with the SEC, added extra uncertainty to the picture. Even now, with markets heating up again and the SEC case officially closed, XRP finds it hard to build a steady climb.

For investors, this presents a mixed picture. On the one hand, XRP is a trusted name with a clear use case. Its large market size makes big moves harder to achieve. When a coin is already well established, doubling or tripling in price requires huge inflows of capital. This is why some traders are starting to look elsewhere for stronger upside potential.

This is where BlockchainFX ($BFX) enters the conversation. Unlike many tokens that live only on speculation, $BFX is directly tied to a working trading platform.

The project is building a crypto super app, where users can trade not only digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, and CFDs. Everything happens inside one Web3 platform, which makes it simpler for traders to move between different asset classes.

What truly sets $BFX apart is its profit-sharing model. Half of all trading fees from the platform flow back to token holders. Rewards are paid daily in both BFX and USDT, creating a steady stream of income for those who stake their tokens.

$BFX is also offering unique benefits to early participants. They can qualify for limited-edition BFX Visa Cards, ranging from sleek metal versions to exclusive 18k gold cards. These cards work with both Apple Pay and Google Pay. For anyone looking to connect crypto with everyday spending, this is a clear step forward.

The EXTRA30 bonus code offers presale participants an additional 30% worth of $BFX tokens as a gratitude for their purchase. It has been designed as a limited-time reward for early supporters, ensuring they receive extra value while securing their position in the BlockchainFX presale.



The presale has been a success story on its own as funds raised have passed the $8.5 million mark. The token is currently priced at $0.026, with a planned listing at $0.05. That means early buyers could already see a 2x upside before the token even launches on major exchanges.

Beyond the numbers, the presale includes other rewards. Those who join early can pick up daily staking rewards, unlock trading credits, and even claim exclusive NFTs linked to founder tiers. These perks are limited to the presale, which makes acting early more appealing.

The tokenomics also show a clear plan. Half of the total supply has been set aside for the presale, ensuring wide community distribution. Additional allocations are reserved for liquidity, exchange listings, and development, with strict measures in place to support stability.

With buybacks and burns built into the system, the supply is expected to tighten over time, adding another layer of strength for holders.

The contrast between XRP and $BFX is easy to see. XRP has history, a strong brand, and real-world use cases. Yet its growth is often slow, and its size limits explosive upside.

BlockchainFX is a fresh project, built with a slim structure and plenty of rewards for those who get in early. The mix of a presale, daily staking payouts, and a platform that covers several markets makes it attractive to traders looking for real use and growth potential.

If adoption continues at the current pace, the daily rewards, buybacks, and burns could drive real momentum once the token lists. In a bull market where investors chase both excitement and returns, $BFX holds clear advantages.

Joining the BlockchainFX presale is simple. Participants first need a crypto wallet such as MetaMask, TrustWallet, or Coinbase Wallet. Once connected to the presale site, they can choose a payment method including ETH, BTC, BNB, SOL, USDT, or even card payments.

After confirming the transaction, the purchased $BFX tokens appear in the user's dashboard, along with staking rewards and any bonus perks tied to the presale. The tokens can then be claimed once the presale ends and trading begins.

Many market participants have built long positions on euro-denominated assets, expecting a positive outcome from the German stimulus plan and Rearm Europe projects. However, betting on a stronger euro may be optimistic considering the poor track record of these government plans, the rising fiscal challenges of France and other nations, the elevated debt and enormous unfunded liabilities, as well as the imminent implementation of a central bank digital currency. There are undoubted fiscal and deficit problems in the United States, but the relative position against the euro is undeniably stronger considering all the previously mentioned factors.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has accelerated its plan for a digital euro and recently hired the top global tech companies to create the architecture. However, European banks are rightly concerned, as a central bank digital currency poses significant privacy risks as well as a grave erosion of the capacity of the banking sector to lend and perform adequately.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be a dangerous tool for their potential risks to privacy, financial stability, and the concentration of monetary power. In the United States, the Trump administration has issued an executive order banning the use of these instruments, labelling them as “monetary tyranny”.

A CBDC is not the same as electronic money. A digital euro would give unprecedented surveillance capabilities to the central bank. Unlike current electronic payments, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) gives monetary authorities full and direct access to every transaction and savings account, eliminating financial privacy for citizens. This could allow for monitoring, controlling, or even penalising financial behaviours that central authorities may consider undesirable. Furthermore, a CBDC would eliminate the current limits in the financial system that prevent excessive money printing. Bypassing commercial banks and credit mechanisms allows central banks to instantly increase the money supply and finance government spending, eroding traditional budget controls. Removing commercial banks from the monetary system's transmission mechanism destabilises credit creation and increases the risk of crowding out the private sector.

The main arguments in favour of a digital euro, such as efficiency and enhanced monetary policy transmission, do not withstand scrutiny. None of those benefits require a centralised currency, much less a central bank-controlled monetary monopoly. If those were the real objectives, policymakers would encourage more decentralisation and competition instead of more central planning. The goal is more state control and rapid monetary financing of government spending, not real improvements for consumers or savers.

A CBDC is the evidence that the central bank does not want to strengthen the currency by making it attractive for investors but to impose its use.

 In October 2025, the ECB signed framework agreements with ten of the largest technology companies to provide the primary operational and infrastructural components for the planned digital euro, valued at over €1.1 billion. They include companies like Giesecke+Devrient (which makes offline payment solutions), Feedzai (which uses AI to find fraud), Almaviva and Fabrick (which make mobile wallet apps), and Senacor FCS (which makes it safe to share payment information). The framework agreements set the eurozone up for a possible launch of the digital euro by 2029. They cover software development, security, and fraud management.

The ECB says that these agreements are only for planning and that the currency won't be issued until laws are passed and the next phases of the project are approved. The technology providers will help design and test several technical requirements, such as real-time fraud monitoring and offline use. None of these elements are reducing the widespread concern about privacy, control and erosion of the credit mechanisms as they exist.

European commercial banks are distressed that a digital euro could hurt their main business models, and they are right. Lawmakers in the European Parliament are worried that a retail digital euro could force people to move a lot of money from commercial banks to central bank accounts, which would hurt the sector's private sector credit origination. The central bank would have access to all citizens' financial data, raising privacy concerns, even if they “promise” not to use it.

Banks say that a digital euro that is legally deemed free of risk would take funds out of the private financial system, making it harder for financial institutions to lend and prioritising credit to governments over loans to families and businesses. Furthermore, compliance and infrastructure costs are enormous, regulations are unclear and vague, and privacy protections are, at best, undefined.

A CBDC could let central banks watch almost all transactions and financial decisions by citizens, taking away the privacy that comes with cash and giving the government the power to investigate, limit, or even punish users' financial activities. Central banks can also quickly increase the money supply with a direct digital euro, without the usual limits that come from demand for credit in the banking sector. This eliminates essential limits to inflation and makes monetary policy directly subordinate to political expenditure priorities.

The CBDC will inevitably push commercial banks into a marginal role, creating a dangerous concentration of financial power in the hands of policymakers and technocrats.

The central bank's independence and the laws guaranteeing privacy provide vague answers to all these concerns. However, centralisation is always a threat, and those laws and their alleged independence are widely questioned when the central bank has consistently bowed down to political pressure to use expansionary monetary tools for government financing. The digital euro is likely to become another tool for rapid, unrestricted fiscal expansion and the subsequent loss of the purchasing power of the currency as the limits offered by banking intermediation are eliminated.

If governments want more efficiency, technology, and a stronger currency that is globally valued, they should encourage decentralisation and competition, not the opposite.

Contracts between the ECB and major tech companies are laying the technical groundwork for a digital euro. Regrettably, privacy and independence receive no priority. The digital euro has serious systemic, economic, and ethical issues and can be used by governments with unsustainable spending and debt problems to debase the currency and use it to finance bloated government projects. European banks are concerned and rightly so. The risk of excessively loosening monetary policy and resulting in complete monetary financing of government spending is significant.

A digital euro is surveillance disguised as money, and governments will do all they can to use it as a tool for direct monetary financing of deficits. If you believe that the same policymakers and governments that have done nothing to control debt accumulation and excessive spending are going to defend the purchasing power of the currency, you are dreaming.

 The trader bagged nearly $2 million in profit by investing in the “4” memecoin shortly after Zhao's social media post following the BNB Chain phishing incident. 

A lucky cryptocurrency trader turned a $3,000 investment into roughly $2 million within hours after Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao shared a post about a BNB Chain memecoin on X.

Blockchain data shows the trader, identified by wallet address “0x872,” was one of the earliest buyers of the newly launched “4” ($4) token, according to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. The trader's initial $3,000 worth of BNB (BNB) grew into $2 million, marking a roughly 650-fold return on investment.

Despite the massive gains, the trader sold only a small portion of their holdings and still holds $1.88 million worth of the tokens.

The “4” token was created following a phishing attack on the BNB Chain, where the hacker reportedly made just $4,000 in profit before the community turned the event into a meme.

The trader appears to have sought to capitalize on the social buzz surrounding the memecoin, with their crypto portfolio holding over 98% of their assets in 4.

The trader's portfolio generated over $1.8 million in unrealized profit over the past week, according to data from CoinStats.

The industry's most successful cryptocurrency traders, by returns, who are tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen's blockchain intelligence platform, have also bought the memecoin.

The “4” memecoin was the third-most-bought token by smart money traders over the past 24 hours on the BNB Chain, with traders acquiring nearly $100,000 worth of the tokens, data from Nansen shows.

Despite their lack of intrinsic utility, memecoins have previously made millionaires from crypto traders.

In March, another trader reportedly turned a $2,000 investment into as much as $43 million by buying the frog-themed Pepe (PEPE) memecoin. However, the trader held through Pepe's 74% decline from its all-time high, which saw his unrealized $43 million profit shrink to $10 million when he sold his position.

A separate investor turned $27 into $52 million in May 2024, according to onchain data.

Interest in the “4” token surged after Zhao reposted the BNB Chain's statement on the phishing incident to his 8.9 million X followers.

“Interestingly, after the hacker dumped ALL his tokens for a $4k gain, the community took over and bought the meme coin higher, as a mock to the hacker,” wrote Zhao in a Wednesday X post.

Another unknown wallet purchased the memecoin minutes before Zhao's X post. It was up over $1.5 million just hours after the trade, according to a Wednesday X post by blockchain data visualization platform Bubblemaps.

Zhao's post came shortly after the BNB Chain's official X account was temporarily hacked on Wednesday, Cointelegraph reported.

The attacker used the opportunity to share phishing links and promote the memecoin to the page's over four million followers

The cryptocurrency market benchmark asset, Bitcoin, reached its all-time high after surging to more than $125,000 during Monday's market session, driven by strong volume and broader market-wide momentum on 5 October 2025.

According to CoinMarketCap data, the digital currency gained more than 2% during the market session on Sunday, hitting its lifetime high level of $125,559.21. Bitcoin had a previous all-time high level of $1,24,500, which was achieved in August 2025.

The crypto brokerage data also showed that the currency extended its weekly gain to 13.87%, which aligns with the wider market momentum driven by bullish indicators, macroeconomic tailwinds in the United States, such as potential US Fed rate cuts later this month, and Bitcoin ETF inflows.

“This rally has been supported by the uptick in U.S. equities and renewed inflows into Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds. Investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as part of the ‘debasement trade,' with concerns over the U.S. government shutdown driving demand for safe-haven assets. Rising institutional adoption, coupled with global economic uncertainty, continues to strengthen Bitcoin's position as the ‘digital gold' of our time,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX.

A poll conducted by CoinMarketCap among investors showed that, despite the cryptocurrency reaching its all-time high today, crypto investors are maintaining their bullish momentum.

According to the data, 82% of Bitcoin investors anticipate a ‘bullish' sentiment for Bitcoin, while 18% expect a ‘bearish' stance. More than 5 million people have voted using the poll option on the brokerage.

“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectables like Pokemon cards hitting all-time highs, it's no surprise Bitcoin is benefiting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, told the news agency AFP on Sunday.

As of 3:03 p.m. (IST), the Bitcoin prices are trading nearly 1% higher at $123,632 on Sunday, 5 October 2025, compared to their previous levels on the previous day.

The benchmark cryptocurrency's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.46 trillion, marking a 0.94% gain in the last 24-hour period. However, the CoinMarketCap data also showed that investors are now trying to hold the crypto coin, with the volumes dropping 22.2% in the last one-day period.

Bitcoin's trading volumes dropped 22.2% to $59.33 billion as of the trading session on Sunday. The brokerage data showed that the all-time low level for the benchmark currency was at $0.04865 nearly 15 years ago in July 2010.

However, investments in these digital asset classes are risky due to the highly volatile nature of the crypto market. Hence, investors should stay cautious before making any investments.

 How much is the bridge between the real world and blockchains worth?


 Investors have shown interest in the business of stablecoins, the digital money some believe could one day displace cash. They're not generally seen as investments themselves—those pegged to the buck should cost a buck and be worth a buck, more or less—but the business of dealing in them is drawing in money.


 Take Tether Holdings and Circle Internet Group (CRCL), the world's largest stablecoin issuers. The former recently sought a private-market deal that would value the company at $500 billion, in line with the market capitalizations of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and rivaling the private value of OpenAI's. Circle has a stock more than 350% above its IPO price and a market cap of roughly $35 billion.


 Stablecoins are mainly used for crypto trading, a base currency for buying into bitcoin and other assets. But proponents say their other uses—like paying employees, buying coffee, or holding value in company treasuries—can do what banking services and credit cards can do, only faster, presenting trillions of dollars in opportunity.


Stablecoins are a form of digital currency, typically pegged to a real-world currency like the dollar, that proponents believe are the future of money. While that sorts out, some companies have made inroads in establishing their coins, which has led to multibillion-dollar valuations for their businesses. Competition and legislation, however, will go a long way toward determining who wins in this business.

 Tether and Circle, which together have 85% market share of the roughly $300 billion-and-growing pie, according to rwa.xyz, look like the likeliest disruptors of the payments market. Their business models have been made legitimate with U.S. legislation, and have won over some central bankers.


 Now investors have the tricky task of determining whether the biggest stablecoin issuers can fight off banks and e-commerce giants to take share in payments and other markets that aren't explicitly crypto, supporting their valuations. "We're going to be involved," JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said on a recent conference call.


 Tether and Circle have similar business models: they make money from interest earned on the reserves they hold. The acquire more when users buy the stablecoins, and sell when they're redeemed. Lower interest rates could mean a hit to revenue, but it could also spur trading that could boost business: Demand for crypto can lift demand for stablecoins used to facilitate trading, data show.


 Circle generated $658 million in the second quarter, of which 96% was reserve income, and a net loss of $482 million due to non-cash related IPO expenses.Its reserves are managed by BlackRock (BLK) and its reserve rate for the quarter was 4.1%. Tether, a private company, doesn't disclose its financials as Securities and Exchange Commission-regulated companies do, but its most recent quarterly unaudited attestation report shows a net profit of $4.9 billion in the second quarter.


 While the U.S. in July passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, also known as GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are still locked in battle with the banking industry. The law forbids issuers themselves from passing on yield to stablecoin holders, but it doesn't explicitly disallow crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) from giving Circle's usdc holders a 4.1% reward, just a percentage point below the best saving accounts rates in the country.


 Therein lies one of the key issues: Banks are concerned that stablecoin yields will entice the masses to pull deposits from savings accounts to chase yields as good as or better than those they offer. Now, the Treasury Department has gotten involved, asking for public input on things like taxes and how anti-money laundering rules apply.


 And it's not just banks that want in: Companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are considering issuing their own stablecoins.

BlockDAG has raised close to $420 million in its presale while partnering with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team... not bad for a project that's barely left the lab. This partnership not only boosts its credibility but also highlights the potential of tech innovation and a strong community backing. Let's dive into what BlockDAG is doing to redefine standards in the crypto world and assess its implications for blockchain technology moving forward.

BlockDAG's architecture, which melds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech with Proof-of-Work security, puts it at the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem. This unique model effectively tackles the scalability and decentralization issues that have long plagued conventional blockchains. Demonstrating a throughput of 1,400 transactions per second (TPS) on its Awakening testnet, BlockDAG shows it's prepared for real-world applications, making it an attractive option for companies transitioning from fiat to crypto business payments.

Technological capability is just part of the equation; BlockDAG is also keen on community involvement. With over 3 million users actively mining through the X1 app and 20,000 hardware miners shipped globally, the project cultivates a lively ecosystem. This active participation is crucial for driving adoption, particularly as demand for cross-border crypto payroll solutions escalates. By incorporating decentralized payroll tools, BlockDAG is setting the stage for businesses to hire globally with crypto, enhancing its attractiveness in a crowded crypto marketplace.

The collaboration with BWT Alpine serves as a game changer, adding to BlockDAG's credibility. Formula 1® is all about precision, performance, and innovation, which makes it a fitting platform for blockchain technology. This partnership not only offers high-profile visibility but also associates BlockDAG with a brand synonymous with reliability and excellence. As the first Layer-1 blockchain making its mark in Formula 1®, BlockDAG is establishing a new benchmark for how real-world partnerships can bolster market positioning.

In the volatile crypto market, timing can make or break you. As BlockDAG nears its $600 million target, it retains a presale price of $0.0015, offering a unique investment chance. Market analysts suggest that the partnership with BWT Alpine could significantly elevate BlockDAG's visibility, potentially leading to long-term price levels of $1—an incredible upside of over 76,000% from its current presale price. This well-timed move positions BlockDAG to be a serious contender in the crypto landscape, especially as the demand for stablecoin adoption on freelancer platforms continues to climb.

BlockDAG's entry into Formula 1® through the BWT Alpine partnership isn't just a sponsorship—it's a leap from obscurity to global recognition.

Bitcoin BTC$123,195.05 surged to a record high of over $125,000 Sunday, extending the weekly gain to 11%, according to CoinDesk data.

The rally followed a massive demand for U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). which collectively registering a net inflow of $3.24 billion last week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow on record, according to data provider SoSoValue.

Other tokens such as XRP, ETH, SOL, DOGE followed BTC's lead, gaining 1% to 3% during the Asian hours. 

BTC's rally arrives against the backdrop of a continued U.S. government shutdown, which analysts say has heightened safe-haven demand for the top cryptocurrency. 

Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer of Arca, noted just before the shutdown began, "The only time I buy BTC is when society loses faith in governments and local banks. $BTC likely a good buy here ahead of yet another U.S. government shutdown."

Beyond political uncertainty, experts point to significant macroeconomic factors driving the rally. 

Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, explained, "beyond the escalating risk of new conflicts, US inflation is more likely to increase than decrease, increased borrowing around the world will intensify currency concerns, and what's good for gold is also good for BTC, especially since it is still woefully under-allocated."

"Plus, the incoming rush of market support – lower rates, yield curve control and lots and lots of “money printing” – will boost global liquidity, which will seep into the riskier corners of institutional portfolios," she added.

In short, BTC looks set to chalk up impressive gains during the seasonally bullish month of October. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was trading around $124,080, according to CoinDesk data.

 Bitwise's Matt Hougan said Solana's speed and finality make it Wall Street's top choice for stablecoins and tokenization despite Ethereum's dominance. 

Chief investment officer of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, Matt Hougan, thinks Solana will be the Wall Street network of choice for stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization.

“I think Solana is the new Wall Street,” said Hougan, speaking with Solana Labs' Akshay Rajan on Oct. 2. He added that the Wall Street audiences consider Bitcoin (BTC) “very ephemeral” and “hard to get their heads around.”

They can see what is happening in the stablecoin and tokenization space, and they know that it is going to be “enormously significant,” he said before adding, “Really important people are saying that stablecoins will reinvent payments and tokenization will reinvent stock, bond, commodity, and real estate markets.”

When they look at how to invest, the answer is in the blockchain space, and when they evaluate the blockchain space, “the speed, the throughput, the finality of Solana makes it seem extraordinarily attractive.”

Hougan cited improvements from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds in settlement speed, saying that this makes sense to them because that's how they like to trade.

Stablecoin supplies on Solana have grown to $13.9 billion, giving it a stablecoin tokenization market share of 4.7%, according to RWA.xyz.

It is still a minnow compared to industry leader Ethereum (ETH), which has $172.5 billion in onchain stablecoin value and a commanding market share of 59%. This increases to 65% when Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon are included. 

Offchain Labs' Chief Strategic Officer, AJ Warner, compared Solana and Ethereum total value locked on Saturday, stating, “TVL is definitely not everything, but I don't think you can doubt where the best place to launch new stablecoins is. Build within the EVM.”  

It is not the first time Bitwise executives have hyped up Solana (SOL). Speaking with Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore last week, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, citing its design as more favorable for investors.

He said that Solana's unstaking period is much faster than Ethereum's, which is important because “ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.”

The company offers a fund called the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP that provides investors with exposure to SOL through a fully backed, physically held structure with institutional-grade custody. Interest has been muted in comparison to BTC or Ether-based ETFs, with just $30 million in assets under management, according to Bitwise.

The firm also has a spot Solana ETF waiting in the SEC approval queue with the final decision due on Oct. 16. 

SOL prices were trading down 2% on the day at $227 at the time of writing. The asset remains down more than 22% from its January 2025 all-time high.

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of "food addiction," these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. Some experts argue that they're "specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximise consumption and corporate profits," hijacking our brain's reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs.

Policymakers have proposed bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence?

My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat - not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? We studied more than 3,000 UK adults and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward.

Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They're related, but not identical. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists.

We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognizable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams - more than 400 in total.

We then compared these responses with three things: the foods' nutritional content (fat, sugar, fiber, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the widely used Nova system - a food classification method that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing - and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on).

Perception power

Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating.

But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered - people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fiber, high-calorie foods as more "bingeable." But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot.

Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fiber had the opposite effect.

In one survey, we could predict 78% of the variation in people's likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%).

In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what's actually in it.

This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as "ultra-processed" added very little to our predictive models.

Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating.

That's not to say all UPFs are harmless. Many are high in calories, low in fiber and easy to overconsume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together sugary soft drinks with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives.

Some of these products may be less healthy, but others can be helpful - especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition.

The message that all UPFs are bad oversimplifies the issue. People don't eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals.

Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that are actually beneficial, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what's genuinely unhealthy.

Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalized approach:

It's not just about processing

Some UPFs do deserve concern. They're calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they're not a smoking gun.

Labeling entire categories of food as bad based purely on their processing misses the complexity of eating behavior. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now have the data and models to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets.

Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food - and how we perceive them - matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it's time to stop demonizing food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.

The cumulative effect of social advantages across a lifetime - from parental warmth in childhood to friendship, community engagement and religious support in adulthood - may slow the biological processes of aging. These social advantages appear to set back "epigenetic clocks" such that a person's biological age, as measured by analyzing DNA methylation patterns, is younger than their chronological age.

The research, which appeared in the October issue of the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity -- Health, drew on data from more than 2,100 adults in the long-running Midlife in the United States, or MIDUS, study.

Anthony Ong, psychology professor at Cornell University, and fellow researchers found that people with higher levels of what they called "cumulative social advantage" showed slower epigenetic aging and lower levels of chronic inflammation.

The study focused on so-called epigenetic clocks, molecular signatures that estimate the pace of biological aging. Two in particular - GrimAge and DunedinPACE - are considered especially predictive of morbidity and mortality. Adults with stronger, more sustained social networks showed significantly younger profiles on both clocks.

"Cumulative social advantage is really about the depth and breadth of your social connections over a lifetime," Ong said. "We looked at four key areas: the warmth and support you received from your parents growing up, how connected you feel to your community and neighborhood, your involvement in religious or faith-based communities, and the ongoing emotional support from friends and family."

The researchers hypothesized that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. Remarkably, they found that higher social advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule implicated in heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, however, there were no significant associations with short-term stress markers like cortisol or catecholamines.

Unlike many earlier studies that looked at social factors in isolation - whether a person is married, for example, or how many friends they have - this work conceptualized "cumulative social advantage" as a multidimensional construct. And by combining both early and later-life relational resources, the measure reflects the ways advantage clusters and compounds.

"What's striking is the cumulative effect -- these social resources build on each other over time," Ong said. "It's not just about having friends today; it's about how your social connections have grown and deepened throughout your life. That accumulation shapes your health trajectory in measurable ways."

This doesn't mean a single friendship or volunteer stint can turn back the biological clock. The authors suggest that the depth and consistency of social connection, built across decades and different spheres of life, matters profoundly. The study adds weight to the growing view that social life is not just a matter of happiness or stress relief but a core determinant of physiological health.

"Think of social connections like a retirement account," Ong said. "The earlier you start investing and the more consistently you contribute, the greater your returns. Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional; they're biological. People with richer, more sustained social connections literally age more slowly at the cellular level. Aging well means both staying healthy and staying connected -- they're inseparable."

The habitat of thirty species of sharks, rays, and chimaeras, also called ghost sharks, overlap with areas where proposed deep-sea mining may occur, according to new research published in Current Biology and led by University of Hawai'i at Mānoa oceanographers. Nearly two-thirds of these species are already threatened with extinction due to human impacts, so deep-sea mining, which will disrupt the seafloor and discharge large plumes of sediment into the water above, has the potential to elevate their extinction risk.

"Deep-sea mining is a new potential threat to this group of animals which are both vital in the ocean ecosystem and to human culture and identity," said Aaron Judah, lead author of the study and oceanography graduate student in the UH Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST). "By identifying and calling attention to this threat and recommending potential conservation pathways, I hope we will be better positioned to support healthy shark, ray, and chimaera populations into the future."

Where there is overlap, there is risk

Judah collaborated with an international team of experts to overlay the global maps of species ranges created by the IUCN Shark Specialist Group with contract areas and reserved areas allocated for deep-sea mining by the International Seabed Authority. The researchers also accounted for how each species reproduces and how deep they dive in order to estimate their vulnerability to mining impacts. For example, species such as skates and chimaeras lay eggs on the seafloor and therefore mining vehicles could pose a threat to nurseries.

The species they assessed included iconic examples such as the whale shark, manta rays, and the megamouth shark, and also many lesser known, but just as interesting deep-sea species, such as the pygmy shark, chocolate skate, and point-nosed chimaera, which comes from a unique group of cartilaginous fishes similar to sharks and rays, sometimes called ghost sharks.

The team discovered that 30 species could be impacted by discharge plumes and 25 of the 30 species could also be impacted by seafloor disruptions associated with mining. They also found that because many of the species inhabit a variety of habitats along the depth range or are deep divers, mining impacts may overlap more than half of the depth range of 17 species.

Assessing risk to minimize impacts

Deep-sea mining is set to potentially occur in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which is a large abyssal plain area that spans from the waters around Hawai'i into the eastern Pacific Ocean. To make the best management decisions, the potential impacts on marine life and the communities that depend on them must be known.

"Sharks and their relatives are the second most threatened vertebrate group on the planet, mostly from overfishing," said Jeff Drazen, study senior author and professor of Oceanography at SOEST. "Because of their vulnerability, they should be considered in ongoing discussions of the environmental risks from deep-sea mining, and those responsible for monitoring their health should be aware that mining could pose an additional risk."

The authors offer a number of recommendations to improve conservation of these species under the footprint of mining, such as establishing monitoring programs, including them in environmental impact assessments, and creating protected areas. These recommendations could be adopted by the International Seabed Authority in their regulations for creating environmental impact assessments, or by contractors in executing scientific baseline assessments.

"Many of the shark species identified in the analysis are highly mobile and can move across wide swaths of ocean," said Judah. "Given their mobility and the proximity of Hawai'i to the areas allocated for mining, impacts in these areas may stretch indirectly to ecosystems near the island chain."

Judah continues to research and report species range extensions for animals not included in the initial assessment, which may add additional species to this group of animals at risk from mining impacts.

A key switch for cellular energy balance has been discovered in cells: it could potentially become the target of new therapies for diseases ranging from Parkinson's to rare disorders caused by defects in the cell's powerhouses, the mitochondria. The switch is called phosphatase B55 (PP2A-B55alpha) and regulates the balance of mitochondria. Experts from Università Cattolica, Rome campus, and Roma Tre Universty have observed that, by reducing its activity, it's possible to attenuate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's in a preclinical model of the disease.

This is the result of a study published in Science Advances, led by Francesco Cecconi, Full Professor of Biochemistry at the Department of Basic Biotechnological Sciences, Intensive Care and Perioperative Medicine at the Università Cattolica, and conducted by Valentina Cianfanelli, Associate Professor at the Department of Science at Roma Tre University and Principal Investigator of the Young Researchers Project at the Gynecological Oncology Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS.

Background

Mitochondria are highly complex cellular organelles, vital for cell survival. They are responsible for producing the energy cells need to survive. Their integrity is associated with several diseases, both widespread, such as Parkinson's, and rare, so-called mitochondrial diseases, which can affect various parts of the body, from muscles to eyes to the brain. Inside cells, there is a delicate balance between old or damaged mitochondria that must be eliminated and new ones that must replace them. In some diseases, however, this balance is disrupted, and if mitochondria are lost in excess, or if damaged organelles accumulate in the cell and are regularly not eliminated, the very survival of the cell is endangered.

In the case of Parkinson's disease, for example, the loss of mitochondria also plays a role in the death of dopaminergic neurons that underlies the disease.

The Study

Experts have discovered that B55 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis.

"On the one hand," Professor Cecconi explains, "it promotes the removal of damaged mitochondria by stimulating mitophagy, a selective process for removing inefficient and potentially dangerous organelles. On the other, B55 acts as a controller of mitochondrial biogenesis, stabilizing the main promoter of new mitochondrial formation.

In this way, B55 not only promotes the degradation of damaged mitochondria, but also prevents excessive production of new organelles, thus maintaining a dynamic balance between mitochondrial elimination and synthesis. It is of great interest," the expert emphasizes, "that both these effects depend on the functional interaction between B55 and Parkin, a central protein in mitophagy mechanisms, implicated in Parkinson's disease.

Professor Cecconi and Cianfanelli explain: it is no coincidence that in our research, using animal models of Parkinson's disease (Drosophila, the fruit flies), "we observed that by reducing B55 levels we can improve both the motor defects and the mitochondrial alterations typical of the disease." This effect requires the presence of the Parkin factor and acts primarily on mitochondrial biogenesis.

The idea could be to develop small molecules capable of penetrating the brain and selectively acting on dopaminergic neurons, counteracting their death.

More generally, a 'universal' drug that regulates the action of B55 could be developed for various mitochondrial diseases characterized by mitochondrial loss, including some mitochondrial myopathies and neurodegenerative diseases, Professor Cecconi explains. Furthermore, the deregulation of mitochondrial quality and number also underlies the plasticity of tumor cells and their ability to resist therapies, so controlling B55 could become a promising approach in oncology.

This is why "our future studies will aim to identify safe molecules and therapeutic strategies to modulate B55 in preclinical and human cellular models, especially in order to analyze the effect of its regulation on other neurodegenerative and mitochondrial diseases," they conclude.

OpenAI and Jony Ive face significant technical challenges as they work to develop a screen-less, AI-powered device, according to the Financial Times.

Back in May, OpenAI acquired io, the device startup founded by the legendary Apple designer with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for $6.5 billion. At the time, Altman declared that Ive and his team would help the company “create a new generation of AI-powered computers,” while Bloomberg reported that the first devices to emerge from the deal were scheduled to launch in 2026.

The FT now says that OpenAI and Ive aim to create “a palm-sized device without a screen that can take audio and visual cues from the physical environment and respond to users' requests.” But unresolved issues around the device's “personality,” how it handles privacy, and computing infrastructure might delay the launch.

For example, one source told the FT that rather than waiting for a specific verbal prompt, the device would take an “always on” approach — but the team has reportedly struggled to ensure it only speaks up when useful and ends its conversations at the appropriate time.

It became clear to me along the way that the world that a young humanities academic would have joined in the 1960s just didn't exist anymore.  Departmental politics, publish or perish, shrinking funding, and the declining prestige of the fields meant the gravy train was over.It also became clear that unhappy academics are amongst the most miserable, impotent, and self-loathing people around.

Mediocre blatherers like Jordan Peterson (to pick just one example) have captured the hearts and minds of young people because most "real" work in the humanities is locked behind not just academic paywalls but an impenetrable wall of inward-focused jargon. Humanities work is written for other people in the humanities, not the public. It also tends to deal with subjects that are not of interest to 90%+ of the public.A huge vacuum has been created, and it's been filled with shit because it's there so something's going to fill it.P.S. For the inevitable defenders of Jordan Peterson: go read Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, G.K. Chesterton, and CS Lewis, to name a few. Peterson is one of those people for whom I'd say "what he says that's interesting is not original, and what he says that's original is not interesting." Take away the authors he draws from and what's left is a mix of stoner-esque rambling (though apparently without the pot?) and something like an attempt at highbrow Andrew Tate. The latter is why I genuinely dislike the guy more than I would if he were just, say, a self-help quack, which he also is.

The problem isn't that there's value obfuscated by jargon, it's that almost all of it is obscurantist nonsense that hides its vacuity by trying to sound profound with jargon.

Always ask: is a field engaging with the world or with itself? If the latter, run away (unless you're looking for escapist fun, like a fandom).You even see it in tech fields that become inwardly focused, like cryptocurrency. 99% of the work in that space is aimed at users of cryptocurrency to... use cryptocurrency... so they can... use cryptocurrency? That field also has reams of "whitepapers" that are full of obscurantist nonsense. I'm giving it as an example because same disease, different patient.

I think this neglects the stark opportunity cost: PhD students are devoting years of their life to this endeavor, which may pay modest living expenses during school but otherwise provides no current or future financial benefit to the student unless they get a job in their field. Those years become lost years in their lives, years they can never get back.Moreover, if the ultimate goal of training graduate students is to preserve human knowledge, how is that goal going to be accomplished when those students are forced to leave the field and find some other way of supporting themselves after grad school? Ultimately, the knowledge will still be lost, won't it?In fairness to the University of Chicago, this is not a problem specific to the University of Chicago, certainly not the first straw but only the final straw. When the humanities are defunded across the board, and tenure-track jobs become nonexistent, the training of humanities PhDs becomes futile. We can't look to Chicago for a solution to this larger problem. Every university, no matter how big and prestigious, should and indeed must face the stark reality.

I'd like to juxtapose your quote against a famous quote of John Adams:The Science of Government it is my Duty to study, more than all other Sciences: the Art of Legislation and Administration and Negotiation, ought to take Place, indeed to exclude in a manner all other Arts. I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Mathematicks and Philosophy, Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their Children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine.-- John Adams in a letter to Abigail Adams (12 May 1780)In this quote, John Adams offers the thesis that what subjects we deem appropriate to study is determined not wholly by our interests, but also by the situation (personal, economic, and political) we find ourselves in. Within your quote is an implicit sense of urgency that weighs against someone's desire to devote years of their lives to studying the arts.Perhaps we are returning to John Adams's tumultuous time? Then it should be wholly understandable for more students to choose pragmatism over personal calling when deciding on a course of study.

That's a quite literal interpretation of the quote, which I did not intend. John Adams studied political science because his business was the business of government. Studying political science today -- as an otherwise directionless middle-class student relying on loans and scholarships for tuition -- is not really hearing the call to favour pragmatism I believe Adams had intended.

reply

Yes, but considering the contemporary assault on democracy and the rule of law, it seems apt.> the call to favour pragmatism I believe Adams had intendedIt depends on what you mean by pragmatism. I'd call it public pragmatism, not mere private pragmatism. Adams calls it his "duty" to study, and goes on to talk about the "liberty" and "right" to student other subjects. The obvious interpretation, I think, especially given who Adams is and his role in the founding of the US, is that he has the obligation to fight for democracy and liberty. Otherwise, he could probably just accumulate person wealth and allow his literal descendants, and those only, to study whatever they want.

The University of Chicago is basically Number Go Up University.I don't see why this university, out of all of the high-prestige American schools, would care about humanities in a time when the conservative political movement has wholly embraced anti-intellectualism. The political movement no longer cares about presenting Number Go Up Theory as some kind of elite intellectual practice.

For what it's worth, I have enjoyed a very successful career in data science and software engineering after taking some AP STEM courses in high school, followed by three liberal arts degrees. Many of the best engineers I've known have had similar backgrounds. A good liberal arts education teaches one how to think and learn independently. It's not a substitute for a highly-specialized education in, say, molecular biology, but it provides a really solid foundation to easily pick up more logic-derived technical skills like software development. It's also essential for an informed citizenry and functional democracy.

This is never what humanities at the university of Chicago represented, as the article points out:that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Implicit in their impassioned defenses was the belief that the role of a humanist is to preserve knowledge, safeguard learning from the market and the tides of popular interest, and ward off coarse appeals to economic utility.A lot of the people in the humanities involved with Chicago, Nussbaum, Dewey, Rorty, Roth, are defenders of exactly the Western tradition people ostensibly want to preserve. The assault on this isn't going to strengthen tech and science, which is under attack by the exact same people for the same reasons. Scientists, medical programs, vaccine research is coming under the cleaver just like the humanities do by the same strain of anti-intellectualism. This isn't revitalizing the sciences, as if the humanities are somehow at odds with engineering, it's a decline into Americas version of some kind of oligarchic Third Worldism.

AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don't work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 2.4 did it again.  

At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you're probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn't always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that's doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it's not as evenly distributed as it used to be. 

The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and getting more intricate all the time. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there's a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input.  

As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we're seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can't. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. 

In short, there's a reinforcement gap — and it's becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can't do. 

In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn't break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, as Google's senior director for dev tools recently told me, they're just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they're useful for reinforcement learning, since they're already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. 

There's no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don't have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo.  

Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you'd asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by OpenAI's new Sora 2 model shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both obvious and subtle ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you'd find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. 

To be clear, this isn't a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It's a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. The question of which healthcare services are RL-trainable, for instance, has enormous implications for the shape of the economy over the next 20 years. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.

Remote control drones have added are a terrifying new dimension to warfare in the 2020s. However, a Ukrainian invention that is tangling the efforts of the invaders to hit targets with their kamikaze drones has been revealed by a Russian Vlogger, reports Militarnyi.

Farmland littered with fiber optic cabling has become an instantly recognizable vista in the Russia-Ukraine war. The hazy wisps of tangled cabling, snagged in wheat stalks and hedgerows, are the ghostly remnants of a fierce drone war.

As anti-drone jamming technology has hardened, both sides of the conflict have increased their use of tethered drones. But using these umbilical cords, to avoid wireless jamming, doesn't limit the drone range as much as you might expect.

 




The source notes that there are optical fiber-tethered drones that have spools, allowing them to strike targets over 40km (25 miles) away. A successful anti-tank tethered drone strike back in May, by Ukraine's Birds of Magyar brigade, is said to have been completed from a distance of 42km (26 miles). Furthermore, a Ukrainian twin-engine Darts drone prototype features a 50km (31 miles) coil.

Sometimes low tech solutions are the most practical for high-tech problems. This philosophy has given rise to the optical fiber tethered drone. Now, Ukraine has a similarly simple solution to tethered enemy drones crossing miles-and-miles into its territory.

In a nutshell, the Ukrainian invention we see in the video consists of a rotating barbed wire, or razor wire, fence. This is a 150m (~500ft) long fence, and at one end a battery-powered motor twists the wire barrier once per minute. According to the report, such a fence can run 12 hours a day.

Drones don't pull cabling in the air, but lay it on the ground behind them. Thus, if the barbed wire can rotate and tangle it, and eventually snap the fiber, the enemy drones will fail to reach their targets. We don't get any more information about the installation, but we'd expect parallel fences rotating in opposite directions to each other to maximize fiber snapping speeds.

Militarnyi also notes that it is too risky to install these fences near the front line, so they are mainly used to help prevent deeper Russian drone incursions.

BTC's market cap is approaching that of silver.

Bitcoin reached an all-time high today, when it hit $125,449.77 at 4:55 am UTC. Although it has since normalized to around $122,000, at the time of writing, this is still a greater than 20% increase in value from December last year, when the cryptocurrency broke the $100,000 milestone. According to Reuters, Bitcoin has been rising for eight consecutive days before it hit this record, owing to rising confidence in U.S. equities and interest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The flagship cryptocurrency, abbreviated as BTC, previously hit $124,000 in August, driven by the White House's crypto-friendly policies and consequential interest from institutional investors. On the other hand, this jump is believed to be investors' reactions to the U.S. federal shutdown, with many looking for alternative assets while Washington is sorting out its mess.

Because of this, it seems that many are turning to Bitcoin ETFs to park their funds. Using ETFs, institutions allow investors to take advantage of Bitcoin trading without having to directly buy and manage crypto. Although Bitcoin ETFs accept fiat currency, they still need to purchase the cryptocurrency whenever they get an inflow of investments, which is what is happening at the moment.

Crypto tracking and analysis site CoinMarketCap also suggested that there is a dwindling supply of readily available Bitcoin in exchanges. There's been news of some MegaWhales moving large amounts of Bitcoin into long-term storage. For example, one investor moved 80,000 BTC from one dormant wallet in July, while 54,000 BTC (worth approximately $6.6 billion) was transferred out of Binance yesterday.

This news could add further momentum to BTC, as investors get FOMO and rush to buy more. Although prices have already dropped a bit, analysts suggest that many are still bullish on the cryptocurrency. However, it can also move the other way, especially if the market thinks that it has been overbought.

At the moment, BTC's total market cap is nearing $2.5 trillion — meaning it's about to catch up with silver. Although it's still distant from gold's over $26 trillion market cap, this shows that Bitcoin is slowly turning from a niche investment vehicle into a mainstream financial asset.

Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days returns for round two this Oct. 7-8 and gives you a second chance at Prime Day-level deals ahead of the holiday shopping season fully kicking off. Here's the twist, though: you don't actually need to wait until Tuesday morning to start saving. Amazon is already beginning to roll out pre-Black Friday savings in leading categories with among the deepest discounts appearing this Sunday, Oct. 5.

Top 10 Prime Day deals:

This October iteration of Prime Day has grown exponentially in popularity since Amazon first introduced it as a fall counterpart to the July edition. Timing is more crucial than folks realize. While July Prime Day falls in the middle of summer (when most shoppers aren't shopping for big-ticket items), October positions itself perfectly in advance of Black Friday and the holiday shopping season. This gives the consumer a chance to grab gifts, upgrade their technology or refresh their home without having to fight the raw chaos of late November. Most have caught on that October Prime Day offers the same or better prices than Black Friday, especially on Amazon devices and a few big-name electronics lines.

The electronics department is already facing deep discounts across the board. Apple products (which rarely get heavily discounted through authorized channels) are appearing on Amazon with massive discounts – especially the Mac Mini M4. Samsung has joined the advance savings deal bandwagon with discounts on tablets, smartphones and home appliances. Sony audio products including top-selling headphones and speakers have seen prices fall below regular retail prices. These aren't nominal percent discounts: We are seeing actual savings that make upgrading more financially attractive than usual.

Amazon's own brands are leading the way on the early Prime Day discounts, with some of the steepest price cuts available for those items with Amazon's own branding. Kindle e-readers have dropped to prices this Sunday morning that put them impulse-buy zone with many models establishing their year-to-date lowest price ever. Blink cameras, Amazon's budget security option, are becoming affordable with savings that drop them well below $50 for starter packages.

The eero mesh WiFi systems are seeing fantastic offers and cure one of the most common home annoyances: dead zones and spotty internet access. Those Prime Big Deal Day deals matter because mesh systems typically come with high prices, and Amazon's aggressive discounting makes them accessible to mass consumers who've been tolerating crummy WiFi for years. All Echo devices of every size have been receiving price reductions. Fire TV streaming sticks and devices are hitting record lows, making it simple to break up with cable.

The scope of these October Prime Day Amazon discounts is not coincidental: Prime Day events are used by the company to drive hard uptake of its ecosystem aggressively and hope that once customers possess an Echo, Kindle, or Fire device, they will be more invested in Amazon's services and more likely to be Prime members over the long haul.

Early Sunday Prime Day deals begin to provide glimpses of what is to come when the full event commences on Tuesday morning.

The pleasure of shopping this Sunday rather than waiting for the grand kickoff on Tuesday is simple: less competition, more choice. There will be hordes of shoppers swamping Amazon's servers on Tuesday morning, causing site lag, cart wars where you stock out of something while you check out and general irritation of trying to outbid limited-quantity deals out of there against a thousand other shoppers.

There is a membership fee to be qualified for these deals, which is $139 for the year or $14.99 a month. If you are not a member currently, Amazon offers a 30-day free trial that includes this Prime Day sale and gives you a full month to determine if the membership is worth it through the free shipping, Prime Video, and other perks. Just make sure to stop before the free trial runs out if you do not want to continue.

One tip in practice for Prime Day: add items to cart or wishlist in advance even if you don't plan on purchasing them at that time. Amazon's technology enables you to just track price drops on bookmarked items and you'll be notified if prices drop lower after the big event. This method prevents choice paralysis while browsing hundreds of deals simultaneously.

The October timing also makes this Prime Day ideal for beating the gun on holiday shopping. Prices on all of the top gift categories, from high-tech gadgetry to kitchen appliances to toys, typically don't dip lower even on Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Tying up holiday gift purchases in advance avoids the December shipping issues, out-of-stock items, and last-minute aggravation that plague holiday shoppers year in and year out.

The Ninja Slushi doesn't go on sale often. Why would it? Throughout this year and last, the real story behind the Ninja Slushi was that you couldn't find the dang thing in stock.

What a difference a season makes: Now it's $50 off list price on an early Prime Day deal. This is the best (and kinda the only) actual deal I've seen on the Ninja Slushi. It's among the most exciting and surprising early Prime Day deals, but check out our rundown for more.

Crate & Barrel

I received a Ninja Slushi to test at the beginning of summer, and it changed my year a lot more than I expected. The Slushi has been an unbridled hit since it first came out (then promptly sold out) last year. It's a feat of engineering that brought the bar slushie machine into the American home kitchen and onto the American home patio.

I tested the Slushi against a couple new competitors, and the Ninja still reigned supreme. But I still didn't expect to use it as much as I did.

Just like my favorite soda maker, the Drinkmate Omnifizz ($133), the Slushi offered the chance to try pretty much every drink you already like … a different way. Orange juice slushie, cold-brew slushie latte, mimosa slushie, frosé all day, daiquiri slushie, negroni slushie, and tamarind michelada slushie. Fruity-sour craft beers slush like champions, it turns out, as do sweetly cheap wines from Grocery Outlet.

I am apparently still a child, plus alcohol, is what I learned. I even nurtured by inner fraternity bro by making slushies from Bapple and Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade. Both, by dint of being Very Cold and Very Sweet, were also trashily delicious.

Attempts at soft serve ice cream or milkshakes didn't really pan out, alas—you want a Ninja Swirl for that. But I dutifully lugged this thing to barbecues and to parties full of children—where the slushie machine was quickly commandeered for wholesome lemon-lime, strawberry, or orange-vanilla slush.

Heck, I was named an honorary uncle to a tot and tween just for bringing this thing to a birthday party, and presumably bringing it again for the next one: You've gotta keep at least one slushie machine in the family, seems to be the idea. I can't help but agree.

Many presidential appointments are structured so that their terms outlast the president in question; Biden kept Chris Wray on, for example. But that simply won't work this time, because these people are loyal to Trump first; that is what he demands. It is impossible to imagine any Democratic or national unity president keeping Kash Patel in his job, or Brendan Carr in his, or whoever Trump finally installs at the Federal Reserve.Whoever takes over from Trump would legitimately have to purge and criminally charge essentially everyone he hired, and many, many people they hired, all the way down the chain. It would be the right thing to do but it will seem indistinguishable from what Trump is currently doing under false pretences.Even assuming Trump does not simply die of or retire from old age or ill health in office, he himself is essentially untouchable. So to his remaining supporters it will look like an unfair proxy war against him, targeting his employees and loyalists.Nothing is ever going to go back to the way it was before, and I think people will have to steel themselves for the possibility that the only thing that will provide any sort of foundation for rebuilding the federal USA is some sort of truth and reconciliation commission, and these people will, in fact, have to get away without meaningful sanction if the full truth is to be known.Apart from that, the only solution will be to dissolve the union and start from scratch.

The GFC set them straight and enough of them got desperate they elected a black man.Instead of dissolving the union (which probably wouldn't benefit the owner class) just wait until the next financial catastrophe to hit and watch those Trump signs go into the trash and those people to hide in their caves for at least a year or three.

The U.S. men's national team still has questions across the roster, but Haji Wright is putting himself in a position to solve the striker issue as the October international window beckons.

Wright scored his ninth goal in all competitions for Coventry City on Saturday, as they dominated Sheffield Wednesday with a 5–0 win to bring them to the top of the EFL Championship table. His goal came in first-half stoppage time, netting his eighth goal in the Championship and 40th with the club since signing in 2023.

The 27-year-old is among the names fighting for the starting striker job as the USMNT continue to prepare for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil. Wright was called up by head coach Mauricio Pochettino for October friendlies against Ecuador and Australia alongside Patrick Agyemang and Folarin Balogun.

Wright has now scored in seven of his last nine matches. His goals come at the perfect time as well, as he finds himself in stellar form ahead of the October camp. 

“We couldn't ask for much more from the week with three clean sheets and a lot of goals, Coventry manager Frank Lampard said after the match. “We worked hard and we've had a good start now up to this point, and it's important we keep our feet on the ground, enjoy the moment, because it's been a good week and rest up and try and continue with this form.”

Wright has not featured for the USMNT since June 16 in the Gold Cup, a 5–0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in which he scored. An Achilles injury kept him out of the rest of the tournament as the U.S. went on to finish runners-up. He was not selected in September as the USMNT fell to South Korea and beat Japan in international friendlies.

“I hope he does [start], and how passionate he is about doing that and representing his country at the World Cup and what that would mean to him. He's very honest about that, as he should be,” Lampard told Sports Illustrated in September.

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup just around the corner, more details are beginning to emerge about the tournament that will take place across the United States, Mexico, and Canada. After the unveiling of the official mascots — Zayu, Clutch, and Maple — and the new match ball, Trionda, new reports have surfaced revealing the tentative kick-off times for the opening group-stage matches. According to multiple Mexican outlets, there could be up to four games per day, offering fans nonstop soccer action across North America.

The FIFA organizing committee is expected to officially confirm match times in the coming weeks, ahead of the World Cup draw scheduled for December 2025, when the full fixture list will be unveiled. The 2026 edition will mark the first time 48 teams compete, resulting in a record 104 total matches across 16 host cities.

Leaked schedules indicate that group-stage matches will follow this four-game format (U.S. Eastern Time):

This approach allows fans across different time zones — from Vancouver and Los Angeles to New York and Miami — to enjoy an uninterrupted stream of matches, echoing the excitement of major tournaments like the NFL Sunday lineup but on a global soccer scale.

FIFA will officially release the match calendar at the World Cup draw in December, which will also finalize the venues for each group. The tournament opener is expected to take place in Mexico City's Estadio Azteca, while the final will likely be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, capable of hosting over 80,000 fans.

So far, 17 nations have secured their spots:

Marcus Rashford's stunning volley proved to be a consolation goal for Barcelona, who were hammered 4-1 in Seville. The defeat was compounded after Robert Lewandowski missed a penalty, but Sevilla were well worth the scoreline and it was only a fine performance from Wojciech Szczesny which kept the scoreline down. 

The hosts took the lead in the 11th minute after a clumsy challenge from Ronald Araujo on Isaac Romero, referee Alejandro Muniz Ruiz initially failed to give the penalty, but pointed to spot after reviewing the challenge on the pitchside video, and Alexis Sanchez sent his former Arsenal team-mate Szczesny the wrong way to give Sevilla the lead. 

The conditions in southern Spain were sweltering, hitting 33 degrees, and it was the hosts who were on fire, doubling their lead in the 37th minute, courtesy of a well-taken finish by Romero after Joules Kounde had been caught in possession. But Barcelona game themselves hope deep into time added on in the first-half, when Pedri picked out Rashford who timed his run to perfection and fired an unstoppable shot past Odysseas Vlachodimos. 

And while Hansi Flick's side were improved in the second half, Lewandowski fired his penalty wide in the 77th minute and the league champions conceded two further late goals to slump to a demoralising 4-1 defeat.

Sergio Busquets has revealed that he could have continued playing alongside Lionel Messi at Inter Miami in MLS, but has chosen not to. Instead of prolonging a remarkable playing career, the legendary former Barcelona midfielder has announced that he will be retiring at the end of the 2025/26 season. A break from football is being planned, but he could return to the dugout at some point in the future.

LONDON (AP) — Martin Odegaard has been withdrawn from Norway's squad for its upcoming matches, including a World Cup qualifier against Israel, because of a knee injury sustained on Premier League duty with Arsenal, the English club said Sunday.

Odegaard, who is Norway's captain, suffered a medial collateral ligament injury to his left knee early in Arsenal's 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday, the club said. It marked the third time this season he has gone off in the first half of a match because of injury, with Odegaard having also been troubled by shoulder problems.

Arsenal didn't give an expected timescale for Odegaard's latest injury absence, only saying he will “continue to be assessed and treated by our medical team ... with the aim of a return to action as soon as possible.”

Norway hosts Israel on Saturday and then plays a friendly against New Zealand three days later.

Barcelona must win to retake top spot in La Liga, but in the opening stages against Sevilla, they have fallen behind at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan.

Ronald Araujo was one of two changes made from the midweek defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, and he was at the heart of the incident that allowed Sevilla to score the opener. He was adjudged to have fouled Isaac Romero inside the penalty, with the decision being confirmed after a VAR check. That allowed Alexis Sanchez to step up from 12 yards, and he netted against his former club.

Alexis received a lovely message from Barcelona upon making his La Liga return with Sevilla, but right now, there will not be any warm feelings from the Catalans, who have been left incensed with the decision to away that penalty to Sevilla. Araujo protested his innocence, but in the end, it has not mattered, and Los Nervionenses have the early lead.

According to a recent update from SPORT, Andreas Christensen has made it clear that he wants to extend his stay at Barcelona.

The outlet assures that the 29-year-old defender, whose current contract runs until 2026, has shown no interest in entertaining offers from other clubs.

He has completed four seasons at the club and is keen to continue, but only if Barcelona agree to keep him. For now, Christensen will have to wait, as the club has yet to make an official offer.

From a sporting perspective, Christensen remains an important part of Hansi Flick's plans.

The Barcelona coach and his staff value the defender highly, praising his professionalism and trustworthiness on the pitch.

While he is regularly getting minutes, the coaching team has not confirmed whether he will enjoy a long-term starting role.

As such, Christensen's future at the club will largely depend on his performances and how the team fares over the season.

For Barcelona, Christensen is a solid option, but the club is taking a cautious approach.

Decisions regarding contract renewals are expected at the end of the season, after evaluating both his form and physical condition.

Any potential offer would likely be within Barcelona's revised salary structure, reflecting the club's financial strategy.

Both Deco and Flick have expressed confidence in Christensen's reliability. While other clubs will surely show interest, the Dane is willing to stay and adapt to the team's framework.

Meanwhile, the club is also scouting centre-backs in the transfer market as a precaution.

Their focus is on players with potential and left-footed defenders capable of playing out from the back, ensuring that Barcelona are prepared for any eventuality in the summer transfer window.

Christensen's commitment and professionalism make him a valuable asset for the Blaugrana.

However, whether he stays long-term will depend on his performances, team results, and how Barcelona manage their squad moving forward.

Christian Pulisic is already fondly known as 'Captain America', but could he become captain of AC Milan? The USMNT star has become a talismanic figure for the Serie A giants, with his value to the collective cause being recognised at San Siro. There has been talk of a new contract being lined up, while Pulisic could be asked to provide on-field leadership at some stage as he takes on skipper duties.

This is the 11th in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, and a second West Germany triumph in 1974. Now it's time for a new name on the trophy: Argentina.

Forty eight years after they were defeated in the first final over the water in Montevideo, Argentina finally won the World Cup, on home soil in Buenos Aires. This was the 11th World Cup, and now five had been won by the host nation.

Argentina had been awarded the tournament 12 years beforehand, but the situation in the country had changed dramatically since then, with the government ousted by a military junta headed by General Jorge Rafael Videla. This was a period of serious violence in Argentina, with the most notable death in footballing terms being the assassination of General Omar Actis, the head of the World Cup organising committee.

On the pitch, Argentina were not blessed with an overwhelmingly brilliant generation of players, but they were the favourites going into the tournament.

“Argentina to reach final — but who else?” was the headline in World Soccer magazine's preview of the competition, for example. But they had an outstanding player in each department on the pitch: the commanding centre-back and captain Daniel Passarella, the diminutive midfield playmaker Osvaldo Ardiles, and the prolific centre-forward Mario Kempes. That, to a certain extent, was enough as they battled through the first group stage, opened up in the second group stage, then edged a memorable final with a 3-1 extra-time win over the Netherlands.

The tall, thin, long-haired Cesar Luis Menotti was only 39 and most famous for smoking his way through the tournament. He was a fascinating figure, a committed left-wing philosopher in charge during a period of right-wing military dictatorship. He distanced himself from power while also acknowledging the need to stay on decent terms with the regime.

He abhorred the defensive mindset that had dominated Argentine football in the previous decade and was determined to create something which would create a connection between the national side and the public. “His great virtue was to give the players a lot of freedom,” said Kempes. “The player had to handle the three or four tasks he assigned you, but beyond that, players had full freedom to do what they would usually do for their own club.”

The 1970s had seen a mass exodus of Argentina's star players abroad, particularly to Spain, where a ban on foreign players had recently been lifted. But Menotti was keen to gather his players together for lengthy training camps ahead of the tournament, and this simply wasn't possible with the differences in European and South American football calendars.

So not only did Menotti convince the country's football association to ban players under 25 from playing abroad, he initially committed to selecting only three overseas-based players for his squad, then eventually plumped for only one, Kempes. In the lead-up to the tournament, Argentina had played a series of friendlies without him, since Valencia refused to release him.

But in the end, Menotti's decisions proved successful: both in terms of building a team of relatively modest, domestic-based players, and also providing an exemption for the man who would be the tournament's star. A legendary figure perhaps based more upon his philosophy rather than his success, he died last year at the age of 85, just one year after standing down from a position as a director for the Argentine national side.

In hindsight, Kempes — El Matador — was always destined to be the star of the tournament, having won the top goalscorer award in Spain in the two seasons leading up to the competition. But Kempes had failed to score at the World Cup four years earlier, and started this tournament slowly. He was admonished in an awkward one-on-one interview by the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano for playing too high up the pitch against the man-marking Italians rather than dropping deep.

But Kempes exploded into life in the second group stage, scoring twice against both Poland and Peru, before recording his third brace of the tournament in the final against the Netherlands. He also created the other goal for Daniel Bertoni. He won the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, as well as the Golden Ball as best player. Curiously, his goals in the final were his last for Argentina, at the age of just 23 — four years later at World Cup 1982, he again failed to find the target.

Menotti insisted on open, free-flowing attacking football; more in keeping with the spirit of Brazil and Dutch sides of the 1970s than Argentine sides of the past, who had earned a reputation for being defensive-minded and, above all else, extremely aggressive. The side's most striking feature, according to most reports from the time, was therefore their relative lack of brutality.

Their defenders were all better going forward than stopping opponents, with the full-backs committed to overlapping. Even Passarella seemed to switch off regularly, but would suddenly push forward to provide an attacking threat, particularly with powerful left-footed free kicks, although he also had two good chances from open play in the final.

Argentina were more flexible than previous World Cup-winning sides, who tended to have a default shape and only altered it if they felt a particular opponent needed marking. This Argentina varied the positions of their attackers more. Kempes, for example, played particularly deep in a goalless draw with Brazil in the second group phase, perhaps having remembered the criticism from Di Stefano. His role in this tournament was unusual: at various points he felt like a No 9, a No 10 and a midfielder and, while humble away from the pitch, he was quite a straightforward attacker, playing for himself rather than his team-mates even if his average position suggests he was a link man.



At times, the midfield seemed pedestrian and lacking invention, with the obvious exception of Ardiles: a lovely quick dribbler, most obviously when he created a Kempes goal against Poland. They boasted two speedy wingers: Oscar Ortiz was particularly nippy down the left, Bertoni was highly energetic down the right, and Leopoldo Luque was a good foil for Kempes, scoring a spectacular long-range strike against France.

Like the Dutch side who had finished runners-up four years earlier, Argentina's shirt numbers at the tournament were not based around position, but were assigned alphabetically. So when substitute Norberto Alonso popped up for the winner in the opening 2-1 victory over Hungary, there was the somewhat egregious sight of him celebrating over on the far side with the No 1 on his back.

Goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol wore No 5, while Kempes was, mercifully, No 10. They had the same policy four years later, although one man was allowed an exception: Diego Maradona should have been No 12, but insisted on No 10, which bumped Kempes up to No 11.

The Dutch had been amongst the strongest objectors to this tournament being held in Argentina, and had toyed with boycotting the World Cup entirely. Maybe that contributed to Argentine gamesmanship for the final: demanding the Israeli referee was replaced because of his country's diplomatic ties with the Netherlands, sending the Dutch team bus on an unnecessarily lengthy route to the Estadio Monumental, leaving the Dutch side waiting on the pitch for five minutes before coming out to an almighty roar, and then objecting to Rene van der Kerkhof playing with a light cast around his arm, which had been the case throughout the tournament.

Once most of the ticker tape had been cleared from the pitch, and the game finally started, all this seemed to have rattled the Netherlands, who played an unusually physical brand of football, perhaps a precursor to their infamous 2010 final display against Spain.

Tactically, the most notable feature of the final was how regularly the two goalkeepers found themselves in bizarre positions, rushing out to close down attackers in wide areas. The goals were regularly left unguarded because the goalkeepers seemed overly concerned with narrowing the angle of players who, in modern terms, were merely in cut-back positions. But when the two goalkeepers were wearing the shirt numbers five and eight, maybe that was to be expected.

After Kempes opened the scoring with a clever sliding finish past the advancing Jan Jongbloed, Argentine goalkeeper Fillol was caught too wide for Dick Nanninga's headed equaliser, and was similarly too far out when Dutch forward Rob Rensenbrink prodded against the post in stoppage time.

For all the talk about the Dutch coming close in 1974, they came even closer — with a less spectacular side — in 1978.

Two decisive moments, really. Kempes scored his second on the stroke of half-time in extra time, bundling his way past two Dutch defenders and goalkeeper Jongbloed before scrappily turning home a shot that deflected in off Wim Suurbier. It was technically an own goal, although no one felt right taking it away from Kempes.

With the Dutch chasing the game, the Argentines' main quality — their commitment to forward running — proved crucial on the break and they had a few chances to seal the game. Eventually, they did so with an even scrappier goal. Bertoni played the ball to Kempes in midfield, he dribbled forward, and then his return pass bounced off Bertoni's knee, then off Kempes' chest, then back off Bertoni and fell nicely for him to tuck the ball home. You can forgive Jongbloed for being bamboozled by the pinball nature of the move, but again he ended up in an odd position. In fact, you can question the goalkeepers' position for all four goals in the final.

The New York Times' Alex Yannis seemed unimpressed by the spectacle. “The Argentines spent most of the overtime on the ground, contending that they had been fouled and pleading with the Italian referee to call fouls,” he wrote. “They apparently forgot the main issue — a soccer game that was watched by about a billion people round the world.”

It was generally acknowledged that this was a World Cup without a genuinely outstanding team, after Brazil in 1970 and the Netherlands in 1974 had captured the world's imagination with forward-thinking football. In fact, there was a feeling that world football lacked not merely great teams, but great players. The holder of the Ballon d'Or — at the time only open to European players — was the Dane Allan Simonsen, perhaps the most obscure winner of the award.

It must also be added that Argentina benefited from various instances of good fortune: being hosts, some favourable refereeing decisions in a group-stage win over France, and the fact they knew what result they needed in their last second-round match, because Brazil had played earlier in the day. That game, a 6-0 win over Peru, was later the subject of an extensive investigation published by the Sunday Times that suggested the game had been fixed.

But who else was there? Brazil had lost the flair and spirit that had taken them to previous success. The Dutch were without Johan Cruyff and more functional than four years beforehand. France looked decent but exited, somewhat unfortunately, in the first group stage.

“Argentina won the World Cup because they deserved to,” wrote World Soccer's Eric Batty, always reluctant to dish out praise. “They showed everyone how the game should be played, with clever players going forward all the time — never mind about marking the opposition stars.”

Enzo Maresca has needed a moment like this at Stamford Bridge to truly form a bond with Chelsea supporters.

Beating defending champions Liverpool with a late winner never does any harm to a head coach's chances of winning over a critical fanbase, but by going on a dash down the touchline to celebrate with his players, and being sent off for it after being awarded a second yellow card, Maresca has made his biggest breakthrough yet.

Maresca has struggled to connect with Chelsea fans since he was hired in June last year. His CV, compared to the successful managers Chelsea used to hire, such as Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel, was underwhelming — just 14 games at Parma and one full season at Leicester City in the Championship.

The main highlights on the reel from his first campaign all took place away from home: the victory over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on the final day of the season to qualify for the Champions League via a top-five finish; the Europa Conference League final triumph, the first trophy of the Todd Boehly-Clearlake era, in Wroclaw, Poland; and his tactical masterclass in the FIFA Club World Cup final in New York's sweltering July heat.

This is not to say Maresca has had nothing to enjoy up until now at Stamford Bridge. There were two significant victories over Liverpool and Manchester United in successive home league games in May, which played a major role in the club being able to secure fourth place.

However, these triumphs came with a caveat. Liverpool had just clinched the title and played like a team that had made the most of the celebrations. Defeating Manchester United is never a bad thing, but they were putting the finishing touches on the worst Premier League season in their history, finishing 15th with 42 points.

So what occurred on Saturday felt like a real housewarming. A week earlier, Maresca and his players were booed off the pitch after Brighton & Hove Albion had made the most of the rather generous hospitality provided by their hosts to win 3-1. In contrast, everyone in the stands was in party mood come the final whistle against Liverpool.

Unlike five months earlier, Chelsea faced a Liverpool side hungry for the three points. The visitors had club-record signing Alexander Isak leading the line, with summer purchases Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike coming off the bench.

Meanwhile, Chelsea could not have been much weaker, especially defensively. Four centre-backs were ruled out through suspension and injury. Benoit Badiashile was starting his first Premier League game in seven months due to the injury issues he has suffered. Next to him was 19-year-old academy graduate Josh Acheampong, making just the fourth Premier League start of his career.

Neither finished the game due to suffering some kind of niggle, which left Maresca having to move right-back Reece James inside. Initially, the England international was beside Acheampong, but after the teenager had to be substituted, he was operating next to 19-year-old summer buy Jorrel Hato. Meanwhile, Chelsea's best attacking player, Cole Palmer, was watching from the stands due to an ongoing groin problem.

To win under these circumstances was extraordinary, but crucially, Maresca did not play it safe or react negatively. His changes after going down to 10 men in the recent losses to Manchester United and Brighton had caused frustration among Chelsea fans. All the good work to win over the doubters after the strong end to last season was in danger of being undone.

Funnily enough, Maresca probably would have been forgiven for being cautious this time. Drawing 1-1 against a fine side like Liverpool with such a makeshift back line would have still been a positive return. Instead, he went on the attack, bringing on Estevao Willian, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu with 15 minutes remaining. And he was rewarded for it.

But what will arguably carry more favour than the crucial three points is that Maresca allowed his guarded mask to slip. His stoic demeanour in the majority of press conferences has not won the hearts of many tuning in. There has been the odd flash of charisma, but more often than not, his delivery has been like some of his tactics: too cautious.

Due to the significance of the occasion, Maresca could not control himself. He was a bundle of nervous energy in his technical area, barely sitting down over the 90 minutes. He was booked in the first half for his reaction to Anthony Taylor's refusal to award a penalty and remonstrated with Xavi Valero seconds later after seeing the Liverpool goalkeeping coach talking to the fourth official.

This was Maresca standing up for his side, and the crowd responded to his passion as much as the team's willingness to fight against adversity. By running to join in the celebrations of his players following Estevao's neat winner, screaming as he did so, Maresca showed the fans that he cares just as much as they do. It was not forced or contrived. This was raw emotion and the images of the moment will benefit him more than the best public relations exercise money can buy. It was reminiscent of Mourinho's own touchline celebrations in 2004 when his Porto side drew at Old Trafford in the Champions League to send them through — and that comparison will also do him no harm.

Naturally, Maresca has to build on this. It cannot be a one-off. Assistant coach Willy Caballero, who had to do the media duties because of Maresca's dismissal, feels it can be a starting point to making playing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge a more intimidating prospect.

He said: “I believe Enzo has a good connection, a good relationship with the supporters. But any victory in the last second, any victory against Liverpool, Arsenal, big teams, strong teams, can give you a little bit more.

“In the last 30 minutes, the whole crowd, the whole supporters, were pushing, were living the game. And that's what we want to create, that environment that is nasty for the away team and gives you a little bit more legs or wings to run in the last couple of minutes. So, hopefully, we can create this environment for more games.”

A coalition of community organizations and documentary filmmaker Billy Corben on Thursday called again on FIFA and Miami-Dade to use their influence to protect soccer fans from federal immigration agents roaming stadiums during next year's World Cup tournament.


At a demonstration in front of FIFA's Coral Gables office, they pressured officials to protect World Cup attendees from "overzealous immigration enforcement" and to reinvest Miami-Dade County tax dollars set aside for the World Cup into the local community. They held a similar protest in June.


"Miami-Dade is a proud county of immigrants, and we are subsidizing the World Cup with over $60 million in public cash and resources," Corben said during Thursday's press conference. "In a year in which we suffered a $400 million budget deficit, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is failing us all."

The activists say their fears about immigration agents are warranted, citing last week's New York Times report that revealed "FIFA was alerted to 145 human rights concerns at Club World Cup games, including federal policies and enforcement."


The Times reported there were complaints of alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at stadiums during the tournament.

"We unequivocally believe that any human rights plan that does not include protections for fans who are immigrants living in the United States or visiting the country is incomplete, and we urge the Miami Host Committee to commit to no immigration enforcement in or near the stadiums during the games," the activists said in a statement announcing Thursday protest.

They warn that the stakes are too high in a state with an aggressive posture toward immigration.


"The potential for due process abuses, racial profiling, and for fans to lose their liberties and freedoms is far too great," they said, noting that the backdrop in Florida "includes the reopening of the Everglades [Alligator Alcatraz] facility and news of a Mexican national on a tourist visa who was detained and deported."


"The Trump Administration's recent immigration policies have affected both staff and fans," they said. "The time for FIFA to act is now."


Since the first protest on June 30, activists said an official of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee contacted them, according to Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, Policy Coordinator with American Friends Service Committee. She said no meeting date with FIFA has been set.


"This is an international game. They need to meet with people who deal with immigrants," Mendez-Zamora told WLRN.


She added: "I want to be in the stadium with my family screaming, but it's not worth it if it means people are going to be taken [into federal custody]."


Amy Morales, director of advocacy and policy for Engage Miami, said community nonprofits had to fight for full funding before county commissioners at the same time the World Cup was getting $46 million in subsidies from the county.


"What we're saying here today is that we do not want our taxpayer dollars funding the separation of families — funding deportations," Morales said to WLRN.

Luna Plaza, a migrant justice committee member of the Florida Student Power Network attended both protests. The University of Miami student said she was disappointed activists were not able to speak with FIFA after the first demonstration but hopes that the second one will prompt a meeting.

 "Sports, in general, shapes all of our lives," Plaza told WLRN. "It's really saddening to hear that so many safe spaces are being taken away for undocumented folks — including sports. It's just really messed up."  Copyright 2025 WLRN

Liverpool have now lost three matches in a row for the first time under Arne Slot after they succumbed to a 2-1 loss at Chelsea on Saturday evening, ensuring they will go into the October international break only second in the Premier League table. The reigning champions of England can't have many complaints about the result either, with the Club World Cup winners outlasting them and striking at the death to settle the contest.

What proved to be a manic contest began with a contender for goal of the season. Moises Caicedo, famously of Liverpool interest before his £115m move to Chelsea in 2023, was given the freedom of Stamford Bridge by a retreating Reds backline and essentially non-existent midfield as he approached the penalty area. He didn't need a second invitation to pick out the top corner of Giorgi Mamardashvili's net.

Arne Slot had the luxury of throwing on £117m man Florian Wirtz at half-time, and that seemed to kick Liverpool into gear. They found an equaliser when Dominik Szoboszlai's cross looped up into the path of Alexander Isak, the most expensive man on the pitch at a measly £125m, and his touch fell for Cody Gakpo to fire home. From there, both sides committed to finding a winner, but there could only be one and it turned out to be Chelsea.

Having forced Mamardashvili into a few saves leading into stoppage time, the Blues regrouped and launched one final attack, with Marc Cucurella getting to the last line and cutting the ball right through the six-yard box for Estevao Willian to convert. Just like that, the three points belonged to Chelsea and Liverpool were heading home empty-handed from a game that was in their control.

 Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard secured a pair of significant breakthroughs in one swoop on Sunday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. 

 The Frenchman upset World No. 4 Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-5 to seal the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking. With his one-hour, 25-minute victory inside the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, one which avenged his painful loss to Fritz from two sets up at Wimbledon earlier this year, Mpetshi Perricard also booked his spot in the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time.

 Although Perricard secured his win in straight sets, humid conditions in Shanghai made Sunday's encounter a big physical test for both players. It was the Frenchman's ability to capitalise at key moments, particularly as Fritz tired towards the end of the match, that proved crucial. 

 Mpetshi Perricard broke his opponent's serve in a dramatic 11th game of the second set in which Fritz let slip a 30/0 lead and struggled to put away winners in the slow conditions. The World No. 37 then served out successfully to wrap a victory in which he fired 12 aces and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. 

 “Before this my record was not good, 0-6 [against Top 10 players],” said Mpetshi Perricard. “Some of the matches were tough losses for me. I was very close against [Lorenzo] Musetti, against [Fritz] at Wimbledon, and I had a lot of things to improve. I tried to do a few things better than at Wimbledon, and it worked today. 

 “It was a tough match, physically and mentally, but I did well and I'm very happy about it.”

 While third-round defeat in Shanghai is a setback in Fritz's bid to secure qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals, the American remains well placed to reach the season finale. He is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 450 points clear of Musetti in the final qualification spot. 

 Mpetshi Perricard's next opponent will be another Turin hopeful, Holger Rune, who also enjoyed a Sunday success in Shanghai. The 10th-seeded Dane survived the tricky conditions to sink Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-4 to reach the fourth round for the second consecutive year. 

 With his victory, the 22-year-old Rune earned five tour-level wins against the same opponent for the first time in his career. He leads Humbert 5-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with two of those triumphs coming in 2025 (Indian Wells, Shanghai).

 “We are both Europeans, so we're not quite used to this kind of weather, but I just told myself it's the same for him and I'm just going to try to stay strong,” said Rune when asked about the Shanghai humidity. “Focus on my serve. Push when it matters, when it matters less, try to save some energy. 

 "I think I had a good balance today of playing aggressive and making him work at the same time, making him run because we both feel when we run in this kind of weather, it's more tough. So, very sweaty day, but very happy to get through. No more excuses." 

 In other early Sunday matches, Gabriel Diallo and Zizou Bergs also advanced. Diallo advanced after his opponent David Goffin retired when trailing 0-3 in the first set. The Canadian's next opponent will be Bergs, who overcame 19th seed Francisco Cerundolo 7-6(1), 6-3.

Playing each other for the first time, things were neck-and-neck early on in both sets before Auger-Aliassime caught fire just at the right times—he won four games in a row from 2-3 to pocket the first set, then three games in a row from 3-all to take the second set and the match.At the end of the day the Canadian was just too solid on the stats sheet, finishing with 29 winners to 26 unforced errors. The Chilean, meanwhile, had 11 winners to 18 unforced errors in the match.And break points were key, too, with Auger-Aliassime converting three of his five opportunities, while Tabilo went zero-for-seven.Auger-Aliassime is now 9-2 in his last three events, having reached the quarterfinals of Cincinnati and the semifinals of the US Open in his last two events of the summer. He was stopped by Sinner both times.Awaiting the No. 12-seeded Canadian in the third round will be Jesper de Jong, who upset No. 17-seeded Jakub Mensik, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4.

McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

Hamilton: ‘At then end I was catching Kimi and then the brakes gave up'

He didn't win the race. He didn't even make the podium. But he rightfully got your vote after an evening of never-say-die motor racing...

He may be the most experienced man on the grid, but it's no secret how much Fernando Alonso still relishes his racing. Nowhere was that clearer than on the streets of Singapore, where a typically feisty drive from the Spaniard saw him convert 10th on the grid into seventh at the flag - despite a botched pit stop that saw his Aston Martin stationary for over nine seconds. Here's how the voting broke down…

Fernando Alonso - 22.5%
George Russell - 16.4%
Max Verstappen - 14.5%
Lando Norris - 8.7%
Lewis Hamilton - 7.6%

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

McLaren could not match the pace of Mercedes' George Russell in Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with Oscar Piastri taking third while Lando Norris ended the session in fifth.

Oscar Piastri admitted that he was surprised to see the Mercedes of George Russell outpace McLaren to take pole position in Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with the Australian having to settle for third while team mate Lando Norris was fifth on a day where he said the squad “weren't quick enough”.

In a busy end to the session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Russell claimed provisional pole before going even faster to seal the position on the final runs, his lap of 1m 29.158s putting him 0.182s clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Piastri, meanwhile, was nearly four-tenths off Russell's time in third. When asked after Qualifying if he felt that the result was the most he could have gotten out of the session, the 24-year-old responded: “More or less. I think there was a little bit left in it but not enough for pole.

“Ultimately I thought it was a pretty good session. It's just been a pretty good weekend – very solid, no major hiccups or anything like that. I think ultimately we just didn't quite have the pace, so we'll try and see what we can do tomorrow.”

Pushed on whether it had been a surprise to see a Mercedes ahead in pole position – with Verstappen also in front – Piastri added: “It was a surprise, yeah. I think the start of Qualifying we seemed pretty good, and then everyone else just seemed to find a lot of time and we didn't really.

“That was a bit of a surprise , but it's been a little bit weird this weekend. The tyres have been pretty tricky to switch on.

“I think a few things changed from yesterday to today with the track and everyone's just been pretty close, and anyone that nails it has been towards the front. So just one of those kinds of weekends, but third's still not a bad result.”

On the other side of the garage, Norris conceded that he had felt more comfortable at the wheel of the MCL39 than during Friday's running, but acknowledged that the squad were ultimately lacking pace in comparison to their competitors.

“I felt happier with the car today,” the Briton explained following his P5 result. “[It's] just we weren't quick enough, clearly. The Mercedes are much, much faster, and I'm sure between Oscar's and my lap is a tenth in it or something, or maybe a little bit more, but not the four that that we need or the three and a half that we need.

“It is what it is, but still I just didn't put it all together and you need to do that on a track like today, but I just didn't.”

In terms of whether having a better feeling in the car gives him an additional sense of confidence for Sunday's race, Norris answered: “Not really. This track's kind of where you qualify is more than likely where you're going to finish, but there are still chances so we'll have to wait and see.”

McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

Hamilton: ‘At then end I was catching Kimi and then the brakes gave up'

Williams received some bad news after Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with both Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz being disqualified.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have both been disqualified from Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix due to technical breaches on their Williams cars.

Albon and Sainz placed 12th and 13th in Saturday night's session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit but will lose those results after the team failed post-Qualifying checks.

“The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked on car numbers 23 (Albon) and 55 (Sainz),” read a note from FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer. “Both cars exceeded the maximum limit of 85mm on both sides of the rear wing outer area.”

This violates Article 3.10.10 g. of the Technical Regulations, which covers the Drag Reduction System (DRS) and states that “at all points along the span, when the DRS is in the state of deployment, the two sections the rear wing profiles must have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 85mm”.

As is standard procedure with such a scenario, the stewards later confirmed that Albon and Sainz had been disqualified from Qualifying.

“During post-Qualifying scrutineering, the rear wing of the car was found to be non-compliant with the Technical Regulations,” read the stewards' notes for Albon and Sainz's disqualifications.

“The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked. The DRS in the state of deployment exceeded the maximum limit of 85mm on both sides of the rear wing outer area.

“At the hearing, the competitor admitted that, although their own measurement prior to the Qualifying had shown the component to be within tolerance, the measurement subsequently conducted by the appointed FIA officials revealed a larger gap than permitted and therefore the rear wing did not conform with the required dimension.

“The competitor did not contest the measurement procedure, the methodology, or the accuracy of the measuring equipment used by FIA. The competitor fully accepted the results of the FIA measurement and acknowledged that the rear wing fitted to the car did not comply with the requirements of the Technical Regulations.

“Accordingly, the standard penalty applicable to technical infringements is imposed.”

Following the confirmation of the disqualification, Williams Team Principal James Vowles issued a statement saying: "During FIA scrutineering after Qualifying, the rear wings on both our cars failed DRS slot gap checks. As a result, Alex and Carlos have been disqualified from Qualifying for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix.

"This is bitterly disappointing for the team and we are urgently investigating how this happened. At no point were we seeking a performance advantage and the rear wings had passed our own checks earlier in the day, but there is only one measurement that matters and we fully accept the FIA ruling.

"We have a car capable of scoring points here this weekend and will do everything we can to fight from the back of the grid tomorrow, and will immediately review our processes to make sure this doesn't happen again."

The Williams double disqualification comes after Esteban Ocon was also disqualified from Qualifying at the previous round in Azerbaijan, with the rear wing on his Haas failing post-session checks.

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

Max Verstappen had to settle for second between George Russell and Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen shared mixed feelings after a hard-fought run to second position in Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix, having “struggled a lot” behind the wheel of his Red Bull throughout the race.

Red Bull headed to the high-downforce Marina Bay Street Circuit aiming to validate the apparent progress they have made with their RB21, following back-to-back wins for Verstappen in low-downforce conditions at Monza and Baku.

While Verstappen's run to second in Qualifying and the Grand Prix continued that positive trend, the reigning four-time World Champion was made to work harder than he wanted to inside the cockpit.

Verstappen was heard complaining about shift problems in particular, at one stage describing his car as “undriveable” after locking up and narrowly avoiding the barriers at Turn 14, but he survived to come home between George Russell's Mercedes and Lando Norris' McLaren.

“It was a bit more difficult than I would have hoped for, to be honest,” Verstappen reflected afterwards. “For whatever reason in the race I was struggling a lot with the downshifts and upshifts of the car. It was giving me a lot of pushing under braking, which on a street circuit you don't want!

“The car was also not where I wanted it to be, unfortunately. A few things of course to learn from that, I think, from some decisions that we made throughout the weekend in terms of the set-up.

“We didn't do a proper long run [during practice], so that doesn't help. But it's not like it's a mystery why it didn't go so well in the race, so we just need to analyse that.”

Nonetheless, Verstappen added: “Even if the balance would have been perfect, I think second was still the best possible, because you can't pass around here. As you could see, I think for more than an hour I had Lando behind me, and I think he was clearly faster, but you can't pass.

“Of course, we went for a different strategy at the start with the soft [tyre], knowing that the left-hand side grid was very dirty, which we measured over the weekend. We had to take a risk. For me, that first stint was all about just managing to go long enough.”

As for how much encouragement can be taken from the weekend, given that he finished ahead of both McLaren drivers once again despite the higher downforce track characteristics, Verstappen maintained a cautious tone.

“We were more competitive, but I think it's still not our favourite layout, let's say it like that,” the Dutchman commented. “[But] maybe some other tracks will come to us a bit more, so we just have to see it race by race.”

Verstappen's latest result has seen him make further progress in the Drivers' Championship, moving to within 41 points of Norris and 63 points of championship leader Oscar Piastri.

McLaren's journey to the 2025 Constructors' Championship

Hamilton: ‘At then end I was catching Kimi and then the brakes gave up'

It was a dramatic start to the Singapore Grand Prix, with McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri banging wheels.

McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have shared their initial reactions after dramatically banging wheels on the first lap of Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix.

While Mercedes' George Russell and Red Bull's Max Verstappen maintained P1 and P2 through the opening sequence of corners, there was drama behind when a fast-starting Norris boldly attacked Piastri.

Norris went so deep at Turn 3 that he tagged the back of Verstappen's car, before making contact with Piastri's sister McLaren and emerging in third position – much to his team mate's frustration.

“Yeah, I mean that wasn't very teamlike, but sure,” Piastri commented over the radio, before adding: “So, are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way?”

After the race, which Norris and Piastri finished in third and fourth respectively, both the Briton and the Australian gave their version of events when speaking to the media.

“I mean it was slippery, it was still wet in a lot of places,” said Norris of the start and incident that followed. “It's racing. I put it on the inside, I had a small correction, but nothing more than that. It was good racing.”

Piastri was reluctant to offer much more following his radio comments, simply saying: “I need to go and look at it. Obviously there was contact, which is never ideal, but I'll go and have a look at the replays.”

That contact aside, it was a momentous day for McLaren thanks to Norris and Piastri's combined points haul securing back-to-back Teams' Championships – the first time the squad have achieved that feat since the early-1990s.

“I'm obviously very proud of the whole team,” added Piastri. “This is one of the two objectives we set out to achieve every year, so to achieve it with this many races to go is very, very impressive.”

“I gave it my all today,” added Norris, having just fallen short of overhauling Verstappen for second. “I got close, a few chances where we were side-by-side, and some good little bits of battling, but it's just too difficult to overtake.

“It's a shame, because the pace was very strong today, and I would have loved to try and catch George and give him a little bit more pressure.

“I'm happy with today. I got forward two positions, we won as a team the Constructors' once again, so I'm most happy about that.”

F1 will now roll on to Austin for the United States Grand Prix, with Piastri leading Norris by a reduced margin of 22 points in the Drivers' Championship, and Verstappen cutting his deficit to 63 points.

Plus: Doja Cat, Young Thug, Mariah Carey, Olivia Dean and P1Harmony debut in the top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack returns to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 11), slaying its second week atop the list, with 102,000 equivalent album units earned (down 2%) in the United States in the week ending Oct. 2, according to Luminate. The companion set to the smash Netflix animated film first reached No. 1 on the Sept. 20-dated list and has been locked inside the top two for the last 10 weeks in a row.

	











	Five albums debut inside the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, led by Doja Cat's Vie at No. 4. Also arriving in the region: Young Thug's UY SCUTI at No. 6, Mariah Carey's Here for It All at No. 7, Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving at No. 8 and P1Harmony's EX at No. 9. The five debuts in the top 10 are the most since the July 26 chart, when there were also five debuts.


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Oct. 11, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Oct. 7. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of KPop Demon Hunters' 102,000 equivalent album units earned in the latest tracking week, SEA units comprise 84,000 (down 9%, equaling 117.48 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks; it holds at No. 2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 16,000 (up 56%; it rises 7-4 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 2,000 (down 13%).


Morgan Wallen's chart-topping I'm the Problem rises 3-2 on the Billboard 200 (88,000 equivalent album units earned, down 2%) and Cardi B's AM I THE DRAMA? falls 1-3 in its second week (83,000, down 58%).


	Doja Cat captures her fourth top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as her latest studio project, Vie, debuts at No. 4 with 57,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 31,000 (equaling 40.62 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 10 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 26,000 (her best sales week ever; it debuts at No. 3 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	The set's first-week sales were aided by the album's availability across eight vinyl variants (one signed), two CD editions (one signed), a deluxe CD boxed set (containing a signed CD and a branded T-shirt), standard and deluxe iTunes download editions, and a cassette.


Vie was preceded by the Billboard Hot 100 hit “Jealous Type,” which debuted and peaked at No. 28 on the Sept. 6-dated chart.


	Sabrina Carpenter's former No. 1 Man's Best Friend falls 4-5 with 57,000 equivalent album units (down 18%).


	Young Thug logs his ninth top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as UY SCUTI starts at No. 6 with 52,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 39,000 (equaling 54.3 million on-demand official streams of the songs on the album; it debuts at No. 5 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 13,000 (it debuts at No. 6 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.

	











UY SCUTI was issued in a range of iterations: an eight-song widely available download edition, 12-track CD and vinyl variations (all of the physical versions were exclusively sold in the artist's official webstore) and two widely available download/streaming versions with 20 and 21 tracks, respectively. During release week, there were five additional digital versions that dropped that adding assorted bonus material. The artist also had a range of deluxe boxed sets available that contained a copy of the CD and branded clothing.


UY SCUTI was preceded by the Hot 100 hit “Money on Money” (featuring Future), which debuted and peaked at No. 39 on the May 10 chart.


	Mariah Carey achieves her 19th top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as Here for It All bows at No. 7. Carey becomes only the third woman with at least one new top 10-charted album in the 1990s, 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s, following Madonna and Shania Twain.


Here for It All launches with 47,000 equivalent album units earned in its first week. Of that sum, album sales comprise a little more than 39,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise slightly more than 7,000 (equaling 9.53 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise less than 1,000. The album's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across four CD variants (one signed), four vinyl editions (one signed), two cassettes, and a deluxe digital download album with a bonus track.


Here for It All was preceded by the single “Type Dangerous,” which reached No. 95 on the Hot 100 (marking Carey's 50th entry) and No. 25 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.


	Further, with a 19th top 10-charted album on the Billboard 200, Carey solely has the third-most top 10s among women in the history of the chart (since it began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956). She was previously tied with Taylor Swift, with 18. Ahead of them among women are only Barbra Streisand (34) and Madonna (23).

	











	English singer-songwriter Olivia Dean makes her Billboard 200 debut with her second studio effort, The Art of Loving, which arrives at No. 8 with 43,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 32,000 (equaling 40.49 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks; it debuts at No. 8 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 11,000 (it debuts at No. 7 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	The set was available in standard download and streaming editions, a standard CD, a CD variant in premium packaging, and seven vinyl variants (one signed).


The Art of Loving was preceded by the surging hit “Man I Need,” which has hit the top 10 on Streaming Songs (rising 14-8 on the Oct. 4 chart) and climbed the Hot 100 (rising 30-25 on the Oct. 4 list).


	Closing out the debuts in the top 10 on the latest Billboard 200 is P1Harmony's EX, which begins at No. 9 with 40,000 equivalent album units earned, marking the first top 10 for the group. Of the 40,000 units earned, album sales comprise just under 39,000 (the best sales week for the act; it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 1,000 (equaling 2.06 million on-demand streams of the tracks on the project) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. There are five tracks on the effort: four different songs, plus a Spanish version of one of the songs.


EX's first-week sales were enhanced by its availability across 17 CD variants and six vinyl variants, all containing collectible items inside the packaging, some randomized.


	Lastly, Bad Bunny's former No. 1 DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS holds at No. 10 (39,000, up 25%).

	That's the power of word of mouth.

	In Europe, the Leonardo DiCaprio-starrer was the No. 1 film for the region for the 2nd weekend in a row with an outstanding -19% hold. Turkey debuted this weekend at No. 1.  


	For Latin America, the film had just a 23% drop; OBAA is already PTA's biggest film in 13 markets in the region.


	The IMAX running cume for overseas is now $5.4M.


	Up ahead, China will be the last market to open, on October 17.


	Meanwhile, Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl is forecast at $13M for the weekend in 54 offshore markets. This puts the estimated weekend global box office at $46M.


	The event “non-film” is only playing this weekend. It's released by AMC Theatres Distribution in partnership with Variance Films in the U.S. & Canada, and in partnership with Piece of Magic Entertainment internationally. We are hopeful for more clarity on overseas numbers tomorrow.

	











	Turning back to studio releases, New Line/Warner Bros' The Conjuring: Last Rites added an estimated $9.3M this weekend in 76 markets. The international running cume is now $290.4M and the global total is $458.2M through Sunday.


	Moving up to the No. 6 spot globally for 2025 so far, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle has now grossed $633M. Per Sony, that includes Japan and select other Asian markets. For Crunchyroll/Sony markets it equates to $324.6M. The latter added $10.2M this weekend, including $6.7M overseas from 62 offshore hubs.


	The Top 5 CR/Sony markets to date are: Mexico ($17.4M), Germany ($14.4M), France ($14.2M), India ($9.3M) and UK ($8.9M).


	And, in anticipation of James Cameron's next Na'vi movie, Disney re-released Avatar: The Way of Water to $6.8M overseas and $10M global. Avatar: Fire and Ash goes in December and there was a sneak peek on the current limited engagement for the latest title.


	This additional release overseas makes Avatar: The Way of Water the second highest grossing film of all time in Australia, behind only Avatar, and surpasses Star Wars: The Force Awakens.


	Additionally, in New Zealand, Avatar: The Way of Water is the first film to ever cross NZ$ 20M.


	The re-issue was No. 1 in Thailand (non-local), Indonesia (non-local), Vietnam (non-local), Bulgaria and Romania.


	The Top 5 for the return to Pandora are: France ($800K), Germany ($500K), China ($400K), Mexico ($400K) and UK ($400K).

In the months since Saturday Night Live wrapped its 50th season on NBC in May, CBS had its primary late night show cancelled and ABC had its own put on a week-long hiatus. Both of these are widely assumed to be because of their hosts' (Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, respectively) criticisms of President of the United States Donald Trump. (There really isn't even room for guesswork about whether the government was involved with Kimmel's case, but we digress.) Given that SNL has mocked Trump basically as long as he's been a public figure, it was going to be a source of interest to see how the show reacted to this current paradigm. 

The answer—as it has been for much of Trump 2.0—was to get meta. The season 51 premiere opened with Colin Jost as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (sure) lecturing the generals at Quantico about being less fat and gay, much like the real Hegseth did this week. After a couple minutes of this, James Austin Johnson's Trump interrupts to declare late-night TV to be the greatest threat to democracy currently facing our country. Trump makes some jabs about keeping an eye on the show to make sure it's not too mean to him and at Jost for not being at the Riyadh Comedy Festival (he wasn't invited, he mumbles from his frozen tableau). Mikey Day shows up as a dancing FCC head Brendan Carr, Trump asks ICE to keep an eye on cast member Marcello Hernandez and promises to keep scamming people, and then it's live from New York. 



The real Trump hasn't acknowledged the sketch as of this writing. (This morning, he posted on Truth Social, “It will be a big day with the Navy” and then, an hour later, he was railing against Fox News for being too “politically correct!”) While SNL has really leaned into this kind of fourth-wall-breaking set up for much of the second Trump administration, they don't seem to have bothered him as much as Alec Baldwin's impersonation did the first time around. In 2019, he threatened SNL and other late night shows with a FCC investigation. He's really committed to that strategy this time around, even if, so far, “hit both sides equally” Jimmy Fallon has gotten strangely more heat.

Five years after Alicia Witt last appeared in a Hallmark movie — 2020's “Christmas Tree Lane” — fans continue to ask her when and if she'll return to the network. 

On October 3, 2025, the singer and actress provided an update in the comment section of her latest social media post while promoting her upcoming holiday concert tour. 

A post shared by alicia witt (@aliciawitty)

Witt appeared in multiple Hallmark Christmas movies from 2014 to 2020, per IMDb. She has since navigated major personal hurdles, including fighting breast cancer and the tragic death of her parents.  But Witt has also focused her energy on her music career and feature film work, including the 2024 hit indie thriller “Longlegs” co-starring Nicolas Cage. 

When numerous fans asked in the comment section of her latest post about her status with Hallmark, Witt replied to one of them that the primary reason for her absence was leadership changes at the network. 

 “I'm SO grateful for the movies i made for them,” Witt wrote, “especially since so many of you found my music this way ❤️ since the leadership at Hallmark changed over 5 years ago, i stopped getting offered movies there, along with some other ‘regulars.'”

Witt continued, “and then i started getting a lot of work in feature films 🙂 you know what they say about god opening a window when a door closes 🌠 i have 4 theatrical movies coming out at this time – after having made Longlegs last year.” 

“But I remain most open to making another christmas movie in the future if they were to offer me one (and @hallmarkchannel knows this). but please know it was never my choice to stop making them  🙃 hope to see you at one of the shows on my christmas tour!!”

Hallmark Media has gone through multiple leadership changes since Witt was last on the network. Hallmark severed ties with former CEO Bill Abbott in early 2020, and beloved programming executive Michelle Vicary left in 2021. But after multiple changes at the top, Vicary returned to Hallmark in August to oversee programming. 

In addition to navigating personnel changes at Hallmark, Witt was also sidelined for a while by some heavy personal hurdles. In December 2021, she quietly began treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, per People, deciding not to publicly disclose her diagnosis until she'd finished six rounds of chemotherapy and a unilateral mastectomy. 

Weeks later, her parents were found dead in their Massachusetts home due to exposure to the cold, according to the Associated Press. Witt wrote in a January 2022 Facebook post that her heart was broken and that she was overcome by “overwhelming floods of grief.”

Witt channeled some of her grief into her music, releasing an emotional song in March 2023 called “Witness”, which she described on social media at the time as “a deeply personal anthem about getting thru an unimaginably hard chapter – and coming out the other side, forever changed.”

Nicole Kidman is embracing a new chapter after bringing her 19-year marriage to “American Idol” judge Keith Urban to an end. A source close to the actress told People that while the decision wasn't easy, Kidman is finding peace in focusing on family. “She's been stressed because she knew the separation would eventually become public and she was dreading it,” the insider shared. 

“But she's surprisingly level-headed and calm. Now that it's out, she's just focused on what's ahead and her girls.”

As per People magazine, the Oscar winner filed for divorce in Nashville on September 30, citing irreconcilable differences and listing the same day as their official date of separation. Kidman, 58, and Urban, 57, share two daughters, Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 14. According to court documents, she has requested to be their primary residential parent.

The news of their separation broke on September 29, with sources telling People that the Oscar winner and the country musician had been living apart since early summer. “Nicole didn't want this,” an insider said. “She has been fighting to save the marriage.”

Page Six reported that the “Moulin Rouge!” star received strong support from her sister, Antonia Kidman, and close family members. The two were spotted walking together in Nashville on October 1, marking Nicole's first public sighting since the divorce news became public.

Kidman and Urban first met at a Los Angeles gala in 2005 and got married the following year.

People reported that just days after filing for divorce, Urban returned to the stage for his High and Alive World Tour stop in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While performing “Heart Like a Hometown,” he kept a family photo featuring Kidman and their daughters in the slideshow that plays during the song — a quiet but emotional nod to his loved ones.

Before launching into the song, Urban shared a personal story with the crowd about how his parents had supported his dream of pursuing music full-time. His bandmate Natalie Stovall rejoined him for the show after sitting out previous dates.

Stovall's earlier absence had sparked speculation over Urban's connection to guitarist Maggie Baugh, who temporarily filled in during his Chicago performance. 

At that show, Urban ad-libbed, “I'll be your guitar player,” to Baugh while performing “The Fighter,” a song inspired by his romance with Kidman. Baugh did not appear onstage in Hershey and has not addressed the rumors.

This marks Kidman's second high-profile divorce. She was previously married to Tom Cruise from 1990 to 2001 and shares two adult children, Isabella, 32, and Connor, 30.

In a 2021 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Kidman reflected on how her past relationships have shaped her outlook on love. “I'm wary at times, and I've been hurt, but I much prefer a warm approach rather than a prickly shutdown,” she said. “My husband Keith once asked, ‘How's your heart?' and I told him, ‘Open.'”

As she steps into a new chapter, Kidman is keeping that same spirit. Sources indicate that she remains focused on her daughters and moving forward with grace.

Bad Bunny hosted Saturday Night Live and paid homage to the Televisa sitcom classic El Chavo del Ocho.

The last sketch of the night was a parody of the Chespirito-created comedy series featuring Bad Bunny as Quico and Marcello Hernández as El Chavo.

Chloe Fineman played Quico's mother, Doña Florinda, Sarah Sherman took on the role of La Chilindrina, while Andrew Dismukes played her father, Don Ramón.

The sketch also featured cameos from Kenan Thompson as El Señor Barriga, which SNL named in English, Mr. Stomach, and a surprise visit from Doña Florinda's gallant suitor, Profesor Jirafales, played by Jon Hamm.

El Chavo del Ocho was a comedy series from the 1970s about a boy who lived in a barrel inside an apartment complex and all the trouble he got himself into with his neighbors due to misunderstandings and taking things too literally.

El Chavo del Ocho is a staple in Latino culture, still airing repeats from its extensive library of more than 300 episodes. The sitcom is available to stream in the U.S. on Televisa-Univision's Vix platform.

The homage that aired on SNL on Saturday night captured the essence of the characters perfectly, with each actor mimicking the personalities of their respective characters masterfully.

Bad Bunny is the first Saturday Night Live guest officially booked on a season finale to then be booked on the following season's premiere. (I thought maybe Buck Henry or Steve Martin had managed this in the '70s as hosts; close, but no dice. Often one would take the finale and the other would host the premiere.) This is both a neat piece of trivia and a perfect emblem for the behind-the-scenes changes made at the show over the summer. Cast changes are nothing new for SNL—just a couple of years ago, there was a big post-COVID turnover—but with only 90 minutes of OK and familiar TV to go on, it's easy to focus on the weird on-paper push and pull of these particular changes.

Like, for example, losing five cast members, which even with sadder departures can at least allow the ensemble to breathe a little more… only to hire five more featured players and keep the cast at a swollen 17. Or bringing in five new people without a single woman of color to make up for losing Ego Nwodim. (Nwodim seems to have decided to leave after the new hirings, but still.) Or keeping among the holdovers the four longest-tenured cast members (Kenan gets a pass, but still). Or losing several folks with stand-up backgrounds and hiring several new stand-ups in their place. Given all that, it makes sense to take the musical guest from last season's uninspired final stretch and make him your marquee name for the different-yet-same show in its premiere—and just to make it clear how cosmetic these changes are, kick things off with Colin Jost, a Trump sketch, a game show sketch, and a restaurant sketch. Later, Jost and Michael Che joked about how long the past nine months of Trump have felt well into their second decade doing the fake news on Weekend Update.

None of this is Bad Bunny's fault. It's sort of heartening, actually, that the show will go so all-in on a bilingual musician who performs largely in his first language of Spanish, even if there's a distinct sense that Lorne Michaels might erroneously think of the guy as his own special discovery. Two hosting gigs in, there's still a sense that SNL is still writing around Bad Bunny's limitations to some degree. But that can be a fun exercise, especially when he seems so enthusiastic about bounding into live sketch comedy to play a would-be spontaneous sperm donor or hardcore KPop Demon Hunters fan.


The problem is more that the Season 51 premiere also felt a bit like the show was taking Bad Bunny for granted as automatically delightful, a fixture who can elevate even pedestrian sketches about not knowing how to play Jeopardy! Fair enough that the live audience seemed to agree, and that none of the night's weakest sketches (the Jeopardy! thing, the sperm-donor thing) went on long enough to tank the episode. It is, however, a neon blinking sign advertising the drawbacks of such a large cast and the blind spots of the show in general, when Bad Bunny's regular presence on the show still mostly just involves him doing sketches where he either works as the designated oddball against a small group of performers who can do more interesting stuff, or works in sync with Marcello Hernández specifically. Just what the 2020s need: a new Timberlake ‘n Fallon duo.

Still, at its best this episode had some back-to-basics fundamentals. It only featured one pretape—the funny if oddly overcrowded ad for ChatGPTio—and half a dozen live sketches, one of which was carried almost entirely by good old-fashioned sketch acting. Doja Cat was fun. Some material that might have been eye-rolling at the end of Season 50—Bowen Yang in elaborate makeup at the Update desk, Kenan mugging and wigging his way through a series of barely-there characters—was like seeing a bunch of old friends back at school. That's the show's eternal comfort and curse, isn't it? School isn't really supposed to last for half a century.

Ashley Padilla is clearly very talented and exactly the kind of sketch-comedy pro who can help hold the show together during transitional or uncertain times. I've also sometimes felt that hardcore SNL fans are a little eager to anoint cast members the new so-and-so like that bit from Season 6 when Bill Murray hosted and tried to cheer up the dejected new cast. One of the best things about the sketch where Padilla played a stern school administrator who immediately pivots to awkwardly girlish flirtations once she meets a troubled student's handsome parent (Bad Bunny, naturally) is how immediately it felt like hers. Obviously plenty of other folks could have played this part well, but she took such ownership of the specific mannerisms of the piece, sometimes too subtle to get a big in-studio laughs.



On the other side, I have to admit the shameless hijacking of KPop Demon Hunters, complete with actual guest shot from Huntrix, pretty much worked for me, especially with the mini-game of the weird misfortunes that Bad Bunny's character persistently ignored while thinking about the Netflix sensation. (Sarah Sherman was only on Epstein's island for a layover!)



Both the Jeopardy! sketch and the sperm donor sketch felt like they were about to take off into something weirder and funnier, and they really just left it at “you have to answer in the form of a question” and “donating sperm is kind of a weird idea, huh?”… which is to say they left both sketches in, oh, I don't know, 1988 maybe?

As for the obligatory Trump thing, as much as I quietly sighed when a new cast member was quickly supplanted by Jost in a sketch turn (way to turn the page, guys!), having someone else take a crack at something besides “Trump interrupts” as the focus of a political sketch isn't such a bad idea.

For actual numbers, you'd have to give it to Marcello, but Ashley Padilla had a perfect one-for-one.

Amy Poehler! For my money, one of the best to ever do it, and not as frequent a return host as Tina Fey or Maya Rudolph. I hope she won't feel obligated to revive a bunch of old characters or invite a bunch of 2000s-era SNL pals (besides the one who still works there, of course). I want to see her doing weird sketches with Dismukes and Yang. And while I used to find it a little cheesy when they'd get an old Update star to guest-anchor, yes, having someone who merely did Update for four years back at it would count as hugely refreshing at this point.

'Showgirl' pulled in huge numbers for a 89-minute "cinematic experience" that's neither a concert film nor a doc but rather a (smart) promotional stunt for Swift's new album. Overseas, it took in $46d million.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock

	Swifties have struck again at the multiplex.


Taylor Swift‘s special Life of a Showgirl album release event towered over the competition at the domestic box office — including films featuring two of the world's biggest stars, Dwayne Johnson and Leonardo DiCaprio — with an estimated weekend bounty of $33 million. Overseas, it earned a better-than-expected $13 million for a global haul of $46 million.




	That's a stunning number for what's being described as a “cinematic experience” that's playing for only three days in cinemas. In other words, it's neither a concert pic nor a documentary, but rather a promotional event timed to the release of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, which dropped Friday and is already setting sales records. The 89-minute big screen event is a mix of music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and a series of lyric videos for tracks on her new album. And it's anchored by the world premiere of the music video for Showgirl single “The Fate of Ophelia,” which she directed.

Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl — which earned a coveted A+ CinemaScore, just as her history-making concert film Eras Tour did — easily came in No. 1 as The Smashing Machine, starring Johnson, bombed with audiences. The drama, marking Johnson's first potential foray into the Oscar race, opened to an estimated $6 million from 3,345 theaters, the worst wide weekend start of his career. Heading into the weekend, tracking showed the indie pic opening $12 million to $14 million, but the R-rated film stalled after getting slapped with a B-CinemaScore and so-so exit polls. Except for swooping in and booking premium large-format screens A24 had counted on, it's would be difficult for Johnson's team to blame Showgirl.

	











	Swift went to great lengths to keep the Showgirl project top secret until the 11th hour (they almost succeeded, but not quite), much to the annoyance of other distributors who don't like last-minute surprises. She announced the Oct. 3-5 special event on Sept. 19 in a well-orchestrated social media post informing fans that advance tickets would go on sale that day at 12:12 local time for $12, in keeping with Swift's longtime relationship with numbers (Showgirl is her 12th studio album). However, consumers can expect to pay notably more than $12 for premium large-format screenings, which contributed 28 percent of the opening gross.


	In 2023, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour catapulted Swift to box office fame when it opened to a record-smashing $93.2 million domestically on its way to becoming the top-grossing concert film of all time with $261.6 million in global ticket sales. The superstar and her team financed the $15 million project, bypassing the Hollywood studio system in partnering with AMC Theatres to distribute the film. The cinema circuit is likewise releasing Showgirl in partnership with Variance Films in the U.S. and Canada, and with Piece of Magic Entertainment in other international markets.


	According to THR‘s review of Showgirl, “The 89-minute cinematic experience — neither visual album nor concert film, and not quite a documentary — is strictly for the diehards. But while there's something to be said for the communal experience of absorbing an album surrounded by dozens of like-minded fans, what's actually being served up on screen is more filler than killer.”

	











	Paul Thomas Anderson's critically acclaimed awards contender One Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, fell to second place in its sophomore outing as it crossed the $100 million mark globally. The Warner Bros. film declined an estimated 49 percent to $11.1 million in North America for a 10-day domestic tally of $42.8 million; overseas, where it opened in select markets ahead of its domestic debut, it added another $21.7 million for a foreign tally of $58.9 million and $101.7 million globally. The movie is being closely scrutinized because of its $135 million net production budget, which is by far the most money Anderson has even been given. 


	From filmmaker Benny Safdie, Smashing Machine came in third. The awards hopeful reunites Johnson with his Jungle Cruise co-star and good friend Emily Blunt, who played a key role in bringing Johnson and Safdie together. The film is based on the real-life story of Mark Kerr, a former college wrestler who battled trauma and an addiction to painkillers during the early years of the UFC. The movie is a radical departure for the actor, who is best known for anchoring big-budget action pics or broad, all-audience tentpoles.


	Swift's Showgirl isn't hurting Smashing Machine in terms of stealing away moviegoers, but it did swoop in and book a number of premium large-format screens that Smashing Machine had wanted.


	Insiders close to the Safdie's film say prerelease tracking was overly aggressive due to Johnson's star status, and that a $6 million start isn't uncommon during awards season. What's more important than a big opening weekend is sustaining momentum. While that's certainly true, many moviegoers don't seem to be connecting with Smashing Machine thus far, based on the worrisome B- CinemaScore (for an adult drama, that's like receiving a C). Box office pundits note that there could be consumer confusion since Johnson's fans aren't used to seeing him in roles like this. 

	











	But A24 has worked magic before. Darren Aronofsky's The Whale was neither a critical or box office hit in the U.S., yet Brendan Fraser went on to win the Oscar for best actor. And in 2019, the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, starring Adam Sandler, became both an awards darling and a box office success despite receiving a C+ CinemaScore.


	One difference between Smashing Machine and those two films: A24 opened The Whale and Uncut Gems in only a handful of theaters in early December before expanding the two titles nationwide over Christmas (The Whale never played in more than 1,700 or so cinemas). Opening Smashing Machine in 3,345 locations is a far more aggressive move, although sources say A24 remains confident that the film will find its stride as word of mouth grows and becomes more positive. 


	“The film presents a bold and deeply personal portrait of legendary MMA pioneer Mark Kerr and marks a dramatic turn from Johnson unlike anything he has done before,” A24 said in its Sunday box office note. “Matched by a powerhouse performance from the incomparable Emily Blunt, The Smashing Machine stands as a creative achievement that will resonate far beyond opening weekend.”


	Another offering over the weekend was James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water, which is being rereleased exclusively in 3D. Like Swift's team, Cameron and partner 20th Century/Disney are using the box office for promotional purposes: this Christmas, Avatar: Fire and Ash opens.


Way of Water pulled in a solid $3.2 million domestically from 2,100 cinemas and another $6.8 million overseas for a global total of $10 million. In North America, where it came in seventh, it is playing in 90 percent of all Imax auditoriums, a huge boon.

	











	IFC's Good Boy, the new drama-dark-comedy-thriller by Corpus Christi helmer Jan Komasa, didn't fare so well despite its provocative plotline. The film, about a young hoodlum kidnapped by a London family, opened to $1.7 million from 2,650 locations.


	Among holdovers, Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie, from DreamWorks Animation/Universal, tumbled 62 percent in its second weekend to $5.2 million from 3,507 locations for a domestic tally of $21.6 million. Following in fifth place was New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites, which took in $4.1 million from 2,753 theaters for a domestic haul of $167.8 million, an impressive feat in the challenged horror space.


	Japanese box office sensation Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle placed sixth domestically with $3.5 million as it moved up the list of the year's top 10 grossing films to No. 6 after finishing Sunday with an estimated $633 million in worldwide ticket sales. Of that, $324.6 million comes from markets outside of Japan where Sony's Crunchyroll is handling the manga pic.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on Sean “Diddy” Combs' 50-month sentencing, potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations at the Super Bowl, and the ongoing government shutdown, as well as other topics in the news since the late night show was last on the air in May.


	“This week, the government finally represented the people when it just completely shut down,” co-anchor Colin Jost joked on the fourth day of the federal government ceasing non-essential operations.


	“Honestly, didn't it feel like the government needed a break? Just so we could all catch our breaths,” Jost added. “Can you believe we're only nine months into this presidency? That means we only have three months and seven years remaining. I already tried fighting. I'm tired. I went to so many protests this summer, but it was finally worth it because we finally got them to change the Cracker Barrel logo back to my actual grandpa.”


Michael Che then addressed Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem both warning that ICE agents will be the Super Bowl after Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny—SNL‘s host—was announced as the halftime show performer.

	ICE being at the Santa Clarita venue would be totally worth it, Che joked—”You know, to catch all those farm workers who can afford Super Bowl tickets.”


	Later, Che commented on Combs' sentencing for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The disgraced music mogul was acquitted in July of the three most serious charges, including racketeering.

	“Sean Combs was sentenced on Friday to four years in prison. I'll be honest, it's hard to watch someone I love get punished, but that's what Diddy would do,” Che joked. 


	“During Sean Combs' sentencing, he pleaded for mercy, saying that the things he did were disgusting, shameful and sick,” Che added. “In fact, just thinking about them makes him harder than grandma's candy.”

	NBC's Saturday Night Live thrives on skewering pop culture, so it was only natural for the show's first episode since May to acknowledge one of the biggest phenomena to emerge during its summer hiatus, Netflix's animated hit KPop Demon Hunters.


	The Season 51 premiere of SNL, hosted by Bad Bunny, featured a KPop Demon Hunters-themed skit about four friends (Bad Bunny, Mikey Day, Sarah Sherman, Chloe Fineman) reconnecting after a long time. While the others talk about their excitement over the new Paul Thomas Anderson movie One Battle After Another and Guillermo del Toro's upcoming Frankenstein, Bad Bunny's Thomas admits he likes KPop Demon Hunters.












	No matter how the subject of the conversation changes — it name-checked two of the biggest controversies of the summer, the Epstein files and Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle ad — Thomas goes back to KPop Demon Hunters and insists that it is not just a movie but tells a true story, with the songs of the fictional K-pop girl group Huntr/x as weapons. He has visions of Huntr/x's Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami performing.

	His friends don't take him seriously until Bowen Yang appears dressed as demon Jinu from the movie and demands their souls. He succeeds with Sherman's character who turns demonic. 


	Amid panic and horror, Thomas summons Huntr/x for help. The sketch ends with Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami coming out to perform a portion from the film's biggest hit, “Golden.”


	You can watch the sketch above.


KPop Demon Hunters has ruled pop culture since its June release, breaking Netflix viewership records with 325.1 million views to date, getting a box office-winning two-day sing-along theatrical run and ruling the music charts.


	Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami's surprise SNL appearance precedes their first announced televised appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Tuesday, October 7. On the late-night show, executive produced by SNL boss Lorne Michaels, the group is expected to perform “Golden.”

EJAE, a songwriter on the film and singing voice to lead character Rumi, also announced her debut single, releasing later this month.

Saturday Night Live season 51 is off to a “Golden” start.


	EJAE, Rei Ami and Audrey Nuna, who voice the characters of Rumi, Zoey and Mira in the hit Netflix and Sony Animation movie KPop Demon Hunters, made a surprise appearance during an SNL skit in the season 51 premiere. The short performance as part of a brunch-themed KPop Demon Hunters sketch marks the first-ever live performance of the song by the three women.




	The ladies of Huntrix are set to make their first official and full-length performance of the song during Tuesday's episode of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. They'll also be interviewed together. The news was announced last week, showing Fallon receiving a special invitation from some familiar faces for fans of KPop Demon Hunters.

	The animated feature has become Netflix's most popular title ever. The project — which chronicles the adventures of Huntrix, a K-pop girl group comprised of three members who just happen to also fight monsters from the underworld — has been a surprise hit for the streamer, and its soundtrack has spent several weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart. THR has confirmed that a sequel film is in talks at Netflix and Sony Animation.


	In August, Huntrix ended Alex Warren's long-running No. 1 streak to take the top spot on the chart. After a flip-flop the following week, the song returned to No. 1, where it remains. Two other songs from the film are in the top 10 of the Hot 100. “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop,” sung by the film's fictional boy group Saja Boys, sit at No. 3 and No. 5, respectively. Six other songs from soundtrack, including Twice's “Strategy,” are also charting on the Hot 100.

	











	Following the appearance, EJAE, who also served one of the film's key songwriters, announced her debut solo single, “In Another World,” which is set to be released on Oct. 24. “I'm so humbled and grateful for the love I've received as a songwriter and the singing voice of Rumi from KPop Demon Hunters. Getting so much exposure so quickly has been strange, exciting, and truthfully a little scary,” she said in an Instagram post announcing the song. 


	“People keep referring to me as an ‘artist' or a ‘star' — which is everything 11-year-old EJAE dreamed of, but over the years, I became comfortable behind the scenes and I didn't think I was meant to be an artist,” she continued. “Writing this song helped me through a hard time, and I hope that sharing it can help others too.”

Saturday Night Live‘s season 51 premiere kicked off with Donald Trump and his Federal Communications Commission attack dog warning cast members not to go too far with their jokes—or face the consequences.


	Trump (James Austin Johnson) began by interrupting Secretary of Defense and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth (Colin Jost) instructing high-ranking members of the military on some new rules. 


	“No fatties, no facial hair, no body hair. Just hot, shredded, hairless men who are definitely not gay,” Hegseth said. “Because this is serious. We are facing the greatest threat to freedom and democracy the world has ever known, and we all know what that threat is.”


	“Late night TV!” Trump answered, referring to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's pressure last month on ABC and parent company Disney over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.


	“I'm just here keeping an eye on SNL making sure they don't do anything too mean about me. They better be careful. I know late night TV like the back of my hands; not looking great right now!” he said, revealing the all-too common smear of non-matching makeup on the back of his right hand.

	











	After roasting the show's beginning—”we all know they were never going to let [Jost] do the whole opening by himself”—Trump said of the Weekend Update co-host: “I thought he would be with his friends at the Riyadh Comedy Festival.”

	











	“That's sad. We love the Saudis because they like to ‘saw these' journalists in half,” Trump joked, amid Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle and other comedians receiving criticism for taking money to perform in a nation with a dismal human rights record. “That's the kind of thing that would kill over there.” 


	Trump then addressed another big development since the season 50 finale in May: the contents of a creepy 2003 birthday letter to eventual sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that The Wall Street Journal reported was from Trump, but which he (dubiously) denies writing.

	“All right, Colin, those Spirit Airlines jokes aren't going to write themselves. Bye,” Trump said, shooing him away. “Oh, and Colin: ‘May every day be another wonderful secret.' That was a quote from a poem I wrote to a horrible man I've never met before.”


	“But here we are, SNL season 51. Should have called it at 50, right?” Trump continued. “It's so sad to see something get old and confused yet still demand constant attention. Oh, well. But they better be on their best behavior, otherwise they're going to have to answer to my attack dog at the FCC, Brandon Carr.”


	“It's actually ‘Brendan,' sir,” said Carr (Mikey Day).


	“It's crazy that you think I care,” Trump replied. 


	“Well, I had a great summer,” Trump concluded. “I took a little vacation time for golf and travel and stroke. Kidding! Or not. We'll never know, will we?”

	“I ended every war, except the two main ones still happening and more vicious than ever,” he added. “Now starting a new war in Venezuela soon.”


	That one will be paid for, he explained, “with my scams.”

	In his second time hosting Saturday Night Live and fourth appearing in Studio 8H, international superstar Bad Bunny (née Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) sent an uplifting message to his Latino community around the world. The three-time Grammy winner said no one could “remove nor erase” the impact of Latinos in the U.S. following right-wing furor over him being tapped to perform at next year's Super Bowl Halftime show.


	“I think Marcello is getting nervous that Lorne has a new favorite Latino,” Bad Bunny began his monologue, as the camera panned to repertory player Marcello Hernandez in the audience, who responded simply, “I am.”

	











	The trap-pop artist explained he would not be pulling double duty on the late-night sketch show as he just wrapped his 31-show residency in Puerto Rico, which featured three-hour-long sets. Adding that he needed a “rest,” the singer-songwriter also poked fun at his much-discussed knee injury, citing it as “complicated choreography.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	After his Caught Stealing co-star Austin Butler went viral for attending one of his shows, and who later revealed he was high on edible gummies during the performance, Bad Bunny noted he had a number of celebrities “on drugs” at his show. Singling out Jon Hamm, Bad Bunny nicknamed him “Juan Jamón” before the camera panned to show a surprise appearance from the Mad Men alum.


	Bad Bunny then pivoted to the Super Bowl, saying, “I'm very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News.” The show then cut to spliced-together footage from the right-wing network, which said: “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician. He should be the next president.”

	











	Speaking more seriously, the multi-hyphenate said his fans are happy with NFL decision, pivoting to Spanish amid raucous cheers to add, “especially all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world, and here in the United States, all the people who have worked to open doors. More than an achievement for me, it's a milestone for all of us, demonstrating that our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one can ever remove nor erase.”


	“And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn,” he quipped.


	Following the announcement that Bad Bunny would be performing on one of the most-watched entertainment programs of the year, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced ICE agents would be present at the event. She doubled-down on the matter earlier today. 


	Bad Bunny previously explained he opted not to include any U.S. stops on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour as he and his team were “very concerned” about his fans being subjected to threats of deportation.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, confirmed what President Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said earlier in the week: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will be attending the Super Bowl on Feb. 8. The event will feature Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny as the halftime show headliner.


	In a recent The Benny Show video, Noem told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that ICE will be “all over” the 2026 Super Bowl.


	“I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that's what America's about,” Noem said in the clip. “So yeah, we'll be all over that place. We're going to enforce the law.” 


	Noem continued: “So, I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they're law-abiding Americans who love this country.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When asked if she had “any message to the NFL” regarding the organization naming Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime performer, Noem said, “Well, they suck and we'll win, and God will bless us and we'll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day, and they won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe. And they're so weak, we'll fix it.”

	











	Earlier in the week, Lewandowski spoke to Johnson as well. He told the podcaster when asked if ICE would be at the big game, “There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said. “We will find you, we will apprehend you, we will put you in a detention facility, and we will deport you.”

	











	Others in the president's MAGA base also unsurprisingly had meltdowns when it was announced the Puerto Rican superstar would headline the Super Bowl halftime show.


	Before Bad Bunny was revealed as the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show star, the musician told i-D why his upcoming Debí Tirar Más Fotos world tour does not include dates in the continental United States. The artist said the Trump administration's recent mass deportations targeting Latinos informed the decision.


	“There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,” Bad Bunny said. “All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent.”

	The singer, a vocal critic of Trump's agenda, added: “But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”


	Bad Bunny is set to host Saturday Night Live's Season 51 premiere tonight, which features musical guest Doja Cat.

	Any Taylor Swift fans chanting “more!” after the release of The Life of a Showgirl‘s 12 tracks on Friday (Oct. 3) were in for a little surprise Saturday night (Oct. 4). Swift dropped four new CD variants of her latest album, each featuring two acoustic tracks not found on the standard version of Showgirl.

	Now available in “limited quantities” on Swift's official webstore, the CDs are described as having “brand new production by Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift and newly recorded vocals by Taylor Swift.”

	Fans can order the the limited-release CDs over a 24-hour period, through 7 p.m. ET Sunday — “while supplies last.” Each CD is priced at $7.99, and features cover art that's different from that on the standard release. (Those who made it to a screening of The Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters this weekend will recognize the imagery.)


	“File this under ‘save your best for the finale'… I think my favorite moments from the tour were the acoustic surprises. So I went back into the studio with Max and Shellback to record acoustic/unplugged versions of a few of the Showgirl songs with brand new vocals and production! Cannot WAIT for you to hear,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post promoting the CDs.


	For those who share Swift's love of acoustic versions of songs, here's the breakdown of the four new The Life of a Showgirl options and what's available on them (beyond the set's original tracklist):

	











	• Life Is a Song Acoustic Version with “Opalite (Life Is a Song Acoustic Version)” and “Ruin the Friendship (My Advice Version)”• Dressing Room Rehearsal Version with “Wi$h Li$t (Settled Down Acoustic Version)” and “The Life of a Showgirl (Dressing Room Rehearsal Acoustic Version)”• Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version with “The Fate of Ophelia (Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version)” and “Eldest Daughter (Now You're Home Acoustic Version)”• So Glamorous Cabaret Version with “Elizabeth Taylor (So Glamorous Cabaret Version)” and Elizabeth Taylor (Original Songwriting Voice Memo)


	As Billboard revealed earlier on Saturday, initial first-day sales reports from data tracking firm Luminate say Swift sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the The Life of a Showgirl album available on its first day of release, Oct. 3. This means that in its first day alone, Showgirl‘s already seen the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. Only Adele has tracked a larger sales week since then, with 3.378 million copies of 25 sold within the first week of its release in 2015.

	While discussing her Hamptons International Film Festival opener Eternity earlier today, Elizabeth Olsen acknowledged she “always” wants to return to the MCU


	“It is something that I love, and it's something I always want to return to,” she said at a panel conversation, per People. “I think the thing that's been so special about the last five years is I've gotten to do so much with the character that I never thought I would. There are still character through lines that have happened in the comics that I'd love to do that I think fans also want to.”


	Olsen continued, “I mean, these movies aren't for critics, these movies are for fans.”

	The actress first began portraying Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch nearly a decade ago, first appearing in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. The character got a standalone limited series with WandaVision in 2021, and Olsen garnered an Emmy nomination for the role. Wanda's last appearance was in 2022's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, with Olsen having since confirmed the character died. As audiences are aware, however, even death can be overcome in the multiverse.


	“It's really fruitful, and the stories have only gotten better for me, my character. I really enjoyed it,” she said of the part, adding later on the subject of superhero fatigue (something Marvel boss Kevin Feige is making a priority in tackling): “Some people have ongoing television series that they get to return to. Very few, I feel like, get to be a part of franchises that, I know we might culturally get a little bit exhausted by, but there is something about them that becomes very familial.”

	











	She concluded, “There's nothing else really like it, and I don't know that I'll have [that] again unless it's for an ongoing show. I do like that kind of consistency. It feels good. I mean, job security feels nice — I think we can all agree on that.”


	Olsen echoed sentiments she previously expressed last year, saying, “I'd never really had the mentality of ‘one for them, one for me.' Marvel has been such a consistent thing I've been able to return to and has created — what's the word? — some feeling of insurance in my life that has given me freedom to choose other jobs. So I haven't felt like, ‘And then I'll do this to do this.'”


Eternity, which enjoyed its world premiere at TIFF last month, will see a limited theatrical release Nov. 14, before going wide Nov. 26.

I'm a fan, not a critic, and I've been disappointed in recent MCU movies and most of the Disney+ series. Somehow they lost the magic. Maybe they just got lucky with casting the original Avengers. 

I didn't like Benedict Cumberbach as Doctor Strange (and definitely did not like their cowardly rewriting of The Ancient One so as not to offend the Chinese government) and that was the start of the MCU going off the rails.

These movies are for money*

I know I'm screaming into the void here but people aren't exhausted. They have lost interest because Tony Stark, the reason I and a lot of people watched the MCU in the first place, was offed.

Your scream from the void has been heard, at least by me. Stark was a favorite. I hated they write him out. I do love Dr Strange and Scarlett Witch. I do wish they could bring back Stark.

She's absolutely right. Marvel, DC, neither of them are for critics, “professional” or non; just for us fans and us fans alone. On a separate note, first time receiving confirmation that she actually died; completely missed when she stated so.

To be fair, she's right. Marvel movies shouldn't be judged on whether your typical film critic is going to give them top marks. Shouldn't be about box office results either, although I doubt Disney would agree with that.

End of the day, I'd rather see Marvel making great movies that service the fans and comic book types, rather than chasing the ever changeable general audience. As a lifelong Marvel fan it was nice to see the MCU taking over the world leading up to Endgame but I genuinely don't care if they ever reach those heights again, because I'll still enjoy them regardless and I couldn't care less how many others share that enjoyment.

Bottom line, if Marvel movies (outside of your big event Avengers or Spidey releases) are only averaging $500M these days, who cares as long as Marvel start bringing the production budgets down to accommodate. Disney know that Marvel has a guaranteed audience even if it never becomes the phenomenal success it was during the 2010s. Just bring the budgets down, make them profitable again, and tell great stories. Simple.

Taylor Swift has dropped some new versions of The Life of a Showgirl, this time she's going unplugged with a few of the album's songs. The acoustic tracks are available on four new CDs on the musician's website for the next 24 hours “while supplies last,” she noted in a social media post on Saturday, Oct. 4.


	“File this under ‘save your best for the finale' … I think my favorite moments from the tour were the acoustic surprises,” Swift wrote on social media. “So I went back into the studio with [producers] Max [Martin] and Shellback to record acoustic/unplugged versions of a few of the Showgirl songs with brand new vocals and production!” The post includes photos of all four CD covers and a list of two stripped-down tracks that appear on four different CDs.

The Life of a Showgirl (Alone In My Tower Acoustic Version) features “The Fate of Ophelia (Alone In My Tower Acoustic Version)” and “Eldest Daughter (Now You're Home Acoustic Version).” The Dressing Room Rehearsal Version includes “Wi$h Li$t (Settled Down Acoustic Version)” and “The Life of a Showgirl (Dressing Room Rehearsal Acoustic Version).” The Life Is a Song Acoustic Version is paired with “Opalite (Life Is a Song Acoustic Version)” and “Ruin the Friendship (My Advice Version).” There is also the So Glamorous Cabaret Version, which includes two “Elizabeth Taylor” renditions: “Elizabeth Taylor (So Glamorous Cabaret Version)” and “Elizabeth Taylor (Original Songwriting Voice Memo).”

The Life of a Showgirl is already on track to potentially break Adele's 25 record for largest sales week ever in the modern era, per Luminate data, having sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales during its first day, Oct. 3. The number includes all of the album's digital and physical versions thus far, prior to dropping the four new acoustic CD variants. One day in, and it's already Swift's biggest album sales week ever, and only Adele has eclipsed Showgirl's first-day numbers with 25, when the album sold 3.378 million copies in its debut week in 2015.

When you think of James Wan, the first thing that comes to mind is likely his participation in major Hollywood franchises like Fast & Furious and Aquaman, but those who've followed him since the start know of his strong horror background. Before creating franchises like The Conjuring and Insidious, Wan broke out with the wild ride that was Saw, but the movie he made next often falls through the cracks. The movie in question? Dead Silence, which was added to the Peacock library on October 1.

In Dead Silence, Jamie and Lisa Ashen find a mysterious gift on their doorstep. Jamie opens the box and inside there's an eerie ventriloquist doll named Billy. When he leaves for a few minutes, he returns to find Lisa viciously murdered. After he's cleared of all charges, Jamie decides to return to his hometown of Raven's Fair, hoping to solve his wife's mysterious murder. What he finds upon his return is a derelict rural town that holds a few secrets that could be related to the tragedy. Per the Rotten Tomatoes synopsis:

After his wife meets a grisly end, Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) returns to their creepy hometown of Ravens Fair to unravel the mystery of her murder. Once there, he discovers the legend of Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts), a murdered ventriloquist whose eerie presence still looms over the town. As he desperately digs for answers, Jamie encounters the curse that took his wife's life and threatens his own.

Although Wan and Saw co-writer Leigh Whannell were still enjoying the ongoing success of their first film, Saw had already morphed into a franchise. 2007 saw the release of Saw IV, but also of the creative duo's follow-up to their first collaboration. Dead Silence marked a drastic change in the horror subgenre they'd so successfully tackled in 2004. Could the Wan/Whannell duo win again with a different formula?

The film was released to a negative reception by critics and audiences, only grossing a little over $22 million against its $20 million production budget. Professional reviewers also failed to connect with the movie; today, it has a 21% critics' score at Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score is somewhat higher at 51%.

 While the director behind Insidious, Aquaman, and The Conjuring has made his fair share of big studio movies, Saw put him on the map as a talented storyteller capable of touching a nerve with disturbing visuals and a compelling narrative, and the horror universe is still arguably where Wan is able to best express his unique voice.

Malignant is, of course, the greatest example of this. The 2021 Warner Bros. release consolidated Wan as a filmmaker willing to go against the conventions of modern horror. Dead Silence, on the other hand, is his most underrated project to date. Though many accused it of being inconsistent, the film is Wan at his most unhinged. His approach to "haunted house" and "ghost story" tropes isn't wholly unique, but the opening sequence alone is enough to terrify viewers, and proves the director's skillset when designing scary films.

The following is an adapted version of an article written by Mátyás Bíró, originally published in Hungarian in Magyar Krónika.

In its series about reading matters, this time Magyar Krónika recommends the 2013 work by well-known and popular Hungarian historian Péter Hahner on the Kennedy assassination, with a lesser-known Hungarian thread.

It is worth reading Hungarian historian Péter Hahner's intriguing book, published 12 years ago, which deals with the most well-known conspiracy theories related to the Kennedy assassination on the occasion of its 50th anniversary (The Non-Existing Mystery — Fifteen Questions and Answers on the Kennedy Assassination), if only because President Trump signed an executive order on the release of secret files related to the assassination earlier this year. This has permanently consigned many popular conspiracy theories to the dustbin of history.

Péter Hahner presents the known facts and sources of the Kennedy assassination in an easy-to-read style, similar to his previous works on popular knowledge and dispelling historical misconceptions, based on facts. Those interested in history will particularly enjoy the introductory chapters, which cover political assassinations in world and American history, and then introduce the lives of John F Kennedy, his wife Jacqueline, the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald's killer Jack Ruby. This information and the connections revealed help us form a well-founded opinion about the assassination.

The author openly takes the position in the title of the book that there is no mystery here. He carefully goes through all the known conspiracy theories and places the events and claims in a historical context, and also refutes them. As he argues, when it became known that Oswald declared himself a Marxist, Americans were suspicious of the Russians and the Cubans for a long time. Therefore, the first more complex conspiracy theories were written by communist or far-left authors such as Thomas Buchanan or Mark Lane, with the aim of shifting suspicion to others, such as the mafia, the FBI, the CIA, or the leaders of the oil lobby.

‘The author openly takes the position in the title of the book that there is no mystery here'



The introduction reads the following: ‘There is no debate among American historians about who killed President John F Kennedy and why, just as Hungarian historians do not ask the question of which side was the winner in the battle of 29 August 1526. And if there were still a few “experts” who considered the soldiers of Louis II to be the winners, and their number was growing, perhaps we should believe that the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and that the Battle of Mohács was undecided?' The author adds that, of course, there are many historical events about which we do not know the full truth; for example, we do not know what Alexander the Great died of, or where King Attila the Hun was buried. However, according to Hahner, the presidential assassination does not belong to these examples.

Reading the book, we find his position quite convincing. The Marxist Oswald's psychopathic traits, his inferiority complex, his life story, and later the Warren Commission report investigating the assassination, all support the idea that Oswald committed his act as a lone madman. President Kennedy, the greatest enemy of his hero, Fidel Castro, passed in front of his workplace with his convoy on 22 November 1963, and Oswald simply took advantage of the situation.

The Warren Commission, after ten months of work, interviewing 489 people, and using the 4,600-page Secret Service dispatch, prepared its 26-volume report, which reads: ‘The Commission found no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby participated in any domestic or foreign conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.'

Péter Hahner also writes that 98 per cent of the Warren Commission documents were already made public in 1992. He knew in advance that the documents that had been uncovered would not contain any significant new information regarding the Kennedy assassination.

The book also mentions the publication in 2007 of a work by former New York prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi titled Reclaiming History, which convincingly proved Oswald's guilt and the baselessness of conspiracy theories. In the volume, the author collected the names of 214 (!) suspects whose names have come up in some form in connection with the case over the past decades. Among them are people such as the Nazi Martin Bormann, George Bush Sr, Richard Nixon, Fidel Castro, Khrushchev, and J Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI.

It is interesting from a Hungarian perspective that Ferenc Nagy, who was the prime minister of our country between February 1946 and March 1947, is also on the list.

In 1967 New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison indicted Clay Shaw, an American businessman, former military officer, and CIA contact, for Kennedy's assassination, but the charges were eventually dropped. Shaw gave an interview to Penthouse magazine in which he said that around 1960, a young Italian man approached him in New Orleans and asked him to be a member of the board of directors of a planned world trade centre in Rome.

‘I looked into it, and it turned out that the head of the programme was a man named Imre Nagy, who was the last non-communist prime minister of Hungary,' Shaw said. Of course, he confused him with Ferenc Nagy, but what does that have to do with the Kennedy assassination? The only thing, writes Hahner, is that Ferenc Nagy announced the plan to build a world trade centre in Rome at a press conference in October 1958, in which a Swiss company called Permindex was also involved. The centre was eventually not built, but a daily newspaper close to the Italian Communist Party wrote in 1967 that the centre designed by Permindex would have been the CIA's Italian front.

Thus, when Clay Shaw was indicted in 1967 for the Kennedy assassination, the American newspapers questioned him about Permindex, and in his statements at the time, he also mentioned the former Hungarian prime minister, confusing the names of two Hungarian leaders.

Black Star Canyon is a beautiful nature escape in Orange County, but did you know about the haunting legends and stories that take place there?

Black Star Canyon is found in the Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County, California. The area features a popular hike to a seasonal waterfall, but it may be most famous for spectral rumors and stories that have endured throughout history. From the early-1800s massacre of Indigenous Tongva people to rumors of contemporary cult activity, there's much more to Black Star Canyon than it seems.

Keep reading to learn more about this fascinating hiking area, which you can reach in about an hour from Downtown L.A.

The Black Star Canyon area has a haunting reputation based on a blend of real tragic events and paranormal folklore.

Most ghostly rumors trace back to a violent confrontation between the Indigenous Tongva people and white fur trappers in 1831. The story goes that William Wolfskill led a group of men to massacre the native people, whom they accused of horse theft, and some believe that the spirits of the murdered Tongva people still wander the canyon. Hikers and ghost hunters have heard disembodied chanting and war cries, according to Connect Paranormal.

Some visitors also report seeing the ghost of James Gregg, who was shot and killed by Thomas and Henry Hungerford at Hidden Ranch in 1899 over an unsettled monetary dispute. Other stories mention the Mexican legend of “La Llorona,” a weeping woman from Latin American folklore said to haunt bodies of water in search of her children. Then there's the rumor of cult activity in the 1980s, stemming from so-called ritual bonfires and occult activities.

Reported phenomena include sudden temperature drops, disembodied voices, phantom apparitions, and rocks thrown from the darkness. While skeptics point to natural noises and sensations from the canyon's unique acoustics, ghost hunters and visitors maintain that it's caused by paranormal activity.

If you're interested in learning more about the legends, history, and paranormal activity of Black Star Canyon, Haunted OC hosts spooky ghost tours hosted by naturalist Joel Robinson.

Whether you're a ghost hunter or a skeptic, Black Star Canyon offers a wonderful blend of natural scenery, including dramatic red rock faces, geologic formations, and an elusive 65-foot waterfall. Many visitors take the trail at 13333 Black Star Canyon Road, which leads to a 7-mile round-trip hike along a fire road and rocky creek bed.

The Black Star Canyon Falls are at their peak flow during and after the rainy season, which is from late winter to early spring. The hike can also be a bit of a challenge due to muddy and slippery conditions during this time, so plan accordingly.

20 years later, and our love for Supernatural is still going strong. There's nothing quite like the adventures of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), and revisiting the show's earliest horror-fueled seasons often leads to new questions that the rest of the long-running series either forgot about entirely or simply failed to answer. One such question: who is Sam and Dean's unnamed uncle? Did you even know that the Winchesters had an uncle? Unless you've recently found yourself revisiting the show's second season, this fun family fact probably drove right past you...

Early in the show's run, Sam and Dean were plagued by guilt, the former due to the death of his girlfriend Jessica (Adrianne Palicki) and the latter because of the sacrifice of their father, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). And that's not even counting the death of their mother, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith), back when the boys were just children. With so much tragedy in their family life, it's easy to just remember the highlights and forget the rest, but if you listen closely, we learn something quite interesting about their extended family in Season 2's "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things."

While driving to Greenville, Illinois to pay respects to their mother's headstone, Dean notes that it was put up by some uncle — a man they never even met. Of course, the way Dean says it, there's been some debate on whether he's saying "her uncle" (as in Mary's uncle) or "our uncle" (as in Mary's brother), though the captioning on Netflix uses the latter. Nevertheless, the point remains that there's some other relative out there that Supernatural doesn't address again.

When Dean time-travels to the past in Season 4, meeting a younger version of his mother, we hear absolutely nothing about Mary's uncle or brother. If we're going based on the Netflix captioning, then Mary should have a sibling out there. Yet, "In the Beginning" not only makes no reference to another Campbell beyond Mary's father, Samuel (Mitch Pileggi), and mother, Deanna (Allison Hossack), but there's no physical evidence in their home that such a person ever existed. This is even true of the Campbell family in the alternate universe story The Winchesters, which reminds us that neither John (Drake Rodger) nor Mary (Meg Donnelly) had siblings of any sort. When the extended Campbell family is more properly introduced in Season 6 of the original show, the new Campbells are considered distant relatives, as if this comment from Season 2 had been long forgotten. But there is one source that speaks more directly to this mysterious uncle...

There is one piece of Supernatural media that expands on this mysterious uncle further. The WildStorm comic book prequel Supernatural: Origins was released during the show's second season and followed John Winchester as he engaged with the paranormal just after his wife's murder. It's a great comic book that gives us some greater context into how John found himself getting into hunting in the first place. But it also reveals something about Sam and Dean's uncle, a man named Jacob Campbell. Here, Jacob is established as Mary's older brother who watched over her almost like a father when their parents died. Although he attempts to take custody of Sam and Dean, John convinces him to help him search for Mary's killer, ultimately resulting in Jacob being mauled to death by a hellhound.

This would explain why Sam and Dean never got to know their uncle, and why John likely never spoke about him. But despite that, the six-issue comic book is no longer considered canon, making this a strange continuity error that Supernatural never took the time to resolve. To make matters more complicated, the Alex Irvine tie-in novel John Winchester's Journal also refers to a Jacob Campbell, though here he's presented as Mary's uncle from Illinois rather than her brother. Because neither tie-in story is technically canon to the show itself, fans can take this throwaway line by Dean to mean whatever they want, but one thing remains clear no matter if Jacob Campbell is Mary's brother or uncle: the Winchesters had another relative out there that they never knew.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix in the U.S.

Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.
