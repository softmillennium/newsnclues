                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• US President Donald Trump told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if it refuses to cede power in Gaza, as Trump pressures Israel and the militant group to move forward with his ceasefire proposal. • Trump says Israel has agreed to an initial withdrawal line, and that a ceasefire would be “immediately effective” if Hamas approves. • Despite Trump's assertion that Israel has temporarily stopped bombing Gaza, dozens of people have been killed in Israeli strikes over the weekend, according to hospitals in the enclave. While the relative calm has offered brief respite for the Palestinians CNN spoke with, they said they can still hear explosions and are cautious in their optimism. Ismail Zaydeh, who is currently sheltering at Gaza Port, said he heard airstrikes around dawn, including around Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa and al-Sabra neighborhoods and the beach encampment west of the city. Hatem Abu Rahma, who had been living in Gaza City's Al-Shifa neighborhood but traveled an hour away to the Al-Saraya area for his safety, told CNN the situation across the enclave feels “much calmer” this weekend in comparison with Friday. “There's still gunfire and shelling that we can hear, but it's far lighter than in previous days.” Asmaa Ziyad from Gaza City's Al-Sahaba neighborhood also noted a change, saying: “Yesterday and the night before, there were many airstrikes, but the bombardment is lighter than it was two days ago. We still hear the sounds of aircraft and distant explosions, but not like before.” “Israel can go in there and make sure Hamas is obliterated,” Hegseth said. “So we're proud to be a part of supporting and defending Israel.” US President Donald Trump spoke to reporters a short time ago at the White House, saying negotiations on the Gaza ceasefire deal are going “very well.” It'll last a couple of days,” Trump said as he departed the South Lawn for an event in Norfolk, Virginia, later today. Trump described his 20-point ceasefire proposal as a “great deal” for Israel and “the entire Arab world.” Remember: Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources. Negotiators, including a US delegation, are headed to Cairo now. Hamas' chief negotiator, Khalil Al-Hayya, was seen in a video for the first time since the Israeli assassination attempt in Doha nearly one month ago. In the two-and-a-half-minute video, only Al-Hayya's head and chest can be seen, and it's unclear if he is suffering from any injuries as a result of the earlier attack. Al-Hayya mourns his son, who was killed in the Israeli strike on September 9, and says, “We are heartbroken over the loss of thousands in Gaza. God has honored us by counting among the martyrs our sons and grandchildren.” The Israeli strike drew international condemnation, including from US President Donald Trump. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has commended US President Donald Trump's “huge mission” to secure the release of the remaining captives in Gaza while voicing his optimism that a hostage deal could be close. “I want to thank President Donald Trump for all his efforts regarding this huge mission of bringing our hostages back home,” Gideon Sa'ar, who has spoken out in support of ending the war in Gaza, said at a prayer event on Sunday. “We are yearning to see them come home – very soon.” Three Israeli anti-war activists have been released from detention and placed under house arrest after attempting to break through the Gaza border, a spokesperson for the their network, Mesarvot, said Sunday. Itamar Greenberg, Roman Levin and Roy Elani were arrested and detained in Beersheba District Court after crossing briefly into the Gaza border on Friday. Greenberg, 19, is a conscious objector, having refused to enlist for military service, which is compulsory for most Jewish Israelis - and some minorities - over the age of 18. He served a total of 197 days over five consecutive sentences before being released in March 2025. For context: An independent United Nations inquiry concluded for the first time last month that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and that the country's top leaders have incited genocide, in what it described as the “most authoritative UN finding to date.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said today that US President Donald Trump's team is “convinced” their ceasefire proposal is not only possible, but “should happen.” “Over the past two days I conducted a series of conversations with President Trump's team. They are convinced it should happen,” Lapid said at the start of a political party meeting. “This deal was shaped thanks to President Trump, and despite (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu. I saw yesterday Netanyahu trying, as usual, to steal the credit for it,” Lapid added. The opposition leader went on to say that Netanyahu has “no political impediment” to finish what Trump started, before adding: “This deal can be done; this deal must be done.” More now from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also speaking earlier today on ABC's “This Week.” He said the administration's hope is to have “90 percent” of negotiations completed by the time White House officials arrive in Cairo. Rubio said that while he does not fully trust Hamas leaders, there is still progress being made during negotiations. “I'm not telling you here that these are people I trust 100%, nor should we, but they have said basically that they agreed to his proposal and the framework for releasing the hostages,” Rubio said. Rubio said it's a goal the administration believes “we can achieve something very quickly on,” specifying that the release would be “in exchange for Israel moving back to” the initial withdrawal line outlined in President Donald Trump's proposed ceasefire plan, “which is basically where they stood at the middle part of last month of August.” “Even as I speak to you now, there are people meeting on that,” Rubio added. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh tomorrow. After leaving the White House in 2021, Kushner launched a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The UAE and Qatar have also invested large amounts into his firm. These deals came shortly after Kushner helped lead Middle East policy during the first Trump administration, including the Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and several Arab states. Kushner has denied these investments are a conflict of interest. Critics from across party lines and human rights organizations argue that Kushner continues to profit from relationships he built while in public office, renewing questions about whether his financial ties with Riyadh and other Gulf players could influence US policy under his father-in-law. His firm invests heavily in Israeli companies, and Kushner praised the “very valuable” potential of Gaza's “waterfront property” last year, suggesting that Israel should move Palestinians “out and then clean it up” — raising further questions about his impartiality in acting as a mediator as he re-enters diplomatic circles. Detained activists of the recently intercepted Gaza-bound aid flotilla have suffered “serious abuses” in Israeli custody, including being denied access to medication and – for some – physical violence, according to a legal team representing the group. The claims come days after the same lawyers said some detained activists had been forced to “kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours.” According to the testimonies of these individuals, Adalah said that, as of Saturday, participants were denied access to essential medications, including prescriptions for conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer. “The participants are detained in overcrowded cells, and some participants were forced to sleep on the floor under harsh and unsanitary conditions,” Adalah said. Adalah said that Israeli authorities “used physical violence against some detainees, with at least one participant sustaining injuries to his hands.” Other members of the flotilla were blindfolded and handcuffed for prolonged periods, Adalah said. Israel's Foreign Ministry said today that the claims of mistreatment are “brazen lies.” In a statement to CNN, the Foreign Ministry also said, “Of course they are receiving food, water and medication, and they are not mistreated.” US President Donald Trump has told CNN Hamas faces “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to cede power and control of Gaza, amid ongoing efforts to push forward his proposed ceasefire plan. “Complete Obliteration!” Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked via text message yesterday what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power. Tapper pressed the president on Hamas' response to his 20-point ceasefire proposal, citing Sen. Lindsey Graham's interpretation that Hamas had effectively rejected the plan by insisting on “no disarmament, keeping Gaza under Palestinian control and tying hostage release to negotiations.” The president said he expects clarity “soon” on whether Hamas is genuinely committed to peace. “Yes on Bibi,” Trump said, when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fully on board with ending the bombing campaign in Gaza and supporting the president's broader vision. While we await delegations from Hamas, Israel and the US to continue talks in Egypt, let's take a look at how Hamas responded to parts of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan. The militant group's response opened the door to potential negotiations to finalize a deal, and Trump quickly hailed it as victory, saying Hamas was “ready for lasting peace.” The Hamas statement only says that “other issues” mentioned in the Trump plan “will be discussed through a comprehensive national Palestinian framework.” Hamas also insists that it will be a part of this framework, defying the Trump proposal's demand that it “not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.” Trump may be celebrating, but there are still delicate talks ahead on some of the most sensitive issues. Leo also said he continues to be “saddened” by the suffering of Palestinian people in Gaza. Leo, the first Amercian pope, acknowledged that “some significant steps” have been taken in ceasefire negotiations, which he hoped would achieve the “desired results as soon as possible.” At least 15 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since dawn today, hospital authorities said. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are expected to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources - as we reported earlier. At least 67 people were killed in Gaza yesterday as Israeli bombardment continued, hospital officials said. Seventeen – many of them children – were killed after a strike hit a home in Gaza City, which recorded most of the deaths in the enclave Saturday. More than 460 people were treated at Gaza City's Al-Ahli Arab hospital Saturday, said Dr. Fadel Naim, who works there. “The medical teams are still fighting to save lives amid severe shortages of staff, supplies and medicines, and an overwhelming number of patients requiring urgent surgery,” he said. Many more have been left with life-changing injures, according to the ministry. “We are fully aware that the government is not going to stop, so we are here to call on the world to boycott us, as ridiculous as it sounds,” Sapir Sluzker Amran, one of the participants, told CNN. … They're in denial, and I think the best way to get out of this denial is to keep shocking them until everyone faces the horrible truth that we are committing genocide.” In September, an independent UN inquiry concluded for the first time that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a finding which the Israeli government has rejected. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he would not move forward with the entirety of the Trump administration's ceasefire plan until all hostages are freed. “Only then will we proceed to any other clause,” Netanyahu added. He was speaking to Israel's Heroes Forum, a group of families whose loved ones were killed during Hamas' October 7 attacks or in the war in Gaza that followed. A total of 251 people in Israel were taken on October 7. This is how many are still there as of today. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to start tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to an Egyptian official and three Israeli sources. These negotiations, also known as proximity talks, are a critical step in finalizing an agreement based on US President Donald Trump's 20-point ceasefire proposal.</p>

Top Trump administration adviser Stephen Miller was accused of spreading dangerous “propaganda” Saturday night regarding the federal judge who ruled that the White House could not deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The White House deputy chief of staff accused U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, of “legal insurrection” after she found that the president's claims about violent protests at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland were “untethered to facts,” and that residents' expressions of opposition to ICE do not meet the high legal standard for calling the National Guard. Miller claimed authorities in Oregon and Portland are aiding “an organized terrorist attack on the federal government and its officers” by refusing to aid ICE agents, and claimed Immergut was attempting to assume the role of “commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces” by siding with state officials and issuing a temporary restraining order blocking the National Guard deployment, which was expected to begin this weekend.

Crowds have dispersed quickly during the daytime, while at night federal officers have sometimes used tear gas and other weapons to move people away from the building. The Portland police have reported 27 arrests since early June at the protests, and at least two dozen people have been arrested by federal officers. The judge added that the U.S  “has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs… This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law. Miller's accusation that Immergut was taking part in a “legal insurrection” by rejecting Trump's false claims about the nature of the protests was “reckless,” said California Gov. This kind of rhetoric is incredibly dangerous for the judge. The Trump administration on Saturday night appealed Immergut's ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously ruled that Trump could send the National Guard to Los Angeles to stop anti-ICE protests after a federal judge had decided that deployment should be halted. Since the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last month, the president and his allies have insisted that left-wing groups are fomenting violence, with Trump signing an executive order falsely claiming he has the authority to designate “antifa” as a “domestic terrorist organization” — despite the fact that no “antifa” organization exists. The president also signed National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7), which mandates a “national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts.” On Saturday, Miller said on Newsmax that the administration intends to apply NSPM-7 in Portland, initiating investigations into what he called a “domestic terrorist network” whenever federal agents make an arrest at a protest. NSPM-7 will be applied to Portland, Trump's homeland security advisor Stephen Miller says.STEPHEN MILLER:  Every time we make an arrest, we are initiating an investigation into the entire domestic terrorist network. Miller, said investigative reporter Jim Stewartson, “collapsed Democrats, ‘far-left Democrat judges', and ‘antifa' into a single domestic terror threat as a pretext for mass arrests.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many families who lost nearly everything to the storm are still slogging through red tape a year later. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. This story was originally published by ProPublica and The Assembly. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Slogging through a thick slop of mud and rock, Brian Hill passed the roof that Hurricane Helene's floodwaters had just ripped off someone's barn and dumped into his yard. Then he peered into the unrecognizable chaos inside what had been his family's dream home. Brian and his wife, Susie, had just bought the house a year earlier. They had a 30-year mortgage — and, now, no house to live in. Because their home didn't sit in the 100-year floodplain, they had not purchased flood insurance. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. FEMA doles out financial help after a major disaster for everything from home repairs to rental assistance. Once she could get a cell signal, Susie applied. They received close to $40,000, just shy of the maximum amount FEMA provides for rebuilding and repairs. But farther up Cattail Creek, a man whose wife was killed in floodwaters said he checked his FEMA application one day and noticed it was marked “withdrawn,” a surprise since he'd received no explanation. Elsewhere in Yancey, another man said he realized FEMA had denied him aid because his birthdate was a year off on his application. A third man said his application — which he filled out just days after hiking down a mountain severely injured — seemingly vanished from the system. FEMA's application process can be onerous, particularly for people who've lost their homes. And it can be especially daunting for those with lower incomes who may have fewer resources. A ProPublica investigation earlier this year found that despite dire warnings from the National Weather Service, many people in Yancey were unaware of the enormity of danger Helene posed. Households in the middle range tended to get about as much FEMA housing assistance money as the lower-income ones, or even a little less. But experts say the Hills did have something in common with the highest-income households: They had the luxury of time to pursue every dollar of federal aid that they were qualified to receive. That's because they received full pay for seven weeks while schools were closed. That allowed them to navigate FEMA's bureaucracy during a crucial time when, for many others, pursuing the aid felt insurmountable. Our analysis looked at counties with the highest per-capita rate of households receiving FEMA aid for housing assistance, an indicator of where Helene hit people the hardest. Apart from Buncombe County — home to Asheville and by far the most urban county in the region — lower- and middle-income households overall got lower amounts of this aid compared to the highest-income earners. In some counties, the highest-income homeowners received two to three times as much housing assistance as those with lower incomes. Yet income isn't supposed to play a role. FEMA aid for home repairs and rebuilding is intended to help begin replacing a primary home or make it safe and habitable again, not restore one to its prior state. FEMA did not respond to ProPublica and The Assembly's requests for comment. The agency previously told the Government Accountability Office, according to a 2020 report, that it encourages all survivors with property damage to apply, and those with minimal damage are “driving down the average award amount.” Disparities in who receives FEMA aid have long been known to researchers, including Sarah Labowitz, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies and writes about disasters and publishes the Disaster Dollar Database. “Disasters pull back the curtain on inequity,” Labowitz said. “It's a vicious combination of things that make it so much harder for people without a lot of money to get what they need from FEMA.” She pointed to FEMA inspectors who undervalue damage to more modest homes, FEMA's onerous documentation requirements and a “brutal and discouraging” appeals process. Several years ago, NPR obtained an internal FEMA analysis showing that the poorest homeowners received about half as much to rebuild their homes compared with higher-income homeowners. The 2020 GAO report noted that homeowners in communities with the most socioeconomic vulnerabilities, like being below the poverty line and not having a high school diploma, received significantly less assistance than those in less vulnerable communities. The disparity we found in Yancey was equally striking in Haywood County, where water flows down 13 peaks towering above 6,000 feet. Like the Hills, they returned to find their house had been filled with water. They too had lost virtually everything, down to their wedding photographs. That time, their house had been rebuilt by a state-run program. When Helene hit just a year after they got back into their home, they decided the risk of rebuilding was too great. Jeff, a former wastewater treatment plant operator, was on disability. They applied for a hazard mitigation buyout, another program offered through FEMA, instead. But that process could take years, and their home was unlivable. The couples' situations diverged in important ways, and they applied for different pots of FEMA housing assistance. But their journeys underscore how disaster survivors with varying resources are able to navigate FEMA's application process. Susie and Michelle spent hours plodding through FEMA's online system, uploading documents, deciphering bureaucratic letters and making myriad phone calls to the agency. After weeks of pestering FEMA, the Hills received just under the maximum $42,500 for home repair and rebuild assistance for damage to things like the home's walls, windows and doors, plus about $9,000 from other FEMA aid programs. The money played a critical role in helping them start rebuilding. Then Jeff died from cardiac arrest in June at age 56. Michelle felt like she was operating in a fog. So when FEMA's call wait times soared to two to three hours after the deadly Texas floods on July 4, she gave up on pursuing additional rental assistance from FEMA. After disasters strike, households with lower incomes can face major challenges, beginning with the early steps of the rebuilding process, which include finding temporary housing and transportation. Some residents lack reliable internet access or cell service. Throw in the added hurdles of rugged topography, and western North Carolina posed particular challenges to those faced with rebuilding after Helene. Alicia Edwards, who directs the Disaster Relief Project for Legal Aid of North Carolina, said she wasn't surprised by our analysis, which found that in six of the 10 counties most impacted by Helene, the lowest-income households got less in FEMA's housing assistance than those at the highest income level. “People with lower incomes are at a huge disadvantage,” Edwards said. And it can feel downright impossible to navigate for those with less money or other resources. In Buncombe County, our analysis found the opposite trend. The lowest-income families there typically received more housing assistance than those with higher incomes. Pisgah Legal Services has had an office in Asheville for decades. The region also is home to both higher-income retirees, who can have more free time and more experience navigating complicated finances, and lower-income multigenerational families. In more rural areas, many of the latter tend to distrust the federal government and are reluctant to pursue assistance, said Morgan Monshaugen, disaster recovery program director with the Housing Assistance Corp., a nonprofit that serves Henderson, Polk and Transylvania counties. The month before Helene struck, Tulane University researchers released a literature review of 25 years of research on barriers to equitable disaster recovery. They noted common themes, including the confusing aid process and challenges navigating bureaucracies. They also pointed to research that shows inspectors' biases and time pressures can play a role. Before 2020, inspectors would go through a long checklist of items that could qualify for repair or replacement money. After FEMA changed that system, inspectors now record notes about standardized factors such as roof damage and the height of flood marks inside. Some households get additional money for things like heating, venting and air conditioning or septic systems. But she worries biases can still creep in. “If they feel you are a credible person, they could give you a little more assistance, even subconsciously,” she said. It isn't always obvious that survivors can appeal — an even more arduous process for many. Susie Hill knew her family would need every dollar they could get to rebuild. So she filled out a FEMA application online and talked to someone at the agency by phone. Slowly, aid from FEMA started arriving in their bank account — $3,514 first, a set amount for people displaced, then an initial $13,687 for home repair. As hope for more aid began to fizzle, Susie pestered FEMA. “I was anxious about getting lost in the mix of so many people across the region in need,” she said. They set up a GoFundMe campaign that raised more than $53,000. And finally, in late November, they came close to reaching the maximum $42,500 payout from FEMA for home repairs, along with smaller amounts from the agency's other aid buckets. “Unfortunately,” Susie said, “I think it is a bit of a socioeconomic situation where we have jobs, where we know people that know people, that maybe have money or that are able to help us, or that have the skills to help us, where other people are just trying to make it day to day.” Yancey is home to the most families per capita — about 175, or roughly 1 in 36 homeowners — who got the top amount of FEMA home rebuild and repair assistance. The Hills had decided to relocate their historic house to a spot on their property farther back from the creek. The FEMA money would cover most of that cost, a critical first step toward gutting it and rebuilding. On an icy cold day in mid-January, house movers put I-beams underneath the water-damaged structure and used hydraulic lifts to raise it. Susie had to wash their clothes at the elementary school where she works. For other things, they used water carried from a neighbor's well. Jeff had fractured his ankle two months before the storm and used a wheelchair. They weren't taking chances after fleeing their home under darkness — Michelle carrying their two Chihuahuas, one under each arm — when Tropical Storm Fred hit three years earlier. When they returned home after Helene, their shed was gone. Instead, other people's structures lay in their yard. Inside, the contents looked like everything had been spun around. Michelle remembers FEMA offering a free hotel, more than 60 miles away in Tennessee, a distance made farther as Helene's waters took out parts of Interstate 40. The rent for that gravel parking space is $900 a month. Donors paid half, but Michelle has to come up with the rest. She requested more rental assistance and uploaded an employer letter, a rental agreement, utility bills and a rent receipt. FEMA has faced years of criticism from people applying for assistance. Chief among their complaints: inconsistent payouts, the onerous application process, incomprehensible communication and confusing rules. He's struggled to find a job and has grappled with a FEMA application, complicated by deaths in his family and property ownership issues. It doesn't help that he's reluctant to ask for help, much less aggressively seek it from the federal government. Just plowing through each day is hard enough. “Everyone is so eaten up with PTSD,” Isom said. FEMA has been working on improving its application process. From 2021 to 2024, it announced changes aimed at improving access and equity, including making home repair money available to underinsured households. Another change cut an onerous rule requiring applicants to first apply for a U.S. Small Business Administration loan, which approved less than 4% of all applicants from 2016 to 2018. Before President Donald Trump took office in January, FEMA also had spent more than a year hiring a team of engineers, designers and product managers to help modernize the online application process. Michael Coen, the agency's chief of staff when the team was formed, noted that people are used to going on Amazon and getting updates about when their order is out for delivery and when it's about to arrive. Coen said survivors wonder, “Why can't FEMA do that?” “They all are gone,” said Alexandra Ferčak, who until May was chief of service delivery enhancement, part of a relatively new office at FEMA. “We had so much knowledge and expertise, it was unprecedented,” she said. Without that in-house expertise, major changes are “not going to be effective,” said a FEMA employee who worked with the team but asked not to be named out of fear of retribution. FEMA did not respond to questions about the team. But in late August, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed a public letter to Congress warning that cuts to the agency's full-time staff risk kneecapping its disaster response capabilities. In response, Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes FEMA, said she is working hard to “streamline this bloated organization into a tool that actually benefits Americans in crisis.” The agency then suspended most who had signed their names to the letter. The Hills had their house moved back from Cattail Creek and temporarily propped up until they could get a new foundation laid. Heavy rain triggered flashbacks to Helene, and in February it poured. A retired contractor from Texas volunteering his skills had become the guiding force in their rebuilding. Volunteers from other states also showed up to help. They asked what the Hills wanted in their house. The Hills mostly wanted to add a bathroom so that their daughter, Lucy, who was 9 at the time, would have her own. When they left, the Hills went out to dinner using a gift card and declared it the best day ever, or at least something that had been hard to come by since the storm: a great day. A few months later, a feeling of hope spread across western North Carolina as the dogwoods and redbuds bloomed in puffs of purple and white. Friends and volunteers became fixtures at the Hills' house. Brian spent every spare minute working on repairs as well. Without that initial FEMA money, the Hills' wrecked house might still be sitting in the moonscape of mud and destruction that persists along Cattail Creek. Instead, as summer waned, the house had electricity, siding, floors, insulation, drywall — and a bathroom for Lucy. On this one-year anniversary of Helene's destruction, the Hills expect to move back in any day. In November, that assistance will come to an end. Other nonprofits like United Way and Salvation Army have offered to help cover some of the home's expenses, but Michelle still must come up with $81,000 not yet covered by her insurance or donations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US treasury is planning to mint a $1 coin featuring Donald Trump to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence next year. Draft designs show Mr Trump's side-profile, surrounded by the word “liberty”. The opposite side depicts Mr Trump standing with a clenched fist in front of an American flag and the words “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT”, which he shouted after surviving the assassination attempt last year. Although a final design has not yet been decided on, the coin is intended to reflect the “enduring spirit” of America, a treasury department spokesman told Politico. “While a final $1 coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States' semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.” Brandon Beach, the US treasurer, confirmed reports about the proposed coin were accurate, writing on X: “No fake news here. These first drafts honouring America's 250th birthday and @POTUS are real. Presidents may only feature on a coin two or more years after they have died, according to the US code governing coin design. Republicans have also introduced a bill to rename the Kennedy Centre, which Mr Trump took over as chairman in February, the “Donald J Trump Centre for Performing Arts”. Responding to questions about the ceremonial coin on Friday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters she wasn't sure whether Mr Trump was aware of the plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland security secretary takes aim at city's mayor who has called deployment of national guard ‘unhinged' Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, called Chicago “a war zone” on Sunday after federal agents shot a woman and the governor of Illinois accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. Speaking on Fox News Sunday morning, Noem took aim at the city's mayor, Brandon Johnson, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's Ice raids and deployment of the national guard in Illinois, a measure he called “unhinged and unhealthy”. “It's wrong, there should be consequences for that and for leaders that stand up and knowingly lie about the situation on the ground,” Noem said. “His city is a war zone and he's lying so that criminals can go in there and destroy people's lives.” The move came just weeks after national guard troops were sent to Washington, where the president federalized the city's police force in what he described as a “crackdown” on crime, a pattern now extending to a string of other US cities. “We're going to be doing Chicago probably next,” Trump had said at the time. “People are much safer, we have got a thousand criminals that are off the streets of Chicago, just because we've been there.” Border patrol agents on Saturday shot and injured a woman while firing at someone who tried to run them over. Pritzker also condemned the deployment in a post on X on Saturday, writing: “The Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.” Pritzker called the decision “absolutely outrageous and un-American,” and added that it had been made “against our will”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel and Hamas prepared for indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, as hopes for a possible ceasefire in Gaza began to build after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a truce and hostage release could be announced this week. Monday's discussions will focus on the proposed exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, Egypt's foreign ministry said. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is joining the talks, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief reporters. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the current situation is “the closest we've come to getting all of the hostages released.” But he warned that “there are a lot of opportunities here for whoever wants to sabotage it to do so.” Pro-Palestinian protests in Barcelona and Rome draw tens of thousands Netanyahu says he hopes to announce release of hostages from Gaza ‘in the coming days' Speaking on ABC's This Week, he described two phases after Hamas accepts Trump's framework: The hostages are released and Israel pulls back in Gaza to the “yellow line,” where it was in August. Rubio told CBS that Hamas should release hostages as they are ready, and that bombardment needs to end so they can be released. Trump also texted that Netanyahu was on board for ending the bombing and peace in Gaza but added, “soon on the rest.” “I hope that we are closest to a hostage deal since the (ceasefire) deal in January,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said in a speech Sunday. Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza City led many to fear for the hostages' lives. Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis on Sunday.Jehad Alshrafi/The Associated Press Rubio told ABC that decisions regarding a governing structure or international group to manage Gaza can take place simultaneously with the first step of the ceasefire. Trump has ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza, but residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the territory. Israel and Hamas prepare for negotiations in Egypt ahead of possible ceasefire. “While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time,” Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Badrosian told journalists. She also said Netanyahu is in “regular contact” with Trump and that the prime minister has stressed that the talks in Egypt “will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for manoeuvres that will delay talks by Hamas.” Four other people were shot dead near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser Hospital. The ministry does not differentiate how many of those killed were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up about half of the dead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US president's recent behavior is strange to many, from reposting a false AI video of himself to confusing comments during press conferences To many observers, both in the US and abroad, Donald Trump has been behaving strangely recently. Hispanic groups criticized Trump's posts as “racist”, “dangerous” and “reprehensible”, but Trump doubled down, posting a new video which showed himself wearing a sombrero and playing the guitar behind a rendering of Jeffries. It wasn't the only situation where Trump's behavior has seemed unusual. Last weekend Trump reposted to Truth Social an AI-generated fake video which promoted “med bed hospitals”. Trump has reposted AI content before, but the difference was that this video showed an AI version of himself speaking. “Every American will soon receive their own med bed card,” the AI rendering of Trump, apparently seated in the Oval Office, said. Setting aside the fact that the idea of “med beds” is a rightwing conspiracy theory – one version of the theory posits that the government and/or a group of wealthy Americans have access to medical bed-like devices that can cure almost every illness, but are withholding the technology – Trump's post prompted a number of questions. Did Trump, 79, believe that the video really showed him announcing med bed hospitals? “And he has the right to do that. You hear from him directly on social media. He likes to share memes, he likes to share videos, he likes to repost things that he sees other people post on social media as well and I think it's quite refreshing that we have a president who is so open and honest.” But, in truth, it was only the most recent example of increasingly odd behavior from Trump, who has – like his predecessor Joe Biden – been subject to questions over his mental acuity in recent months. In a recent speech at the White House where Trump claimed – against most existing evidence – that Tylenol could contribute to autism if women take it during pregnancy, Trump confusingly spoke of “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby”. I was just saying to Bobby [health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr] and the group, let's do it now. Back in the social media world, on Sunday Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had “been briefed” on a shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan which killed four people. But it was not an update on the still unfolding tragedy in Michigan. Instead, three hours later, he shared a video which showed an array of gold fixtures and fittings. Best Oval Office ever, in terms of success and look!!! He did not comment again that day on the Michigan shooting, although he did complain about the new NFL kickoff rule. Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters Setting aside Trump's confusing online behavior, the president's in-person appearances have also become odd. On Tuesday, Trump summoned the country's top military commanders to a meeting in Virginia. Addressing the top military brass, Trump, sounding drained, touted his alleged successes and lauded the US bombing of an Iran nuclear facility – something which may have violated international law – before saying: They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Trump continued: “I said: ‘It's not our president. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don't, don't bop down the stairs. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.” In the same speech, Trump claimed that cities including San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles are “very unsafe places and we're going to straighten them out one by one”. The president then casually mentioned that he had told Pete Hegseth, the newly-annointed secretary of war, that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military”. The address prompted immediate concern, including from former military members. Barry McCaffrey, a retired general, told MSNBC that Trump's performance was “one of the most bizarre, unsettling events I've ever encountered”. “The president sounded incoherent, exhausted, rabidly partisan, at times stupid, meandering, couldn't hold a thought together,” McCaffrey said. Trump's speech was enough for Madeleine Dean, a Democratic congresswoman from Pennsylvania, to confront the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, in Washington on Wednesday, although Johnson appeared unconcerned. He is unwell,” Dean told Johnson, in an encounter filmed by journalists. “Well a lot of folks on your side are too,” Johnson responded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United Kingdom, Germany, and France are seeking to stage a color revolution in Serbia to destabilize and divide the country, Milorad Dodik, President of the Republic of Srpska (one of the two constituent entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina), told TASS. "Now, no one rules out that it is about the so-called color revolution imposed from outside - by the British, Germans, and the French in a bid to weaken Serbia. According to Dodik, there are certain structures, which formally brand themselves as independent, but "are actually governed from external centers of power, which control relevant processes." "These processes involve a lot of people who, as a matter of fact, are acting against Serbia," he noted. "President [of Serbia Aleksandar] Vucic and his policy are supported by the electoral majority. This fact is acknowledged by everyone and if elections are held today, their results would demonstrate that the current Vucic-led authorities enjoy support to continue their work." "However, it should be noted that is these circles continue operating as they are instructed to or at their own initiative continue playing the role imposed on them, these elections will have no sense. At the same time, he drew attention to another process: "what has failed in Serbia is now unfolding in the Republic of Srpska." "A process against the Republic of Srpska president has been initiated via externally-imposed illegal, non-constitutional courts. "Obviously, they have lost a favorable moment. Some destabilizing factors may remain but Serbia and the Republic of Srpska will stay strong together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Law enforcement officers stand in tear gas outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility during a protest on Saturday, in Portland, Ore.Jenny Kane/The Associated Press “This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.” State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. Modest protest outside Portland ICE facility at odds with Trump's claims of chaos Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement – we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.” “It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president's war-torn fantasy. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theatre.” Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces. Opinion: Trump is turning the National Guard into his personal police force Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. Tear gas drifts by demonstrators outside during the protest on Saturday.Jenny Kane/The Associated Press The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 375 square kilometres and has about 636,000 residents. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. In Portland, fears grow that Trump's crackdown is coming and will make life worse Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police. Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. The government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.

MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. A potential US decision to supply Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may ruin the positive trend in relations between Russia and the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin in a comment.

"This (potential decision to send Tomahawk missiles to Kiev - TASS) will ruin our relations (between Russia and the United States - TASS), or at least the emerging positive trend in these relations," the Russian leader said.

Commenting on his speech at the plenary session of the Valdai Discussion Club on Thursday, Putin said he gave an honest overview of the situation. "And, well, how to react to that is up to my counterparts (Western leaders - TASS). I am always sincere in my speeches," he emphasized.

US Vice President JD Vandce confirmed on September 28 that Washington was considering providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to other NATO countries for a subsequent transfer to Ukraine. According to him, the final decision on the matter will be made by US President Donald Trump.</p>

KOFU — Craft beer brand Uchu Brewing, which does its brewing in the city of Hokuto, Yamanashi Prefecture, has won the World Beer Cup's top award for the best juicy or hazy pale ale. The winning beer features a fruity flavor and stylish label. It was created by two people who moved from Kochi Prefecture and studied brewing on their own, and who used “uchu,” meaning “space,” as their watchword. At the competition, thousands of beers entered from around the world are judged by category, and gold, silver and bronze awards are presented. This year's award ceremony was held in Indiana in May, and Uchu Brewing's flagship product, Uchu Relax, won gold for its hoppy aroma and hazy look. The brewery's founders, Masahiro Kusunose and Rumiko Suzuki, met through design work in Kochi Prefecture and moved to Hokuto about 15 years ago. Believing that “all activity on earth, from humans to microorganisms, is an expression of the cosmos,” they called themselves “space farmers” and began cultivating food without pesticides. They also worked on fermented foods like miso and koji rice mold. The turning point came in 2016 when the pair visited Portland, Ore. At a local brewpub, they tasted American beers with hoppy aromas and varying levels of alcohol, and they were shocked by the rich flavors. After returning to Japan, they began growing hops and discovered that Hokuto was once a major area for the crop. Suzuki felt it was fate and fully immersed herself in brewing. They began full-scale production, importing high-quality hops from the United States and elsewhere. Initially, they only sold their beers online, not at the brewery. “I want to create a one-of-a-kind beer that surprises people with its fruity taste,” said an enthusiastic Kusunose. Some of the company's labels feature fantastic colors on a black background, and the beers have such distinctive names as “Ukiyoe” and “Ronin.” “Our beer was created as an expression of the cosmos, and we want more people to experience joy and surprise at how good it tastes,” Kusunose said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having Ukraine separate Hungary from Russia is in Budapest's interest, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview with Hetek published Oct. 4. This is a strategic interest of Hungary that Ukraine exists. Despite Orban's latest remarks, the Hungarian leader on Sept. 29 claimed that Ukraine is not a sovereign state amid allegations from Kyiv that Hungarian drones had violated Ukraine's airspace. Orban has repeatedly voiced opposition to Ukraine's EU bid and for the bloc's support to Kyiv as it fends off Russia's war. Not a membership, but an agreement," Orban said in the interview. On Oct. 3, Orban said that Hungary will oppose Ukraine's accession to the EU, claiming that admitting Kyiv would drag the bloc into war with Russia. We have our own fate, which is much easier than that of the Ukrainians," he said. Orban on Oct. 3 also voiced opposition to the EU providing Ukraine with long-term military and financial aid, calling it "an illusion" based on false assumptions about Russia's economic collapse. Hungary has repeatedly vetoed EU sanctions against Moscow in response to Russia's war against Ukraine and is currently preventing progress in Ukraine's EU accession. In response, EU officials are exploring reforms to the bloc's unanimous decision-making process, which would allow accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova to continue despite the Hungarian veto, Politico reported on Sept. 29.

Russia launched 500 drones and 50 missiles, including ballistic ones, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on the wave of unidentified drone sightings across Europe — from Denmark to France — that have sparked airport closures, military investigations, and renewed calls to shoot them down. Putin's message comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a more hostile stance against Russia in recent weeks after a summer of courtship that saw the U.S. roll out the red carpet for Putin during the Alaskan Summit in August. The bombing campaign hit an apartment building, injuring two women, three men, and a child. This is a strategic interest of Hungary that Ukraine exists," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. Lithuania's main airport was closed late on Oct. 4 following a sighting of 13 "contraband" balloons flying towards the site, Lithuanian outlet LRT reported. Ano party leader and billionaire Andrej Babis said on Oct. 4 that Ukraine is "not ready" to join the EU and that the Czech ammunition initiative should be taken over by NATO. One of the sanctioned companies is Hardberry-Rusfactor, which produces drones and counter-UAV systems as well as neural network systems for automatic equipment recognition and target designation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lithuania's main airport was closed late on Oct. 4 following a sighting of 13 "contraband" balloons flying towards the site, Lithuanian outlet LRT reported. Unidentified drones have violated European airspace several times in recent weeks, prompting airport closures throughout the continent. Russia has been increasingly suspected of being behind the drone sightings over NATO territory, following known Russian violations of the defense alliance's Eastern Flank in September. Flying objects were detected near Baltoji Voke, with disruptions expected to last several hours, Vilmantas Vitkauskas, head of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center (NKVC), told LRT. Vilnius itself is situated only 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the country's border with Belarus. Drone sightings have also caused disruptions in several other European countries, including Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, authorities have not ruled out that the drones may be Russian. Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory in a first for any NATO member in over three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Russian drones again violated EU and NATO airspace, flying over Romanian territory on Sept. 13 Three Russian jets violated Estonian airspace on Sept. 19 in an escalation from drones as Moscow continues its provocations.
