                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that layoffs for federal employees will begin if President Donald Trump decides that congressional negotiations to end the government shutdown "are absolutely going nowhere." His comments come as the government shutdown enters its fifth day, with no clear offramp in sight. Democrats are holding their ground on their health-care demands, pushing to include a permanent extension of enhanced premium tax credits in any government funding legislation. Republicans, however, argue that those conversations should happen in December — not as part of government shutdown negotiations — escalating the standoff. Democrats continue to dig in on their demands as the shutdown enters a new week. The Senate again on Friday failed to pass two funding bills that would have ended the shutdown. The Republican measure would have funded the government through late November, while Democrats' version included additional health-care funding. The Trump administration has repeatedly warned of mass layoffs during a government shutdown, saying last week that they would be "imminent." Trump also said that the shutdown offered him an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash the size of federal agencies and lay off government workers, although the administration has not yet followed through on its threat. Hassett said Sunday that Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought are "lining things up and getting ready to act if they have to, but hoping that they don't." Still, Hassett expressed optimism that negotiations this week could resolve the impasse. "We think the Democrats, there's a chance that they'll be reasonable once they get back into town on Monday," Hassett said on CNN. "And if they are, then I think there's no reason for those layoffs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift gave the box office a boost this weekend. In partnership with AMC, the singer-songwriter brought a 90-minute movie to cinemas for one weekend only to celebrate the release of her 12th album, "The Life of a Showgirl." The three-day event tallied an estimated $33 million domestically, the biggest album debut event in cinema history. "On behalf of AMC Theatres and the entire theatrical exhibition industry, I extend our sincerest appreciation to the iconic Taylor Swift for bringing her brilliance and magic to movie theatres this weekend," AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement Sunday. "Her vision to add a cinematic element to her incredible album debut was nothing less than a triumph." This is the second collaboration between Swift and AMC. In 2023, the theater chain secured the rights to distribute a filmed version of Swift's Eras Tour concert. It is currently the highest-grossing concert film of all time. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel and Hamas prepared for indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, as hopes for a possible ceasefire began to build and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a truce and hostage release could take shape this week. Egypt will host delegations from Israel and Hamas on Monday to discuss the proposed exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, the country's foreign ministry said. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is also joining the talks, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief reporters. Speaking on ABC's "This Week,'' he described two phases after Hamas accepts Trump's framework: the hostages are released and Israel pulls back to the "yellow line," where it was in August 2024. The foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issued a joint statement Sunday welcoming steps toward a possible ceasefire. They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, and reaching an agreement on security leading to a "full Israeli withdrawal" from Gaza. Rubio noted that these decisions regarding a governing structure or international group to manage Gaza can take place simultaneously with the first step of the ceasefire, an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. "That's the part that I think is goin; g to be a little tougher to work through, but that's what's going to provide permanency to the end of the conflict," he said. Trump has also ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza, but residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the Gaza Strip over the weekend. "While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time," Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Badrosian told journalists. She also said Netanyahu is in "regular contact" with Trump and that the prime minister has stressed that the talks in Egypt "will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for maneuvers that will delay talks by Hamas." Half of them were killed in a strike that hit a group of people in Gaza City, the hospital said. Four people also were killed in a shooting near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser hospital. "We're on the brink, and we don't know whether one will die of a strike or starvation," said Mahmoud Hashem, a Palestinian father of five, who is forced to shelter in a tent in the center of Gaza City. Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war reached 67,139 on Sunday, with nearly 170,000 injured. The Health Ministry does not differentiate how many of those killed were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up about half of the dead. Rubio said the U.S. will look into Israel's operations over the weekend, because Israel cannot be engaged in active combat if they are moving toward a deal. "The Israelis have said that they would only deal with imminent threats, so we'll look into any of that because that's going to be a key component," Rubio said. "We have to make sure Hamas is also doing their part in this regard. But, there are a lot of opportunities here for whoever wants to sabotage it to do so," he added. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pillow soft sand dunes shift and shape along the shores of Lake Michigan. "It is a beautiful natural environment with gorgeous sand dunes that you don't see in other parts of the world," says Daywi Cook, whose family has lived in this area for five generations. Small modular reactors are factory-built nuclear power plants that are much smaller than traditional reactors (typically 300 megawatts or less). "There are still some unknowns but Holtec has been inviting us into the conversation," said Cook, who is the township supervisor. Holtec did not respond to a request for comment. "We are known as the Catskills of Chicago. There are a lot of short-term rentals that boom in the summer," Cook said, which she explained then sit empty in the winter. "It would be nice to have year-round stability," Cook added. Zach Morris, executive director of Market One, a local association of business and government leaders that promotes economic growth in Cass and Van Buren Counties, Michigan, says that the area is uniquely positioned to be the leading edge of the nation's nuclear renaissance. Morris says the recommissioned legacy nuclear plant will employ 600 people, and the two SMRs will employ a combined 300 people with salaries averaging $107,000. And with the area's nuclear past, there's been little opposition to the arrival of SMRs, which he pointed out have been around for awhile, used in the military for years in submarines and aircraft carriers. "This is not a new technology, but there has not been a need for it until now," Morris said. "We have a national issue, it is a national crisis that we didn't anticipate five years ago," Morris said. Their collective genius didn't anticipate this," he said of data centers coming online without enough power and people who don't want to give up their AI, streaming services, or cameras. To illustrate how much the world of power generation has been upended in short order, Morris offers a stark comparison. "Five years ago we were worried about how we were going to put up with the demand from a 20 megawatt marijuana farm," he said, referring to a planned cannabis operation, and adding, "that is a fraction of what the data centers are asking for." People are using AI for everything from identifying the animal tracks in their backyard to analyzing 10 years of sales data for corporate reports. And the demand for data centers — constructed by tech titans Google, Amazon, and others — has led to a torrent of demand for electricity. While the industry works on smaller, scalable nuclear solutions, big tech is taking decommissioned legacy plants out of mothballs. Constellation Energy plans to restart the 835-MW Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear generating station in Pennsylvania in 2028, with Microsoft agreeing to buy electricity from the reactivated power plant to power their data centers. And Google recently entered into an agreement with Kairos Power and the TVA for a new nuclear plant. Bill Gates has been among the tech titans leading the charge, investing $1 billion in the technology and co-founding TerraPower, which is building a next generation nuclear plant in Wyoming. Gate's company also announced plans recently to explore building a nuclear facility in Kansas. "Both fission and fusion are fundamental technologies for humanity to power everything we do. We're on the cusp of massive breakthroughs, and it's clearer now than even before: The future of energy is subatomic," Gates wrote in Power Magazine this week. Oklo, which OpenAI's Sam Altman helped to take public before stepping back from his role as chairman in April, remains a highly speculative public stock market play on the nuclear potential, with no revenue or power purchase agreements, and is at least several years away from commercial operations. Much of the industry excitement surrounds SMRs and their commercial deployment. Everett Hansen, vice-president of energy and power for Marsh, a leading insurance broker that helps businesses manage risk and secure coverage, sees nuclear, whether it is an SMR or a legacy system, as a safe bet. "Their design is incredibly thorough and detailed," he added. Hansen says that part of the design process is exhaustive loss modeling and casualty analysis. Casualty in the industry parlance refers to an "incident," and in the analysis a casualty could be something minor to very severe. Hansen says that when it comes to nuclear, people's reaction is to think of it on its worst day. There are not many things that could happen in a nuclear plant which are unknown or haven't been looked at," Hansen said. "The effective management of physical hazards, financial risks, strategy risks, all of that materially contributes to the commercial pathways being viable," Hansen said, describing himself as "optimistic" about the SMRs' viability. There is the expense of deploying SMRs, but Hansen thinks that, too, will be overcome. "The assets are very expensive to construct, and SMRs are trying to get at that problem by reducing product capex. Costs should come down over time after the first builds as developers act on plans to scale the business model. "Collectively we will all be surprised a year or a few years from now with respect to what has changed. Still, opinions vary about how ready SMRs are for prime time. Whit Johnson, a Salt Lake City-based partner at Foley & Lardner LLP, who counsels a portfolio of tech clients, agrees that the specter of nuclear disasters haunt to this day, but the industry has seen many changes since then. "Nuclear power is not what it was nearly 40 years ago when the Chernobyl meltdown created fear for many about nuclear power. The technology has come a long, long way," Johnson said, comparing today's nuclear with dial-up internet vs. cloud computing. "Still, there remains in the public perception a lingering stigma about nuclear power, but it may be time to create an opportunity for society to rethink nuclear," Johnson said. "While SMRs clearly offer potential, their viability remains largely based on projections, not operational evidence," said Gilbert Michaud, assistant professor of environmental policy at the School of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University Chicago, and Coordinator of the School's "Climate & Energy" Focus Area. "The regulatory framework for nuclear is based on large reactors, and adapting rules for SMRs remains a work in progress," he said. Before widespread deployment of SMRs, Michaud said more planning and preparation protocols are needed. "Deploying these in or near populated areas necessitates the need for better emergency preparedness and better public trust," he said, with fuel handling and storage, and mitigating cyber threats among issues that require better testing and better data. That leads him to believe widespread deployment of SMRs will take longer than the most optimistic forecasts. Widespread commercial rollout may be slow," Michaud said. Even by the 2030s, SMRs are likely to be pilot projects at industrial sites and not tucked away in a strip mall or subdivision, according to Michaud, with costs, financing challenges and maintaining an adequate supply chain among key obstacles. Because they are unproven at scale, projects are likely to go over budget, and these dollars could have been invested in proven technologies like wind, solar, and storage. This provides risk to energy developers, utilities, and even ratepayers," Michaud says. An SMR planned in Idaho last year was cancelled due to multiple factors, including cost overruns. The Palisades plant in Michigan, meanwhile, needs major repairs to restart safely, according to regulatory filing made by Holtec. A Pew poll from last August found a majority of Americans (56%) in support of more nuclear power for electricity generation. That was unchanged year over year, and Pew noted that Americans remain more likely to favor expanding solar power and wind power. But the public support for nuclear has increased from 43% a decade ago, while overall support for solar and wind power has declined by double digits in recent years, according to Pew, as more Republicans voice support for nuclear power. "With SMRs you will get more skepticism because it is newer technology and there will be questions," Cook said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. We're done,'" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, "10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World," published on September 2. Twenge has spent much of the past decade warning parents about the risks of giving young adolescents unlimited access to smartphones and social media. She's cited research connecting their usage to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, including anxiety and depression. Some other parenting and medical experts have issued similar warnings: In 2023, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory warning that the risks of social media and connected devices have helped create "a national youth mental health crisis," for example. In her book, Twenge advocates for parents to wait as long as possible before handing over smartphones to their kids, or allowing them on social media platforms. She recommends keeping kids from joining social media until they're 16 or older, and from having full access to their own smartphone until they have a driver's license and are expected to "get around independently." But banning devices from kids' rooms overnight is her No. 1 rule because of its potential to improve their sleep habits, she says. Doing so is "absolutely crucial for both physical and mental health," she notes in her book. "No devices in the bedroom overnight is very straightforward and costs nothing." Devices in bedrooms can easily cut into sleeping time, whether your teen puts off shutting their eyes to continue scrolling through social media or the sounds of notifications keep waking them up, research shows. More than two-thirds of adolescents surveyed by Common Sense Media in 2023 reported missing out on sleep "sometimes" or "often" due to using phones or other devices late at night in their bedrooms. "Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed," Twenge writes in her book. Looking at screens in bed is connected to higher rates of mental and physical health issues for adults, too. "If you can only do one thing, [this rule] might end up making the biggest difference," says Twenge. Any of Twenge's rules will likely be met with resistance from kids, especially teenagers who already regularly use their smartphones and other devices at all times of day, she says. You can more easily implement and enforce these types of policies by communicating them to your kids at an early age, she advises. Twenge recommends having conversations about the dangers of smartphones — and the need for strict rules around their use — as soon as elementary school. "Kids are getting these devices younger and younger" and your child might have friends who are already using connected devices at that age, she says. Parents of older kids can also backtrack and put new, stricter rules in place. That's what Twenge did with her own three teenage daughters, after initially allowing them to use their laptops overnight, she says. Retroactively establishing strict rules isn't easy, she adds: "The first few days might be tough, and you might get some slammed doors." Her advice is to be transparent, but firm, about your decision process. "You should be honest with your kid [and say], 'Look, I made a mistake. Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fears about the impact of a government shutdown, a slowing labor market, and elevated stock valuations are weighing on investor sentiment. Given the ongoing uncertainty, investors looking for stable returns can consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios. Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help investors pick stocks of dividend-paying companies that have strong fundamentals to support consistent dividend payments. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. First on this week's dividend list is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP), a global infrastructure company that owns and operates diversified, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, midstream, and data sectors. Following the recently held Investor Day event, BMO Capital analyst Devin Dodge reiterated a buy rating on Brookfield Infrastructure stock with a price forecast of $42. Dodge highlighted that the number of high-growth platforms in BIP's portfolio continues to increase, and there are significant investment opportunities across most of its sectors. In particular, he mentioned the robust digital infrastructure investment opportunity. With hyperscalers' capital spending estimated to increase by 50% this year, there is a strong growth potential for BIP's data center platforms over the intermediate term. The analyst pointed out that BIP's funds from operations per unit (FFO/unit) growth is nearing an inflection point. He noted that over the past five years, BIP's FFO/unit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% despite foreign exchange headwinds and high interest rates. However, Dodge expects these challenges to ease in the near term, which could drive visible FFO growth. 377 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. We move to Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. Ares pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share. In an update on business development companies, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on Ares Capital stock with a price target of $24. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on ARCC stock with a price target of $25. In the current scenario, Lee prefers ARCC, Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL), and Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) stocks. "ARCC has a long track record of successfully managing risks through cycles," noted Lee. The 5-star analyst specified that ARCC is a market-leading BDC with scale. He believes that the company's access to the Ares global credit platform is one of its major competitive advantages. Lee is confident about Ares Capital's potential to generate above peer-average return on equity. Lee views Ares Capital's experienced senior management team as one of its key strengths. He also pointed out that ARCC's dividends are backed by the company's core earnings per share generation and potential net realized gains. Finally, let's look at ONE Gas (OGS), a 100% regulated natural gas utility that provides affordable energy to over 2.3 million customers in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Recently, Mizuho analyst Gabe Moreen upgraded OGS stock to buy from hold and increased his price forecast to $86 from $77, citing several reasons, such as the benefits from the Texas HB 4384 legislation (enables recovery of certain costs associated with a gas utility's plant, facilities, or equipment placed in service) and lower interest rates. Moreen sees the possibility of HB 4384 generating a full-year benefit of about 18 cents in incremental EPS in fiscal 2026. He added that this benefit is not one-time in nature, and will grow with ONE Gas' yearly Texas capital spending. It is worth noting that Texas constitutes about 32% of OGS' rate base. "We believe this will place a floor under OGS' growth outlook at the higher-end of its 4-6%," said Moreen. The top-rated analyst noted that elevated short-term interest rates were one of the reasons that forced OGS to revise its guidance in 2023 and 2024. He expects the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts to benefit the company, as they will ease relative interest expense from prior periods. Additionally, Moreen highlighted notable growth opportunities for OGS, thanks to the growing natural gas demand from data centers and advanced manufacturers. He believes that all these catalysts, along with a growing customer base and a solid balance sheet, make OGS stock an attractive pick at the current valuation. In fact, Moreen expects OGS to rebound to its historical premium valuation levels, at which the stock traded before the company restated its guidance in 2023 and 2024.

On a clear Saturday afternoon, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, two California-based companies focused on making electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, or eVTOLs — pronounced ee-vee-tols — demonstrated their aircraft in front of a public crowd for the first time at the California International Airshow in Monterey County. The 10-minute demos came and went with nothing more than a pither. That's one of the main selling points for Joby and Archer. The companies are envisioning a ride-share-like service in dense urban regions — except they're relying on a zero-emissions, all-electric aircraft to transport passengers. To achieve public acceptance of a fleet of small aircraft constantly hovering over people's heads, noise — along with safety — is among the top priorities. "It almost sounds like a whoosh," Didier Papadopoulos, Joby's president of aircraft OEM, told Business Insider at the airshow. Public opinion is only part of the hurdle. EVTOLs are a capital-intensive and highly regulated space. Companies undergo numerous tests and, in the US, must obtain several certifications to demonstrate airworthiness to the Federal Aviation Administration. Archer, a seven-year-old company, announced in May that it would partner with the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics to transport VIPs and fans between key venues for the games, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and other visitor hubs such as the Los Angeles International Airport. An Archer Aviation representative could not be reached for comment during the weekend. Joby's aircraft features six tilting propellers that can rotate mid-flight, enabling the vehicle to seamlessly transition from vertical takeoff to forward flight. It also allows the aircraft to hover in place. The cockpit of Joby's eVTOL was designed to be simple, Papadopoulos told BI. The simplicity is intended to make flying Joby feel intuitive. "This is one of the most advanced fly-by-wire flight control systems that you would see. It takes them about 20 minutes in the simulator of flying, and they are like totally natural." Archer's "Midnight" eVTOL demonstrated a conventional, non-vertical take-off, starting on a runway before taking flight during the 10-minute demonstration at the airshow. Archer Aviation envisions cutting down travel time, such as commutes between Newark Liberty International Airport and downtown Manhattan — a corridor currently served by noisier helicopters — to under 10 minutes. Papadopoulos, the Joby executive, told BI that the company's eVTOL has demonstrated a 150-mile range, but the purpose is more optimized for short, critical, and high-density missions that are often 20 to 30 miles long. "Last week, I was in Japan at the Osaka World Expo," he said. It would've taken eight minutes exactly if I took this aircraft."</p>
