Follow:


            If you go to Japan, there's a chance you might meet someone with an unusual name – such as “Nike,” “Pikachu” or “Pudding.”
    


            While still a minority, these names have grown in popularity over recent decades as parents reject traditional Japanese names for something more unique.
    


            But the practice has also drawn criticism – mainly that it's confusing for hospitals, schools and authorities who don't know how to pronounce them.
    


            Now the government is cracking down on these so-called “kirakira” names, which means sparkly or shiny. New rules came into effect on Monday that will limit parents from giving their babies names pronounced in unconventional ways.
    


            The news was met with mixed reactions; some social media users argued that kirakira names are an expression of individualism, that they're fairly harmless and don't warrant government regulation.
    


            “They're not children of the nation, right? They're children of their parents,” one person wrote on X after the announcement.
    


            Many more, however, welcomed the change – lamenting that children with unusual names might face harassment, or at the very least complications in administrative tasks like registrations or banking.
    


            “Why do certain people put kirakira names on their kids? It just causes those kids to be bullied,” one X user wrote. Another joked sarcastically: “Please stop restricting kirakira names. Seeing a child's name reveals the intelligence of their parents, which is helpful.”
    


            Japan uses three writing systems – Kanji, which is based on Chinese characters, and two other phonetic systems. Names are typically written in Kanji, and this is where the trouble comes in.
    


            Because these Chinese characters were mixed with the existing Japanese language, each Kanji character can be pronounced multiple ways – some with ten or more ways. You decipher the “right” pronunciation based on context clues and the other characters in a sentence or phrase.

            In kirakira names, which became more popular from the 1980s onward, parents often choose a name based on the phonetic sound – wanting their child's name to sound like “Pikachu,” for instance – and pick similar-sounding Kanji characters.
    


            The problem is that those characters might not usually be pronounced that way – making it hard, or impossible, for a teacher or nurse to decipher how to properly say a child's name just by looking at its written Kanji form.
    


            Some have drawn parallels to how American parents have, increasingly in the past decade, chosen unusual spellings for common names – such as Ashleigh instead of Ashley, or Catelynn instead of Caitlin.
    


            The Japanese government's new rules aim to limit this by mandating that only widely accepted pronunciations of kanji characters will be allowed.
    


            Parents will need to include the phonetic readings of their baby names in the registry – and if local officials see that the phonetic sound of a name doesn't match how its characters are typically pronounced, they may reject the name or request additional paperwork.
    


            This is not the first time strict naming rules have sparked debate in Japan.
    


            Japan still legally requires married couples to share the same surname, unlike most other major economies that have done away with the tradition. Normally, wives take their husband's name, since same-sex marriages aren't legal in Japan.
    


            A movement to change the rules around surnames has been brewing, led by women's rights advocates and those trying to preserve the diversity of Japanese surnames in a nation where a handful of names are becoming increasingly common.
    


            First names have afforded more room for experimentation – at least, until the latest rules came in.
    


            More and more people have been given unusual names in the last 40 years, according to a 2022 study that analyzed baby names published in local newsletters over the last few decades.

            The trend suggests a shift toward seeking “uniqueness and independence” in Japan, the study said – also seen in changes to other parts of Japanese life during that time like family structures and societal values.
    


            Girls in particular saw an increase in kirakira names, it added – perhaps suggesting that parents had a stronger “hope for their daughters to become unique and independent than for their sons.”
    


            Japan isn't the only country that has seen an upward trend in unusual baby names. A 2016 study found that American parents picked more unusual names between 2004 and 2015, pointing to the culture's “increasing individualism.”
    


            In China, too, rapid economic growth and upward mobility have meant people today value individualism and autonomy more than previous generations, according to a 2018 study – reflected in the steady rise of parents choosing unique characters in their babies' names.
    


            Like in Japan, the study found that Chinese girls were more likely to have unusual names than boys – perhaps reflecting different “parental expectations.”
    


            But it's also common for countries to have rules in place for what names are acceptable. In the US, this is often state-by-state; names in California can only use the 26 alphabetical characters of the English language, which briefly posed a problem when Elon Musk and Grimes named their baby “X Æ A-12.” They eventually changed the name – very slightly – to “X Æ A-Xii.”
    


            In Germany, authorities may strike down a baby name if they find it offensive or potentially harmful to the child's best interests. For example, they've previously barred parents from using “Borussia,” a reference to a soccer team, or “Gastritis,” arguing that the names would “jeopardize the welfare of the child,” according to the official Frankfurt city administration.
    


            Meanwhile New Zealand also maintains strict rules that include bans on references to titles, meaning names like “King” and “Prince” are routinely rejected.

• Diplomas and a court decision: Harvard University held its 2025 commencement ceremony today as a federal district judge –– in a Boston courtroom 6 miles away –– said she will order the Trump administration not to make any changes to Harvard's student visa program indefinitely.
    


• Federal funding at risk: The battle over international students is just one front in a broader ideological war between the White House and American colleges, with Harvard the central foe. Harvard also is suing the government over its freeze of $2.2 billion in federal money after the Ivy League school refused to take steps including eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, banning masks at protests and enacting merit-based hiring and admissions changes.
    


• Foreign students under fire: The administration is giving Harvard a month to provide evidence challenging its attempt to strip the university of its ability to host international students. President Donald Trump has suggested Harvard enroll no more than “around 15%” of scholars from overseas. Some foreign students worried “immigration-related action” would unfold at graduation.
    


            At a time when the Trump administration has moved to tighten the screws on many visa holders living in the United States, Harvard's commencement speaker said the medical community in the US relies on immigrants.
    


            “We were recruited here because American medical schools simply don't graduate sufficient numbers of physicians to fill the country's needs,” said Dr. Abraham Verghese, a physician and bestselling author.
    


            Verghese first immigrated to the US in 1974 and completed his medical education in India before returning to the US. He said many other foreign-born medical workers are filling critical gaps in the US.
    


            “More than a quarter of the physicians are foreign medical graduates, and many of those foreign physicians ultimately settle in places that others might not find as desirable,” Verghese said.
    


            The commencement ceremony for Harvard's class of 2025 has ended in an eruption of cheers and celebration from the university's graduates.
    


            Dr. Abraham Verghese spoke about moving to a small town in Tennessee amid the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the mid 1980s, highlighting his pleasant surprise to find his dying patients well-received by their families, “given the prevailing sentiments against gay people.”
    


            “They were cared for lovingly, to the end,” Verghese said. “Love trumps all bigotry, love trumps ideology. When it's your child, when it's your family member who's affected – all that stuff just flies out the window.”
    


            “These brave men taught me so much about quiet and about manhood, not the caricature of manliness, the posturing that has become so fashionable lately,” he continued.
    


            “They found that meaning, …  at the end of a shortened life, did not reside in fame, power, reputation, acquisitions, good looks,” Verghese said. “Instead, they found that meaning in their lives ultimately resided in the successful relationships that they had forged in a lifetime, particularly with parents, particularly with your family.”
    


            Dr. Abraham Verghese said he grew up in Ethiopia reading books by American authors such as Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway. From those novels, he said, he came to believe America is “a nation striving to live up to the ideal expressed in its founding documents.”
    


            Verghese said he was inspired to pursue a career in medicine after reading the novel “Of Human Bondage,” by W. Somerset Maugham.
    


            “The idea that now in America, a book that might speak to a young reader, reveal his or her calling, could be banned from their library by a school board or government decree is beyond tragic,” he said.
    


            “I know we will find our way back to displaying those attributes of America I've admired from afar,” Verghese said to applause, “the America that I've known and loved from over four decades of being here, and it depends on all of you.”
    


            “You deserve to hear from a star or a Nobel Prize winner, or perhaps, God knows, from the pope himself,” Harvard keynote commencement speaker Dr. Abraham Verghese, a bestselling author and a Stanford expert on infectious diseases, told attending graduates.
    


            “When legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country, including so many of your international students, worry about being wrongly detained and even deported, perhaps it's fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me,” he continued.
    


            “Part of what makes America great, if I may use that phrase, is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom,” Verghese said, nodding to President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan. “The greatness of America, the greatness of Harvard, is reflected in the fact that someone like me could be invited to speak to you.”
    


            Dr. Abraham Verghese – the bestselling author, Stanford University professor and infectious disease expert – began his commencement address by acknowledging Harvard is facing “unprecedented” times.
    


            “In this institution's almost four-century existence, there has probably not been more attention focused on you than in these last few months,” Verghese told the graduates assembled. “In coming to your campus, I feel very much like a medieval messenger who had to sneak through the encircling forces and slip into your besieged community.”
    


            Verghese offered his congratulations to graduates and told them “no recent events can diminish what each of you has accomplished here.”
    


            “A cascade of draconian government measures,” Verghese said, has sown fear in the US and across the globe.
    


            “The outrage so many feel also must surely lead us to a new appreciation – appreciation for the rule of law and due process,” he said, to a burst of applause.
    


            In the midst of the political controversy surrounding Harvard, a special honor for a legendary performer brought down the house. Groundbreaking Latina actor and singer Rita Moreno, 93, broke down in tears as she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree.
    


            Moreno, who first performed on Broadway as a teenager and noted she was able to find work without a degree, was awarded the degree by Harvard provost John Manning “with hopes that the parchment we now present her will not damage her future prospects.”
    


            Moreno was then serenaded by Harvard student Carolyn Hao with “Somewhere,” the showstopping number from “West Side Story,” a film for which Moreno won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1962. Moreno drew a standing ovation, joining with harmony on the final note.
    


            US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs says she will order the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to not make any changes to Harvard's student visa program indefinitely.
    


            While the Trump administration has tried to defuse the situation heading into a crucial court hearing for Harvard University's international student population, the judge is moving forward with putting in place a firm court order – a preliminary injunction – after previously stepping in on an emergency basis last week to stop the Trump administration's revocation of Harvard's student visa program.
    


            Burroughs said, “I want to maintain the status quo,” to allow Harvard to continue hosting international students on visas at this time.
    


            The details are still being hashed out in court.
    


            Burroughs has told Harvard's lawyers and the Justice Department lawyers to work out an agreement to stop the revocation of the student visa program for the time being.
    


            “It doesn't need to be draconian, but I want to make sure it's worded in such a way that nothing changes,” she said.
    


            Harvard's lead lawyer Ian Gershengorn said he wants to make sure there are no “shenanigans” once the court order is in place.
    


            The judge also has expressed concern that potential Harvard students abroad have been unable to get visas from some US embassies abroad since last week, according to Harvard's sworn statements.
    


            The Justice Department has said this morning the case may be moot because of the administration's latest procedural move to delay consequence for Harvard, the judge indicated Harvard's First Amendment claims may still need to be resolved in court.
    


            The university says it is being unfairly retaliated against. The Justice Department now says that's not true, and they will allow for additional administrative proceedings with the university over the student visa program.
    


            As its battle with the Trump administration over funding and international students continues, the university is conferring honorary degrees on figures who have fought for equality, diversity and the environment.
    


            Here are the 2025 recipients, who were announced on the morning of the commencement ceremony:
    


            After the Trump administration announced plans to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas, Yurong “Luanna” Jiang, a graduate of the class of 2025 from China, received a standing ovation after delivering a commencement speech that urged graduates to remember their “shared humanity.”
    


            Jiang, who is graduating from the School of International Development, began her speech by celebrating her 77 fellow graduates from 32 different countries.
    


            “The countries I knew only as colorful shapes on a map turned into real people with laughter, dreams, and the perseverance to survive the long winter in Cambridge,” Jiang said. “Global challenges suddenly felt personal.”
    


            Harvard's school of international development was founded on a vision, Jiang said, that “humanity rises and falls as one.”
    


            “If we still believe in a shared future, let us not forget those who were labeled as enemies, they too are human,” she said. “In the end, we do not rise by proving each other wrong. We rise by refusing to let one another go.”
    


            The Trump administration in court is trying to put off being under any court orders in its fight with Harvard University over student visas.
    


            In the first few minutes of the hearing, a lawyer for the Justice Department has told the judge Harvard's moves in court for emergency help should be moot, because the Trump administration now wants to give the university 30 days to argue to them for their student visa program.
    


            But the judge appears to be skeptical of the administration's latest procedural move.
    


            “I don't know whether to take that as an acknowledgment procedural steps were not taken,” Judge Allison Burroughs of the District of Massachusetts said.
    


            “Aren't we going to end up back here in essentially the same place?” the judge also asked.
    


            Less than 6 miles away from Harvard's graduation celebrations today, US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs has gaveled in a hearing that could decide the future for Harvard's international students.
    


             Attorneys for the university will face off against lawyers representing the Trump administration over the government's attempt to block the university from accepting any international students.



            Across the river overlooking Boston Harbor, more than 50 lawyers, media and onlookers are awaiting the Harvard vs. Trump administration clash in court over student visas.
    


            Harvard University has assembled a top-notch legal team that has arrived, expected to be led on Thursday by Ian Gershengorn, a well-established Supreme Court litigator and former acting US Solicitor General in the Obama administration, indicating the seriousness and likely substance of the hearing today on the student visa program.
    


            Gershengorn is also notable for the firm he comes from, Jenner & Block, which was the subject of a severely limiting executive order from the Trump White House in recent weeks that was borne out of Trump's personal animus toward some lawyers.
    


            Three courts so far have determined the restrictions Trump is placing on law firms he dislikes are unlawful, and the Trump administration's actions toward law firms and universities like Harvard are perceived as part of a similar campaign to punish powerful intellectual institutions in America that have championed diversity, globalization and the rule of law.
    


            Harvard's battle with the federal government places it in the middle of a larger fight, a graduating senior told his classmates from the commencement stage.
    


            “We leave a much different campus than the one we entered, with Harvard at the center of a national battle over higher education in America,” said Thor Reimann.
    


            “Now look, our university is certainly imperfect, but I am proud to stand alongside our graduating class, our faculty and our president with the shared conviction that this ongoing project of ‘Veritas' is one worth defending,” Reimann said, referring to Harvard's motto, Latin for “Truth.”
    


            Reimann also noted achievements of past Harvard graduates in science and medicine, saying the school benefits the whole as a country.
    


            “All of this, our alumni achieved, not in service of themselves or ideology but in service of others in times of great national need,” they said.

            Harvard President Alan Garber received warm applause from the faculty and graduating class at today's commencement celebration.
    


            Garber, who has been the public face of Harvard's legal fight against the Trump administration, was applauded for a full minute after giving an enthusiastic “Welcome!” to the audience.
    


            Garber was loudly applauded again after making an indirect reference to the university's legal pushback against the White House's effort to make it impossible for Harvard to accept international students.
    


            “Members of the Class of 2025, from down the street, across the country and around the world … just as it should be,” Garber said.
    


            Graduates, he added, should be prepared to “expand our thinking and change our minds in the process.”
    


            “My hope for you, members of the Class of 2025, is that you stay comfortable being uncomfortable,” Garber said.

            Harvard University's commencement ceremony comes on a “day of mixed emotions,” Steven Pinker, the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology told CNN Thursday, amid the ongoing battle between the school and the Trump administration that could determine whether international students can attend the Ivy League school in the fall.
    


            “Harvard is doing it's best and I'm doing my best to make it a day of joy and satisfaction, pride – especially to the families of the students who worked so hard for four years, families who made sacrifices to send their kids here,” Pinker told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            But hanging over the day, Pinker said, “is the knowledge that, amazingly, the American government seems to be at war with its most famous university.”
    


            “Knowledge has no boundaries, particularly science,” Pinker said. “To do the best possible scholarship, you have to be in touch with all scholars, from all over the world.”
    


            “There is no reason to put a wall around the United States. Sometimes the best science is done in some other country and we want to bring them here and find out what they are doing,” he said.
    


            The commencement ceremony for Harvard's graduating class of 2025 – the 374th celebration in the school's storied history – has begun.
    


            Harvard was bursting with activity Thursday morning as thousands packed into historic Harvard Yard for commencement – all while the school's ongoing battle with the Trump administration loomed over the day.
    


            Beaming graduating seniors were decked out in caps and gowns as family members in suits and spring dresses swarmed to celebrate their loves ones.
    


            Meanwhile, outside the campus' main gates, two dozen or so pro-Palestinian protesters gathered amid lines into the commencement event. Older protesters who did not appear to be students held signs reading, “Gaza must have food and water,” and “Ceasefire Now.”
    


            A smaller group of pro-Israel counterprotesters also stood outside the gates, with some among them arguing with some of pro-Palestinian protesters. Despite the crush of people filling the streets of Cambridge, all was relatively calm leading up to commencement.
    


            Basketball legend and social activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came out in strong defense of Harvard University and its leadership during a speech Wednesday on campus.
    


            “When a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard to give up their academic freedom and destroy free speech, (Harvard President) Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures the way Rosa Parks defied the entire weight of systemic racism in 1955,” Abdul-Jabbar said, according to The Harvard Gazette, the school's official publication.
    


            Abdul-Jabbar – who is being awarded an honorary degree Thursday by the university – was the keynote speaker at Class Day, an event for underclassmen held a day before the university's main commencement exercises.
    


            “After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians, and other universities bend their knees to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,” said Abdul-Jabbar.
    


            The Trump administration has thrown the lives of the university's 7,000 international students into distress and disarray, with some afraid of attending commencement this week, Harvard's director of immigration services spelled out yesterday in a new court filing.
    


            Some US students are even reconsidering enrolling this fall because of the Trump administration's actions, Maureen Martin wrote in her sworn statement.
    


            Harvard's faculty and administration are being “inundated with questions” from concerned students, and international students are so distressed their mental health has been affected, she wrote.
    


            “Some are afraid to attend their own graduation ceremonies this week out of fear that some immigration-related action will be taken against them,” Martin wrote. “Some have cancelled upcoming international travel plans to conduct academic research or see their families in light of the risk that they might not be admitted back into the United States.”
    


            Martin's declaration in court highlights the competitive disadvantage the Trump administration's recent actions against the university have caused. A judge has temporarily blocked the State Department and Department of Homeland Security from rescinding Harvard's ability to host international students.
    


            Yet some of the damage is already done, the school says.
    


            International students set to come to Harvard for future semesters are reconsidering, including at least one medical school and one law student, Martin added, as are at least three US students who want to study where international students also can be. Others have had trouble getting student visas to the US at embassies abroad in recent days.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed Ukraine peace negotiations in a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov briefed Rubio on “concrete proposals for the next round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.”

“Both sides affirmed their intent to maintain constructive and respectful dialogue,” the ministry said in a statement on its website.

US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said that Rubio “welcomed Russia and Ukraine's exchange of ‘1,000-for-1,000' prisoners over the weekend.”

“The secretary reiterated President Trump's calls for constructive, good-faith dialogue with Ukraine as the only path to ending this war,” Bruce added.

The conversation took place as US President Donald Trump intensified his rhetoric toward Russia, accusing his counterpart Vladimir Putin of “playing with fire.”

He stopped short, however, of imposing new sanctions – something he suggested could still happen if peace talks stall. “We're going to find out whether or not [Putin is] tapping us along, and if he is, we'll respond a little differently,” Trump said on Wednesday.

Russia and Ukraine held their first direct negotiations in three years on May 16 in Istanbul, agreeing to carry out a major prisoner swap and to each draft a memorandum outlining their terms for a potential ceasefire. The exchange was conducted in several phases and concluded last week.

While Kiev has said it shared its memorandum with both Moscow and Washington, the Kremlin stated on Wednesday that it is “finalizing” its version of the document.

Lavrov proposed holding the next round of talks in Istanbul on June 2. Russia's lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, has rejected Ukraine's claims that Moscow is stalling the process.

Kiev has backed Trump's proposal for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. However, Russia has stated that for a full ceasefire to be achieved, Ukraine must halt mobilization, stop receiving foreign weapons, and withdraw its forces from Russian territory.

Moscow also insists that Kiev must abandon its plans to join NATO and formally recognize Crimea and four other regions as part of Russia. The Kremlin has described NATO's expansion as one of the “root causes” of the conflict – an issue it says must be addressed in the ongoing talks.

Artificial intelligence could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, the CEO of American AI research company Anthropic, Dario Amodei has warned. 

In a statement to Axios published on Wednesday, Amodei, who co-founded Anthropic and is a former OpenAI executive, said he hopes to jolt the US government and fellow developers into preparing for the consequences of rapid automation. AI could spike unemployment in the US to 10-20% in the next one to five years, he warned.

AI development companies are already working on systems that could soon replace workers in technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, particularly entry-level positions, Amodei claimed.

The public and politicians are still “unaware” that a major shift is about to happen and insisted that companies and officials needed to stop “sugar-coating” what lies ahead, particularly for younger workers. 

Earlier this month, a report by the Linux Foundation, commissioned by Meta, found that open source AI is already transforming the economy by boosting efficiency, innovation, cost savings, and revenue gains.

However, Amodei has expressed concern that people could continue to stay ignorant of the threat of being replaced by AI, especially if the US government chooses to stay silent on the issue out of fear of spooking workers or falling behind China.

Soon, “almost overnight,” business leaders will see savings in replacing humans with AI and implement a change “en masse.” They will stop opening new jobs or backfilling existing ones, and replace human workers with automated alternatives, Amodei claimed.

He has proposed several mitigation strategies, including a special index to track AI's impact across occupations, and briefings for lawmakers to raise awareness. He also suggested a “token tax” — a system where a percentage of AI-generated revenue would be redistributed by the government. 

Amodei's warning comes as a number of major companies have recently started laying off a considerable amount of workers, which some believe is being done in anticipation of major shifts due to AI. 

Earlier this month, Microsoft fired some 6,000 workers, mostly engineers, despite reporting strong sales and profits. Walmart has cut 1,500 corporate jobs to “simplify operations” while Crowdstrike - a Texas based cybersecurity company - has slashed 500 positions citing “a market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry.”

MOSCOW, May 29. /TASS/. The process of militarizing Europe has begun, but it will require significant financial investment, tough political decisions, and some compromises, according to Prokhor Tebin, director of the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute for World Military Economy and Strategy at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.

In an interview with TASS, Tebin emphasized that modernizing Europe's defense-industrial complex and establishing a unified market for defense products will not be easy. ""Such efforts will demand difficult and often controversial political choices,"" he noted, commenting on the EU Council's recent decision to create a 150-billion-euro fund - Security Action for Europe (SAFE) - aimed at enhancing the bloc's military capabilities.

Tebin explained that the SAFE mechanism is intended to foster greater coordination in both demand and supply within the European arms market. This includes launching joint programs for procurement and maintenance of weapons, military, and special equipment (WMSE), as well as consolidating suppliers through mergers and acquisitions, which could lead to the weakening of competition. However, he pointed out that European nations are actively protecting their domestic industries, striving to preserve jobs and technological advancements.

The expert highlighted the current challenges faced by European WMSE manufacturers, including limited production capacity, surging demand, and uncertainty about the longevity of this demand. Expanding production necessitates scaling up the entire supply chain - a difficult feat within the EU's existing framework. Consequently, many European defense firms are compelled to source raw materials, components, and parts from abroad. For instance, Rheinmetall, a leading European ammunition producer, has formed a strategic partnership with India's Reliance Defense to boost its ammunition manufacturing capabilities.

Tebin emphasized that overcoming these hurdles requires sustained financial investment and a consistent long-term policy approach. ""Without these, the EU's defense industry will remain disjointed and overly reliant on exports, caught in fierce intra-European competition, and unable to fully meet the needs of member states,"" he warned. Moreover, he cautioned that military spending - whether funded through borrowing, tax hikes, or reductions in other public sectors - will largely continue to be driven by defense contractors from outside Europe, such as those in the United States and South Korea.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The ruling says Trump exceeded authority in imposing sweeping tariffs. Plus, Elon Musk confirms government exit

Good morning.

A federal trade court has ruled Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs regime illegal, a dramatic twist that could block the president's controversial global trade policy.

The ruling by a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits argued that Trump had exceeded his authority, treating trade policy as a matter of the president's whim and unleashing economic chaos around the world.

The ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump's strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to US shores and shrink a $1.2tn goods trade deficit.

What was the ruling? Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress but Trump has so far bypassed that requirement by claiming that the country's trade deficits amounted to a national emergency. The court's ruling said Trump's tariff orders “exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs”.

How are markets reacting? Global markets cheered the ruling, with the US dollar rallying along with indexes in France, Germany, Japan, and futures for the US S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes rising.

What's next? The Trump administration has already filed to appeal. White House officials attacked the court, calling it “unelected”.

Four people were killed as thousands of starving Palestinians burst into a UN warehouse in Gaza, tearing away sections of the building's metal walls in a desperate attempt to find food.

Two people were fatally crushed and two others died of gunshot wounds after people crowded into a World Food Programme warehouse in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday, health officials said. It was not immediately clear if Israeli forces, private contractors or others had opened fire.

Earlier, at least one civilian was killed and 48 wounded when Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, after the US-backed food logistics group chosen by Israel to ship food into Gaza, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), lost control of its distribution center, health officials reported.

What is the humanitarian situation after Israel's aid blockade since 2 March? Earlier this month, the IPC estimated that nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.

What has the UN said about the new Israel-backed plan? The UN and other humanitarian groups have rejected the system, warning it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.

Elon Musk has announced he is leaving his role in the Trump administration, a departure the White House confirmed on Wednesday evening.

It followed Musk publicly criticizing Donald Trump's tax bill, saying the plan undermined cost-cutting efforts, in comments likely to widen a rift between the two men.

Musk said he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, which … undermines the work that the Doge team is doing” in a CBS interview that will air on Sunday.

What's in the bill? Extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations; ending Joe Biden's clean energy incentives; construction of a wall along the Mexican border; about $1tn in cuts to benefits, including Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps.

How is it progressing on Capitol Hill? Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act was narrowly approved last week by the House of Representatives, sending it to the Senate, where the Republican majority will probably make its own changes.

Donald Trump's plane from the government of Qatar, which he said would be turned into the new Air Force One, has arrived – but the president says it's too big to use as his personal aircraft.

A former French surgeon was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of patients, mostly aged under 15, after the biggest child abuse trial in French history.

Argentina is being used as a “testing ground” for stripping back abortion rights around the world, Amnesty International has warned.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said the Trump administration will “aggressively” revoke visas of Chinese students. China sent 277,398 students in the 2023-24 academic year, and international students are one of the largest sources of revenue for US colleges.

“For the first time in my life, a notional concept of global Black solidarity became concrete,” writes Nesrine Malik. Five years on? “The biggest lesson is that we don't get to choose how revolutions unfold” but also that “BLM opened up the issue of racial justice in ways that can never again be closed”.

The president of Cop30 has warned that the world is facing a new form of climate denial: a concerted attack on the idea that the economy can be reorganized to fight the climate crisis. André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, has said he believes countering this new type of denialism will be his biggest job as director of this year's UN climate summit.

Hitting a strong updraft during a test of his new equipment, Peng Yujiang was sent soaring from 3,000 meters to above 8,000 meters, nearly the height of Mount Everest. He managed to survive despite losing consciousness and enduring temperatures of -31F (-35C), eventually landing 30km from the launch site.

Defence argues photos taken by police inside Patterson's home appear to show computers and a phone that were not seized during search

Who are Erin Patterson and the other key figures in Australia's mushroom murders trial?

The detective in charge of the investigation into the deadly beef wellington lunch served by Erin Patterson has denied police made several errors in the case, including failing to seize electronic items during a search of her house and wrongly identifying her son on CCTV footage, a court has heard.

Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to poisoning her four lunch guests – relatives of her estranged husband, Simon Patterson – with a beef wellington served at her house in Leongatha, Victoria on 29 July 2023.

Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering Simon's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Simon's uncle and Heather's husband.

Lawyers for Patterson say the death cap mushroom poisoning was a tragic and terrible accident.

Det Leading Sen Const Stephen Eppingstall, the informant or officer in charge of the investigation, continued his evidence on Thursday. He is the last prosecution witness in the trial.

Under cross-examination from Colin Mandy SC, for Patterson, Eppingstall was asked to expand on several pieces of evidence already shown to the jury, including message exchanges between Patterson and Don and Gail, the exchanges Patterson shared with her friends on Facebook, CCTV purportedly showing Patterson's son attending Subway in the hours after the lunch, and images taken during the police search of her property on 5 August.

Eppingstall was shown photos taken by police inside Patterson's home which Mandy said appeared to show laptop computers and a phone that he said were not seized by police.

Mandy said a USB at the home was also not seized.

Eppingstall said a large number of items had been seized, and that police had taken everything they considered relevant. A phone allegedly used by Patterson, known as phone A, has never been recovered by police, the court has previously heard.

Mandy also had messages shown to the court between Patterson and her Facebook friends that he said provided context to other messages sent by Patterson that were already in evidence about her relationship with Simon and his parents.

The messages shown to the court on Thursday revealed the Facebook friends making comments like “what morons”, “it's pathetic”, “you are human”, “so sorry Erin it's so fucking hard” and “I went through similar with my ex in-laws, she was wonderful until we split up”.

“This was a chat where a number of the participants were talking like this, that is venting to each other about various issues in their lives,” Mandy asked Eppingstall.

“Yeah that's fair to say, sir, yes,” Eppingstall replied.

Mandy said the chat was also used for “random conversation” about pets, children, and other issues in their lives, referring to a discussion “about the fact that Kirstie Alley was dead”.

Stills taken from CCTV footage of Leongatha Subway were also shown to the court, and compared with separate images of Patterson's son, including one of him with Don, and another taken from the footage of his police interview.

Mandy suggested to Eppingstall that the CCTV footage of Subway previously shown as part of the prosecution case did not depict Patterson's son.

“I believe that's [him], but I guess that's a matter for the jury,” Eppingstall said.

When Mandy said he was “not suggesting there's not a visit to Subway”, simply that the footage did not show Patterson's son, Eppingstall said: “I've got the wrong one, is what you're saying. I don't think so, but that's a matter for you, sir.”

Eppingstall's evidence is set to continue for a fourth day on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Zelenskyy says Moscow dragging out the process as Lavrov insists on another meeting; funeral for three sibling children killed by Russian cruise missile. What we know on day 1,191

Ukraine has submitted its peace terms and insisted Russia do the same before further talks, which the Kremlin has demanded take place next Monday in Turkey. “We are not opposed to further meetings with the Russians and are awaiting their memorandum,” said the Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov. “The Russian side has at least four more days before their departure to provide us with their document for review. Diplomacy must be substantive, and the next meeting must yield results.”

Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said instead that a Russian team “is ready to present a memorandum to the Ukrainian delegation and provide the necessary explanations during a second round of direct talks in Istanbul on Monday, 2 June”. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Wednesday called for Moscow to engage in “good-faith” talks with Ukraine in a call with Lavrov.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Wednesday accused Russia of dragging out the peace process and of not wanting to halt its offensive. “They will constantly look for reasons not to end the war,” he said at a press conference in Berlin alongside the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.

Vladimir Putin promised Donald Trump that Russia would produce the “memorandum” in conjunction with Ukraine when their much-vaunted phone call took place on 19 May. Donald Trump posted on Tuesday that Putin was “playing with fire” by continuing to attack Ukraine, but on Wednesday the US president's words sounded more tepid. Trump said he would determine within “about two weeks” whether Putin was serious about ending the fighting. He was “very disappointed” but rebuffed calls to impose more sanctions on Moscow: “If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that.” As Peter Beaumont writes, there has been little or no sign of a deal.

Three Ukrainian children, aged 8, 12 and 17 – siblings killed in their beds by a Russian cruise missile – lay side by side in their coffins on Wednesday as a church choir sang in Korostyshiv, about 100km (60 miles) west of Kyiv. They were surrounded by dozens of bouquets. Moscow denies targeting civilians, but abundant evidence shows otherwise. The children's father, still bearing fresh injuries, was released from the hospital to attend the funeral. He and his two surviving children sat beside the coffins.

As Zelenskyy visited Germany, the two countries announced that Berlin will help finance long-range weapons production on Ukrainian soil, Kate Connolly writes. The deal appears at least in part to be a workaround to German concerns about being labelled a “warmonger” if it provides its far-reaching Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. The expectation is that Berlin will supply Ukraine with the technical components to build and maintain its own long-range weaponry, including rockets and cruise missiles, with a range of up to 2,500km.

Neither leader would detail the specific weapons that would be manufactured in Ukraine, saying it was prudent to keep the information as secretive as possible. Zelenskyy said he expected the first weapons to be ready by June 2026. Contrary to some perceptions, Germany has long supported Kyiv and is the second-biggest deliverer of weapons after the US.

On the battlefield, Zelenskyy said Russia was amassing more than 50,000 troops on the frontline around the north-east Sumy border region, where Moscow's army claims to have captured a number of settlements as it seeks to establish what Putin has called a “buffer zone” inside Ukrainian territory.

Ukraine said a heavy wave of drone attacks into Russia on Wednesday struck several of the Kremlin's weapon production sites.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said that the US would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students, including those studying in “critical fields.”

China is the second-largest country of origin for international students in the US, behind only India. In the 2023-2024 academic year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up about one-quarter of all foreign students in the US.

“Under [US] President [Donald] Trump's leadership, the US State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Rubio wrote.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning (毛寧) yesterday called the decision unreasonable.

“Such a politicized and discriminatory action lays bare the US lie that it upholds the so-called freedom and openness,” Mao said, adding that Beijing had lodged a protest with Washington.

The action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between US higher education and China.

The US House of Representatives this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally funded research at Duke.

Last year, the House issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing “back-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.”

The US Department of Homeland Security raised similar issues in a letter barring international students at Harvard University last week.

US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem accused Harvard of “coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party,” citing research collaborations with Chinese academics.

It also accused Harvard of training members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Chinese paramilitary group.

The announcement came a day after Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students as the state department prepares guidelines for increased vetting of their activity on social media.

Together, the announcements from the state department added to uncertainty for international students in the US.

Earlier this year, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested and tried to deport students who had been involved in campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

The Trump administration abruptly terminated the legal status of thousands of international students before reversing itself and then expanding the grounds on which students can lose permission to study in the US.

The Trump administration last week moved to block Harvard University from enrolling more international students, a decision that has been put on hold by a federal judge, pending a lawsuit.

Trump on Wednesday said that Harvard, which has a student population that is more than one-quarter international, should limit that percentage to about 15 percent.

“I want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country,” Trump said.

During a head-to-head debate lasting two hours, centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's governing pro-European coalition, faced the Eurosceptic historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS).
The two candidates, who qualified for the second round after coming in the top two places in the first vote on Sunday last week, clashed over Poland's relations with Ukraine, EU policy and the track records of their

For an as-yet unknown reason, the 135m NCL Salten sailed up onto shore just meters from Johan Helberg's house in a fjord near Trondheim in central Norway.
Helberg only discovered the unexpected visitor when a panicked neighbor who had rung his doorbell repeatedly to no avail gave up and called him on the phone.

Both countries lay claim to Essequibo, which makes up two-thirds of Guyana's territory and is home to 125,000 of its 800,000 citizens. Guyana has administered the region for decades.

The World Masters Games are to conclude today with the final rounds in soccer and tennis, while New Taipei City is to host the closing ceremony tonight with headliners Taiwanese boy band Energy, drag queen Nymphia Wind (妮妃雅) and Taiwanese hip hop group Caotun Boy (草屯囝仔).

While most events were completed yesterday, the last day still has tennis finals in various categories and age groups at the two main tennis venues in Taipei and New Taipei City today. 

In soccer, 11-a-side men's teams are today to vie for the trophy in the Competitive Recreational category for 45+, 50+ and 55+ age groups at Taipei's Yingfeng Riverside Park Football Field (迎風河濱公園足球場), while matches in the Open category for the 65+ age group are being held at Jhubei City's (竹北) Hsinchu County Second Stadium (新竹縣第二運動場).

As cohosts, Taipei launched the Games with the opening ceremony at the Taipei Dome on May 17, while New Taipei City officials are the main organizers for this evening's closing ceremony, featuring music, entertainment, a laser light show and fireworks to spotlight the “We are the World” theme.

According to the New Taipei City Cultural Affairs Bureau, the closing ceremony is to be held at the New Taipei City Art Museum in Yingge District (鶯歌), which is a brand new facility that opened only last month. 

Work began on the facility in December 2018, and its exterior park spaces opened to the public on April 2023.

Games participants and members of the public wishing to attend the closing ceremony are advised that traffic control and restrictions are in place all day, and the best way is to take a Taiwan Railway Corp train to Yingge Station, then to follow the corridor and signs for a six-minute walk to the venue, which opens its doors at 5pm, organizers said in a news release.

“The site is divided into four areas: Zone A has the performance stage for participating athletes, including the para competitors; Zone B is to the east for all athletes — passes with name tags would be checked on entry; Zone C is to the west side of the main stage and is for the general audience, while Zone D is at the site's northeast corner and serves as a recreational area for parents and families with kids,” the release said.

According to officials and a map for the event, Zone A hosts the main stage for the music and entertainment performances, while other areas are further away, with giant screens set up for zones B, C and D audiences. 

A street market is also being held nearby, which opens at 3pm.

The program starts with an address by the president of the International Masters Games Association, Taipei and New Taipei City mayors, and representatives from the next Games' host city in Japan, followed by performances featuring Energy, Nymphia Wind, Caotun Boy, singer-songwriter Kasiwa (葛西瓦), DJ RayRay and other acts, along with colorful laser light shows, the release said.

The show would conclude with a four-and-a-half minute fireworks show over the riverside park along the Dahan River (大漢溪), the release said.

Security checks are in place for Zone A, and participating athletes are restricted to bringing in a bag under 50x50x50cm in size, while there are storage spaces available, officials said.

The efforts are part of China's promotion of a “Kinmen-Xiamen twin-city living sphere, including a cross-strait integration pilot zone in China's Fujian Province,” the source said. 
“The CCP is already treating residents of these outlying islands as Chinese citizens. It has also intensified its ‘united front' efforts and infiltration of those islands,” the source said.

Public support stood at 56.4 percent for action by the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of Culture to enhance scrutiny on Taiwanese performers and artists who have developed careers in China while allegedly adhering to the narrative of Beijing's propaganda that denigrates or harms Taiwanese sovereignty, the poll showed.
Thirty-three percent did not support the action, it showed.
The poll showed that 51.5 percent of respondents supported the government's investigation into Taiwanese who have

The upcoming performances will also make Blackpink the first girl group ever to perform twice at the stadium. It will be the group's third visit to Taiwan to stage a concert.
The last time Blackpink held a concert in the city was in March 2023. Their first concert in Taiwan was on March 3, 2019, at NTSU Arena (Linkou Arena).

The UK would benefit from pledging more sustained and committed support in this age of disinformation and global turmoil.

Two years ago, BBC Arabic radio left the airwaves after decades. Soon afterwards, Russia's Sputnik service began broadcasting on the frequency left vacant in Lebanon. That detail illuminates a larger picture. China, Russia and others see global-facing media as central to their global ambitions and are investing accordingly — pumping out propaganda to muddle or drown out objective, independently minded journalism. These outlets are state-controlled as well as state-owned.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and disinformation proliferate online, attacks on press freedom intensify and the administration of US President Donald Trump is dismantling media organizations, including Voice of America and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which have been essential sources of information for audiences under repressive regimes. Official Chinese media were gleeful at what RFA president Bay Fang called “a reward to dictators and despots.”

The BBC World Service, and its accurate reporting borne of deep knowledge of places, has rarely been needed more. At its best it is a beacon of truth in times of war and crisis, as well as life-transforming for listeners in a myriad of less dramatic ways. Yet it is already scrabbling to compete with lavishly funded foreign rivals for audiences and resources. The government boosted its contribution for this year and the next, but is now asking the BBC to identify tens of millions of pounds of cuts over the next few years.

Since 2014, the World Service has been primarily funded by the licence fee. However, the government contribution is mostly funded from official development assistance, which British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is slashing to increase defense spending. Even an alternative budget, with funding remaining flat in cash terms, would make deep cuts inevitable when global inflation is running at more than 4 percent.

The World Service faces tricky decisions, too. Most future users are unlikely to come via radio, but shortwave services remain central in some areas and can reach listeners even when Internet access is cut. The decision to axe Arabic radio services looked all the more ill-judged in light of wars in Gaza and Sudan. Bosses are struggling to balance the competing demands to constrain spending, ensure reach, and maintain standards of quality and depth. One pilot is a low-budget model in Polish, which would mostly repurpose existing BBC journalism.

In the long run, the BBC said that the government should fully resume World Service funding. That sounds more like a negotiating position than a serious prospect. What is absolutely clear is that it needs more money to compete, not less, and a long-term settlement. Its authority depends on the capacity and institutional memory it has established, and the fact that it is not seen to respond to the imperatives of the government of the day: it represents national values, not a politician's fiat. Those are all imperiled when it must battle over money year by year. Once weakened, it would not easily recover.

Research conducted for the BBC found it to be the UK's most recognized cultural export internationally — ahead of the  English Premier League and British universities. Its hundreds of millions of users are more likely to favor the UK and more likely to support democracy. 

The World Service is a precious and irreplaceable asset. Former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan once described it as “perhaps Britain's greatest gift to the world” in the 20th century. However, the giver enjoys rich returns, and would be foolish to squander them.



                                                                                As the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its People's Liberation Army (PLA) reach the point of confidence that they can start and win a war to destroy the democratic culture on Taiwan, any future decision to do so may likely be directly affected by the CCP's ability to promote wars on the Korean Peninsula, in Europe, or, as most recently, on the Indian subcontinent.
It stands to reason that the Trump Administration's success early on May 10 to convince India and Pakistan to deescalate their four-day conventional military conflict, assessed to be close to a nuclear weapons exchange, also served to                                    



                                                                                After India's punitive precision strikes targeting what New Delhi called nine terrorist sites inside Pakistan, reactions poured in from governments around the world. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a statement on May 10, opposing terrorism and expressing concern about the growing tensions between India and Pakistan. The statement noticeably expressed support for the Indian government's right to maintain its national security and act against terrorists. 
The ministry said that it “works closely with democratic partners worldwide in staunch opposition to international terrorism” and expressed “firm support for all legitimate and necessary actions taken by the government of India                                    



                                                                                The recent aerial clash between Pakistan and India offers a glimpse of how China is narrowing the gap in military airpower with the US. It is a warning not just for Washington, but for Taipei, too. 
Claims from both sides remain contested, but a broader picture is emerging among experts who track China's air force and fighter jet development: Beijing's defense systems are growing increasingly credible. Pakistan said its deployment of Chinese-manufactured J-10C fighters downed multiple Indian aircraft, although New Delhi denies this. 
There are caveats: Even if Islamabad's claims are accurate, Beijing's equipment does not offer a direct comparison                                    



                                                                                To recalibrate its Cold War alliances, the US adopted its “one China policy,” a diplomatic compromise meant to engage with China and end the Vietnam War, but which left Taiwan in a state of permanent limbo.
Half a century later, the costs of that policy are mounting. Taiwan remains a democratic, technologically advanced nation of 23 million people, yet it is denied membership in international organizations and stripped of diplomatic recognition. Meanwhile, the PRC has weaponized the “one China” narrative to claim sovereignty over Taiwan, label the Taiwan Strait as its “internal waters” and threaten international shipping routes that carry more                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Ukraine will not take part in the World Judo Championships set for June in Budapest due to Belarus's participation in the competition, the Ukrainian Judo Federation announced on May 29.

The decision came after the Executive Committee of the International Judo Federation (IJF) confirmed, following an appeal from Kyiv, that Belarusian athletes are allowed to take part in all international competitions under national symbols from June 1, 2025.

Since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale war, Ukraine has repeatedly called for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in international competitions, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. Ultimately, these athletes were allowed to compete only as ""individual neutral athletes"" in individual disciplines without using any national symbols related to their countries.

While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine.

According to the Ukrainian committee, the federation said in its response that ""the IJF is committed to ensuring that sport serves as a platform for dialogue, unity, and understanding — building bridges, not walls.""

The Ukrainian Judo Federation condemned the decision, saying that it contradicts ""the fundamental principles of fairness, responsibility, and solidarity in the global sports movement.""

""We firmly believe that allowing athletes from aggressor countries to compete under national symbols is not only a case of political blindness but also a blatant disregard for the victims of war and international law,"" the statement read.

As of March, 591 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russia in the war, with 22 held captive and 11 missing, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said.

Telegram and Elon Musk's xAI will enter a one-year partnership, integrating the Grok chatbot into the messaging app, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced on May 28.

Musk, the world's richest man who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, commented that ""no deal has been signed,"" prompting Durov to clarify that the deal has been agreed in ""principle"" with ""formalities pending.""

""This summer, Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market,"" Durov said.

""Elon Musk and I have agreed to a one-year partnership to bring xAI's chatbot Grok to our billion+ users and integrate it across all Telegram apps.""

The announcement comes as Musk announces his exit from his role in the Trump administration to focus on his business ventures, many of which saw their profits drop in the past few months.

Musk founded xAI in 2023, and earlier this year, another of his ventures, X Corp., which operates the X social platform, acquired the AI company. Grok is xAI's flagship project and has already been integrated into X.

Musk's takeover of X saw the social platform, formerly known as Twitter, become the leading source of disinformation, EU officials said. The Grok chatbot also faced scrutiny recently after posting unprompted comments on the topic of so-called ""white genocide"" in South Africa, Musk's home country.

Durov, the Russian-born founder of Telegram, currently resides in Dubai and holds Russian, Emirati, and French citizenship. He is under investigation in France for criminal activity on his messaging app.

Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but it was reported last year that he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country, according to Kremlingram, a Ukrainian group that campaigns against the use of Telegram in Ukraine.

Telegram remains one of the most popular social media platforms among Ukrainians. A September 2023 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 44% of Ukrainians use Telegram to receive information and news.

Ukrainian officials have warned about security risks associated with using Telegram, leading to restrictions on its use by civil servants and politicians.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia's Migalovo Air Base in Tver Oblast came under attack by drones overnight on May 25, the Russian independent news channel Astra reported. 

Locals reported that drones were targeting the air base and that explosions occurred in the area. Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya confirmed that air defense units had intercepted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the area. 

Rudenya claimed that five UAVs were shot down but reported no damage or casualties. He did not mention the Migalovo airfield. Later in the night he said that three more drones were shot down in the area and that air defense was active over Tver.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports. 

The Migalovo military airfield is located on the outskirts of Tver, over 1,300 kilometers (807 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The facility is a base for military transport aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-76. 

Ukraine has previously targeted Russian air bases in drone attacks, aiming to undermine Moscow's ability to carry out large-scary aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities. In March, Ukrainian drones successfully hit Russia's Engels-2 air base in Saratov Oblast. 

Kyiv has also launched several strikes against targets in Tver Oblast. In January and February, Ukraine struck the Andreapol oil pumping station in the region twice in two weeks. Previous targets have included ammunition depots and missile arsenals.

The latest reported attack on Tver Oblast came as Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. For the second night in a row, Moscow barraged Kyiv with drones and missiles, injuring civilians.

Explosions were reported in cities across the country as attacks continued throughout the night. 

As Russia intensifies aerial attacks on Ukraine and the civilian death toll climbs, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory. The recent surge in drone strikes aims to disrupt airport operations, overwhelm air defenses, and mount pressure against the Russian population.

Students cheer during Harvard University's commencement ceremonies, in Cambridge, Mass., on May 29.Charles Krupa/The Associated Press

Harvard graduates celebrated commencement on Thursday at a pivotal time for the Ivy League school, cheering speakers who stressed the importance of maintaining a diverse and international student body while standing up for the truth at a time the esteemed university is under threat by the Trump administration.

Harvard's battles with Trump over funding and restrictions on teaching and admissions presented another challenge for the thousands of graduates who had already endured their share since arriving on campus four years ago. They started college as the world was emerging from a pandemic and, in the years since, grappled with student-led protests over the war in Gaza.

Other schools face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don't agree to the Trump administration's shifting demands. But Harvard, which was founded more than a century before the nation itself, has taken the lead in defying the White House in court and is paying a significant price.

The Trump administration's latest salvos include asking federal agencies to cancel about $100-million in contracts with the Ivy League school. The government already cancelled more than $2.6-billion in federal research grants, moved to cut off Harvard's enrolment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.

Visa interviews for international students admitted to schools nationwide were halted on Tuesday, and Trump said Wednesday that Harvard should reduce its international enrolment from 25 per cent to about 15 per cent.

Sustained by a $53-billion endowment, the nation's wealthiest university is testing whether it can be a bulwark against Trump's efforts to limit what his administration calls antisemitic activism on campus, which Harvard sees as an affront to the freedom to teach and learn nationwide.

The Trump administration has demanded that Harvard make broad leadership changes, revise its admissions policies and audit its faculty and student body to ensure the campus is home to many viewpoints.

In response to the administration's threats, Harvard has sued to block the funding freeze and persuaded a federal judge to temporarily halt the enrolment ban. During a hearing in Boston on Thursday, the judge extended her order blocking the ban on enrolling international students.

Harvard President Alan Garber, who has repeatedly defended the school's actions, didn't directly touch on the Trump administration threats when he addressed the graduates Thursday. But he did get a rousing applause when he referenced the university's global reach, noting that it is “just as it should be.”

Several of the graduating speakers spoke more directly about the challenges facing the school and society.

Speaking in Latin, salutatorian Aidan Robert Scully delivered a speech laced with references to Trump policies.

“I say this: ... Neither powers nor princes can change the truth and deny that diversity is our strength,” Scully said.

It was a sentiment echoed by Yurong Luanna Jiang, a Chinese graduate who studied international development. She said she grew up believing that the “world was becoming a small village” and that she would be part of the generation that would “end hunger and poverty for humankind.”

She said coming to Harvard, she found a global community that included classmates from all around the world.

“When I met my 77 classmates from 32 different countries, the countries I knew only as colourful shapes on a map turned into real people, with laughter, dreams and the perseverance to survive the long winter in Cambridge,” she said of the other students in her international development program. “Global challenges suddenly felt personal.”

Now, though, she said she wonders whether her world view is under threat.

“We're starting to believe those who think differently, vote differently or pray differently, whether they are across the ocean or sitting right next to us, are not just wrong – we mistakenly see them as evil,“ she said. “But it doesn't have to be this way.”

Dr. Abraham Verghese, a bestselling author and Stanford University expert on infectious diseases, opened his keynote address by saying he felt like a medieval messenger “slipping into a besieged community,” with more attention focused on the university than perhaps anytime during its history.

“No recent events can diminish what each of you have accomplished here,” Vergghese said On Wednesday, basketball Hall of Famer and activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the “Class Day” speaker, and journalist Christiane Amanpour addressed graduates of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

Both praised Harvard for standing up to the Trump administration, with Abdul-Jabbar specifically calling out the actions of Garber.

“When a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard, to revoke their academic freedom and to destroy free speech, Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures,” Abdul-Jabbar said to wide applause as he compared Garber's response to Rosa Parks' stand against racist segregation.

“After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,” he continued.

Earlier in the week Garber said in an interview with a university publication, that “government overreach and devastating attacks on scientific and medical research are unwarranted and unlawful, and so we have taken legal action to defend the institution.”

“We should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies – we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them,” said Garber, who commissioned internal reports last year on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the school.

The Trump administration has said it wants “to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.” It cites campus protests against Israel. Like many college students around the country, Harvard students set up tents called on the university to divest from companies supporting Israel's military, which has levelled Gaza in response to attacks by Hamas.

Last year, hundreds of graduating students walked out of commencement chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of campus protests. Harvard also said some protesters would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates, although it eventually allowed most to get them.

This year, the anti-war demonstrations have largely faded from view, but protesters held a silent vigil a few hours before Thursday's ceremony. Holding signs that read “Ceasefire Now” and “Not Another Bomb,” protesters stood silently along the walls of Harvard.

Harvard students and professors rallied in support of international students on May 27, just days after a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking the school's ability to enroll foreign students.

The British government is trying to understand how its recently signed trade deal with the U.S. will be affected by a court ruling blocking most of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Britain was the first country to reach a deal with Mr. Trump after he announced sweeping tariffs in April on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Canada. The U.K.-U.S. agreement, although limited, was hailed as a model for other countries hoping to win similar relief from Mr. Trump.

Under the deal, announced on May 8, Mr. Trump agreed to eliminate the U.S.'s 25-per-cent tariff on imports of British steel and aluminum. The President also agreed to cut the U.S. tariff on British cars from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, but only on 100,000 imported vehicles per year. The U.K. and U.S. also moved to improve market access for beef imports. 

However, a baseline U.S. tariff of 10 per cent on imports of all other British goods remains in place. Prior to April, U.S. duties on British imports were around 3 per cent.

The U.S Court of International Trade ruled Wednesday that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in introducing most of the tariffs, raising questions about the future of the U.K.-U.S. deal. The White House has vowed to appeal the decision and carry on with Mr. Trump's aggressive trade policy. 

A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs from going into effect, ruling that the President overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from countries that sell more to the U.S. than they buy.

Reuters

British officials were hoping to speed up implementation of the recently signed trade deal during talks next week between trade officials. On Thursday, a statement issued by Downing Street said the court ruling was a matter “for the U.S. to determine domestically, and we note this is only the first stage of legal proceedings.”

The statement added: “We were the first to secure a deal with the U.S. in a move to protect jobs across key sectors, from autos to steel, and we are working to ensure that businesses can benefit from the deal as quickly as possible.”

The court decision won't affect the U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum or cars since they were imposed under different legislation. The ruling would affect the sweeping 10 per cent tariff on all other U.K. imports.

The London Stock Exchange's FTSE 100 stock index opened slightly higher on Thursday but most of the gains were erased by noon British time. 

“That the gains were measured rather than blockbuster reflects a healthy level of skepticism over whether this can truly rein in the Trump administration, which has already launched an appeal against the judgment,” said Russ Mould, investment director of Manchester-based A.J. Bell. 

The court ruling “clearly adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to what Trump is doing when businesses don't know what tariffs their product would face in the U.S. That can't be good for the economy,” said David Henig, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy a Belgium-based think tank. 

The European Union has also been grappling with how to respond to Mr. Trump, who has threatened to hit the EU with 50-per-cent tariffs on all exports in addition to higher duties on steel, aluminum and cars. Those import taxes have been delayed until July, but Wednesday's ruling will complicate negotiations. 

EU trade negotiator Maros Sefcovic is expected to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Paris next week.

Geologists had predicted that a rockslide near Blatten — home to nearly 300 — was imminent. Residents were evacuated on May 19 before a glacier collapsed, causing the landslide.

A mass of rock and ice engulfed part of a mountain village in Switzerland on Wednesday, authorities said.

A local spokesman said one person was currently missing after the landslide near Blatten, in the southern Lötschental valley in the canton of Valais.

The massive landslide was caused after a glacier partially collapsed in the Swiss Alps.

""An unbelievable amount of material thundered down into the valley,"" said spokesperson, Matthias Ebener.

Authorities had warned days ago that up to five million cubic meters of rock and debris could break off at any moment.

The village's roughly 300 inhabitants were evacuated on May 19 after assessments from geologists established that a rockslide was imminent.

Buildings and other infrastructure in Blatten were hit hard by the rockslide, Ebener said.

Video shared widely on social media showed the moment the glacier partially collapsed, creating an enormous cloud that obscured part of the mountain as rock and debris came thundering down into the outskirts of the village. 

Drone footage showed the rubble of shattered wooden buildings on the flanks of the huge mass of earth in the drone footage.

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed her support for those impacted by the landslide.

""It's terrible to lose your home. I feel for the residents of Blatten at this time,"" Keller-Sutter said on X.

A US court has ruled President Donald Trump overstepped his authority when imposing ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration. DW has more.

Here's a roundup of news from the United States on Thursday, May 29, 2025:

The White House reacted strongly rebuked a federal court's decision to block many of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which has been seen as a setback to his trade strategy.

The White House called this ruling ""blatantly wrong"" on social media, expressing confidence that the decision would be overturned on appeal.

Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro also told Bloomberg Television: ""Nothing's really changed. If anybody thinks this caught the administration by surprise, think again.""

Attorneys for the Trump administration have filed an appeal against the ruling, which gave the White House 10 days to complete the process of halting affected tariffs. 

White House spokesman Kush Desai earlier said: ""It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.""

An initial rally in various stock markets on Thursday eased off as uncertainty continued following a court ruling related to the global tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

The ruling saw the stock markets in Tokyo and Seoul, which had the first chance to react, leap by almost 2%, after raising hopes in financial markets that a hamstrung Trump would not see the economy move into a recession with his desired tariffs.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney welcomed the decision, saying it was ""consistent with Canada's longstanding position"" that Trump's tariffs were unlawful.

However, other US trading partners offered careful responses. The British government said the ruling was a domestic matter for the US administration and noted it was ""only the first stage of legal proceedings."" 

Trump ""is still able to impose significant and wide-ranging tariffs over the longer-term through other means,"" according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.

China urged the United States on Thursday to completely drop all the tariffs that it has imposed since President Donald Trump took office in January after a US federal court blocked most of them from going into effect.

""China urges the United States to heed the rational voices from the international community and domestic stakeholders and fully cancel the wrongful unilateral tariff measures,"" Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian told a news conference. 

China has been a major target of US tariffs, with Trump recently raising them to 145% before pulling them back to 30% for 90 days of negotiation.

Most economists have said the sweeping levies ordered by Trump would be unlikely to produce the positive effects for the US economy that he has promised.

Beijing has condemned the US decision, announced on Wednesday, to revoke the visas of Chinese students.

""The US has unreasonably canceled Chinese students' visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. ""China firmly opposes this and has lodged representations with the US.""

Mao went on to say that the decision had ""seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and disrupted the normal cultural exchanges between the two countries.""

""This political and discriminatory practice of the US has exposed the lies of the so-called freedom and openness that the US has always advertised, and further damaged the US's own international image, national image and national credibility,"" she said.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday evening that visas for Chinese students would be ""aggressively"" revoked and future visa applications from China and Hong Kong subjected to enhanced scrutiny.

Chinese students are one of the largest sources of revenue for US universities, and make up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States. Only India has a larger student contingent in the US.

The visa move seems in line with the Trump administration's seemingly hostile attitude to US institutes of higher learning, which  it apparently sees as bastions of a liberal ideology that is at odds with its own agenda. 

The court ruling has invalidated with immediate effect all of the orders on tariffs given by Trump since January that took the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as a justification.

Among other things, it applies to the sweeping import duties on most trading partners that Trump announced on April 2, which included tariffs at a baseline of 10% in addition to higher levies on dozens of economies, including China and the European Union.

Separate duties imposed by Trump on Canada, Mexico and China under the IEEPA have also been ruled invalid.

But US tariffs imposed on automobiles, steel and aluminum remain unaffected, as they were issued under a different statute.

There's still uncertainty about what will happen next as the Trump adminstration, while already engaging in trade talks over the planned tariffs, lodges an appeal. 

""TACO trade"" — with the acronym standing for ""Trump Always Chickens Out"" — is the term coined by Robert Armstrong from The Financial Times to denote US President Donald Trump's tactic of setting high tariff rates, then pulling back.

The term has reportedly spread on Wall Street, as investors and traders learned to not react quickly to his decisions, but rather wait and see if he walks back on them. 

As could be expected, Trump himself is not pleased by the term, calling a reporter's question as to whether he was indeed chickening out ""nasty.""

""It's called negotiation; you set a number,"" Trump said.

Among other things, the president defended raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% before reducing them to 30% for 90 days to allow negotiations.

Trump claimed that his strategy has led to $14 billion (€12.4 billion) in new investment in the US, a figure that no economic data has so far fully substantiated.

""Don't ever say what you said!"" Trump told the reporter who asked him on Wednesday if TACO was a good description of his trade policy.

US President Donald Trump's administration has canceled $766 million (€681 million) awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc to develop an mRNA vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the avian flu strain H5N1, the company said.

The cancelation is the latest anti-vaccine move by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long promoted misinformation about immunization and particulary mRNA vaccines, which were key to the fight against COVID-19.

The development by Moderna of a vaccine against H5N1 comes as experts warn that the strain, which has been circulating among birds and cattle, could jump to humans and trigger another pandemic.

As Moderna announced the cancelation of the federal funding, it also announced positive results from an early-stage clinical trial of the vaccine.

""While the termination of funding from HHS [Health and Human Services Department] adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine, and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,"" said CEO Stephane Bancel in a statement. 

""These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,"" he said.

During his first term in office, Trump backed the so-called Operation Warp Speed, a private-public partnership that aimed to facilitate the fast development of COVID-19 vaccines, among them the mRNA vaccines that Kennedy regards with suspicion.

Harvard University is due to hold its annual graduation ceremony Thursday as the storied Ivy League institute continues to contend with the punitive measures taken against itby President Donald Trump.

Dr. Abraham Verghese, a bestselling author and Stanford expert on infectious diseases, will be the principal speaker at what will be the university's 374th commencement.

On Wednesday,  basketball star and human rights campaigner Kareem Abdul-Jabbar addressed the class of 2025 for Class Day, praising the university's president, Alan Garber, for taking a stand against Trump.

""When a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard to give up their academic freedom and destroy free speech, Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures the way Rosa Parks declined,"" he said to applause.

Rosa Parks was a Black activist whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955 triggered a boycott that ultimately led to the desegregation of the city's public transit services, which is seen as a watershed moment in the US civil rights movement.

Since taking office, Trump has sought to ban the university from having foreign students, canceled its contracts with the federal government and slashed grants worth millions of dollars, while accusing it of antisemitism and liberal bias.

All the measures are being challenged in court.

Harvard was founded in 1636, making it a century and a half older than the US itself.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel held the commencement speech at Harvard in 2019.

The German Association of University Professors and Lecturers has criticized the decision by the US Trump administration to suspend the processing of visas for foreign students.

""International mobility is the lifeblood of free academic activity,"" Lambert T. Koch, the association's president, told the corporate newsroom Redaktionsnetwerk Deutschland.

Any country calling this into question by suspending visa procedures or imposing other restrictions not only made itself ""an enemy of learning but also did massive damage to itself — in the short and, above all, longer term,"" he said.

Koch said that German students would also very likely be affected by the new restrictions.

He said there were few ways that the US government could be influenced from the outside, meaning that ""German students that want to go to the US or are already there will also suffer under the completely wrong direction it has taken.""

In response to Washington's move, he said, Europe and Germany should ""signal great openness and make themselves even more attractive than before for international students and researchers.""

More than a million international students are enrolled in US universities. Most of them come from India and China. 

After the Court of International Trade in New York ruled that Trump's sweeping tariffs were illegal, the US president's administration lodged an appeal. 

The rest of the world is waking up as the US goes to sleep, and we're waiting for reactions on the latest developments, as well as other news related to the US. 

US President Donald Trump issued a string of pardons for politicians, reality TV stars, including a former New York congressman, a Connecticut governor, a rapper known as ""NBA YoungBoy,"" a labor union leader and a former Army officer who ignored safety measures during the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump also signed pardons for reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were imprisoned after being convicted three years ago of bank fraud and tax evasion. Trump announced his plan to pardon them on Tuesday, saying the celebrity couple had been ""given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I'm hearing.""

He also commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gangster serving a life sentence at a supermax prison in Colorado.

The latest round of pardons is another example of Trump pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.
 

A federal court ruled that the Trump administration wrongly revoked the humanitarian parole of hundreds of thousands of people allowed to live temporarily in the United States.

The court ruling is another setback for Trump's plan to deport people from the US on a large scale, but it could prove to be temporary and it is unclear how it will impact the concerned immigrants.

US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston sided with people and temporarily blocked the US government from halting legal entry ""parole"" programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants with US sponsors to enter the country legally.

Talwani said two orders by Department of Homeland Security officials to suspend parole renewals pending further review were unlikely to survive a legal challenge.

One of the orders ""gives no reasoned explanation"" for the actions, she wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elon Musk, who has led a department tasked with cutting government inefficiency, has announced his time as a government employee is ending. 

""As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,"" he wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. 

The Associated Press news agency reported Musk is leaving his government position after disagreeing with measures in Trump's budget bill. Reuters news agency later confirmed that Musk was leaving the administration and that his ""offboarding"" would be on Wednesday.

Musk's departure was decided at the ""senior staff"" level and the billionaire did not have a conversation with the president ahead of the announcement he would leave.

Musk's 130-day term as a special government employee was set to expire around May 30. The administration has said DOGE's efforts to restructure and shrink the federal government will continue.

The agency has come under significant criticism for its approach to cutting government spending as well as for the veracity of the amount it has saved the government. 

Musk said previously that after his temporary government position ends, he would turn his attention back to his businesses, such as the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.

Shortly after the court's decision, the White House responded that it was ""not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.""

As expected, the government also filed a notice of appeal to the ruling from the New York-based US Court of International Trade.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students, ""including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.""

Rubio wrote in a post on X that the government would ""aggressively"" revoke visas for students from China.

""The US State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,"" he said.

Rubio added that there would also be revisions to visa criteria and enhanced scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong.

China is the second-largest country of origin for international students in the US, behind only India. In the 2023-2024 school year, over 270,000 students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.

Earlier this week, Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students as the State Department prepares guidelines for increased vetting of their social media activity. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

A US trade court has blocked Donald Trump's tariffs from going into effect in what is a significant setback for the US president.

The Manhattan-based Court of International Trade on Wednesday ruled that the US president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the United States than they buy.

The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries that is not overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the US economy.

“The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the president's use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,” a three-judge panel said in the decision.

The Trump administration minutes later filed a notice of appeal.

The ruling quashes duties that Mr Trump imposed on Canada, Mexico and China separately using those emergency powers.

It came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the non-partisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states.

The companies, which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments, have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business.

The White House and lawyers for groups that sued did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and one of Mr Trump's lead policy advisers, rebuked the court in a brief social media post, writing: “The judicial coup is out of control.”

At least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states' lawsuit, called Mr Trump's tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating.

“This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,” Mr Rayfield said in a statement.

Mr Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency.

The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Mr Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.

The Justice Department has said the lawsuits should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by tariffs that they have not yet paid, and because only Congress, not private businesses, can challenge a national emergency declared by the president under IEEPA.

Mr Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on most trading partners on April 2, at a baseline 10 per cent, plus steeper levies on dozens of economies, including China and the European Union. Many of those country-specific tariffs were paused a week later.

The US president had called the trade deficit a national emergency in order to justify his 10 per cent across-the-board tariff on all imports.

The Trump administration on May 12 then said it was temporarily reducing the steepest tariffs on China while working on a longer-term trade deal.

Both countries agreed to cut tariffs on each other for at least 90 days.

			End of ‘special' role confirmed – days after billionaire criticised Trump's policies

Elon Musk has stepped down from his role in the Trump administration, days after criticising the most significant spending bill of the president's second term. 

The Tesla billionaire thanked Mr Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending”, but has denied falling out with his boss.

His departure comes days after he criticised the president's spending plan, saying it “undermines” the work he had been doing in the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).

The comments were part of his broader criticism of Mr Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, which has promised to deliver $4.5 trillion (£3.3 trillion) worth of tax cuts, while significantly increasing America's deficit.

Mr Musk has previously warned that the world's largest economy was going “bankrupt” as a result of its $36.2 trillion debt pile, echoing similar concerns made by economists since Mr Trump came to power.

The 53-year-old had been designated as a “special government employee”, giving him access to work in the administration for 130 days. The deadline was due to expire on May 30.

In an announcement posted on social media, Mr Musk said his “scheduled time as a special government employee” was coming “to an end”.

Mr Trump did not immediately comment on the departure, and a source told Reuters that Mr Musk had made the announcement prior to any formal exit conversation with the president.

Mr Musk had been a central figure in the Trump campaign, spending billions of dollars to help the president get elected in November, before dominating the first few weeks of Mr Trump's second term by promising to slash $1 trillion of government spending.

At one point, Mr Musk called himself the president's “first buddy”, and promised to donate $100 million to help with the 2026 midterm elections, though the money is yet to come in.

But The New York Times reported that Mr Musk became disillusioned with Washington after spending $25 million on a judicial election in Wisconsin, which the Republicans lost, and that he was uncomfortable with Mr Trump's sweeping global tariffs agenda.

Mr Trump, meanwhile, initially liked having the Tesla founder around, but grew concerned when learning that Mr Musk was set to receive a classified briefing about China at the Pentagon.

Another source of tension for Mr Musk centred around the president's recent visit to the Middle East.

Prior to Mr Trump's four-day visit to the Gulf states, Mr Musk expressed concern over a proposed deal between the UAE and OpenAI, a rival to his own AI company, xAI, which was not included in the deal.

Mr Musk ended up joining the trip but was among a number of billionaires, including OpenAI's Sam Altman, who lined up to shake Mr Trump's hand.

Speaking before his exit from the White House, Mr Musk admitted he had already planned to spend less time in politics and more on business.

“I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics,” Mr. Musk told Ars Technica this week.

He added: “It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”

It comes after he admitted that slashing government spending was more difficult than he had initially thought.

“It's a long road to go, and, you know, it's really difficult,” he told reporters at the White House. “It's sort of, how much pain is, you know, the cabinet and is Congress willing to take?

“Because it can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”

Mr Musk said it remained to be seen whether there was “sufficient political will in Congress and elsewhere to actually do that”.

Speaking over the weekend, he said he would go “back to spending 24/7 at work”.

“I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla.”

“Making durable changes isn't always about the raw numbers,” says Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò. 

“Making durable changes isn't always about the raw numbers,” says Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Táíwò and host Kelly Hayes talk about protest, why large “awareness raising” events will not defeat Trump and the kind of actions and formations we need in these times. 

Music by Son Monarcas & David Celeste

Note: This is a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes.

[musical interlude]

KH: Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò: Thanks for having me.

KH: How are you doing today?

OOT: Pretty good, all things considered. How are you doing?

KH: I am managing and muddling, which I guess is pretty okay, all things considered. I am also really grateful to be in conversation with you today.

OOT: Likewise.

KH: So, some of our listeners will obviously be familiar with your work, or might remember our last conversation, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your work?

OOT: I teach political philosophy at Georgetown. My political interests extend beyond teaching political philosophy. I'm one of the fellows at the Climate and Community Institute. I've done organizing in the past with my workers union, first in grad school, which was a UAW local, and am now one of the people organizing Georgetown's AAUP chapter. And beyond that, my interests are in the Black radical tradition, anticolonial traditions, both intellectually and otherwise.

KH: Well, I am so glad to have you back on the show, because, among other things, I have been eager to discuss your recent piece, “Why Protests Should Be Promises,” which was published in Time magazine. In the piece, you argue that protests should not only express dissent but also serve as credible threats of sustained action, such as strikes, boycotts, or other forms of collective withholding to compel systemic change. Could you talk about why this concept of a protest as a promise feels especially urgent in this moment?

OOT: I think one of the things that, obviously, veteran organizers well know, but maybe people who are newer to organizing, newer to protest culture, might reflect on is why protests work. I think we've been often given this very tidy story about past political movements, especially the civil rights movement, where there was a march and there was expression of disagreement, there was awareness spread about social injustices of various kinds. Then question mark, question mark, then change happened, and a lot of details go unremarked on, unreflected on in those question marks that we skip past.

And in general, I think we're starting to see that lack of reflection reflect itself in the organizing. It's fine if people have criticisms of this or that particular organization out there, if you have criticisms of a particular union or unions in general, or if you have criticisms of a particular church or churches in general or if you have criticisms of a particular religious organization. But the reason why these kinds of collections of people were able to succeed at being parts of social change in previous generations, in previous eras of political history, is because of what I was talking about in the article.

It was because they were able to command not just attention, not just cause awareness of political issues, but they could meaningfully mess things up for the powerful as a result of being able to organize people at scale, whether it was the bus boycotts, whether it was strike actions, whether it was withholding rent. And I think we need to think about that kind of leverage if we believe our own criticisms of the people in power.

I think a lot of people agree with the notions that the various people in power, the health care executives, the shareholders of large corporations – they don't care. They're insufficiently attentive to what's going on in our society. They're letting people become homeless, they're letting people die of preventable health care problems. And if we really internalize the view of the world that I think follows from that, then I don't think we can have an awareness-based strategy of how we get them to stop running health care or housing or anything else in the way that they're doing.

KH: I really appreciate what you've raised here about leveraging power, because I agree that we are dealing with some major, popular misunderstandings around protest. In addition to the historical simplifications you were talking about, one of my concerns is that a lot of people simply don't know what it means to build leverage. For example, after the Hands Off marches that some of us participated in, which drew millions of people into the streets, I saw some people referring hopefully to the “3.5 percent rule.” For folks who are unfamiliar, the 3.5 percent rule is a theory derived from Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth's research on nonviolent movements. The theory suggests that no government can withstand a challenge of 3.5 percent of the country's population mobilizing against it in a peak event.

Now, in addition to the fact that Chenoweth has acknowledged that there are actual historical exceptions to this theory, including recent uprisings in Bahrain, where the government withstood a mobilization of 6 percent of the country's population, Chenoweth has also stated:

The rule does not speak to leadership, strategic imagination, organizational capacity, or sustainability. Strategic leadership is required to organize a constituency, motivate their engagement, design campaigns adaptively, innovate tactics creatively, mobilize allies, respond to adversaries, sustain long-term organizational capacity, and devise alternatives to existing systems. A movement's ability to do this is probably more important than a movement's ability to quickly mobilize a large number of people, especially because today's digital organizing environment makes it easier to coordinate mass protests but not necessarily to sustain them.

Now, I know that was a long quote, but I think it's really important. Chenoweth also specifies that the movements she studied for her dataset were not reformist movements, but movements that sought maximalist outcomes, such as overthrowing governments or claiming independence. So we're talking about different contexts as well, depending on your perspective. 

Alongside those caveats, there are also critiques of Chenoweth and Stephan's work that I think are worth considering. I find Andreas Malm's counterarguments particularly compelling, but even if we were to take the 3.5 percent rule, as Chenoweth has explained it at face value, we need to understand that it doesn't mean that 3.5 percent of us getting together on a Saturday afternoon and participating in permitted marches across the country and holding signs will mean that Trump has to resign. That is not a thing. And I am not saying this to devalue the big marches that people have organized because I do think they have value. I attended those protests for a reason. I believe mass marches can help us rally our collective spirits and remind people that they're not alone, and that they have the potential to be a part of something larger than themselves.

But I think trying to recreate that energy through mass marches repeatedly, whether the marches are permitted or not, is a losing proposition because you're not really amassing power. You're not, as you're saying, establishing leverage, and you're not affecting material outcomes. And over time, people get tired of doing the same thing and not seeing any results. So numbers dwindle, which feels disempowering to the people who do keep showing up. And I have seen this kind of errant approach of continuously trying to replicate moments that feel empowering or inspiring across a number of movements. And we really don't have time to get stuck in this cycle this time around.

Strategy right now is not about scheduling the next big march.

OOT: Yeah, I absolutely agree. And I would just add, if we're talking about a counterexample to the surface-level misreading that once you get a mass protest of 3 percent of the population that you get large-scale social change, we could add ourselves in the United States to that, right? The estimates of the percentage of the population that participated in the 2020 summer uprisings after the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, they range from 6 percent to 10 percent of the U.S. population. So I think it's important both that we understand that the claim being made in the first place wasn't if you have a protest or a series of protests with a certain percentage of the population that you're automatically going to get social change, and then I think it's also important, the clarification that you point out about Chenoweth, what demands people were making is an important aspect of the extra details we would want to know besides the 3.5 percent magic number, what other organizational capacities the people represented in the 3.5 or whatever percent have and cultivate is something that we would want to know that gets left out of that simple story. And the more you stare at those details, the more, I think, you have to come to the conclusion that those are actually the things that matter most, more than the 3.5 percent number.

So, obviously, the more people are involved, the better, and there's a reason to keep track of how many people are involved, but we really need to focus in on what we're getting people involved to do. And it's got to be something better, deeper, and more compelling than just telling people to express displeasure with how things are going.

KH: So, in thinking about what actually makes a protest effective, I'm curious, is there a protest you've participated in that you believe was especially effective?

OOT: There's one I think about a lot in this context, just because, in a way, it's my personal best counterexample to the excessive number focus. One of the most influential, most successful protests I've ever participated in had, if I recall correctly, exactly five people involved. We were protesting the lack of all-gender restrooms on the third floor of our building, which is where the philosophy department was at UCLA. And one of my union siblings, she figured out who the decision-maker was on the facility side of things that was the immediate barrier between getting a bathroom designated as an all-gender bathroom and not. 

And she organized a bunch of us to go plaster this guy's name across campus, to make signs, to have a bullhorn, and walk the right blocks of campus where the right people would notice us. And lo and behold, I think to this day, there is still an all-gender bathroom on the third floor of Dodd Hall. And all it took was knowing specifically who to pressure, how to pressure them, and getting not zero people, not one person, but enough people, which turned out to be literally five. But the context was we were all members of the workers union or most of us were. And I think the administration knew that if they dug in too hard, the next version of this confrontation might involve more than five people. It might involve things like the press and so on and so forth.

So I don't want to make it sound as though as soon as you find four other people, you can make any change to any political system. But I think the point stands that making durable changes, making specific kinds of interventions politically, isn't always about the raw numbers. Sometimes it's about picking your spots and knowing what's vulnerable, and importantly, having the ability to, when the chips are down, move large numbers.

KH: I love that. And to be honest, this question of what makes a protest effective is really dear to my heart, as a movement educator, so I am going to geek out and go on a bit of a rant here. 

I usually think of protest, not in terms of permitted marches, but in terms of direct action. Every direct action is a protest, but not every protest is a direct action. A direct action is an intervention that occurs outside the status quo, so it's something we're not getting permission for. And in the school of thought I've worked with, there are four primary purposes for a direct action: To advance a strategic campaign, to mark a momentous occasion, to participate in acts of political communion, or to address the needs of our communities in ways that defy or challenge the status quo. Some direct actions represent a mashup of these intentions. 

For example, here in Chicago, we have a long tradition of rallying outside juvenile detention centers around the December holidays. We sing songs and sometimes we carry lighted messages that spell out the words, “WE LOVE YOU,” and we bring messages of love and care to the young people inside those facilities, which fulfills a community need. Those young people need our love and support. And at the same time, by standing out there in the cold, and singing, and tearing up while those children wave and draw hearts in soap on their windows, we are also reaffirming our values. That's political communion. We are being reminded of who we are, and why we're in the struggle in the first place — and that's very important to our political endurance. 

But we're not just organizing to comfort people who are harmed by the system or to reaffirm who we are in relation to the system, we're also trying to make material changes.

So in that vein, another action that comes to mind for me is a really simple one, in the home stretch for the fight for reparations, for victims of police torture in Chicago, Rahm Emanuel was particularly politically vulnerable very suddenly because he wound up in a mayoral runoff. We planned and executed a lot of actions during that time, but one that I think carried a lot of weight was an artful action outside his home. It was very cold, there was a lot of snow on the ground, and there were cops outside guarding his house because this was a moment of peak protest. But a group of people all sprang out of their cars and around corners at the same time. And we spelled out a message in lights outside his home and the message read, “REPARATIONS NOW.”

We got a photo with the house in the background and we turned around for a moment to face the house so Rahm could see the message. We saw lights go out inside the house, so we knew there were people there seeing it, pretending not to be home. And then we got out of there before anyone got arrested. That image, as part of the campaign, went viral on social media. It was published, and republished, and it really carried the message that this legacy of torture and the demand to address it was inescapable for Emanuel. We were literally bringing it to his doorstep.

That attention was the last thing he needed or wanted to focus on at that time. And we ultimately won that campaign. And a lot of people, who were tortured under the leadership of Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge, received reparations in the form of monetary compensation, mental health care, access to education for themselves and their families, and more. And that home stretch of direct actions was crucial to that outcome. But we're also talking about an effort that was many years in the making, a true coalitional effort between groups and individuals. And ultimately, it was won by leveraging our power and the political vulnerability of our bitch-ass mayor.

OOT: Magnificent.

KH: So let's talk about what we need to accomplish and build right now. What do you think the organizing and formations we need to get out of this mess look like?

OOT: So I think anything that can play the role of strong-arming the people in charge could potentially be the kind of organization or the kind of effort that would work. Historically, unless you're seceding from a country, then maybe you're talking about an army or a militia. I guess if folks want to do that, they can do that. But historically, we're talking about unions, workers unions, tenants unions. More recently, people have been talking about creating debtors unions. These are organizations that involve the disempowered, but don't just involve them in the way that NGOs might involve the disempowered or the way that philanthropy, that charity might involve the disempowered, that's like recipients of something that some other group of people are doing. But the point of a union is to make the disempowered powerful.

The point of a tenants union is that if the landlord has to deal with all the tenants at once, now suddenly it's not as obvious. It's not as clear who has the upper hand in that engagement. You're evening the playing field just a little bit. And the more powerful the tenant union is, the more even the playing field is. I think in principle, any group of people that's prepared to take an action, whether it's one of those kinds of organizations or some other kind, could be that kind of organization, so long as the action hits the enemy where it hurts. So the Montgomery bus boycott, not principally organized by unions, but withholding money from people that want money, that's a way to have leverage. The people boycotting Target right now, I think you could say, are doing a version of that. And I think they're putting some real pressure on Target and I think time will tell how well that works. But I think it's certainly the kind of thing that has worked historically, and it represents smart political thinking, so we need to do a lot more of that.

KH: I agree that we need union power, now more than ever. If people want to learn more about union organizing, I really recommend checking out No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age by Jane McAlevey. And if people are interested in tenant organizing, I think Abolish Rent is an absolute must-read. I really agree with you that moments of mass protest should be moments where we are flexing the structured power that we are building.

I also really think this is a time for people to experiment, in terms of doing what it takes to meet community needs, from accessing the care people need to organizing community defense. There are longstanding traditions of harm reduction work that people can learn from, in terms of what it means to care for people, even when that means breaking the rules. For people who feel drawn toward that kind of work, I really recommend checking out Shira Hassan's book Saving Our Own Lives and Angela's Hume's book Deep Care. Dean Spade's book Mutual Aid is also a really important resource, if you're focused on addressing community needs. 

And if people are really interested in work that involves breaking rules, I would also encourage folks to know who they are working with and make sure that you have a lot of trust, and have done some solid risk assessment, because we want people to act righteously and consent to risk in an informed way. For some people, who they can trust with information that shouldn't be public is obvious — maybe you have co-strugglers or trusted neighbors, or people you've known for years who are the only people you would do that kind of work with. That's ideal. But if you don't have that kind of long-term understanding, and you're looking to break rules, I highly recommend checking out Vision Change Win's Get in Formation Toolkit. There is a section on vetting that everyone should read, and you can also use their risk assessment toolkit to think through what you're doing, and make sure you've covered all of your bases. Because whatever we're doing, we want to look out for ourselves and each other, and move in a good way.

And speaking of how we move, and how we build with people, I have frequently quoted something you said on social media about what we prioritize in our dealings with other people. You wrote, “At some point, you should decide whether you will accept the discipline imposed by your material objectives and commitments or the discipline imposed by your resentments.” Can you talk about the distinction between the discipline imposed by our objectives and the discipline imposed by our resentments, and how you see these motivations showing up on the political landscape?

OOT: So one of the themes I've talked a lot about in the last few years, especially around the idea of elite capture and some of the discussions that get brought up in that context, is coalitional politics. I think people rightly have lots of resentments about the way that they are treated, people who are dealing with bigotry on a daily basis, dealing with disrespect on a daily basis. Part of being the kind of person that would fight for a better world is being the kind of person that doesn't just take disrespect and bigotry lying down. We should be the kind of people that object to that, whether it happens at work or in the organizing place or wherever it happens.

So at bottom, I'm deeply sympathetic to the resentment people have about misogyny or about racism or about any of the other things that we're fighting against in our organizations. But one of the places that people often take it is a suspicion, sometimes even what they take as a principled stance against certain kinds of relationships. We're not going to work politically with this kind of person or with that organization because of the kind of people that are in that org. And that is one response you can have to the well-earned, well-justified resentments that we all develop.

But there is still the question of what it is you're trying to accomplish politically and whether or not, as a matter of fact, you can do it without that org over there or without that neighbor over there or without that section of the union. And I think if we're serious about things like the 3.5 percent rule, if we're serious about things like mass politics, if we're serious about things like organizing across our workplace or our apartment building or our church congregation, we're going to find ourselves in a position where we have to choose between leaning into our assessments of who deserves our support or who deserves our scorn and resentment and who it is that we, in fact, need to work with and build with if we're going to get the job done, if we're going to challenge the richest, most well-armed organizations and people on the planet.

And I think we will find, if we ask ourselves the strategic questions that we … We need a lot of people. We certainly don't need people who are going to actively work against our interests. So there's a fine line between letting things go and letting wreckers in, but we need to be honest about where that line is. And sometimes we mobilize arguments that are designed to prevent people from entering the movement who are wreckers, and we use those arguments to defend our own wrecker-type behavior. And that is what I'm getting at with that quote. We need to be disciplined … We will be disciplined by something. We will behave, we will make choices, we will make connections or fail to make connections, and we can either let our anger do the choosing for us or we can let our goals do the choosing for us.

KH: I really appreciate what you're saying about taking mass politics seriously, and taking what we believe it takes to win seriously, because, as a jumping off point, I don't think everyone does. I think that some of the politics of disqualification, where people kind of wear ideologies and ideas as merit badges, and strut around saying, “Behold my righteous politics,” and vote people off the island all day — I think that shit's often, really, a form of surrender. It's a resignation, a shrinking down of what it means to do politics to the scale of maybe winning arguments or coming off as better than someone else. It's about having a righteous political identity rather than winning a political battle, and I think that often, the object of winning doesn't even enter into the calculus, because there's no theory or vision of that — other than maybe, at best, the bad guys will eventually crumble on their own, and personally, I can't accept that as a game plan. Even if I were to accept that as inevitable, the costs along the way are too damn high. 

Dwelling in expressions of disdain, disgust, and sanctimony may get likes and reposts, because people love that shit, but it does not build power. And while people on the left model that, and some folks mistake that kind of acting out for the work of doing politics, the right is accumulating more and more actual power, and taking even greater control of our lives. 

And so I think that we need to, as you say, acknowledge that we have a right to be mad about some shit, and also be disciplined about what we want to see happen. As Mariame and I wrote in Let This Radicalize You, how much discomfort is the whole world worth? That is an admonition I take seriously in my own work, and I am challenged by it all the time. And you know, anyone who has worked with me knows, I am no pushover. I will push back on some fucked up behavior, but I also approach difference more carefully and diplomatically than I would have ten years ago, because I am a better organizer now than I was ten years ago. Organizing is a craft, and I am better than I used to be at prioritizing what I want to see happen, and what I hope we're all going to do in order to survive, or have health care, or have homes, or end police violence — whatever it is, I know how to make that more important than the fact that I am not gonna like everyone in the room, and that some folks are gonna be on some bullshit. 

But sometimes when I say this, people will tell me that people not experiencing social consequences for having taken bad or offensive positions doesn't help us move forward. What would you say to those folks?

OOT: If someone can tell me the story, actually, if someone can paint me the consequential picture that starts at being shunned by a few leftists on the internet or something and ending up at a real change of heart, not just on the scale of the particular individuals being shunned, but on the scale of, say, the 3.5 percent number or even larger than that, if that's the story of a massive cultural shift, I'd be receptive to that. I don't think out of hand that it's impossible that we could get to one from the other, but I don't myself see it.

I think at the end of the day, you have to make a decision about what it is that you mean when you're saying that what your politics is informed by is a political ideology like anti-imperialism or socialism, or is informed by advocacy for a particular marginalized group, a pro-women politics or pro-Black politics, something like that, is what you mean that the aesthetic in your head that you attach to those ideas you describe as pro-Black or pro-woman or pro-colonized, or something like that, or do you mean that you actually want to do something for the actual people out there in the world that correspond to those labels because those people think all sorts of things and are problematic in all sorts of ways and are excellent in all sorts of ways and have opinions that were not formed in a radical reading group, but were formed by the same propaganda and the same material oppression that formed the rest of the world.

And I think the retreat from engaging with the actual empirical things that people think and say across identity groups, across classes, across races, across genders, et cetera, and just carving out a small niche of like-minded people that you're willing to engage with is a form of surrender, as you were saying, because it's trading the actual nature of the struggle that we have in front of us with a science fictional one. We don't need to contend with the things people actually think and say out there in the world outside of the people that view the world in the way that we do. And we certainly don't need to deal with the consequences of the decisions those people make out there, except as they inform what criticisms we circulate amongst ourselves in here. But once you adopt the actual practical goal of trying to do something about the world outside of your affinity group, outside of the circle of people that think and move like you do, you necessarily have to take seriously some stuff that maybe objectively doesn't deserve to be taken seriously or maybe people that you think don't deserve to be taken seriously, but that's the job, or else we're just not doing the thing that we say we're doing.

KH: I also think we need a lot more humility. As a Native person living in the United States, I have never seen clean hands or clean money, and I have met very few people in my life who I would say did not benefit from someone else's suffering or oppression, and who did not move in ignorance or indifference to that oppression and suffering, at some point, and that includes me. I think that we had really better hope that people can be redeemed for the ways that they have been ignorant of other people's suffering, benefited from other people's suffering, and not really read into the consequences of their actions. We had all better hope that people can be redeemed, under those circumstances, because I don't really know anyone in my day-to-day life who's excluded from that.

We live in the heart of empire. There's lots of accountability to go around and there's a lot of mistakes that have been made. But I think that we really need to accept that any movement to make things better is going to be an amalgamation of flawed people operating on a really fucked-up terrain. It's going to be about trying to make things happen that need to happen.

And in that process, in the waging of struggle, what we can learn about each other, what we can learn from each other about how to maybe make some things right, that's not the pursuit of purity. It's the pursuit of solidarity and really showing up for each other in ways that are meaningful and doing the work of collective survival in ways that a lot of people clearly aren't ready for, but that I hope we are going to get ready for. Because, all of this disqualification, talking about why everybody and their brother isn't good enough to be part of the struggle — that shit does not reflect the stakes. When it comes down to it, in a struggle for collective survival, you struggle with the people who are there and who are willing to lock arms. And I think imprisoned organizers understand that better than anyone, which is why we should be learning everything we can from incarcerated and formerly incarcerated organizers right now, because those folks know what it's like to move under fascistic conditions. 

And good labor organizers understand this, too, inasmuch as you have to be able to organize with people who aren't of your own choosing. And if you can't do that, then you're really not going to get a thing done at scale. 

OOT: Yeah, who's in your apartment building? Who's on your cell block? You didn't pick those, but that's who you have to work with. And just to that same point about humility, I don't know, maybe some people … I actually have met some people that just seem to have, from birth, had good politics. Every now and again, I look at them like they're aliens because there's like three of them, but I am certainly not one of them. And I remember having not-so-good political opinions and habits and ways of talking. And I remember why I challenged those. And I'll tell you in not a single instance was it me just reasoning from first principles and the delightful purity of my soul out of propaganda and years of socialization into a better outlook. I happened to meet someone who told me something or led me to an experience that made me challenge some belief that I had or some fucked-up way of talking that I had or some fucked-up way of treating other people that I had.

And in my case, at least, a lot of those connections and a lot of those experiences are direct results of privileges that I had. I went to school and I got to read something that I wouldn't have gotten to read somehow else or I got to move across the country and I got to meet people that I wouldn't have met in southwestern Ohio. And I had experiences that I wouldn't have had over there. And so I think the honesty we should have about ourselves is one of the quickest routes, at least in my case, to humility, because whatever I'm getting right now, it's not because I was ordained, destined to come to the right political opinion. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time to think about something.

And so if we look out at the world, at our cell block, or at our shop floor, or at our apartment building and see people who didn't luck into those particular circumstances, why have the opinion that this person is some irredeemably politically problematic person rather than holding out the hope that maybe this person just hasn't chanced into the particular conversation that you chanced into that set you on your political trajectory. And why not also hold out the hope that you could be the person that sets them on a different political trajectory than they're currently on? Your talking to them could be the conversation that leads them to think about something differently from how they had thought about it before. Why couldn't it be you? Why couldn't it be this thing that you're doing with your neighbors or with your fellow workers or with the other people that owe money to the same institution you owe money to?

KH: Yes, and also, don't be shocked if it doesn't all come together in one conversation. In my experience, people's views change over time, through ongoing dialogues, and through the experience of shared struggle. Most people aren't responsive to someone walking up to them and saying, your politics are bad, use these instead. And people who are that impressionable are still going to be that impressionable when the next persuasive person comes along with a different view. So, I think this advice of yours, to think about our own growth processes, and how we've changed in our views and beliefs, is really important too. Most of us don't arrive at better ways of doing and thinking overnight. There are people who were patient with us, and we probably really annoyed and frustrated those people at times. I know I did, and I try to remember that anytime I'm the one giving someone else room to grow. And I'm not saying it always works out, or that people will always come around to a better way of thinking or doing, but if we write each other off quickly and easily, it definitely doesn't happen. 

[musical interlude]

I also want to talk a bit about language and how the Trump administration has characterized a lot of the harm it's doing. Many of the administration's attacks on workers, on public services, and on programs that people depend on have been framed as efforts to root out the influence of DEI programs. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has become code for Black people, women, accessibility, and really any acknowledgement of the existence of marginalized people. It's functionally similar to the way that right-wingers use the word “woke.” This puts us in a defensive position, but often, what we're defending isn't actually DEI, but rather, the truth of history, or the basic rights of marginalized people. We also know that DEI initiatives, as you recently wrote, often “wrapped corporate entities in a shawl of faux progressivism, donned to placate societal demands for civil rights, even while these same entities continued to oppose unionization and other efforts to meaningfully empower the workers whose diversity they were so eager to acknowledge.” So how do we navigate the demonization of DEI and defend what's actually under attack? How do we reframe this crisis in a manner that reflects the reality of the situation?

OOT: I think what's happening at the bottom is a direct assault on values, and it couldn't be clearer from the fact that the administration itself is naming DEI, naming diversity, equity, and inclusion as its enemy. Now, they're referring to it with an acronym and they're using cleverly the faux progressivism that we were just talking about, the empty association with those values that corporations developed to make it seem as though their target is this corporate perversion of the values or their target is the bad faith allusions to those values.

But you can see from the patterns of who they're firing from what they're canceling that their target just is the values. And I think this is the thing that represents an element of confusion for centrist institutions like the New York Times. If you are in essentially a valueless ideological space and you don't essentially believe in political values as an organizing feature of politics and political life, it's very hard to parse the difference between the attack on corporate DEI and the attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Those seem like the same thing from that political vantage point.

So I think what's incumbent on the rest of us is to do the opposite of this constant refrain that we need to pivot to anodyne issues like whatever the economy refers to and get out of contentious politics and just talk about potholes and jobs. But, in fact, I think there needs to be an even more full-throated defense of the values that are under attack by the Trump administration. Certainly not corporations versions of those, but the real solidarity-based versions of those thoughts and values that I think are alive and well in our movement spaces.

KH: The language that gets used to describe what's happening around us can really shape people's responses. You mentioned the New York Times, and I was especially grossed out recently by NYT reporter Eric Lipton's refusal to characterize Trump accepting a jet as a gift from a foreign state as corruption, because according to Lipton, corruption requires explicit quid pro quo. There are so many examples of the corporate press demurring or really doing the spin work you might have expected from Trump's lackeys during the first administration, but this time around, the administration doesn't feel the need to spin anything the president does. He's just off in this realm of extremity and the legacy media is doing the spin work for them. Some people call it “sanewashing,” but I think what we're really talking about is a laundering of fascist lies and a lot of preposterous behavior. Can you talk about that laundering process and what it means for our movements?

OOT: Yeah, I think my read … I don't know Eric Lipton, but I also feel like I've met a thousand versions of this guy. So just judging from that statement where there's a kind of person that just … It's the caricature of a centrist. I don't really know what I believe. I know what distance I would like to maintain between the people on the right who believe things and the people on the left who believe things. And that lack of a core set of one's own political commitments does, I think, draw you inevitably to sanewashing, because at the end of the day, you need to believe that wherever politics has ended up is somewhere near what is normal and reasonable, even if it tilts slightly to the right of your ideal version of those ideas or slightly to the left, depending on who's in office. But when the people to the right of you are fascist and you're still doing that, then absolutely, I think laundering of fascism is as good a description of any of that centrist positioning in that historical context.

I think what it means for our movements is there is a deep communications challenge, there's a deep informational challenge, that we have to take on because the institutions that are best positioned to rain alarm bells are effectively working for the other side. And I think that means we have to think seriously and strategically about what it is to develop an information architecture that is robust to the sanewashing of centrist legacy media. We have to develop other ways of not just getting information out, but getting … We have to develop ways not just of getting information out, but of sounding our own alarm bells, not just informing people, but rousing people to action.

And again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but this is one of the functions of organizations. Not everybody in Alabama was probably tracking transit politics, but the people who were sent out the message saying what we need to do at this point in time is boycott the bus system. And so people did. Not everybody in a union is going to be equally well positioned to track what's going on in bargaining, even if you have open bargaining in your union, but you're going to have people on the committee who will be in the room and who can report back to everyone else saying, “Negotiations are breaking down. We need to authorize a strike,” something like that.

Whatever else our organizations are, they are information networks and they work best when other information networks like ideally functioning press, like people's informal communities, people's religious affiliations, people's membership in clubs, people's hangout spots are also a part of the effort to make sure people know what's going on and people are in a position to do something about bad things that are going on. And we need to think really holistically about how we can set those up in a way that's going to be compatible with resisting the machinations of the people in charge to take all of the wealth and power for themselves.

KH: I absolutely agree. And I've also seen you talk about the importance of supporting independent media, and I just want to emphasize to folks how important that infrastructure is going to be in the coming months and years. We need to fortify the cooperative and supportive networks of independent media that exist right now. The Movement Media Alliance is a very important project. And I also want to shout out the Truthout Center for Grassroots Journalism, which is part of our organization here at Truthout, and headed up by my good friend Maya Schenwar. The Center is currently mentoring six independent news publications, helping folks firm up their fiscal and legal structures, support their staff, connect with movement people, and explore what kind of stories and authors they should engage with during this really scary and uncertain time. 

I get really frustrated when I hear about how we need a leftist Joe Rogan, or fucking whatever, when what we really need is to fortify the powerful longstanding work that people are doing, that already has a lot of reach, that has always been under-resourced, and has already helped elevate the voices and stories of our movements. The legacy media has capitulated, and the truth is its own front of struggle. There is no “saving democracy” without fighting on that front. The fabric of our shared reality is under attack. That's something that we absolutely cannot surrender. And I really need people to understand that. I am at Truthout because I believe in what we do, and I hope people will support the kind of media they believe in, and that they want to see in the world in these times.

And speaking of meaningful projects, and what we choose to engage with or support, I also want to ask about a piece you wrote for Teen Vogue called “Donald Trump and His Allies Don't Really Care What Kind of Leftist You Are.” In that piece, you wrote, “When you are recruited by people and projects to be a thing and others that want to do a thing, join the doers.” As we wrap up this conversation, can you talk about this distinction between being and doing and the kind of politics people should be wary of in these times?

OOT: Yeah. One thing that I've been through, especially as a baby leftist, was constantly flirting with these various ideological labels and groups. And I'll just use classic commie ones just as an example, but it's not something that's particular to socialism or communism. Everywhere on the left has their versions of these, these schools of thought or possible identifications that you can make. Am I a Maoist or a Trotskyist or Leninist or do I belong to this theory or that theory? And the particular kinds of sectarian squabbles that you would see come up around these would not confine themselves to reading groups about particular texts or discussions about particular segments of 20th century leftist history. People would click up around actual organizing efforts.

I just remember thinking, “Wait, so the way that we're supposed to try to confront the sheriff's department here in Los Angeles, what the fuck does that have to do with whether or not I buy so-and-so's criticism of the agricultural policy of 1930s Soviet Russia?” What is it that we're actually accomplishing by having these kinds of disagreements and trying to identify ourselves as the particular leftists of this or that tradition? And the more I organized, the more I thought about these sorts of things, the more I suspected that, for some people, the goalposts had shifted somewhere along the line and being a proper Trotskyist or a proper Nkrumaist or a proper this or that was actually the thing that they were trying to do politically rather than get the sheriff's department to stop collaborating with ICE, or rather than trying to defund the police department or rather than trying to retake over the school board.

And for some people, it was actually the other way around. Those struggles were in service of their goal of being the right leftist rather than trying to make any particular change to the world. And so it's the long way round to the discussion we were having earlier about these subtle forms of political surrender, where people stop trying to at least primarily accomplish political changes to the world, and people end up nursing resentments or nursing these kinds of ego-driven identifying goals.

And I think it's an unnecessary, unforced error that we should all do our best to try to avoid. I don't think living up to any particular historical figure or any particular subset of any political thinking is the important thing that we're doing. All of those, after all, were just ways of responding to the political problems of their times. And we should just do our version of that. Look outside, what is the thing you're going to try to get done? Who do you need to get it done? What do you need to get it done? How do you need to move to get it done? Those are the primary questions. And where that sits you next to the long history of political activism is interesting. I'm a nerd. I study philosophy for a living. I'm not uninterested in how to draw the narrative line that starts at Fanon and ends somewhere in my apartment or whatever. But it's not the thing that's important about climate change activism or anti-carceral activism or anything else that we might be doing.

KH: That really resonates. And I think these conversations around being more focused on the politics we do than the politics we wear are really important. And I think this also ties back to what we were saying about protest and direct action earlier. A lot of protests that people get really hyped about are what we would call “expressive protests.” They can be energizing. They can allow us to express ourselves and our position, and maybe feel unified in that expression. And we do need that energy. But what we also need, and what we need a lot more of, are instrumental actions — protests that apply meaningful pressure to targets and attempt to reshape our social and political environment. That involves more than raising awareness. It's about impact. The best protests are expressive and instrumental, but I want us to constantly keep coming back, in everything we do, to how effective our actions are, and what impacts we're having. 

Now, with all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?

OOT: The one other thing that I think goes nicely with what we were saying about the leftist media landscape and, just in general, trying to build a more hospitable system for ourselves to do politics out of, to organize out of, is we should not overlook the role of literal physical spaces in that. So what that's going to look like is going to be different depending on where you're at. Maybe there's a friendly church that some of you meet at. Maybe there's a radical bookstore in your city. Maybe there's a coffee shop that is run by a workers' cooperative that is down and that collaborates with some of the activists there. But whatever the spaces, the physical spaces, maybe it's somebody's house, maybe it's somebody's apartment, but I think trying to support those places is a big force multiplier. The more you can do to keep those places thriving and to keep the workers and the comrades who support them supported and healthy and secure, the better it is for everyone in the vicinity of those spaces. And so I think one of the concrete things that we can do to support progressive leftist, whatever, movements is to support the spaces, the places, the buildings that support them.

KH: That is such a good point. And by the way, if you're someone who has a space that you can make available to movement folks, please consider doing so. I know that here in Chicago and in many cities where space is at a premium, we don't have enough of these spaces where folks can meet and gather and do the work of community building. So, yes, let's fortify and support those places where they exist, and let's open up more space to do the work we need to do together.

Olúfẹ́mi, this has been such a great conversation. I'm so grateful you could join me today. You're someone who I always learned so much from and I'm just so grateful to have had the chance to talk today.

OOT: Likewise. Thanks a lot for having me.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

The message coming from the Trump administration is: “Take care of yourselves — because we won't.”

The message coming from the Trump administration is: “Take care of yourselves — because we won't.”

As Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) acolytes readily admit, U.S. public health continues to deteriorate. Five years into the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. life expectancy is at best stalled while those of other industrial countries have rebounded back onto their historical trends upward.

The solution Trump administration officials are offering is to replace 125 years of — albeit underfunded — public health infrastructure with a eugenics-framed program wrapped in natural health packaging.

During his swearing-in as the new director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz presented this program in the terms of wartime sacrifice:

Like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Oz signaled his plans to focus on chronic disease in the U.S., saying it was “the patriotic duty of all Americans to take care of themselves.”

“Because it's important for serving in the military, but it's also important because healthy people don't consume health care resources,” he added. “The best way to reduce drug spending is to use less drugs, because you don't need them, because you're healthy, and it feels a lot better.”

The message: Take care of yourselves — because we won't.

Never mind the trillions of dollars Americans pay into a largely privatized — and very profitable — health care system, far outspending other industrial countries only to suffer worse health outcomes. 

The new Trump administration is now compounding this long-standing damage by dismantling the last of the public commons.

It's cutting billions to state programs tracking disease, repealing emissions and drinking water regulations, revoking hundreds of millions in funding for life-saving research, canceling local food programs for schools and food banks, rolling back vaccinations, and shutting down the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee.

The administration is also truncating the bird flu response and Meals on Wheels; firing CDC's sexually transmitted infections lab team; cutting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); dismembering the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; and reducing the Medicare programs Oz will supervise, as Congress weighs deep cuts to Medicaid, pricing the poorest out of health care to the public health cost of us all. 

In these programs' stead, MAHA aims to place responsibility for health problems on the individual. Americans must somehow eat better and sleep more while also working more hours than their European counterparts, for stagnating pay. Americans must now “do their own research” on complex medical matters beyond the due diligence that can reasonably be expected of any adult — as if each of us can serve as our own CDC.

Nothing inspires patriotism like blaming Americans for the societal damage the political class pursues in their name.

Democratic Party politicos, largely state officials outside Washington, D.C., have objected to these rollbacks both in the press and in the courts. Many a Democratic accusation, however, also carries the ring of a confession.

Where, after all, did the Trump administration get the idea the pandemic was over and that it could strip out federal COVID-19 programs? Or that public health was a matter of “you do you” individualism? Wasn't it only three years ago that President Biden's CDC Director Rochelle Walensky took a eugenics position on the pandemic, claiming it was good news that it was largely people with underlying health conditions who were dying from COVID?

Who botched the latest bird flu response to begin with? What administration did nearly nothing around the toxic derailment in East Palestine, Ohio? Who green-lighted over a year of Palestinian genocide, with, we recently learned, even Israeli officials surprised President Joe Biden never pressed for a ceasefire and with Secretary of State Antony Blinken approving bombing Gaza aid convoys?

There's a shared path across administrations leading to this public health moment — with whole populations at home and abroad increasingly abandoned. Any opposition movement must understand that these patterns began long before Donald Trump if it aims to fight back effectively.

The problem here is a structural crisis of capitalism and requires more than an electoral solution. The public commons no longer holds space within existing relations of private property and production. The bases of our shared society are being treated as disposable baggage, threatening the country's very existence.

Under whichever political party, public health, by definition, can never be conducted as an individualist enterprise.

Yes, each of us has choices to make and responsibilities to attend to during a pandemic or other emergency, but — as the CDC missed even before Trump — effective public health isn't merely an emergent property of many millions of individual choices. Public health requires collective decision-making. It requires action at scale — from the neighborhood level to global cooperation. 

Our health is connected to people halfway across town or halfway across the world. Making sure we can mutually protect ourselves requires us to arrive at decisions together. Our society relies on this collective decision-making to protect our shared social health.

Modern employers — from the classical liberal era to neoliberalism and the now-accelerating turn toward a fascistic reorganization of government — have consistently opposed such an objective.

While some employers want the state to help keep the workforce healthy enough to be efficiently exploited on the job, other employers — and sometimes the very same ones — are perfectly willing to serve workers into the maw of occupational dangers in order to reduce expenses.

Elsewhere, employers and their proxies demand that funding for social services be redirected to industrial subsidies or tax cuts for the rich. Sick or dead employees can just be replaced from the reserve army of labor — the unemployed surviving on society's margins — or, increasingly, by AI.

Countries differ in how they approach public health programming. National programs differed in their response to COVID and bird flu. But any such program must operate at scales of organization that match the scales of the problems jurisdictions face.

So no corporation, individual, or market can defeat a pandemic. Public goods like public health and clean water require other orders of intervention. We cannot shop our way out of problems in population health, which represent far more than the mere “externalities” corporations park off their balance sheets or the influencer marketing MAHA is attempting to turn into policy.

The connections between the structure of a society and its public health practices speak directly to bedrock notions of social justice and fairness.

Our collective health arises from the daily ergonomics of the workplace and the kinds of collective decisions we make around how to organize and run our neighborhoods and rural communities.

The notion that workers and residents could govern themselves from the bottom-up seems to many commentators beyond our increasingly top-down society. History, however, is replete with examples. For instance, Maroon communities were self-governing safe havens for self-liberated formerly enslaved people, often joining with Indigenous people throughout the southern hemisphere.

Historian Mike Davis describes the origins of Chambers of Commerce as a desperate employer effort to counter Chambers of Labor, another example, which fought for worker well-being from the factory floor to the neighborhood block.

With only Chambers of Commerce left today, the top-down version is now presented and operationalized as the natural order of things. In our hyper-individualist culture, the boss/employer/owners — and Kennedy, Oz, Walensky, and other officials in recent governance — aim to shift all responsibility for health outcomes, and all the blame, onto atomized individuals.

We see similar efforts in other sectors. The framing the oil industry attempted in making everything environmental a consumer choice also underlies the COVID-19 response. We cannot consume our way out of a pandemic, however, even with the best respirators or hand sanitizers on the market.

The labor movement structurally disrupts the notion that each of us alone is enough during a widespread health crisis. Most union members working on workplace safety instantly recognize and dismiss this “blame the worker” (and the worker alone) approach.

We could all benefit from learning to assimilate that recognition as a social gut instinct. The health of the country would likely improve if the public moved away from viewing its interests and well-being in the funhouse mirror of the employers and the political candidates that the wealthiest fund.

Such a pivot would also suit U.S. public health practitioners. Many public health models accept — and operationalize — the political premises of the institutions funding them, with significant impacts on our health interventions.

A variety of public health models, for instance, show only things that a worker or consumer can do during a crisis.

A common representation of this approach comes out of Ian Mackay's adaptation of James Reason's “Swiss Cheese” model for respiratory defense. Each “slice” of an intervention has its uses and problems. Layering the different kinds of interventions covers each slice's functional holes. What masking misses, handwashing, eye protection and social distancing can likely catch.

We see in such models always the “me,” never the “we.” Every intervention is the individual's personal responsibility.

Hospital epidemiologist Saskia Popescu presents a broader version, showing what individuals can do — wear masks, get vaccinated — and what “we” can do collectively:

Yet “shared responsibilities” universalizes updating the HVAC system at your work, the downtown library or the neighborhood bar to no one in particular.

If everyone is responsible, then no one is responsible, and nothing is changed. “We,” “our,” and “shared” must always be explicitly identified. It's the boss's responsibility to provide clean air and personal protective equipment (PPE) at work, though perhaps the model is technically right in that without unions demanding clean air through bargaining or legislation, the intervention might not ever take place. 

The abrupt end to federal pandemic protections guaranteed companies would stop providing paid COVID sick leave and other precautions (now including vaccination) on their own. Employers, as most people who call in sick know, hate paying people not to work. 

Some employers chose a different path, if only in passing fashion. The University of Southern California (USC) adapted the Swiss cheese model to illustrate its own responsibility alongside the responsibility of individuals within that institution: 

USC didn't distribute free masks, but did provide testing, tracing and HVAC upgrades to good epidemiological effect.

Which health model institutions use shapes what they see as the nature of the emergency and what they choose to do about it. The model of personal responsibility isn't entirely wrong — but it is woefully incomplete.

The most frightening model — the social Darwinism that encourages sacrificing elders or youth to the needs of the market — often went unspoken during the early pandemic (except for a shameless lieutenant governor of Texas here and there). As Oz's press conference demonstrated, the soft eugenics of early COVID is now being increasingly deployed in more explicit language.

The Swiss cheese model provides an excellent, accessible tool for grasping multilayered problems and their solutions. We now need to keep track when modelers and policy makers leave out whole blocks of slices that make the critical epidemiological difference. We cannot let the growing holes in the model be normalized.

There are other models. One of the better ones for a workplace, or even for a country or economy, comes from the American Industrial Hygiene Association's (AIHA) review of “hierarchy of controls” (HoC). Many union safety activists use this starter one from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH):

Note the engineering controls are elevated in effectiveness above PPE, in, for instance, preventing COVID infection and keeping the virus out of the workplace. It's the presence of engineering and administrative controls such as testing, sick days, bringing in outside air, and filtering the air with upgraded filters that drive the greater part of infection outcomes in the workplace:

Horizon Risk Consultancy, the consultant that adapted the NIOSH HoC for COVID here, does not, however, recommend air filters, HVAC upgrades or paid sick leave. 

Here's a more comprehensive version of the COVID HoC model from Doctors in Unite, the British medical union, including changes in ergonomics, working outside or from home and wage protections:

The full array of possible COVID-specific interventions inside the body and out are gathered in one graphic, including vaccination, face masks, distancing, ventilation, remote work, and, if necessary, furlough.

We see the most effective occupational intervention is to keep the hazard outside the workplace.

Prevention through design — like building codes that design out fire risk — offers many professions, including building engineers, building inspectors and sanitation workers, opportunities to serve as public health heroes and save lives. In a prevention framework that extends beyond the individual, these are our true first responders.

The important work that firefighters, nurses, doctors and EMTs conduct should be embraced, of course, but also understood as the second and third lines of public defense. If a patient's first encounter with a professional about their heart problem is a paramedic, society failed that patient.

Public health ecologists Deborah Wallace and Rodrick Wallace argue the modeling of emergencies, however necessary, often misses when and where the emergency begins. Structural causes — including expropriation, patriarchy and white supremacy — are as much part of the emergency, a bigger picture public health movements should assimilate in the face of the present administration's efforts to censor such understanding.

This framework of prevention also puts engineers, architects, sheet metal workers and other trades in a position to design and construct buildings that inhibit the spread of airborne diseases. Preventing hospital visits saves both lives and money, but in ways that — contrary to the policies of Kennedy and Oz — place responsibility on those with the power to intervene at scale.

The entire design and construction professions, beyond essential public health measures like redesigning meat processing plants and following the new LEED certification that includes indoor air quality standards, should collaborate with unions in redesigning every workplace and all public spaces to better public health.

In other words, even the very best of the Swiss cheese models miss arguably the most critical interventions of all: the very package in which the slices come. While the diagrams show individuals, the government and even corporations, they do not show any organization of workers themselves — from unions to broader communities and how we choose to organize our society.

It is the responsibility of workers' organizations, whether in the workplace or in the greater community, to push for the implementation of these safety protections — often of stunning epidemiological impact — in a society that presently denies them as a matter of principle.

Other parts of the bigger picture are still missing. Individual buildings and workplaces successfully eliminating COVID and future outbreaks will slow, but not end, pandemics.

Ultimately, preventing most zoonotic pathogens from emerging in the first place will better position us to bring the “age of pandemics” to an end. We can protect nature from the doomsday extractivism driving disease emergence by deploying regenerative agriculture, agroecology, conservation, regional planning, land back movements, and cooperative agro-economies. We can return the locus of control around what to grow to farmers and farming communities while also integrating Indigenous knowledge.

That is, we should better integrate collective choice and mutual economics up and down scales of social organization, across sectors and over our shared landscapes.

Building on the back half of the Biden era, the Trump administration appears intent on exactly the opposite trajectory. It seems to be aiming to convince people that public health itself is the danger and removing it is a societal advance.

The resulting stops on the administration's MAHA campaign trail have been shameless in their misdirection.

In April, RFK Jr. shared with tribes in Arizona and New Mexico the administration's intention to prevent chronic disease in Native American populations. The administration, however, had just effectively ended the CDC Healthy Tribes program by mass firing program staff. The program deployed traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of chronic conditions, including diabetes and liver disease.

RFK Jr.'s announcement that HHS would prompt the food industry to remove synthetic dyes still left in the food system was juxtaposed with reports only a week earlier that the FDA would be ending federal-level food safety inspections and quality control programs for food testing laboratories.

The FDA had also just closed out an unpublicized investigation of a 15-state E. coli outbreak. The agency's internal report on the outbreak didn't even name the food suppliers and distributors involved, part of a broader abandonment in informing the public about outbreaks since the inauguration.

Oz's swearing-in ended in a similar if more allegorical fashion:

Television personality Mehmet Oz was sworn in as the new administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid on Friday, but the Oval Office ceremony ended when a girl family member fainted.

A reporter was about to ask a question when the incident occurred, and Trump looked over at what was happening. White House staffers could then be heard shouting “press out” and “get out right now.”

With an empty gesture at a diagnosis:

Trump then went over to see what happened, and could be heard saying, “She's OK.”

By that flippant assurance, found more widely in the MAHA program, a country is all well when it ends well. And by many a measure of what counts as a functioning society, the new administration signals its intent on wrapping up the project called the United States. A country without public health operating at scale can scarcely survive as such a thing — unless Americans organize together to get public health locked in as a central public tenet.

Trump is underfunding FEMA, leaving states that rely on it dangerously unprepared for severe storms.

Trump is underfunding FEMA, leaving states that rely on it dangerously unprepared for severe storms.

With the official start of hurricane season less than a week away, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is facing a storm of its own.

Donald Trump's administration has begun gutting the agency, slashing budgets and cutting staff. The president has made clear from the start of his term that he wants to shift the financial burden for disaster relief from the federal government to states — the same vision outlined in the far right Project 2025 playbook — if not eliminate FEMA entirely, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged. While emergency management experts agree that states should play a role in funding their disaster relief efforts, recent government leaks have raised concerns that the Trump administration is leaving FEMA dangerously underfunded — and leaving the states that rely on it unprepared in the face of upcoming severe storms.

In a May budget draft, Trump proposed slashing FEMA grants by $646 million, even as the agency is projected to run out of disaster relief money by this summer for the third consecutive year. The administration also canceled a grant program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, which funds community-level emergency preparedness efforts. The popular program had enjoyed bipartisan support.

In internal meetings, newly appointed FEMA head David Richardson admitted himself that the agency isn't ready for hurricane season. Like many of the efforts undertaken by the Trump administration this term, FEMA's transition to a “smaller footprint” has been hasty and disorganized. An internal review found that understaffing and other issues had derailed FEMA's usual processes for hurricane season preparedness. The agency is also scrambling as it adjusts to new leadership after the Trump administration fired acting FEMA head Cameron Hamilton earlier this month. The sudden firing was in response to Hamilton's public testimony at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, during which he said he does not “believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later told reporters that Hamilton had been dismissed because he said “something that was contrary to what the president believes.”

Scientists say that warming ocean temperatures are causing more intense and destructive hurricanes. And many months later, states are still reeling from last year's devastating season: In North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene killed at least 100 people last September and caused nearly $60 billion in damage, residents and town leaders are still waiting for disbursements of federal funds. Data released this month by North Carolina's Office of State Budget Management found that $5.95 billion has been allocated by federal and state governments for Helene recovery — only about 10 percent of the total amount needed to rebuild homes and public infrastructure. But just because money has been earmarked doesn't mean it's been disbursed. “The money is there,” Zeb Smathers, the mayor of Canton, North Carolina, told The Charlotte Observer. “It's the will to act. I'm very tired of excuses.”

In April, FEMA denied North Carolina's request for the federal government to continue matching 100 percent of the state's spending on Helene debris removal for another six months. “The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA's bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.”

It's clear that FEMA needs reforms. Bureaucratic red tape and procedural lags have left vulnerable people in limbo. Ironically, as the Trump administration has preached streamlining the agency, a memo obtained by southwest Virginia outlet Cardinal News outlined new, additional “manual review processes” implemented by FEMA that were slowing Helene recovery efforts in the region. John Scrivani, the acting state coordinator of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) wrote to local emergency managers on April 11, that FEMA had provided “revised guidance” on how documentation should be submitted for grant programs. After submitting the requested documentation, Scrivani wrote, VDEM still had not received feedback from FEMA, leaving the state agency without guidance as it awaited payment for a range of disaster reimbursements and emergency preparedness funds — seven months after the storm.

“Unfortunately, at this time, we do not have an update as to when and if these funds will be made available,” wrote Scrivani. “We are asking for your patience and understanding as we navigate this together.”

In a statement to Cardinal News, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) voiced his opposition to the new procedures, noting that allocated federal funds had already undergone a thorough review process. “FEMA and DHS's announcement to conduct additional reviews of grants, including for emergency management and disaster assistance, is ridiculous. These communities need funding as soon as possible, and the Trump Administration is unnecessarily making it harder for these communities to rebuild,” said Kaine.

Similarly, in North Carolina, state lawmakers are wrangling over what to do as they await clarity on federal relief funds. “The continual line from the Republicans in the North Carolina legislature is ‘Well, we got to wait and see what the feds are going to do,'” North Carolina Rep. Eric Ager told The Assembly. “We've been doing that for six months now, right? And it's still not completely clear what the feds are gonna pay for and what they're not.”

Follow:


            The United States will “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Wednesday in a major escalation of tensions with Beijing, and another blow to American higher education institutions.
    


            The plan was met with strong opposition from China, which said on Thursday it had lodged a formal protest with the US over what it called a “politically motivated and discriminatory” move.
    


            The revocations will target Chinese students including “those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Rubio said.
    


            “We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong,” he said, noting that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security would work together on the visa revocations.
    


            The surprise announcement risks disrupting ongoing efforts by the US and China to de-escalate tensions, coming just weeks after both sides declared a 90-day truce over punishing tariffs on each other's goods, and deepens the spiraling confrontation between President Donald Trump and the nation's top universities.
    


            Rubio's comments follow a series of extraordinary steps by the Trump administration to deter foreign students from studying in the US – from ordering embassies to pause new student visa appointments to revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. (A federal judge later halted the Harvard ban.)
    


            The latest move is set to spark consternation and outrage in China, the country of origin for almost a quarter of international students in US higher education. It's also likely to deepen anxiety across American universities, where Chinese and other international students are a significant source of revenue.
    


            There are signs that Beijing has been caught off guard by the announcement. For much of Thursday, China's state-controlled media remained largely silent on the news that will significantly impact the fate of hundreds of thousands of Chinese students.
    


            That changed when official comment eventually came from Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, who accused the US of using ideology and national security as a “pretext” for the move.
    


            “This politically motivated and discriminatory move exposes the lie of America's long-touted claim of being ‘free and open,' and will only further damage the United States' international image and national credibility,” Mao said in a regular news conference.
    


            She added that it would harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and disrupts people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.
    


            Fear and anger is already spreading among Chinese students studying in the US.
    


            Candy, a statistics student at the University of Michigan, who did not want to give her full name, said she feared her visa would be canceled before she graduates.
    


            “Ending up with only a high school diploma is something I dread,” she said from China, where she's visiting family. “I pray to make it through my undergraduate study safely and smoothly.”
    


            “When I first heard the news, I wanted to curse Trump.”
    


            For decades, American universities have attracted some of China's brightest minds. Seen as a path to a prestigious education and better career opportunities, US colleges have drawn Chinese students from middle-class families as well as the political and business elites. Many Chinese officials have sent their children to American schools, including leader Xi Jinping, whose daughter Xi Mingze studied at Harvard under a pseudonym.
    


            Some top Chinese officials have been educated in the US themselves. Liu He, Xi's former economic tsar, obtained a MPA from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in the 1990s; Wang Huning, the Chinese Communist Party's ideology guru, was a visiting scholar at the University of Iowa in the 1980s.
    


            “Many of China's officials, entrepreneurs, and scientists — especially those who played key roles during the era of reform and opening-up — received their training in the US,” said Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a non-government think tank in Beijing.
    


            “When they returned to China, they brought back not only professional knowledge and credentials, but also a deep respect and admiration for America as an open and inclusive society,” he said.

China says Trump Harvard ban will ‘tarnish' US image as students caught in crosshairs



            Student exchanges have been a key constant in the ebb and flow of US-China relations — ties that are now increasingly defined by growing geopolitical rivalry that has fueled an ongoing trade and tech war.
    


            China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years until it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a State Department-backed database tracking international student enrollment.
    


            After decades of growth, the number of Chinese students in the US reached a peak of over 372,000 in the 2019-2020 school year, before declining to more than 270,000 in the 2023-2024 year – a drop that coincides with the Covid-19 pandemic but also increasing friction between the two governments.
    


            The number of American students in China is much smaller, plunging from more than 10,000 to the low hundreds during the pandemic. In the 2023-2024 academic year, an estimated 800 American students were enrolled in China, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
    


            Even as relations plummeted, Chinese officials have repeatedly underscored the important role of people-to-people exchanges in stabilizing fractured ties.
    


            During a visit to San Francisco in November 2023, Xi said China was ready to invite 50,000 American students to China over the next five years. In June last year, the Chinese leader again called for more exchanges between Chinese and American universities to boost mutual understanding.
    


            Now, the Trump administration's move to revoke Chinese student visas risks further undermining an already fragile bilateral relationship, said Wang, the researcher who recently graduated from a master's program at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.
    


            “Despite numerous challenges in bilateral relations, student exchanges remain one of the few genuine and impactful areas of engagement between the two countries,” he said. “The fact that an announcement like this comes at a time when mutual trust between China and the US is at a historic low is, in my view, quite saddening.”
    


            On Tuesday the US State Department instructed American embassies and consulates worldwide to pause new student visa appointments as it moves to expand “social media screening and vetting” to all applicants of student visas.
    


            The following day a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said the country is following the development, and urged the US to “protect the lawful and legitimate rights and interests of all international students, including those from China.”
    


            Rubio's statement on Wednesday did not specify what are the “critical fields,” but there has been long-standing concern in Washington about Chinese academics accessing sensitive and military-applicable American technology.
    


            To crack down on the perceived threat of Chinese students conducting espionage on US soil, Trump introduced a ban during his first term that effectively prevented graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military from gaining visas to the US.
    


            His first administration also launched the now defunct China Initiative, a national security program intended to thwart China's intelligence activities in the US, including those aimed at stealing emerging technology from research universities.
    


            The program, which drew comparisons to the anti-Communism “red scare” of the 1950s, was cancelled by the Biden administration after facing widespread blowback for what was seen as overreach and complaints that it fueled suspicion and bias against innocent Chinese Americans.
    


            It's also unclear how US officials will define students “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party” which is ubiquitous across China and boasts 99 million members. As a result, many Chinese students could have parents or relatives who are party members or work in the vast state-owned sector.
    


            “If you count in all the friends and relatives, it wouldn't be farfetched to say that almost everyone is somehow linked to the Communist Party in China,” Wang said.

            Behind the monumental court ruling that blocked most of US President Donald Trump's tariffs is a small wine company run by a father-and-daughter duo.
    


VOS Selections – a small, New York-based wine company – was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit which prompted a three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade to strike down Trump's sweeping global tariffs on Wednesday.

Tariffs, and Trump's entire economic agenda, were just thrown into chaos



            The decision found Trump overstepped his authority by invoking emergency economic powers to impose sweeping tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico and other US trading partners.
    


            VOS founder Victor Schwartz never intended to be at the forefront of the resistance to US government policy.
    


            “Put it this way: when I started VOS 40 years ago I had no idea that I was signing up for something like this, getting involved in a lawsuit against the executive branch of the United States,” Schwartz, who runs the business alongside his daughter Chloe, told CNN.
    


            “I just wanted to bring in these delicious wines from interesting appellations across the world and sell those wines to a like-minded community.”
    


            Schwartz was in the middle of cooking a pasta dinner Wednesday when he received an email from his lawyers telling him they had won. His first reaction? Disbelief. Then, his phone started ringing off the hook with media requests and messages of congratulations.
    


            The Trump administration immediately launched an appeal against the ruling, which could make it all the way to the Supreme Court. If it survives the challenge, the ruling would put an end to almost all of Trump's tariffs, and cut into his  leverage when negotiating trade deals with other countries. Tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum will continue because they were enacted under a different law.
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.”
    


            The Trump administration's tariffs have been particularly painful for small businesses, which have had to weather surging prices and constantly shifting trade policies without the level of cash flow that larger companies can dip into.
    


            Schwartz said his business, which imports wine, sake and spirits from small-batch producers in countries including France, Lebanon and Japan, was hurt by Trump's tariffs during the president's first term.
    


            “We're not a big company. We can't just ride out the storm,” Schwartz said.
    


            This time around, when Trump announced unprecedented global tariffs on almost all US trading partners, Schwartz knew he had to fight back.
    


            “Something like this is a complete monkey wrench in your business,” he said, describing the tariffs as an “existential threat.”

            Schwartz was put in touch with lawyers at the libertarian advocacy group Liberty Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of VOS and four other small businesses, including a women's cycling apparel company and an online fishing tackle shop.
    


            After some reflection and discussion with his family, Schwartz agreed to be the lead plaintiff in the case, the outcome of which will have implications for consumers and businesses around the world.
    


            Jeffrey Schwab, lead attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins “this is a very important case,” not just because of its economic impact, but “because of the tremendous power grab that the administration is claiming here.”
    


            Schwartz said he is confident in his lawsuit and plans to see it all the way through to the Supreme Court, if necessary. He said the latest ruling is a win for small businesses everywhere.
    


            “We knocked back the tariffs. It's going to change the whole game plan,” he said, clearly elated.
    


            As one would expect, Schwartz plans to celebrate with a nice bottle of wine.

            A federal court on Wednesday ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have raised the cost of imports for everyone from giant businesses to everyday Americans.
    


            But the administration immediately appealed the decision on Wednesday night, leaving the situation uncertain for consumers and companies and potentially prolonging the battle over whether Trump's import duties will stand – and possibly reshape the global economy.
    


            A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade, a relatively low-profile court in Manhattan, stopped Trump's global tariffs that he imposed citing emergency economic powers, including the “Liberation Day” tariffs he announced on April 2. It also prevents Trump from enforcing his tariffs placed earlier this year against China, Mexico and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States.
    


            The court ruled in favor of a permanent injunction, potentially grinding Trump's global tariffs to a halt before “deals” with most other trading partners have even been reached. The court ordered a window of 10 calendar days for administrative orders “to effectuate the permanent injunction.” That means the bulk – but not all – of Trump's tariffs would be put in a standstill if the ruling holds up in appeal and, potentially, with the Supreme Court.
    


            The order halts Trump's 30% tariffs on China, his 25% tariffs on some goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and the 10% universal tariffs on most goods coming into the United States. It does not, however, affect the 25% tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel or aluminum, which were subject to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act – a different law than the one Trump cited for his broader trade actions.
    


            Stock futures surged on the ruling. Dow futures rose nearly 500 points, or 1.1%. The broader S&P 500 futures were up 1.4%, and Nasdaq futures were 1.6% higher in afterhours trading.
    


            The lawsuit was filed by the libertarian legal advocacy group Liberty Justice Center in April and represented wine-seller VOS Selections and four other small businesses that claimed they had been severely harmed by the tariffs. The panel came to a unanimous decision, publishing an opinion on the VOS suit and also one by twelve Democratic states brought against the Trump tariffs.
    


            “We won – the state of Oregon and state plaintiffs also won,” Ilya Somin, a law professor at Scalia Law School, George Mason University and plaintiff lawyer, said to CNN immediately after the ruling. “The opinion rules that entire system of liberation day and other IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) tariffs is illegal and barred by permanent injunction.”
    


            On April 2, Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs, imposing significant levies on imports from some of America's closest trading allies – though he soon after implemented a 90-day pause on April 9. He left in place “universal” 10% tariffs on most goods coming into the United States.
    


            Trump implemented these tariffs without Congress by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to act in response to unusual and extraordinary threats. But the law does not include any mention of tariffs as a potential action the president can take once IEEPA is invoked.
    


            Trump also cited IEEPA in his 20% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on many goods from Mexico and Canada designed to target fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
    


            But the Trump administration has not met that criteria for an emergency, the plaintiffs alleged. The lawsuit also alleges IEEPA doesn't give the president the power to enact tariffs in the first place, and even if it was interpreted to, it “would be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's power to impose tariffs,” according to a statement.
    


            The court concurred in its ruling that Trump lacked the authority to impose those tariffs even after declaring a national emergency.
    


            “IEEPA does not authorize any of the worldwide, retaliatory, or trafficking tariff orders,” the panel of judges said in their order Wednesday. “The worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs. The trafficking tariffs fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders.”
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller was blunter, posting on X that “The judicial coup is out of control” in response to the news.
    


            Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called it a “surprising and spectacular decision.”
    


            “The reason it's a surprise is that if you look at past cases where plaintiffs have tried to challenge the presidential use of extraordinary authority under various laws, the plaintiffs have always lost against the government,” Hufbauer said in an interview with CNN.
    


            “All the president had to do was say, ‘national security,' or ‘national emergency.' Those are magic words.”
    


            The decision could help small businesses across America, many of which had been struggling with the jump in costs from tariffs.
    


            “This is potentially – with that word choice underscored – a significant policy pivot point should it hold up for both the economy and the quiet majority inside Congress that does not support current trade policy,” Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist, wrote in an email to CNN Business. “In particular, this would provide a huge relief for small and medium sized firms that neither have the margins nor the financial depth to absorb the tariffs on a sustained basis.”
    


            The plaintiffs are hopeful they can gain some certainty for their businesses, Jeffrey Schwab, lead attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Wednesday.
    


            “They're hopeful that these will be upheld by the appellate court so that they can continue their businesses with the certainty of what's going to happen rather than the uncertainty of not knowing what the tariff rate is at any given time and whether it will change,” Schwab said.
    


            “Obviously this is a very important case, not only because of the tremendous economic impact that it has on everybody, but particularly business and our businesses, but also because of the tremendous power grab that the administration is claiming here,” Schwab continued. “He can't just assert unlimited authority to tariff whenever he wants.”
    


            The Department of Justice lawyers argued that the tariffs are a political question – meaning it's something that the courts can't decide.
    


            But the plaintiffs noted IEEPA makes no mention of tariffs.
    


            “If starting the biggest trade war since the Great Depression based on a law that doesn't even mention tariffs is not an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power, I don't know what is,” Somin said in April.
    


            Separately, and using similar arguments, twelve Democratic states sued the administration in the same court for “illegally imposing” tax hikes on Americans through the tariffs.
    


            “We brought this case because the Constitution doesn't give any president unchecked authority to upend the economy. This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement Wednesday.
    


            The judges on the Manhattan panel were each appointed by a different president. Judge Jane Restani was appointed to the US Court of International Trade by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Gary Katzmann was appointed to the court by President Barack Obama. Judge Timothy Reif was appointed by President Trump.
    


            The immediate higher court is the federal circuit, though it could potentially go right to the Supreme Court.
    


            The United States Court of International Trade is a federal court in Manhattan that handles disputes over customs and international trade laws.

            The Trump administration has effectively cut off some American companies from selling software used to design semiconductors to China, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
    


            Impacted companies include Cadence, Synopsys and Siemens EDA, according to the FT's reporting, which cited people familiar with the matter. CNN was not immediately able to confirm that. Cadence and Synopsys didn't return requests for comment. The New York Times subsequently reported on Wednesday that sales to China of jet engine technology and certain chemicals were also halted.
    


            The Commerce Department told CNN on Wednesday it is “reviewing exports of strategic significance to China.”
    


            “In some cases, Commerce has suspended existing export licenses or imposed additional license requirements while the review is pending,” a spokesperson told CNN. However, they didn't respond to CNN's inquiry regarding which companies that included.
    


            A Siemens spokesperson told CNN that the US government on Friday informed the industry about new export controls on chip designing software to China and Chinese military end users globally.
    


            Siemens “will continue to work with our customers globally to mitigate the impact of these new restrictions while operating in compliance with applicable national export control regimes,” the spokesperson said.
    


            The move could be the latest blow in an ongoing trade war between the world's two biggest economies. While that trade war is ostensibly on pause while the US and China continue to negotiate a trade deal, the Commerce Department's actions underscore the acrimony between the two nations and the challenges in keeping the peace.
    


            The pause came after Chinese government officials and Trump administration officials met in Geneva earlier this month. The US lowered tariffs on products from China to a minimum of 30% from 145%. Meanwhile, China lowered tariffs on American goods to a minimum of 10% from 125%.
    


            The truce is set to expire in August and is intended to give both countries more time to negotiate a potentially longer-term trade deal. However, either country could raise tariff rates again and throw the relationship back into turmoil.
    


            Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, declined to comment on the Commerce Department's latest actions. However, he said in a statement provided to CNN that “China firmly opposes the US's overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export controls, and maliciously blocking and suppressing China.”
    


            “China will keep a close eye on relevant developments, and take resolute measures to firmly defend the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies,” he added.

• Court stalls tariffs: ﻿A federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's global tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority to impose them. The administration immediately appealed the ruling, leaving the situation uncertain for consumers, companies and Trump's economic agenda.
    


            • Crackdown on China: The US will “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced, in a major escalation of tensions with Beijing and another blow to American education institutions. Separately, the administration effectively cut off some US companies from selling certain goods to China, including software used to design semiconductors.

Our live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has ended. Get the latest here.



            China has reiterated its position that there are “no winners” in a trade war after a US court blocked the bulk of US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
    


            Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, said at a news conference on Thursday that “there are no winners in a tariff or trade war,” adding that “protectionism harms everyone's interests and ultimately goes against the will of the people.”
    


            Perhaps Trump's greatest grudge in his trade war has been with China. In recent weeks, he has hiked overall levies on Chinese goods into the United States to 145%, before recently slashing that figure down to 30% for 90 days following talks with Beijing.
    


            In the United Kingdom, a government spokesperson cautioned in a Thursday statement that the ruling marked “only the first stage of legal proceedings” and that it was a matter “for the United States to determine domestically.” (The Trump administration immediately appealed the court ruling on Wednesday night.)
    


            Earlier this month, the UK scored the first framework for a trade deal with the US, which included some key carve-outs such as an agreement to lower tariffs on some imports of British cars.
    


            European stock markets rose Thursday morning following a decision by a US court that blocked the bulk of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
    


            The region's benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.2% by 4.37 a.m. ET. Germany's DAX index was trading up 0.2% by late-morning local time, while France's CAC index was up 0.5%.
    


            Brent crude, the world's oil benchmark, was also up 1.2% Thursday morning to trade at nearly $66 a barrel.
    


Some context: On Trump's “Liberation Day” in early April, the president said he would impose a punishing 20% levy on all goods imports from the European Union. Trump dramatically upped the ante last week, vowing to slap a 50% tariff on the bloc, only to announce days later a delay to that duty until July 9 — the date the rest of his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” were due to come into effect.
    


            The EU has spent the past few weeks trying to negotiate a trade deal with Washington to avoid the tariffs and threatened to impose its own on US goods if a deal cannot be struck.
    


            Countries around the Asia-Pacific region are cautiously waiting to see how the legal battle over President Donald Trump's tariffs plays out, with the administration now appealing a court ruling that had blocked most global tariffs.
    


            Australia's trade minister Don Farrell said the government would study the ruling “closely,” noting that “they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts.”
    


                    “The Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,” Farrell said in a statement. “We will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.”
                





            As with almost all other US allies, Australia was not spared from Trump's tariffs, something Prime Minister Anthony Albanese previously criticized as “against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship.”
    


            Other countries in the region struck a more neutral tone. New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement it was aware of the ruling, but added: “We need to wait for more details before commenting further.”
    


            Similarly, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a news conference that Tokyo would “carefully examine the details of the ruling and its implications and respond appropriately.”
    


            The court ruling to block most of President Donald Trump's tariffs is likely to slow negotiations between the US and its major trading partners, analysts told CNN.
    


            It is too early to predict whether tariffs will ultimately be rolled back, given that the Trump administration has appealed the decision.
    


            But analysts said the trend of countries diversifying away from the US will continue.
    


                    “The court ruling may offer a reprieve for US trade partners, but there's still a huge amount of global anxiety stemming from the unpredictability and instability generated by Trump's trade policies,” said Joe Mazur, senior analyst at Trivium China, a research and advisory firm.
                





            Investors' positive reaction to the ruling, which sent Asian shares and US equity futures higher, is also likely to be short-lived. Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, said the uncertainties ahead could render the rally unsustainable.
    


            Experts said the court ruling is also going to delay negotiations between the US and its trade partners, which began after Trump threatened aggressive “reciprocal” tariffs, before pausing them for 90 days in April.
    


                    “Most countries will probably drag the negotiation and see how the situation plays out,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. “However, it does not mean Trump is not able to find bargaining chips through other means, such as sector-specific tariffs.”
                





            China, too, is not in the clear. Other trade restrictions may still be on the horizon, Ng added.
    


            In the meantime, Chinese exporters will try to “front-load as many goods as possible” to take advantage of the tariff injunction, he said.
    


            And countries will continue reducing their dependence on the US and deepen ties with other partners, said William Yang, senior analyst for East Asia at the International Crisis Group, which analyzes policy.
    


            Seen as a path to a prestigious education and better career opportunities, US colleges have drawn Chinese students from middle-class families as well as the political and business elites for decades.
    


            Many Chinese officials have sent their children to American schools, including leader Xi Jinping, whose daughter Xi Mingze studied at Harvard under a pseudonym.
    


            Some top Chinese officials have been educated in the US themselves. Liu He, Xi's former economic tsar, obtained a MPA from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in the 1990s; Wang Huning, the Chinese Communist Party's ideology guru, was a visiting scholar at the University of Iowa in the 1980s.
    


            Student exchanges have been a key constant in the ebb and flow of US-China relations — ties that are now increasingly defined by growing geopolitical rivalry that has fueled a trade and tech war.
    


            China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years until it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a State Department-backed database tracking international enrollment.
    


            The number of American students in China is much smaller, plunging from more than 10,000 to the low hundreds during the pandemic.
    


            Even as relations plummeted, Chinese officials have repeatedly underscored the important role of people-to-people exchanges in stabilizing fractured ties.
    


            During a visit to San Francisco in November 2023, Xi said China was ready to invite 50,000 American students to China over the next five years. In June last year, the Chinese leader again called for more exchanges between Chinese and American universities to boost mutual understanding.
    


            The US State Department is reviewing all Harvard University-affiliated visa holders, not just students, three senior State Department officials told CNN on Wednesday.
    


            The move is a notable escalation of the Trump administration's feud with the Ivy League university. The administration previously moved to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, but the attempt has been halted by a federal judge. Harvard argued revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government's ideologically rooted policy demands. On Tuesday, the administration directed federal agencies to cancel all remaining federal contracts with the university — totaling about $100 million.
    


            The officials did not say why the review was being conducted.
    


            The recent moves come as the Trump administration takes steps that could deter international students from studying at universities in the US.
    


            The State Department announced several other moves this week targeting students who wish to come to the US. On Tuesday, the agency paused all new student and exchange visa appointments as it prepares to expand social media vetting for applicants. It is unclear what the expanded social media vetting will entail. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students.”

            A federal court's ruling against Donald Trump's authority to levy some of his most sweeping tariffs may have also dealt a serious blow to the president's entire economic agenda.
    


            Trump's core economic policy has been his tariffs, but the administration has described its aggressive trade actions as just one leg of a three-legged stool. Built on tariffs, spending cuts and tax cuts, Trump's economic agenda relies on all three components to stand.
    


            The three-legged economic stool just lost a leg, at least for now. Without trade, Trump's whole economic policy plan could come crashing down.
    


            Historic tariffs have persuaded dozens of US trading partners to come to the table to make deals with Trump. In theory, those trade deals could open up foreign markets to more US goods, benefitting US manufacturers and farmers.
    


            Revenue from Trump's tariffs, meanwhile, could, at least in part, help pay for Trump and congressional Republicans' massively expensive tax cuts, that could boost economic growth and add certainty to the markets by raising the debt ceiling. Trump's deregulation and spending cuts, particularly via the Department of Government Efficiency, could also reduce the government's costs and negate some of the impact of the tax cuts on the surging federal debt.
    


            Because of its fragile construction, Trump's plan to usher in a new economic Golden Age has plenty of naysayers, including most mainstream economists, who argue that the administration lacks the discipline, authority and political support to make it happen. The on-again, off-again trade policy, legal battles over DOGE and intraparty standoffs on the “Big, Beautiful Bill” serve as evidence.
    


Read the full analysis.



            Asia-Pacific markets were in the green following a US court decision that blocked President Donald Trump's global tariff assault.
    


            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 1.68% in the morning session, while South Korea's KOSPI rose 1.73%. China's Shanghai Composite Index grew 0.66%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.46% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.34%.
    


            Asian markets appeared to be breathing a sigh of relief at a brief reprieve in the trade war, although the Trump administration immediately appealed the court ruling.
    


Some context: Many Asian economies were among the hardest hit by Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs announced in early April, including levies of 24% on Japan, 25% for South Korea and 32% on Taiwan. Even though Trump soon after implemented a 90-day pause, a 10% broad-based levy remained, as well as sector-specific tariffs.
    


            But the court ruling on Wednesday has halted that 10% universal tariff on most goods coming into the US, as well as the remaining 30% tariffs on China, which had negotiated down from an initial three-digit levy rate under a trade truce reached earlier this month.
    


            Just hours after a US federal court blocked President Donald Trump from imposing most of his tariffs, Hong Kong's financial secretary appeared to praise the move.
    


            Asked how countries and companies will react to the court ruling, with uncertainty swirling as the Trump administration appeals, Paul Chan said the decision would “at least bring President Trump to reason,” Reuters reported.
    


            Although Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous Chinese city long known as an international trade hub, it has been caught in the crossfire of the US-China trade war.
    


            It previously had a special trading status with the US that allowed for lower tariffs and a separate customs process from mainland China — but Trump revoked this status in 2020 as Beijing cracked down on dissent in the city and imposed a sweeping national security law.
    


            In April, the Hong Kong government announced its postal service would stop handling packages coming from or going to the US, citing Trump's decision to eliminate the de minimis exception for items posted from the city to the US — which applies to international shipments worth $800 or less.
    


            The Trump administration has immediately appealed a decision blocking most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, leaving the situation uncertain for consumers and businesses and potentially prolonging the battle over whether the import duties will stand — and possibly reshape the global economy.
    


            The notice of appeal came after a federal court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have raised the cost of imports for everyone from giant businesses to everyday Americans.

            Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, said this evening that his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.”
    


            During his time helming DOGE, Musk oversaw major cuts to the federal workforce as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce federal spending.
    


                    “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk said in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” 
                





            Musk's post comes after he raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying in an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning” that he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by DOGE.
    


            Separately, a White House official said Musk will begin the offboarding process tonight, which essentially includes paperwork.
    


This post has been updated with comment from a White House official.



CNN's Kaitlan Collins contributed to this post.



            White House spokesperson Kush Desai, reacting to a court's blocking of President Donald Trump's global tariffs, said in a statement that “it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.”
    


Here's the full statement:



                    “Foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the Unites States has fueled America's historic and persistent trade deficits. These deficits have created a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base – facts that the court did not dispute. It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.”
                





Remember: A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade, a relatively low-profile court in Manhattan, stopped Trump's global tariffs that he imposed citing emergency economic powers, including the “Liberation Day” tariffs he announced on April 2. It also prevents Trump from enforcing his tariffs placed earlier this year against China, Mexico and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States.
    


            US Immigration officials are working on flying back a Guatemalan migrant who says he was wrongly deported to Mexico, according to new court filings, in what appears to mark the first time the Trump administration has made plans to bring back a migrant after a judge ordered the administration to facilitate their return.
    


            Pheonix-based immigration officials are “currently working with ICE Air to bring O.C.G. back to the United States on an Air Charter Operations (ACO) flight return leg,” the Justice Department said in the court filing today, referring to the pseudonym the migrant is using in the case.
    


            US District Judge Brian Murphy, who sits in Boston, ordered O.C.G.'s return last week. The case that Murphy is overseeing concerns the deportation of migrants to “third countries,” or nations that are not their home country.
    


            After entering the US and being deported a first time, the Guatemalan man reentered United States again in 2024, at which point he sought asylum, having suffered “multiple violent attacks” in Guatemala, according to court documents.
    


            On his way to the US during the second trip, O.C.G. said, he was raped and held for ransom in Mexico –– a detail he made known to an immigration judge during immigration proceedings. In 2025, a judge ruled he should not be sent back to his native country, the documents read.
    


            Two days after the judge ruled he should not be removed to Guatemala, the government deported him to Mexico, according to Murphy's order. O.C.G. had claimed in the case that he had not been given the opportunity before his deportation to communicate his fear of being sent to Mexico and that his pleas before his removal to speak to an attorney were rejected.
    


            CNN's Karina Tsui contributed to this report.



            The Trump administration will “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced today in another blow to international students and higher education institutions across the United States.
    


            The top US diplomat said the State Department would work with the Department of Homeland Security on the revocations, which will target Chinese students “including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”
    


                    “We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong,” he said.
                





            More than 275,000 students from China studied in the US in the 2023-2024 academic year, according to a report from the Institute for International Education (IIE) and the State Department. China sent the second most students from abroad of any country, trailing behind only India.
    


            US institutions rely on international students for tuition and many students participate in research and innovation work.
    


            The move comes a day after the State Department ordered a pause on all new student visa appointments worldwide as it prepares for expanded social media vetting.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov amid growing frustration from President Donald Trump toward President Vladimir Putin.
    


            According to a State Department readout, Rubio “reiterated President Trump's calls for constructive, good faith dialogue with Ukraine as the only path to ending this war.”
    


            He also “welcomed Russia and Ukraine's exchange of ‘1,000-for-1,000' prisoners over the weekend,” it said.
    


            Trump said today he would “know in about two weeks” whether Russia is serious about trying to end the war. Moscow has yet to put forward a promised framework of its terms for a ceasefire.
    


            Russia also said today that another round of talks with Ukraine will be held in Istanbul next week.
    


            The Justice Department is investigating whether a California law violates students' rights by allowing transgender student athletes to play on girls' sports teams. 



            Investigators are probing California's School Success and Opportunity Act — which prohibits public schools from blocking transgender students who to participate in school sports — on whether or not it violates Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid, the DOJ said in a statement today.
    


Newly disclosed letters sent to the state's attorney general and the superintendent of public instruction, as well as the California Interscholastic Federation and the Jurupa Unified School District, comes one day after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete's participation in an upcoming sporting event.
    


            It's the latest move against public schools by Trump and the Justice Department, who have repeatedly threatened to pull federal funding from educational institutions whose rules run afoul of the administration's priorities.
    


                    “Title IX exists to protect women and girls in education. It is perverse to allow males to compete against girls, invade their private spaces, and take their trophies,” Harmeet Dhillon, who runs the department's Civil Rights division, said in a statement. “This Division will aggressively defend women's hard-fought rights to equal educational opportunities.”
                





            At the same time, the DOJ also filed a statement of interest in a federal lawsuit brought on behalf of high school girls who argue that they should not have to compete with transgender athletes.
    


            The lawsuit, which alleges that Maine is violating Title IX, is the latest action in a public feud between the governor of Maine, Janet Mills, and the federal government.
    


            A 20-year-old Venezuelan man who was enrolled in a New York City high school that caters to older migrant students is in ICE detention. This makes him one of the first known students in a US public school system to be targeted by Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            The student, identified by his attorneys only as Dylan in the interest of “keeping his family and community safe,” entered the United States in April 2024 with his mother and two siblings, his attorneys said.
    


            He was detained last Wednesday at a Manhattan court where a judge dismissed his immigration proceedings making the young man vulnerable to detention and possible removal from the US.
    


                    “We don't know the exact intent of the government lawyers in asking for the dismissal of Dylan's case, but that it appears to be part of a larger policy that we are seeing across the country to dismiss in order to put someone in expedited removal,” said a spokesperson for the New York Legal Assistance Group, or NYLAG, which represents Dylan.






            The spokesperson said their client entered the United States with permission to petition for asylum and that his detention “robs him of the opportunity to seek that relief with the full protections offered to him under the law.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security referred to Dylan as an “illegal alien,” in a social media post yesterday, and insisted he entered the US illegally.
    


            CNN has reached out to US Customs and Border Protection for comment.
    


            Katie Miller, a top adviser and spokesperson for the Department of Government Efficiency at the White House, has left her position and is now working with Elon Musk, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Miller is working “full time” for Musk, one of the sources said. Another said she has been helping arrange Musk's interviews that are unrelated to his time in government. This week Musk has given interviews to the Washington Post, CBS News and Ars Technica connected to SpaceX's Starship launch.
    


            Like several other White House advisers including Musk himself, Miller was a “Special Government Employee” which allows private sector figures to simultaneously work for the federal government but with restrictions on how many days per year can be spent on government work although that time can be extended.
    


            Miller, who is married to Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, did not respond to a request for comment sent to her White House email, which still appears to be functioning. A separate White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The Trump administration has effectively cut off some American companies from selling goods to China, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN today.
    


            The spokesperson said the department is “reviewing exports of strategic significance to China. In some cases, Commerce has suspended existing export licenses or imposed additional license requirements while the review is pending.”

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona, the latest dramatic twist in a trial that has captivated the nation and the soccer world for more than two months.

The whiplash decision comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary about the case. 

Her controversial withdrawal compelled the court to either appoint a new judge in her place or to retry the entire case from scratch.

On Thursday, the judges decided the latter, effectively turning the clock back on all proceedings in the case that accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in his final days. 

The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when. 

Julieta Makintach said that she had “no choice” but to resign from the case on Tuesday after the prosecutor showed a teaser-trailer for a documentary, Divine Justice, which traces the aftermath of Maradona's death at the age of 60 to the start of the trail, clearly featuring Makintach as a main protagonist.

Maradona, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in 1986, died on Nov. 25, 2020 on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, days after undergoing surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court backed a multibillion-dollar oil railroad expansion in Utah Thursday in a ruling that scales back a key environmental law for projects around the country. 

The 8-0 decision comes after an appeal to the high court from backers of the project, which is aimed at quadrupling oil production in the remote area of sandstone and sagebrush. 

Environmental groups said the decision would have sweeping impacts on National Environmental Policy Act reviews. The Trump administration has already said it's speeding up that process after the president vowed to boost U.S. oil and gas development.

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-kilometer) expansion that would connect oil and gas producers to the broader rail network and allow them to access larger markets. Supporters have argued that streamlining environmental reviews would speed up development. 

The justices reversed a lower court decision and restored a critical approval from federal regulators on the Surface Transportation Board. The project could still face additional legal and regulatory hurdles.

Environmental groups and a Colorado county had argued that regulators must consider a broad range of potential impacts when they consider new development, such as increased wildfire risk, the effect of additional crude oil production from the area and increased refining in Gulf Coast states. 

The justices, though, found that regulators were right to consider the direct effects of the project, rather than the wider upstream and downstream impact. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that courts should defer to regulators on “where to draw the line” on what factors to take into account. Four other conservative justices joined his opinion.

“Simply stated, NEPA is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock,” he wrote of the policy act reviews. “The goal of the law is to inform agency decision making, not to paralyze it.”

The court's conservative majority court has taken steps to curtail the power of federal regulators in other cases, including striking down the decades-old Chevron doctrine that made it easier for the federal government to set a wide range of regulations.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with the outcome, but with a narrower legal reasoning. In a decision joined by her two liberal colleagues, she said the court could have simply cleared the way for the railway approval by finding the board didn't need to take into account any harm caused by the oil that might eventually be carried on the railway. 

Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case after facing calls to step aside over ties to Philip Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire whose ownership of oil wells in the area means he could benefit if the project goes through. Gorsuch, as a lawyer in private practice, had represented Anschutz.

The ruling comes after President Donald Trump's vow to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from former President Joe Biden's focus on climate change. The administration announced last month it's speeding up environmental reviews of projects required under the same law at the center of the Utah case, compressing a process that typically takes a year or more into just weeks.

“The court's decision gives agencies a green light to ignore the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their decisions and avoid confronting them,” said Sambhav Sankar, senior vice president of programs at Earthjustice.

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said opponents would continue to fight the Utah project. “This disastrous decision to undermine our nation's bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy,” she said. 

The project's public partner applauded the ruling. “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability,” said Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition.

LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. see lower social acceptance for transgender people than those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual, a new Pew Research Center poll found.

Pew found that about 6 in 10 LGBTQ+ adults said there is “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of social acceptance in the U.S. for gay and lesbian people. Only about 1 in 10 said the same for nonbinary and transgender people — and about half said there was “not much” or no acceptance at all for transgender people.




Giovonni Santiago, a 39-year-old transgender man and Air Force veteran who lives in Northeast Ohio and was not a participant in the survey, said he feels that acceptance for transgender people has declined in the last few years – roughly in step with the rise of state laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, regulating which school and public bathrooms transgender people can use and which sports they can play.

He said he's seen acceptance get worse nationally, following the lead of some places that were early adopters of restrictions.

“They were like the anomaly for ignorance and in hatred, especially towards trans people,” Santiago said. “But now we see that it's just kind of sweeping the nation, unfortunately.”

Still, Santiago said he doesn't fear for his own personal safety — a contrast with most transgender people, who said they have feared for their safety at some point.







“I guess I don't feel it as much because I live a life that most people don't know that I'm trans unless I specifically tell them,” said Santiago, who runs a nonprofit dedicated to supporting transgender youth.

The survey of 3,959 LGBTQ+ adults was conducted in January, after President Donald Trump was elected but just before he returned to office and set into motion a series of policies that question the existence of transgender people.

On his first day, Trump signed an executive order calling on the government to recognize people as male or female based on the “biological truth” of their future cells at conception, rather than accept scientific evidence that gender is a spectrum. Since then, he's begun ousting transgender service members from the military, and tried to bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions for females and block federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19, among other orders.

A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling transgender issues, with a range of views on specific actions.

According to the Pew poll, about two-thirds of LGBTQ+ adults said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationally 10 years ago boosted acceptance of same-sex couples “a lot more” or “somewhat more.” The Supreme Court is expected to rule in coming weeks on a major case regarding transgender people — deciding whether Tennessee can enforce a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

Transgender people are less likely than gay or lesbian adults to say they're accepted by all their family members. The majority of LGBTQ+ said their siblings and friends accepted them, though the rates were slightly higher among gay or lesbian people. About half of gay and lesbian people said their parents did, compared with about one-third of transgender people. Only about 1 in 10 transgender people reported feeling accepted by their extended family, compared with about 3 in 10 gay or lesbian people.

Transgender people are more likely than gay, lesbian or bisexual people to say they feel “extremely” or “very” connected to a broader LGBTQ+ community and to say that all or most of their friends are also LGBTQ+.

Some elements of the experience are similar. About one-third of transgender and lesbian or gay adults said they first felt they might be LGBTQ+ by the time they were 10 and most did by age 13. About half waited until they were at least 18 to first tell someone. 

Aubrey Campos, 41, runs a taco truck near a hub of LGBTQ+ bars in Fort Worth, Texas, and also serves as a community organizer. She says her parents were supportive when she came out as transgender at about age 12. But the younger trans people she works with often have very different experiences — including some who were kicked out of their homes.

“Now the times are a little bit dark,” she said. “This is a time that we to come together and make it brighter and make it known that we aren't going to just disappear.”

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's presidential election has come down to a stark ideological choice: a liberal pro-European mayor versus a staunch nationalist conservative. They are polling so close that the outcome is impossible to predict in the run-off round on Sunday.

It's not just a domestic affair. President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind the nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, and dangled the prospect of closer military ties if Poles choose him over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.

Trump met with Nawrocki earlier this month at the White House and sent his Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to a meeting of the conservative pressure group CPAC in Poland, where she offered a strong endorsement.

Noem even dangled the prospect of closer U.S.-Polish military ties in the event of a Nawrocki win — with the implied warning that a Trzaskowski victory could jeopardize Poland's security.

Hungary's autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who maintains close Kremlin ties, also gave his support to Nawrocki at a CPAC meeting in Budapest on Thursday.

At stake is not only Poland's domestic course but also the international standing of a key European Union and NATO member on the alliance's eastern flank, in a region gripped by anxiety over Russia's war in Ukraine.

Sunday's vote will either empower Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a pro-EU reformer, with a presidential ally who can advance his rule-of-law agenda — or saddle him with a rival who could veto legislation and block government initiatives.




Trzaskowski's supporters argue that a pro-European leader would enhance Poland's global standing during a time of war in Europe. Nawrocki's backers believe only conservative rule can safeguard national sovereignty and traditional Christian values, and they say Trump's support would greatly enhance Poland's security.

But the candidate who may ultimately decide the outcome is one who won't appear on the runoff ballot.

Sławomir Mentzen, a 38-year-old far-right politician and beer producer from the central city of Torun, finished third in the first round of voting on May 18, with nearly 15% of the vote. Though eliminated, his supporters — often young, anti-establishment, and deeply skeptical of both Brussels and Poland's political establishment — have become the most sought-after constituency in the country.

Both remaining candidates have gone out of their way to court Mentzen and his base. In recent days, each man traveled to the north-central Polish town of Torun, famous for being the birthplace of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, to appear on Mentzen's YouTube channel, where he has built a following with a mix of libertarian economics, nationalist rhetoric, and anti-EU invective.

His influence highlights a broader shift in Polish politics, where the far right — once considered a fringe force — is increasingly shaping the national agenda. It's also part of a larger trend of hard-right parties gaining traction across Europe.

Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations' Warsaw office, says Poland is part of a larger pattern in which voters turn to populist forces amid rapid social change. But he also cites local factors, such as disillusionment with Tusk's coalition.

That coalition, which spans the ideological spectrum, has struggled to agree on key issues, including liberalizing the abortion law — a campaign promise. Meanwhile, outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda has blocked parts of Tusk's agenda. Observers say the coalition's voters must be highly mobilized on Sunday to defeat Nawrocki.

Many votes in the first round went to protest candidates. Among voters aged 18–29, over 35% backed Mentzen, and nearly 20% supported a left-wing candidate, Adrian Zandberg, according to exit polls. 

In addition, an extreme right-wing antisemite, Grzegorz Braun, won more than 6% of the votes overall.

Buras believes right-wing protest candidates are more appealing today than those on the left because they promise to restore a lost past, while the left promises a better future that many see as unattainable.

“The world is changing, society is changing very fast, much faster than anytime in the past,” Buras said. “People are worried and they vote for those who say we can go back to the glorious past.”

Since the first round, Mentzen — co-leader of the Confederation party — has presented both candidates with an eight-point list of demands: no new taxes; defense of cash payments; expanded gun rights; and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine, among others.

Nawrocki, who appeared on Mentzen's show on June 22, signed on to all eight points — including the controversial Ukraine stance — breaking with his Law and Justice party's longstanding support for Kyiv's integration with the West.

Trzaskowski appeared two days later. He said he could agree with some points, like fiscal restraint, but rejected others. He strongly defended LGBTQ+ rights and reaffirmed that Ukraine should eventually join NATO, once the war ends, calling it key to Poland's own security.

The YouTube interviews have dominated the political conversation, underscoring how Mentzen, a TikTok-savvy outsider, has upended traditional campaigning.

The exchange between Trzaskowski and Mentzen on Saturday was occasionally tense, especially over LGBTQ+ rights, but remained civil and substantive. 

In many ways it overshadowed a traditional televised debate the day before. The substance of that debate did not seem to change the trajectory of the campaign. The thing Poles discussed most was a brief moment when Nawrocki inserted something into his mouth which he later said was a tobacco pouch. Some have questioned if he is fit to be president if he couldn't get through a two-hour debate without taking a hit of tobacco.

After the sometimes sharp exchanges, Mentzen sat down for a beer with Trzaskowski and others in the pub he owns.

The informal gathering was documented by Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who was there as well. He posted a video on social media Saturday evening showing the group with the words: “For a Poland that unites, not divides.”

The video quickly went viral, with commentators speculating about whether it was a spontaneous gesture or a calculated political move.

It was also one more example, if more were needed, of how far-right forces in Europe are slowly becoming accepted.

For Mentzen, the moment was also awkward. The man who made his name skewering the political elite appeared cozy with establishment figures. Critics on the hard right lashed out, revealing fractures in the movement he helped popularize.

After dangling the promises of an endorsement for days, Mentzen on Wednesday afternoon said he wouldn't offer one to either candidate. “Vote as your conscience tells you,” he told his supporters.

SOMIS, Calif. (AP) — Andreas Tompros lost his home and at least a third of his avocado orchard to a wildfire last year, but the 47-year-old grower is not worried about his farm making a comeback. 

While California farmers often rattle off a list of challenges they face including high labor costs, water restrictions and overseas competition, many avocado growers say they have a good thing going. A key reason may come as a surprise to some — Mexican imports. 

When the United States lifted its ban on Mexican avocados in 1997, California growers worried at first that the imported fruit would displace their production. 

But the steady flow of avocados has wound up helping, not hurting, their sales by allowing for a year-round supply to markets and restaurants that has fomented demand, farmers say. Before the influx, most American consumers considered avocados to be specialty items — and when they came into season in California, industry officials had to work to rev up widespread interest in order to sell them.

But not anymore. 

Avocado consumption has been booming in the United States over the past two decades. The amount of fruit available per person tripled to more than 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) between 2000 and 2021, federal statistics show. Avocado toast and guacamole are regular offerings not just in culinary hubs like NYC but at cafes around the Midwest and the South.

On a steep, sun-soaked hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Tompros is replanting nearly 300 avocado trees with the belief that Americans' hunger for the fruit — and his orchard — will continue to grow.

“It will come back, and I believe it will become better than it was,” Tompros, who previously ran a software company in Hollywood, said of the orchard he took over five years ago in the tiny community of Somis.

Avocado demand has also been buoyed by consumers' growing interest in healthy fats, said Emiliano Escobedo, executive director of the Hass Avocado Board.

A 2000 U.S. law created the board that collected 2.5 cents for every pound (0.5 kilograms) of avocados imported or produced in the United States. The board used the money to market avocados and conduct nutritional research, an effort that has been widely credited with making the fruit ubiquitous in supermarkets and on restaurant menus.

“It's been really wildly successful. It generates way more money than most of these other industry boards do,” said Richard Sexton, distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. “When you look at the growth rate in avocado consumption relative to all fruits, the difference in growth rate is dramatic.”

Escobedo said about 60% of U.S. households currently buy avocados, and about half of these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of consumption, which means there's still room for the market to grow — especially in the Northeast, where the fruit is less common.

“There is a lot of opportunity for certain groups of people to increase their purchasing of avocados,” Escobedo said.

While the Trump administration has threatened tariffs on a spate of Mexican goods, avocados have so far been spared. California growers said they want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust U.S. inspections of the imports to keep out pests to protect their crop. 

“If you are going to farm in California, avocados are about the best deal right now,” said Ken Melban, president of the California Avocado Commission.

California farmers grow about 10% of the avocados eaten in the United States, Melban said, and account for nearly all of the country's domestic avocado production. The fruit is largely grown in California from April through September, and Mexican imports arrive year-round to meet nationwide demand, which exceeds what the state's farmers grow, he said.

In Southern California's Ventura County, many growers have shifted to avocados since lemon prices were walloped by cheaper imports from Argentina. As recently planted trees start bearing fruit in a few years, the region's avocado production is likely to rise, said Korinne Bell, agricultural commissioner for the county northwest of Los Angeles.

Avocado trees do not come without risks in a region prone to wildfires. 

Still, demand for the trees has jumped due to interest from lemon growers — and since the November 2024 fire charred Ventura County avocado orchards, said Rob Brokaw, whose family-owned nursery has supplied avocado trees to California growers for 70 years.

“Right now we are sold out essentially for this year,” Brokaw said. “And we're mostly sold out for 2026.”

Tompros debated whether to plant the more fire-resistant lemon trees or another crop after the fire ripped through Somis, but he decided to replant due to the soaring demand for Super Bowl guacamole and avocado toast.

“It's the super food, and it's still growing in popularity,” Tompros said.

He's taking precautions to not plant the trees too close to what will eventually be his rebuilt home, because the dried-out leaves that help nourish the orchard's soil can also fuel blazes. 

It may take a few years, but Tompros hopes it won't be too long before his newly planted trees bear fruit that he can sell to a local packinghouse or in seasonal gift boxes with citrus and passionfruit that he ships directly to customers.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin discusses President Donald Trump's removal of national security advisor Mike Waltz and the threat of Iran to U.S. national security on ‘America Reports.'

As the White House trims over 100 aides from its National Security Council staff, some former officials and analysts are asking if the smaller team can meet the demands of a fast-moving and dangerous global security environment.

Roughly half of the NSC's 350-person team will depart in what the White House is calling a ""right-sizing"" of a historically bureaucratic body composed largely of career diplomats – many of whom are seen as out of step with the president's agenda.

Aides originally on loan from agencies like the State Department and the Pentagon are being sent back to their home departments. Political appointees placed on administrative leave have been told the White House will find other roles for them elsewhere in the administration.

Some former NSC officials told Fox News Digital it's too early to tell whether the overhaul will result in a more efficient agency – or one ill-equipped to deliver timely intelligence for national security decisions.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO OVERHAUL NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WEEKS AFTER WALTZ'S DEPARTURE

Privately, national security sources questioned whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is currently serving as interim national security advisor, might be paring back the agency to avoid internal power struggles once he returns to his original post.

Michael Allen, a former senior director at the NSC, said the staffing changes reflect President Donald Trump's desire for direct control over key decisions.

""I think he wants people to bring decisions to him earlier than previous presidents,"" Allen told Fox News Digital.

The NSC has charted rocky waters since it lost national security advisor Mike Waltz following the inadvertently publicized Signal chat. His deputy, Alex Wong, also recently departed the agency, and other aides who had a large impact on the administration's early foreign policy decisions were pushed out in Friday's restructuring.

Eric Trager, the senior director for Middle East issues who traveled with envoy Steve Witkoff for some of his Iran negotiations, is out. So is Andrew Peek, senior director for Europe and Eurasia, who helped coordinate the approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

Additionally, the restructuring will move Andy Barker, national security advisor to Vice President JD Vance, and Robert Gabriel, assistant to the president for policy, into roles serving as deputy national security advisors.

""This happens naturally on NSCs, the kind of stasis we saw in the Biden administration is highly untypical,"" said Victoria Coates, former deputy national security advisor to Trump. 

She noted that President Ronald Reagan had six national security advisors over two terms as president, in addition to two acting NSAs. 

""For the president, he has legitimate concerns about the NSC from the first term, given what happened, and then, you know, there's no sugar-coating it: the situation with Signalgate was a problem for NSA Waltz,"" Coates went on. ""The president is taking actions to get the NSC into a condition that he would have complete confidence in it.""

With a slimmer NSC, the president is expected to lean more heavily on Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for his daily intelligence briefings.

""One thing that makes this administration unique is that it's the president himself and a small circle of advisors who truly matter and make decisions,"" said Brian Katulis, a former NSC official and fellow at the Middle East Institute. ""They just don't see the need for ongoing interagency meetings like in previous administrations.""

Katulis added that the biggest risk isn't necessarily a lack of intelligence – but a lack of coordination.

""Rather than gaps in intel or knowledge, what I'd worry more about is whether different agencies are singing from the same sheet of music,"" he said.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on Friday's cuts and their intent. 

ONE-MAN CABINET: MARCO RUBIO WENT FROM RIVAL TO TRUMP'S POINT MAN, BUT CAN HE HANDLE IT

Others argue that the NSC has become bloated and is in need of a reset.

""The NSC under Democratic presidents grows to 300, 400 people,"" said former Trump NSC official Alex Gray. ""It becomes its own department.""

""When I was there, we took it down to about 110 people doing policy – and it could probably go down another 50 and still be effective,"" he said.

""Do you want an NSC that formulates and directs policy, or one that gives the president advice, lets him decide, and then implements it? You don't need hundreds of people to do that.""

But the NSC is the primary agency tasked with making sure other agencies are in line with the president's agenda. 

""Rather than preparing options for him, they should take his direction and implement it,"" said Coates.  But, she added, ""if you take it down too far, it's not going to have the manpower to implement those directions from the White House into the departments and agencies which are always bigger and better funded than the NSC.""

""How many heads do you have to bash together to get them to do what the president wants them to do? Our experience was in the first term that we needed a fair amount of heft on our end to get them to do stuff they didn't want to do, like designate the IRGC as an FTO, for example,"" Coates added. 

Even with a leaner staff, the NSC remains responsible for managing critical global challenges – from Iran nuclear talks and the war in Ukraine to military competition with China.

That puts added pressure on Rubio, who will bear the blame if any crucial intelligence slips through the cracks.

""The big issue is the national security advisor needs to make sure the president has all the information he needs to make a decision,"" Allen said.

Fox News correspondent Molly Line has the latest on the halting of the student visa program due to alleged antisemitism on campus on 'Special Report.' 

The Trump administration is targeting international students with student visas and permanent residents who hold a green card as part of its immigration crackdown. 

And while green card holders may legally remain in the U.S. indefinitely, work in the country, and are protected by U.S. laws, the Trump administration has made clear that the demographic is not off limits from its mass-deportation agenda. 

Can the federal government deport those who are green card holders and are here in the U.S. legally? 

Yes. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, green card holders are only protected if they ""do not commit any actions that would make you removable under immigration law."" 

Green card holders are ""required to obey all laws of the United States and localities,"" file taxes annually, register for the draft if the green card holder is a male between the ages of 18 and 25, and are also ""expected to support the democratic form of government,"" per U.S. Citizenship and Immigraion Services. 

Should a green card holder violate certain provisions included in the Immigration and Nationality Act, they could face deportation.

LAWYERS FOR COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST MAHMOUD KHALIL BLAST RUBIO EVIDENCE LETTER: 'TWO PAGES, THAT'S IT'

Reasons a green card holder could be deported include the termination of conditional permanent resident status, knowingly helping someone enter the U.S. illegally, committing crimes including rape, murder or fraud, according to Berardi Immigration Law, a business immigration law firm that handles work permits and green cards for international employees working in the U.S. 

Other reasons also include committing an aggravated felony, being convicted of drug or firearms crimes, and engaging in criminal activity that jeopardizes public safety or national security issues, per Berardi Immigration Law. 

Furthermore, those who face convictions for these crimes may only face deportation after an immigration judge hears their case, according to Penn State Law School. 

A green card allows an individual already in the U.S. who is not an American citizen to remain in the country, while a student visa allows those outside the U.S. to study in the country for a specific amount of time at an academic institution. 

Eligibility for a green card is possible through several avenues, including being an immediate family member of a U.S. citizen like a spouse or parent, finding employment here in the U.S., or qualifying as a refugee or someone seeking asylum. 

TRUMP COLLEGE CRACKDOWN: LIST OF STUDENTS DETAINED AMID ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUSES

The possibility of deporting green card holders attracted increased scrutiny after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil, pictured here, in March.  (Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images)

The possibility of deporting green card holders attracted increased scrutiny after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil in March. Khalil, who is a Palestinian raised in Syria and a permanent U.S. resident with a green card who first came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2022, played a major role in the protests against Israel while at Columbia University as a graduate student.

The Department of Homeland Security said Khalil was arrested to protect U.S. national security, and claimed that Khalil ""led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization."" 

Additionally, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the time any Hamas supporters in the U.S. would suffer similar fates and have their green cards pulled, and face deportation.  

Likewise, President Donald Trump said in a social media post in March following Khalil's arrest that it was ""the first arrest of many to come.""

But Democrats claim the Trump administration is out of line and the arrest was an assault on freedom of speech. Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats said Khalil's arrest amounted to ""straight up authoritarianism"" in a post on X in March. 

An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled in April that the Trump administration was at liberty to deport Khalil, claiming she didn't have the authority to challenge the Trump administration's assessment that Khalil posed a national security threat. 

But Khalil, who is currently stuck at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, has yet to see whether he will face deportation. Another federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from removing Khalil from the U.S. while his case plays out in court. 

Separately, the Trump administration is also eyeing ways to beef up vetting for those entering the U.S. on student visas — particularly for those who've publicly supported Palestine, like Khalil. 

For example, the State Department is also bracing itself to ramp up social media screening for those applying for student visas. The State Department announced Tuesday that it is temporarily suspending new student and exchange visitor visa interviews as it evaluates enhanced social media screenings for the application process.

CONGRESS 'ENTITLED' TO 'REGULATING THE CONDUCT' OF VISA HOLDERS, EXPERT SAYS AMID DEPORTATION PUSH

Rubio told lawmakers May 20 that he expects that the State Department has already pulled thousands of visas since January following Trump's inauguration. That's up from the 300 the administration had revoked as of late March. 

Rubio also said that his agency would continue to pull student visas, stating that a visa is not a right, it's a ""privilege."" 

""I don't know the latest count, but we probably have more to do,"" Rubio told lawmakers on the Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign affairs. ""We're going to continue to revoke the visas of people who are here as guests and are disrupting our higher education facilities.""

Former Biden Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg speaks with reporters after headlining a town hall with veterans in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which sparked more 2028 speculation.

It has been just over four months since President Donald Trump returned to power in the White House, and the very early moves in the 2028 presidential race are already underway by some Democrats with likely national ambitions.

This upcoming weekend, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats' 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, who says he is not laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run, will make separate appearances in South Carolina, the state the Democratic National Committee anointed to hold the lead-off primary in their 2024 nominating calendar.

Two weeks later, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who ran for the White House in 2020, will headline a major Democratic state party dinner in New Hampshire, which for a century has held the first presidential primary.

Two weeks ago, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who later served as Transportation secretary in former President Joe Biden's administration, headlined a town hall with veterans and military families in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON

Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars until the DNC demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule.

Another potential contender, two-term Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, late last month, gave the keynote address at a major state party fundraising gala in New Hampshire.

Also making noise is two-term Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who said recently he would consider running for president if he felt he could successfully unite the country.

WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAID IN A FOX NEWS DIGITAL INTERVIEW 

Additionally, progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York grabbed plenty of attention the past couple of months, co-headlining a slew of large rallies across the country with longtime progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which sparked plenty of 2028 speculation.

The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's election setbacks, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. Republicans additionally made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.

Since Trump's return to power, an increasingly angry and energized base of Democrats has been pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration.

EFFORT BY DEMOCRATS TO STOP THE SLIDE RIDICULED 

Democrats are not only looking ahead to next year's midterms, when they hope to make ballot box gains, but also to the next presidential race.

""There was a sense of hopelessness earlier this year among Democrats, as Trump came in with his wrecking ball, and it seemed like there was nothing but futile opposition to him,"" longtime Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News. ""So thinking about a presidential race with potential candidates is a way to get some hope back and look towards a future that doesn't include Trump.""

Moyer, a veteran of a handful of Democratic presidential campaigns, said the race is ""wide open, and it won't be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates.""

The results of the 2026 midterm elections will have a major impact on the shape of the next White House race. 

For now, however, here are 20 Democrats considered potential presidential contenders to watch on the road to 2028.

After lying low when the Biden administration came to a close, former Vice President Kamala Harris has picked up the political pace of late, including headlining a recent major DNC fundraiser in New York City, with another in San Francisco next week.

Among her campaign options that she is weighing is a 2026 run for the open governor's seat in her home state of California and another bid in 2028 for the White House.

A source in the former vice president's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital two months ago that Harris had told allies she would decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a 2026 gubernatorial campaign.

Harris served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and represented the Golden State in the U.S. Senate before joining Biden's 2020 ticket and winning that election as vice president.

Additionally, Harris would be considered the clear frontrunner for governor in heavily blue California in the race to succeed term-limited Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom.

However, early polling in the 2028 Democratic nomination race indicates that Harris would be the frontrunner, thanks in part to her name recognition within her party.

While there are plenty of voices within the party who would like to move on from the Biden/Harris era following Trump's sweeping victory, and there is little history of Democrats yearning for past defeated presidential nominees, Trump has re-written the rules when it comes to defeated White House contenders making another run. 

Potential buyers' remorse of a second Trump administration could boost the 60-year-old Harris in the years to come.

The progressive ""rock star"" and best-known lawmaker among the so-called ""Squad"" of diverse House Democrats in October turned 35, the minimum age to run for president.

Some Democrats argue that a riveting messenger with star power is needed as the party's next nominee, and Ocasio-Cortez is guaranteed to grab plenty of attention if she ultimately decides to run.

There is also speculation the four-term federal lawmaker from New York City may primary challenge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York when he is up for re-election in 2028.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom was a top surrogate for Biden during the president's re-election bid. With the blessing of the White House, the two-term California governor debated then-Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last year on Fox News. 

Newsom's travels on behalf of Biden brought him to New Hampshire and South Carolina, two crucial early voting states on the Democratic Party's nominating calendar.

After Harris, his friend and fellow Californian, replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, the governor, after a pause, continued his efforts to keep Trump from returning to the White House.

While Newsom and California's Democrat-dominated legislature took action to ""Trump-proof"" the Golden State, the governor has also worked with Trump on key matters, including January's wildfires that devastated parts of metropolitan Los Angeles.

Newsom also appears to have moderated on some issues and invited well-known Trump allies Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his weekly podcast.

The 57-year-old Newsom, who is term-limited, completes his duties in Sacramento at the end of next year, right around the time the 2028 presidential election will start to heat up.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has become a leading voice in the Democrats' opposition to Trump and has taken steps to Trump-proof his solidly blue state.

""You come for my people, you come through me,"" Pritzker told reporters of his efforts to protect Illinois.

Pritzker was also a high-profile surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris during the 2024 cycle. Those efforts brought Pritzker to Nevada, a general election battleground state and an early-voting Democratic presidential primary state, and New Hampshire.

Additionally, the governor's recent trip to New Hampshire sparked more 2028 buzz.

However, before he makes any decision about 2028, the 60-year-old governor must decide whether he will run in 2026 for a third term steering Illinois.

Two-term Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer grabbed plenty of attention and became a Democratic Party rising star in 2020 when she feuded with Trump over COVID-19 federal assistance and survived a foiled kidnapping attempt.

Trump, at the time, called her ""that woman from Michigan.""

Along with Newsom and Pritzker, Whitmer's name was floated as a possible replacement for Biden following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June, before the president endorsed Harris, and the party instantly coalesced around the vice president.

Whitmer was a leading surrogate for Biden and then for Harris and made a big impression on Democratic activists during a stop this summer in New Hampshire on behalf of Harris.

However, Whitmer was criticized by some in her party for appearing to cozy up to Trump during a White House visit earlier this spring.

The 53-year-old governor is term-limited and will leave office after the end of next year.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, the 51-year-old first-term governor of Pennsylvania, was on Harris' short-list for vice presidential nominee.

Even though the vice president named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Shapiro remained a top surrogate on behalf of his party's 2024 national ticket. 

However, his two-day swing in New Hampshire during the final full week ahead of Election Day did raise some eyebrows and 2028 speculation.

After Harris lost battleground Pennsylvania to Trump, there was plenty of talk within the party that Harris had made the wrong choice for her running mate.

Shapiro, who has a track record of taking on the first Trump administration as Pennsylvania attorney general, is expected to play a similar role with Trump back in the White House.

The governor will be up for re-election in 2026.

Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland speaks with the New Hampshire delegation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024. (Fox News — Paul Steinhauser)

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is considered by many to be another Democratic Party rising star.

The 46-year-old Army veteran, who is also a Rhodes Scholar and CEO of the charitable organization the Robin Hood Foundation during the coronavirus pandemic, was elected two years ago.

Even though Moore said in a recent interview on ""The View"" that he is ""not running"" in 2028, speculation persists, fueled in part because of his upcoming stop in South Carolina.

Moore will be up for re-election in 2026.

Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who surpassed expectations during his 2020 Democratic presidential nomination run, was a very active surrogate on behalf of Biden and later Harris, during the 2024 cycle.

He helped raise a lot of money for the Democratic Party ticket, including heading a top-dollar fundraiser in New Hampshire.

The 43-year-old former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and former naval officer who served in the war in Afghanistan, is considered one of the party's biggest and brightest stars. He was known as a top communicator for the administration, including making frequent appearances on Fox News.

Fueling buzz about a potential 2028 presidential run, Buttigieg passed on a 2026 Senate bid in his adopted home state of Michigan and made a high-profile stop in Iowa earlier this month.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, 47, who was elected governor in 2019 and then re-elected in 2023 in red-state Kentucky, was on Harris' longer list for potential running mates.

Beshear made plenty of new friends and contacts as he ventured to New Hampshire last year to headline the state Democratic Party's annual fall fundraising gala.

He served as Kentucky's attorney general before running for governor.

Beshear said in a recent interview with local station WDRB that ""if you'd asked me a couple years ago if this is something I'd consider, I probably wouldn't have. But I don't want to leave a broken country to my kids. And so, if I'm somebody that can bring this nation together, hopefully find some common ground, it's something I'll consider.""

Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, 55, is a major player in Washington as the Democratic minority in the Senate fights back against the second Trump administration.

Warnock, who won Senate elections in 2020 and 2022 in battleground Georgia, served as senior pastor at the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.

He is up for re-election to the Senate in 2028.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is considered one of the party's most talented orators.

Thanks to his 2020 run, Booker made plenty of friends and allies in such early states as New Hampshire and South Carolina.

Booker made headlines earlier this year by delivering a record-breaking 25-hour and 5-minute marathon speech from the floor of the Senate. The speech protested the sweeping and controversial moves so far by Trump during his second administration, as well as the operations of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

Since the November election, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been very vocal about the steps Democrats need to take to win back working-class voters.

First elected to the House in 2006 and later to the Senate in 2012, the 51-year-old Murphy cruised to re-election this year by nearly 20 points, which means he would not have to decide between a re-election bid and a White House run in 2028.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 65, who once served as county attorney in Minnesota's most populous county, is now in her fourth term in the Senate.

Klobuchar ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and came in a strong third in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.

The senator has not ruled out making another run for the White House in 2028.

Rep. Ro Khanna, 48, was a tireless surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris. 

He has been a regular visitor to New Hampshire in the past couple of years, including a high-profile debate last year against then-GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

Khanna has grabbed plenty of attention so far this year as he has held town halls in Republican-controlled congressional districts and targeted Vice President JD Vance with events in the vice president's home state of Ohio and at Yale Law School, where both politicians earned their legal degrees.

Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, 67, who in January finished up his eighth and final year as governor, took his name out of the Harris running mate speculation early in the process last summer.

Cooper served 16 years as North Carolina's attorney general before winning election as governor.

The former governor is being heavily recruited by Democrats to try and flip a GOP-held Senate seat in North Carolina in next year's midterms.

The 61-year-old Minnesota governor, who served as Harris' running mate, has two years remaining in his second term in office.

While the vice presidential nominee's energy and enthusiasm on the campaign trail this year impressed plenty of Democratic strategists, the final results of the election will make any potential future national run for Tim Walz difficult.

Walz has said he is not thinking of 2028, but he has been very busy so far this year heading events across the country, and an upcoming stop in South Carolina is fueling more White House buzz.

The 65-year-old Rahm Emanuel, who served the past four years as ambassador to Japan during the Biden administration, has a jam-packed resume.

Emanuel, a veteran of former President Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s, went on to serve in Congress and steered the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during its very successful 2006 cycle. He later served as Obama's chief of staff before winning the 2011 election and 2015 re-election as Chicago mayor.

Emanuel, who late last year mulled making a bid for Democratic National Committee chair, has seen his name floated in recent months as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender.

President Donald Trump criticized CNBC White House correspondent Megan Casella's question about experts claiming he ""chickens out"" on tariff threats.

President Donald Trump ripped a reporter in the Oval Office Wednesday for asking a ""nasty question"" about his tariff deals.

""Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the TACO trade. They're saying, ‘Trump Always Chickens Out' - on your tariff threats. And that's why markets are higher this week. What's your response to that?"" CNBC White House correspondent Megan Casella asked during a brief gaggle.

""Oh, isn't that nice. ‘Chicken out.' I've never heard that,"" Trump responded. ""You mean because I reduced China from 145% that I set down to 100 and then down to another number? I said, ‘You have to open your whole country.'""

He went on, ""And because I gave the European Union a 50% tariff? And they called up, and they said, ‘Please, let's meet right now.' And I said, ‘Okay, I'll give you until June.'  I actually asked them, I said, 'What's the date?' Because they weren't willing to meet. And after I did what I did, they said, ‘We'll meet anytime you want.' And we have an end date of July 9. You call that chickening out? Because we have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing when Biden didn't have practically anything.""

Trump contrasted the situation with the Biden administration, saying the U.S. was ""stone-cold dead"" six months ago.

""We had a dead country. We had a country people didn't think was going to survive. And you ask a nasty question like that? It's called negotiation,"" Trump said.

Trump said lowering the number was part of an ongoing ""negotiation"" with China and attacked the question.

""Don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question. To me, that's the nastiest question,"" Trump said before calling another reporter.

Casella later reported on the event while appearing on CNBC's ""The Exchange."" 

""He did not like this question, I can tell you,"" Casella said.

She also joked that the ""nasty"" jab was a ""badge of honor"" of sorts.

After announcing several widespread tariffs in April, the Trump administration announced a pause on all tariffs except China until July to negotiate better deals.

Earlier this month, Trump agreed to a temporary reduction of China's tariff rates from 145% to approximately 30% as negotiations continued.

Mike Gallagher, a former congressman, discusses a new report detailing more information on the timeline and origins of the COVID-19 pandemic on ‘America Reports'

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino stated Wednesday evening that the bureau is examining issues related to the origin of COVID-19, though he did not confirm the existence of a formal investigation into a cover-up.

Bongino made the remarks in a post on X amid growing media attention on a newly identified COVID-19 strain.

""As we read and process reports of a new COVID strain emerging, I want you to know that we are actively investigating, in multiple field offices, the cover-up of the origin of the COVID virus, along with associated matters requiring our attention,"" Bongino wrote. ""The American people deserve answers.""

He did not identify specific individuals or entities under scrutiny. The FBI has not issued an official news release on the matter, and the scope of the review remains unclear. 

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bongino's comment represents one of the most direct public statements by a senior FBI official regarding the agency's continued interest in the pandemic's origin and the surrounding circumstances.

In 2023, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency assessed with moderate confidence that COVID-19 most likely originated from a lab incident in Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities have consistently denied such claims, calling them politically motivated and unsubstantiated.

Bongino's post follows the detection of a new COVID-19 variant, provisionally identified by researchers as NB.1.8.1, which has appeared in several U.S. states. Federal health authorities have not designated it as a variant of concern.

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic has continued its inquiry into whether early public health messaging downplayed the lab leak theory for diplomatic or political reasons. 

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former White House health advisor, has repeatedly denied any effort to conceal information, calling those allegations ""entirely false.""

Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group, explained the FAA's outdated system and why Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing blackouts in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

A man on board an American Airlines flight from Connecticut to Chicago Tuesday night faces charges after he allegedly forced a flight attendant to the floor and attempted to drag the flight attendant up the aisle while acting erratically, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).

In a news release, the DOJ said 24-year-old Julius Jordan Priester, of Wichita, Kansas, was arrested and charged with interference with flight crew members and attendants, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.

Priester was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 3359, which departed from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, at about 9:30 p.m., en route to Chicago.

Court documents filed Wednesday allege that, during the flight, Priester stood up, began to take his shirt off and ran toward the back of the plane, yelling, ""Help me!""

Priester then allegedly grabbed a flight attendant who was seated, and he shouted, ""You're coming with me,"" before forcefully taking the victim to the ground.

The DOJ alleges that after taking the flight attendant to the ground, he attempted to drag the victim up the aisle.

Passengers intervened, and Priester was returned to his seat, where the DOJ said he continued to act erratically and spoke incoherent sentences.

Once the plane returned to the gate, Priester was removed from the aircraft by Connecticut State Police and taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

American Airlines told Fox News Digital it does not tolerate violence on its flights.

Five former aides to President Joe Biden are facing the threat of subpoena ahead of a Thursday evening deadline to comply with a widening autopen investigation launched by House Republicans.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is leading the investigation into whether Biden personally approved controversial last-minute executive actions, especially a series of preemptive pardons, using a mechanical signature device known as an autopen.

His delegation of authority has fueled GOP claims that unelected officials effectively ran the presidency behind the scenes amid new claims of a White House cover-up into Biden's mental acuity.

“The American people deserve to know who was calling the shots,” Comer said last week, adding that his committee stands ready to escalate if cooperation isn't forthcoming.

While the autopen has long been legal, Republicans argue it becomes constitutionally questionable if the president didn't authorize its use personally. A Biden spokesperson has previously pushed back on reporting about his mental acuity, telling the press that “evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.”

Five former Biden White House officials tapped for congressional interviews have made initial contact with the committee via their lawyers since the chairman sent his letters on May 22, a source familiar with the panel's work told the Washington Examiner on Thursday. The source added that the committee will be in discussion with the group about transcribed interview dates.

“We expect all witnesses to fully comply with the Committee's investigation. The Committee will issue subpoenas if necessary,” the source said.

Anthony Bernal – A longtime aide to Jill Biden and a top figure in the East Wing, Bernal's rise to power made him one of the most influential staffers in the White House, according to Original Sin, the book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that alleged the cover-up.

Colleagues dubbed him the “leader of the loyalty police” for enforcing allegiance to the Biden family. GOP investigators believe Bernal may have exercised decision-making powers reserved for the president, especially amid mounting concerns over Biden's health.

Annie Tomasini – As Oval Office operations director, Tomasini was among Biden's closest aides and gatekeepers. 

Her pandemic-era proximity to the president, and her control over document routing, has placed her under scrutiny over whether she coordinated or facilitated autopen use without Biden's direct involvement.

Neera Tanden – As Biden's former domestic policy adviser, Tanden was involved in shaping executive actions and clemency policy. 

House investigators want to know whether she played a role in directing or endorsing actions the president may not have authorized himself.

Ashley Williams – A deputy to Tomasini, Williams was involved in scheduling and document preparation in the West Wing. 

Her proximity to internal processes makes her a key figure in understanding how executive orders and pardons were reviewed, finalized, and signed, and whether she was “running interference” for Biden to “minimize signs of how age has taken a toll” on the former president, according to a letter sent by the committee.

Dr. Kevin O'Connor – Biden's longtime physician, O'Connor is being asked to explain his February 2024 memo declaring the president “fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” even as internal reports and a subsequent cancer diagnosis have fueled Republican claims of a cover-up.

The committee is also investigating his personal and financial ties to the Biden family.

The committee's investigation is focused on the 32 clemency warrants issued using an autopen out of 57 total pardons and commutations during Biden's presidency. Many were signed in bulk between Jan. 16 and Jan. 19, just before Donald Trump's inauguration, raising questions about whether Biden approved them or whether aides acted without explicit direction.

Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel at the Oversight Project, a former division of the Heritage Foundation that has been investigating Biden's autopen usage for months, previously told the Washington Examiner the implications have major implications for the office of the president.

“The Constitution vests the power of pardon in one person and one person only — the President of the United States,” he said. “If it's autopenned, it opens up a whole can of worms. Did the president authorize this? Was there a written authorization? Who controlled the autopen?”

Brosnan also said those who received preemptive pardons, including Hunter and James Biden, should be considered for testimony. “They're certainly eligible to be deposed in this situation, and they cannot assert the Fifth Amendment for these pardons,” he added.

Though not yet subpoenaed, other former Biden insiders have been floated as possible witnesses:

Ron Klain, who served as Biden's chief of staff from 2021 to 2023, oversaw internal policy coordination and likely had insight into the president's capabilities and awareness after he briefly returned to his side for his 2024 election debate preparation last June.Mike Donilon, Biden's senior adviser and longtime confidant, shaped the president's public messaging and may have known about the inner circle's handling of key decisions.Anita Dunn, another senior adviser, worked closely with both Joe and Jill Biden and has been mentioned in media reports as a central player in managing Biden's appearances and communication strategy.Bob Bauer, Biden's personal attorney and former White House counsel, may have reviewed the legal processes behind the pardons, particularly those issued preemptively.Karine Jean-Pierre, as press secretary, may have knowledge of how Biden's health and executive actions were portrayed publicly and discussed internally.Jill Biden, the first lady, has been described as a “chief denier” of the president's decline and a key voice in pushing for his reelection, raising questions about her influence on internal decision-making.Hunter Biden, whose sweeping 11-year pardon is among the most controversial, is likely to draw scrutiny over the circumstances of its issuance.

DAVID SACKS ALLEGES ELIZABETH WARREN CONTROLLED BIDEN'S AUTOPEN

For now, the focus remains on the five officials contacted earlier this month. If they do not confirm cooperation by Thursday evening, Comer and his staff are prepared to escalate.

“We're continuing our investigation to expose the truth,” Comer said earlier this month. “Now that Biden's top enablers can no longer hide behind the power of the presidency, we're moving forward.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference in Hungary begins in Budapest on Thursday.

While organizers claim it will celebrate the “Age of Patriots,” the conference's main effect will be to lend powerful political cover to Communist China's favored European collaborator, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Prominent American conservative commentators are attending the conservative conference.

American conservatives find legitimate appeal in Orbán's focus on strong families, strong borders, and his skepticism of the European Union bureaucracy. But any American patriot should also judge very skeptically a leader who has sold out his country's sovereignty in supplication to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and in utterly groveling service to the Chinese Communist Party.

The facts are clear: Orbán's government has embraced vast amounts of Chinese investment, Chinese spying tools, and CCP-directed universities. In return for this Communist gold, Hungary acts as President Xi Jinping's primary servant in the EU. That service is priceless to Xi in that it greatly disrupts EU efforts to impose consequences on Beijing for its endemic espionage, vast export dumping, threats to EU politicians and member states, imperial ambitions in the Pacific, and its grotesque human rights abuses. So devoted is Orbán to Xi that he has even granted the Chinese intelligence services free rein to conduct aggressive surveillance operations on his soil, including against Americans.

CPAC doesn't appear to care much about this dynamic. Indeed, there is a very striking incongruence between what CPAC says about China at its events in Washington and what CPAC says about China at its events in Budapest. A CPAC panel event in Washington last year declared that the United States should guide its policy toward Beijing on a simple basis: “We Win, They Lose.” In contrast, CPAC will feature major addresses from Xi's top collaborators in Orbán's government.

Orbán will deliver the keynote address. As they listen, American conservatives should remember that while the prime minister pretends to be a friend to President Donald Trump, he perpetually undermines Trump's effort to check the aggression of America's greatest adversary. Orbán's pretense of American friendship represents an art form of hypocrisy. He says that China, not the U.S., “determines the course of world economic and world political processes.” Another major CPAC Budapest appearance will come via Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó.

Last year, Szijjártó publicly adopted the exact opposite approach to that of the Trump administration when he pledged to Beijing that he would “enhance cooperation efficiency, oppose protectionism and insist on resolving trade frictions through dialogue and consultation.” If this seems like shameless deference to Beijing's agenda, that's because it's supposed to be. As Szijjártó puts it, “We don't see China as a risk, but as a country with which cooperation offers us immense opportunities.”

NATO'S TROUBLING NEW ADDICTION TO DEFENSE SPENDING GIMMICKS

Explaining why CPAC Budapest 2025 matters, Miklós Szánthó, the head of the Hungarian government-aligned Center for Fundamental Rights, stated that “citizens defending their homeland cannot afford complacency. We have no choice but to resist — because Hungary is our homeland.” This must be news to the CCP. After all, Xi and his apparatchiks must surely revel in the ease with which Orbán has sold out his homeland to Beijing.

CPAC Budapest attendees will discuss nationalism and traditional values this week. But Xi will be enjoying himself the most. While their generous attendance honorariums might make them feel good, these Americans are lending cover to a primary ally of their nation's greatest adversary, one that is preparing to kill tens of thousands of Americans in a defining battle in the Pacific.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration has faced legal roadblocks that have complicated everything from the president's immigration agenda to his efforts to fire officials appointed by his predecessor in the executive branch, leading to the Justice Department pleading with the Supreme Court for help frequently since the start of President Donald Trump's second term.

The first plea from the Trump administration to the Supreme Court came in February, but since then an avalanche of lower court decisions has prompted the DOJ to seek a slew of orders and hearings from the nation's highest court. The high court's term will end in just over a month, but in the second half of that term, the justices have been inundated with requests from the Trump Justice Department seeking relief from judges that Trump and his allies say are overstepping their constitutional authority.

The high court has been the most responsive to challenges regarding Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. While the high court has not ruled on the merits of Trump's invocation of the law earlier this year, it has made several orders related to the lawsuits challenging the legislation's usage.

The first challenge to make its way to the high court in April led to the justices ruling that migrants subject to deportation must be given notice and allowed time to challenge their expulsion under the AEA.

Later in April, the high court blocked the deportations of a group of Venezuelans in North Texas through a late-night order, after multiple lower courts had not yet paused the deportations. The speed with which the Supreme Court issued the order blocking the deportations led to a blistering dissent from Justice Samuel Alito, who claimed his colleagues “hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.”

In May, the high court again paused the deportations of a group of Venezuelan nationals in the Lone Star State, sending the case back to the appeals court for a review of the merits of the case.

The question of the legality of Trump's use of the 1798 law, previously used primarily during wartime, is likely to make its way back to the Supreme Court, as lower courts consider whether Trump properly invoked the statute allowing for the speedy removal of foreign nationals. 

The Supreme Court added arguments over the Trump administration's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship late in the term, hearing oral arguments in May as part of its final arguments day for the 2024 term.

The high court consolidated multiple cases and heard arguments earlier this month in a case which could have ramifications for both the executive order changing the longstanding interpretation of constitutional language regarding citizenship and for district courts' ability to grant nationwide injunctions. The case was brought up to the Supreme Court after nationwide injunctions at lower court levels blocked the president's order.

The justices appeared uncertain in the oral arguments about how to remedy the sweeping use by district judges of nationwide injunctions, which could have a significant impact on the high court's emergency docket. The matter of nationwide injunctions took up more of the arguments than the question of revoking birthright citizenship itself.

Other major orders issued on the emergency docket by the Supreme Court in recent months have stemmed from the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the executive branch.

The high court, via its emergency docket, has paved the way for Trump to fire, at least for now, Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board, and has temporarily shielded the Department of Government Efficiency from being subject to discovery in a lawsuit about whether it is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

As the Trump administration continues to face losses and setbacks at the lower courts, the Justice Department will almost certainly continue petitioning the Supreme Court for action through its emergency docket.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Bongino says he found FBI room with hidden Comey-era evidence","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3425133/dan-bongino-fbi-room-hidden-james-comey-evidence/","Thu, 29 May 2025 15:09:29 GMT","

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino revealed on Thursday that evidence from former FBI Director James Comey's time at the agency was found, which he said was in a room “hidden from us.”

Bongino rebuked Comey while describing what the agency found, saying, “Wait till you read this stuff.” The deputy director noted that the room containing the information was “not mentioned” to him or FBI Director Kash Patel when taking over the agency.

“I wouldn't call it hidden, but hidden from us at least and not mentioned to us, and then we found stuff in there and a lot of it's from the Comey-era, and we are working our damndest right now to declassify,” Bongino said on Fox News's Fox & Friends. “And just so you know, because I get the public, I totally understand people saying, ‘Well, do it now.' The process is [that] not all information is ours to declassify; some is other intelligence agencies, it's not– we literally can't do it. Once that gets done and that gets out there, and you read some of the stuff, we found that, by the way, was not processed through the normal procedure, digitizing it, putting it in FBI records. We found it in bags hiding under Jim Comey's FBI, and you're going to be stunned!”

Bongino also directed specific criticism toward Comey, calling him “a disgrace to the badge” and “a big child” regarding his social media post earlier this month that shared a photo of seashells on the beach organized to read “8647.” Multiple officials in the Trump administration have deemed it a threat to President Donald Trump. Since Comey's social media post, Bongino said the FBI has “wasted countless man hours” running out the agency's tip line of people posting “8647” messages.

Amid the agency's work, Bongino pushed back against anyone claiming neither he nor Patel has taken action in the agency, suggesting these claims may be attempting to “breed mistrust.” He added that the FBI cannot simply “advertise” what it is working on, ranging from the 2023 discovery of cocaine in the White House to the release of a new video on Jeffrey Epstein just before he died in 2019.

“Just wait for the results,” Bongino said. “That's all I'm asking.”

Patel also said he would not rush the agency's investigation into Epstein, suggesting “it takes time to go through years of investigations.” He also reiterated his belief that Epstein killed himself.

Attorney General Pam Bondi released a “first phase” of Epstein files in late February, though it contained very little new information. She and other lawmakers have since pressed Patel and the FBI to deliver “the full and complete Epstein files.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A detailed system meant to keep pilots from flying when they need mental-health care may be leading them to avoid the help they need.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

An average person struggling with anxiety or depression might try behavioral therapy or medication, and then ideally get back to a stable, healthy life. But commercial pilots face a different calculation. When pilots seek out mental-health care, they risk disrupting their livelihoods, derailing their careers and sometimes their permission to fly.

Last year, the FAA convened a panel of experts to develop recommendations aimed at improving their system of medical reviews, intended to keep pilots who are suffering from severe mental distress out of the cockpit.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, The Atlantic's Jocelyn Frank reports on the detailed system that may be unintentionally leading pilots to avoid the care that they need, and increasing the risk to passenger safety.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin:  Plane crashes and aviation accidents happen for all kinds of reasons. The collision between the helicopter and the American Airlines flight near the D.C. airport, the Alaska Airlines flight where the door panel flew off shortly after takeoff—these terrifying incidents that make the news, they stick in our minds.

[Music]

Rosin:  But there's another, less-visible safety issue that doesn't really make the news. Pilots themselves have been raising the alarm about a different kind of risk to passenger safety and a risk to their own well-being. It involves a rule that's designed to protect passengers, but it might instead be making flying more dangerous.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Today our producer, Jocelyn Frank, is with us, with the story. Hi, Jocelyn.

Jocelyn Frank: Hi, Hanna. Thanks for having me.

Rosin: Sure. So you've been talking to pilots, and what have they been telling you?

Frank: Yeah, I recently interviewed quite a number of pilots, and one of them has really got me thinking differently about flight safety. His name is Chris Finlayson. He's been a pilot for 13 years. He's married and has two young daughters. And he's a first officer with one of the major airlines in the U.S. It's a job that comes with a lot of responsibility, a few flights every day. He's probably responsible for a few hundred people every time he shows up for work.

So when he got COVID, he had no hesitation about being grounded. He immediately stopped flying.

Chris Finlayson:  I got a really bad bout of long COVID: memory loss, brain fog, fatigue. That really tanked my serotonin. That all of a sudden triggered every anxiety I possibly had. December 19, 2021, was my last flight.

Frank: Even after most of his COVID symptoms subsided, his anxiety just kept going, and then he got anxiety about his anxiety.

Finlayson: And I remember sitting in my bed after a panic attack and just thinking I can't do this. And I remember going into the doctor's office in February of 2022 thinking that, frankly, I was throwing my career away.

Frank: For most people in a similar situation, having stress, anxiety, even panic attacks—it would lead them to try some behavioral therapy or medication, and then ideally, you just get back to a stable, typical, healthy life. But Chris Finlayson is a pilot, and for pilots there is a different calculation.

When pilots do seek out mental-health care, they risk derailing their careers, disrupting their livelihoods and, ultimately, sometimes their permission to fly. And if they don't seek help, they could be putting their lives and the lives of hundreds of passengers at risk.

David Kerley (ABC journalist): These haunting images are the first we've seen up close of the twisted metal and shattered debris—all that is left of Germanwings Flight 9525.

Frank: In 2015, there was a terrible crash—an airline called Germanwings—and it turned out that the co-pilot intentionally crashed the plane.

Kerley: The plane mysteriously crashed into the rugged French Alps, killing all 150 souls on board.

Frank: Even though it wasn't a U.S. airline, basically since then, the FAA has been trying to tighten their approach to mental health. They want to reduce any risk to passenger safety that is linked to any kind of serious mental-health challenge.

Thomas Jetzer: I think you have to understand that the FAA, from their perspective, is interested in helping people fly as long as they're safe for themselves and the public, and they intend us to get as many people flying as they can, safely.

Frank: Thomas Jetzer works as a medical consultant for the FAA. He's a certified AME, which stands for “aviation medical examiner.” He's one of hundreds of special doctors across the United States who meet with pilots on a yearly or on a six-month basis to review their medical records and decide if they're fit to fly, and he thinks it's a pretty good system.

Jetzer: Some of these pilots I've seen for 35, 40 years. And—

Frank: Every six months for that long?

Jetzer: Right, and it's kind of like a barbershop. You really get their full records to make sure that things are appropriately reported and assessed and documented for the FAA.  If you have a problem, they want to make sure that you're well-enough managed that you're not going to be a safety risk to yourself or the public.

Frank: Talking to Dr. Jetzer, I was trying to learn how the FAA system compares to others, because a pilot reporting a mental-health concern—even to a doctor they've known for 35 years—could halt their career. And Dr. Jetzer pointed out that the kind of scrutiny that he's responsible for, it's actually not even unique to pilots.

It's similar to other high-responsibility fields, like FBI agents, people who work within the nuclear industry, and even a part of his own field: medicine.

Jetzer: For doctors, I mean, there's a questionnaire you fill out, you know, every year when you reapply for your medical license that you have to determine whether you have any medical conditions.

Frank: But if I was a doctor and I went on antidepressants, I wouldn't need to report that I'm on antidepressants unless it was impacting my work, right?

Jetzer: Well, you're right. There's not as close an observation and review of doctors every, you know, six months or a year. There is for nuclear operators. You don't have it for police or firefighters.

[Music]

Rosin: Okay. So, Jocelyn, surgeons, police officers, firefighters—all these are also people responsible for the safety and well-being of hundreds of people. But they could each, theoretically, visit a therapist and keep it to themselves?

Frank: They could each, theoretically, visit a psychiatrist. They could be prescribed antianxiety medication and just kind of keep on with their jobs without having to report anything to a special doctor or to their boss, or to take time off. And this added layer of scrutiny for pilots—I mean, they are responsible for hundreds of people at a time, so the FAA wants to be as sure as they can that anyone who's in the cockpit is in a really healthy state of mind.

Rosin: Which totally makes sense that they want that. Like, you should be in a healthy state of mind if you are flying a plane. I guess my question is: Is this invasive amount of scrutiny from your employer or your boss encouraging a healthy state of mind? Or is it encouraging you to pretend that you have a healthy state of mind?

Frank: Yeah, it's a really good question, a really serious question. And I looked into the FAA safety systems in more detail, and it turns out that the processes that they have in place have led to some really terrible unintended consequences.

Rosin: Like what?

Frank: In the fall of 2021, an aviation student attending the University of North Dakota, he took his life in a university aircraft.

Reporter: 19-year-old John Hauser, a commercial-aviation student from Chicago, died near Buxton. The National Transportation Safety Board says there were no mechanical problems with the aircraft.

Frank: It was later discovered that he actually wrote a note revealing that he'd been struggling emotionally but he felt like he couldn't do anything about it because he feared losing his medical certificate. His mom actually read some of that letter out loud during a National Transportation Safety Board summit.

Anne Suh: In a letter describing the turmoil that John was silently facing, he wrote, “I want to seek help more than anything. I really do. I wanna get better. I just know if I try, I'll have to give up on aviation, and frankly, I'd rather not be here than to do that.”

Frank: Even though this was an awful tragedy, it thankfully didn't involve any passengers. But then there was another event.

Journalist: Just in to CNN: We are learning that an Alaska Airlines flight was diverted because someone in the cockpit, apparently, tried to shut down the engine mid-flight.

Frank: In the autumn of 2023, an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot was catching a ride on Horizon Air. It's a travel trick that's pretty common among pilots called “jump seating.” And this pilot—his name is Joseph Emerson—during that flight, he's accused of trying to activate a fire-suppression system that would've cut off fuel to the plane's engines in mid-flight.

Pilot: We've got the guy who tried to shut the engine down out of the cockpit.

Frank: Emerson was, luckily, not successful. He was escorted to the back of the plane, handcuffed to a seat.

Pilot: I think he's subdued. Other than that, yeah, we want law enforcement as soon as we get on the ground and parked.

Frank: The plane was rerouted to make an emergency landing.

Emerson later told reporters that he had been suffering from depression. And he pleaded not guilty to the charges that were brought against him. He wasn't piloting that day, but he did have access to the cockpit, and that means that his position, technically, as a pilot, put the safety of the plane and its passengers at risk.

So these are two pretty high-profile examples where people's lives were at stake, and in both cases, the pilots were not getting the care that they needed.

Rosin: Those are two scary, terrible situations. Do we have any idea if they are outliers? Like, how many pilots are not getting care when they need it?

Frank: I talked with William Hoffman. He's a neurologist and an aviation medical researcher, and he and his team have been trying to figure out how the FAA's protocols impact the decisions pilots are making about their health.

In 2019, Hoffman and his team launched a survey of over 3,500 pilots across North America, and he found that 56 percent of pilots reported a history of health-care avoidance due to fear of losing their flying status.

Rosin: So that's over half the pilots avoiding care, which is a lot. That suggests there is a huge resistance to getting care, which means that Finlayson, who's the guy we were talking about, he's unusual for going through the whole process and seeking care.

Frank: Well, at first, Finlayson thought he might not have to go through the full process. The way the FAA's system works is, basically: If you go on medication, and then you get off of it for 60 days, and your treating psychiatrist says, You're good, the FAA can consider this as all just a little health blip. You're grounded—you're not flying—for that period of time, no regular paycheck. But after, you can potentially get fairly smoothly back into your job. So Finlayson was hoping for that when he went to see a nurse practitioner, and he started taking a low-dose SSRI for his anxiety.

Finlayson: 10 milligrams—did that for about six months, tried to go off it. And, unfortunately, that didn't work.

Frank: He knew he couldn't stay off the medication and feel well enough to fly. If he stayed on medication, he'd have to pursue the longer path for his medical certificate. It's called “requesting a special issuance,” so even with that request, there's no guarantee the FAA would decide he could ever fly again. And he felt totally stuck.

Finlayson: And that's when my psychiatrist was like, Look—like, I get all this stuff, but we should really escalate you up to 20 [milligrams] just to see what happens, because there's nothing to lose at this point. That's when I really gave up. Like, Okay, I guess I'm just going to be on this drug, no matter what. So I am going to, no matter what, need the special issuance.

[Music] 

Frank: And once Finlayson sort of let go of the possibility of the fastest path back to his job—the fast path to that medical certificate—his health improved.

Finlayson: When I started that higher dosage of my SSRI, after about six weeks on that, I was like, Oh, this is—this is clarity! This is awesome. This is a good state to be in! I've maintained that ever since.

Frank: So Finlayson achieved this mental recovery, this clarity, but the path back to piloting was still extremely murky.

Finlayson: I didn't know how long it was potentially going to take, what exactly that cost was going to be, how I was going to pay for that if I wasn't going to be working, the lack of transparency involved with the FAA's processes—all of those things.

Frank: He was about to begin medical testing, paperwork, research, and bureaucratic phone calls, all to get the FAA to decide if he could get back into the air. And it took him years—years of not flying.

Rosin: I have to say, that seems amazing to me, that to go on 10 milligrams of a very commonly used antidepressant, or even to 20—which seems reasonable—that taking that amount of medication long term could cost you years of flying. It just seems like when pilots do decide to pursue mental-health care, like Finlayson did, they are up against a lot.

Frank: Yeah. It's a complicated system, and it can take a lot of time. Actually, Chris Finlayson had so much time away from piloting and so much time feeling frustrated as he was learning all this different information about the process, he joined a nonprofit focused on pilot mental health, trying to reform the system and at the same time he's in it, trying to get his own permission to fly approved.

Rosin: After the break, we try and get to the heart of it: Is this system actually keeping passengers safe?

[Break]

Rosin: Jocelyn, let's say we make the assumption that pilots have more or less the same level of depression and anxiety as the average population—that would be about a quarter of all adults in the U.S. From what you can tell, are a quarter of all pilots seeking mental-health care applying for those special medical certificates?

Frank: Definitely not. In 2024, out of 150,000 commercial pilots, only about 9,000 applied. And in the end, only about 3,000 were approved.

So Finlayson was hoping to be one of those 3,000. He and his doctors decided he needed to take this antianxiety medication long term, which meant he was going to have to enter into this longer process. And it became clear this was going to be a really detailed and, at times, tedious process. According to the FAA, a lot of people get denied for failing to provide some specific requested information. It actually accounts for more than 75 percent of all denials. And from the start, Chris Finlayson was feeling that potential. He would think he'd checked a box, only to learn it was the wrong box.

Finlayson: Oh, the other requirement is to be evaluated by a board-certified psychiatrist. The psychiatrist that I was seeing, she was a nurse practitioner. That wasn't at the level for which the FAA would require. So I then had to search out an M.D.

Frank: And that took an additional month. He had to be on a stable dose for six months before beginning his application, and that switch in care meant he had to start the six-month count again, and he learned there were additional requirements.

Finlayson: I had to go through a cognitive screening, a personality screening, as well as an interview by a neuropsychologist.

Frank: Each of these tests has a cost, and each has to be submitted to the special FAA doctor for review.

Finlayson: I also had to go through neurological testing.

Frank: What is that like?

Finlayson: Oh, it is boring. It is paying about $4,000 out of pocket to play—oh, what's the app on the phone? It's basically like paying $4,000 to play [Lumosity] while a doctor stares over your shoulder.

That's all elective testing. None of that is covered by insurance, so it's all out of pocket.

Frank: You use the word elective, but it's required for you to come back to flying, right?

Finlayson: So yeah. So in the FAA world, it is absolutely required. It is a requirement for me to get a medical [screening]. It is a requirement to have a medical to do my job. “Requirement, requirement, requirement.” In insurance land, I do not need to be a pilot. This is not medically necessary for my health. It is medically necessary for my employment.

Rosin:  So it seems like these medical requirements cost a lot of money, and the pilot isn't earning a regular salary.

Frank: Right. Yeah. This process can cost thousands of dollars, somewhere around $10,000 or $15,000 for most pilots. And like Finlayson was saying, it's uncommon for insurance to cover these kinds of expenses. And only a very small percentage of unionized pilots flying with legacy carriers—which are, those are some of the biggest ones—they have negotiated for this process to fall under their disability coverage. And that can offer pilots like Finlayson a partial paycheck—a partial paycheck to support two kids and a wife in grad school.

But that is a best-case scenario. And many other pilots and aspiring pilots who I interviewed for this story have had no stable income and no safety net during their process.

Rosin:  No income?

Frank: They are grounded from flying, or they haven't received their pilot's license to begin with, so they're not getting any kind of base-level paycheck while they're going through this process. And aviation is a very expensive field to begin with. A lot of pilots take on substantial debt just to get trained, so this is what they're dealing with while trying to get this special medical certificate.

Rosin: So that is, like, a huge disincentive to seek any help.

Frank:  Absolutely. Yeah. It can take years to just gather all of your medical records and get all the paperwork organized and the testing. And once a pilot and their AME do submit the request, the documents can take months and months for the FAA to actually review. And that's a lot of time for a pilot to be waiting around—on disability, at best; more often, unemployed. And I have to say, with recent cuts to federal staffing at the FAA, it's unlikely that this process is going to get any more efficient.

Rosin: You know, Jocelyn, listening to you, I am a little torn. I fly often enough. I'm not a particularly nervous flyer. I'm not sure if I should be worried about my safety. Like, is there any research that gets at the bottom line, the actual outcome of this system they've set up? Does this system, flawed though it may be, result in me, the passenger, being any safer?

Frank: It's seems pretty clear from those terrible suicide-type flights that we do not want a pilot in the pilot's seat who is suffering that kind of intense, untreated mental-health problem. It definitely adds risk to passenger safety.

I asked William Hoffman, that researcher, what we know about having mental-health problems that you're treating, that you're addressing, or something that was on your record from the past. What do we know about how that impacts risk? And here's what he told me:

William Hoffman: Right now, there is this simple model that using services, mental-health services, or having a diagnosis is a marker for risk. But remarkably, that has never been systematically studied in research. That's a complete assumption.

Rosin: So that is a big assumption.

Frank: Yes. And an assumption that is costing Chris Finlayson, and thousands of other pilots, multiple years away from their careers.

But it's nearly impossible to get pilots to raise their hands and say, Hey. I'll participate in your research! I should probably be seeing a therapist. Or, Hey. I'm secretly taking mental-health medication, so study me. Check my flight records and see how well I'm doing, or, Calculate all the small mistakes I'm making compared to this other pilot, so we can figure out if my mental-health issues are actually a problem when it comes to flight safety. No one is volunteering for that kind of scrutiny, partially because doing so would mean admitting they had not been fully honest about their health prior to that kind of study.

Hoffman: It's a catch-22. We need data to drive progress, but people are afraid to participate in research, so we can't get that data.

Rosin:  Okay, so if they can't get the data and they don't actually know the answer, what can be done about any of this?

Frank: Even if we don't know exactly how risky it is to fly with this current system, we do know that the current system is keeping pilots from seeking care, and that is a part of the system where risk could be reduced.

One of the reasons I wanted to look into this story is because the FAA did recently request recommendations from a panel of experts about how to address that problem. Hoffman was one of them. The group delivered 24 suggestions to lower the barriers to mental-health access, and they presented these suggestions to the FAA last year, in April of 2024, and a few were acted on really quickly.

Hoffman: For example, expanding the number of medications that can be used. So that was almost immediately implemented.

Frank: The total is now eight different drugs, but they are conditionally allowed, which means you would still need to request a special medical certificate, and it might be granted, but it's not guaranteed.

Hoffman: They also narrowed some of the requirements for neuropsychological testing that a pilot might need to undergo if they are on a medication for mood.

Frank: So if a pilot like Chris Finlayson were to begin this medical screening again, he might have fewer tests to go through in order to request this special medical certificate. And the committee recommended a bunch of other aspects of the process be changed too. They asked the FAA to modernize the system to reduce paperwork, to improve training for the doctors who are reviewing all these medical records for more consistency, wider disability coverage so pilots could maybe be covered more often. And Hoffman was excited about another recommendation too.

Hoffman: One of the key recommendations was requiring that pilots have access to peer-support services.

Frank: Peer support basically allows pilots the opportunity to talk with each other about sensitive issues that are going on in their lives.

Rosin: So more like an informal counseling setup?

Frank: Yes. I asked William Hoffman why he was so excited about peer support.

Hoffman: Peer support does not need to be disclosed to an AME.

Frank: So why not just promote therapy? It seems like dancing around the idea that people actually could benefit from therapy or could benefit from medication, but instead, saying, Go talk to a peer, or, you know, Do this other back-channel thing, and you don't have to report it.

Hoffman: It's a great question. It's a critical question. While in a perfect world, you know, we could say, Therapy is not reportable, and you should talk to a therapist, I think more realistically, where the rubber meets the road is that there's a lot of distrust, and the pilot peer can be that connection between the pilot needing services and the professional support that's required.

[Music]

Frank: Chris Finlayson decided to go through the process of requesting the special medical certificate. He, like I said, had his last flight on December 19, 2021. He went through all of these different steps that took him almost two years. He submitted his paperwork, and about eight months after that, in July 2024. He heard back.

Finlayson: The woman just said, “Yep, you were denied.”

Frank: Oh my gosh.

Finlayson: I was like, “What?”

I actually requested my full file from the FAA with the application notes and things that they normally don't send you. They see me as in remission, but I need to check more boxes, essentially.

That's probably the most frustrating thing for me right now, is the fact that I kind of got hosed, and now there's no recourse other than to start it all over, so—

Frank: Can you go back as many times as you want? Like, as many times as you can afford/endure?

Finlayson: Yep. Basically, I'm having to restart the whole process.

So I have to wait on the FAA to send them my paperwork. I have to wait on my other doctors to send them paperwork. I have to wait on all that stuff for them to compile that. I'm probably going to have to redo some testing because, you know, the FAA is not going to want to see a test that's a year and a half old. I'm in for the long haul, to say the least.

Frank: Last year, the FAA approved 2,800 special-issuance certificates coded for mental health. As of this April, they've already approved almost that number: 2,400. But if the system continues as is, it's likely that thousands of pilots will go on flying without getting, or reporting, the care that they need.

Rosin:  Jocelyn, thank you.

Frank: Thank you.

Congress, not the executive branch, has the power to enact tariffs.

The debate over President Donald Trump's tariffs often focuses on whether they are prudent. Defenders insist that Trump's tariffs will help make America great again and boost national security. Critics counter that they'll wreck the economy. But the strongest argument against the tariffs is actually that they are unlawful. Neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose what he ordered.

Now, months after sticklers for the rule of law began making that argument, it has finally been vindicated: Yesterday, the United States Court of International Trade, the federal court with jurisdiction over civil actions related to tariffs, struck down almost all of Trump's tariffs in a 49-page ruling. The decision includes a detailed discussion of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the 1977 law delegating increased power over trade to the president during national emergencies, which the White House had cited to support its moves. It concludes that the law does not authorize any of Trump's tariff orders.

Administration officials quickly challenged the ruling's legitimacy. “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. “The judicial coup is out of control,” Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on social media. But their objections are dubious, not because the judiciary never overreaches, but because at least three features of this dispute make the argument for judicial overreach here especially weak.

David Frum: The ultimate bait and switch of Trump's tariffs

First, the Constitution is clear: Article I delegates the tariff power to Congress, and Article II fails to vest that power in the presidency. So the Trump administration begins from a weak position. And the court's ruling did not arrogate the tariff power to the judiciary, which might have warranted describing it as “a judicial coup.” It merely affirmed Congress's power over tariffs. Americans need not fear a judicial dictatorship here. Congress can do whatever it likes. Indeed, it could pass a law reinstating all of Trump's tariffs today without violating the court's ruling. But Congress is extremely unlikely to do so, in part because Trump's tariff policy clearly lacks public support; for example, a recent poll found that 63 percent of Americans disapprove of it.

Second, the plaintiffs in this particular lawsuit include the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Vermont––all democratically accountable entities in a federal system where states are meant to act as a check on unlawful exercises of federal power. All of those states asked the court to rule in this manner to vindicate their rights under the law. As Oregon's attorney general put it, “We brought this case because the Constitution doesn't give any president unchecked authority to upend the economy.” States controlled by both Republicans and Democrats routinely file lawsuits asking the judiciary to strike down purportedly unlawful actions by the president. There is bipartisan consensus that such judicial review is legitimate, not couplike, and such rulings have constrained presidents from both parties.

Rogé Karma: The impossible plight of the pro-tariff liberals

Third, when Congress created the Court of International Trade and later defined its jurisdiction, its precise intent was to create an arm of the judiciary that would exercise authority over trade disputes. Congress made a deliberate choice to alter an earlier law vesting that power in the Treasury Department, under the executive branch, and deliberately vested it in a court instead. To quote from the 1980 law that defined its powers, “The Court of International Trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the United States, its agencies, or its officers, that arises out of any law of the United States providing for tariffs.” Policing whether or not a tariff complies with the law and the Constitution is central, not peripheral, to the court's ambit.

If the Trump administration kept its criticism of the judiciary to edge cases, where there is real doubt about how the Constitution separates powers, it could plausibly claim to be engaged in the sort of dispute that is inevitable when branches of the federal government are checking one another as intended. That it seeks to delegitimize even this ruling suggests contempt for any check on the power of the presidency, not principled opposition to judicial overreach.

The Constitution explicitly vests the tariff power in Congress, and wisely so: Empowering one person to impose taxes and pick economic winners and losers tends toward corruption and dictatorship. Going forward, Congress should set tariff policy itself, and impeach any president who tries to usurp its authority.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Many American adults hesitate to correct strangers' children in public. I wish it weren't so.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

On a trip to Prague a couple of years ago, my family piled into a rapidly filling metro car, and I wound up sitting next to my 6-year-old daughter, while her 4-year-old sister sat directly across from us, on her own. At one point, my youngest pulled a knee up to her chest and rested her foot on the seat. Almost immediately, a woman sitting next to her, who looked to be about 70, reached out and gently touched my daughter's foot, signaling her to put it down. My daughter was surprised, maybe a little embarrassed. But she understood and quickly obeyed.

For a split second, I wondered if I ought to feel chastised: Perhaps the woman was judging me for having failed at some basic parental duty. But something about the matter-of-fact, almost automatic way the woman had intervened reassured me that she wasn't thinking much about me at all. She was just going through the motions of an ordinary day on the train, in which reminding a child not to put her foot on the seat was a perfectly natural gesture.

Ultimately, I was grateful for the woman's tap on my daughter's foot. But the exchange also felt foreign. In my experience, that sort of instruction, from a random adult to a stranger's child, isn't much of a thing in America (or, for what it's worth, in the United Kingdom, where I currently live). Many people don't seem to think they have the authority to instruct, let alone touch, a kid who isn't theirs. They tend to leave it to the parent to manage a child's behavior—or they may silently fume when the parent doesn't step up.

To informally test that assumption, I created a short online survey and ended up interacting with a dozen people from around the United States. Some were parents; some were not. Every single one said that outside certain situations—where they were familiar with a kid's parents, or where a child's safety was in question—they would hesitate before telling someone else's kid what to do, for fear of upsetting the parent. Marty Sullivan, a technology consultant based in Tennessee, gave a representative answer: “Generally I'd prefer to avoid risking escalation.”

These responses struck me as a bit of a shame, because the exchange between my daughter and the woman in Prague seemed to reflect something altogether good. And I know I can't be alone in that thought: Both historical precedent and cultural norms in other parts of the world reinforce the idea that a stranger's meddling in the disciplining of children can have significant merits.

The highly individualistic approach to managing kids' behavior in public is particularly American—and a historical anomaly. David Lancy, an anthropologist and a professor emeritus at Utah State University, wrote to me that for the majority of human existence, it was unquestionable that “‘the whole village' participates” in child-rearing. “Siblings, peers, aunts, grandmas,” he told me, “all have distinct roles, including ‘correcting.'”

When I asked Steven Mintz, a historian of families and childhood at the University of Texas at Austin, whether child-rearing in the United States, specifically, had ever involved a more collective approach, he seemed almost tickled: “Did it ever!” he wrote back. He recalled that during his own childhood, in the 1950s, he was “constantly corrected” by people other than his parents for his poor posture, hygiene, grooming, and language. Child-rearing into the first half of the 20th century was, he noted, “far more of a communal and public endeavor”—an approach that entailed a fair amount of what would, by contemporary standards, probably be considered intrusion. “Neighbors, teachers, shopkeepers, and even strangers on the street,” Mintz wrote, “felt empowered, and often morally obligated, to correct a child's misbehavior, scold a lack of manners, break up a fight, or escort a wandering child back home.”

Today, this sort of “village style” oversight remains a norm in some pockets of the United States. Michelle Peters, a project manager in El Paso, Texas, whose family has roots in Mexico, told me that she has seen communities in both the U.S. and Mexico take a more collective approach to child-rearing. “It is more common and more acceptable for adults to correct children who are not their own,” she said, and people feel “a greater sense of social intimacy and immediacy,” which extends to caregiving in public settings. Yet in much of the United States, Mintz told me, the collective has given way to a “privatized and protected model of parenting.”

As in other aspects of parenthood, that closed-off approach gives parents more control but also puts them under more pressure. If you're the sole arbiter of your child's public behavior, you have to keep a pretty close eye on your kid at all times. That sense of responsibility can also produce anxiety: Rather than just parenting as I see fit, I often find myself guessing—and second-guessing—whether my kids are bothering people or violating some unspoken rule. (Is my daughter standing way too close to that guy? Does that shopkeeper mind that my kid is flipping through their magazines?) Amy Banta, a mom of three in Salt Lake City, told me that this is one reason she really appreciates it when other people step in to correct her kids. “I cannot anticipate your every boundary that my child might possibly cross,” she said. “You're gonna have to help me out.”

If the goal is to steadily acquaint children with the conventions of polite society, it isn't clear that filtering all guidance through parents is the most effective approach. For one thing, kids are smart. A child who knows that his parent or other caregiver is the only one who will ever correct him might reasonably conclude that he can get up to no good whenever that adult turns away. What's more, I have found that a stranger's gentle intervention—as opposed to my nagging—can be a more effective means of conveying to my kids that the people around them are real people, with their own needs, whose space and comfort one ought to respect. Another adult's nudging can function as a kind of “social proof,” as Banta put it—a reinforcement of the lessons a parent is trying to impart.

Banta told me about a time when she took her then-5-year-old to a community-theater performance and he struggled to sit still. “I kept telling him that he couldn't wiggle in his seat, because he was shaking the whole row,” Banta recalled, but “he didn't want to listen to me, because he was having so much fun bouncing.” At intermission, another woman in the row asked Banta's son to stop shaking the seats so much. “I looked at my son and said, ‘See? It's not just me,'” Banta told me. He was far more mindful of his movements during the second act, periodically checking to see if he was bothering the woman down the row—who gave him a big thumbs-up after the show ended.

The collective approach to correcting kids' behavior can have its drawbacks, of course. Plenty of people have truly unreasonable expectations about the way kids should act in public. Miranda Rake, a writer and mother of two in Oregon, told me that she thinks tolerance for ordinary kid behavior in much of America is too low. Even in Portland, which she considers quite laid back, she “gets the stink eye” in many places and feels like she's “on eggshells in a lot of coffee shops and certainly restaurants,” she said. “There just isn't a culture of community around kids here.” In her view, that complicates the question of whether interventions from nonparents would make the environment more or less family friendly.

Rake's concern is not entirely unfounded. In the United States, collective supervision of children has typically coincided with community norms that “could be rigid or exclusionary,” Mintz told me, “and the authority of adults could at times be authoritarian or abusive.” Meanwhile, in many modern societies outside America, tolerance for childlike unruliness is part and parcel of the more communal approach to raising kids. (That was also the norm for most of our evolutionary past, Sarah B. Hrdy, an anthropologist who has extensively studied child-rearing dynamics in traditional hunter-gatherer societies, told me. Where instruction does occur in such cultures, it tends to involve subtle, often nonverbal guidance—of the sort I encountered in Prague—rather than scolding or censure.)

Read: Is it wrong to tell kids to apologize?

The challenge of balancing tolerance and discipline aside, both Hrdy and Mintz observed that in many ways, American society is simply not set up for a thriving culture of community oversight. Where such a culture once existed, it was propped up by various forms of social infrastructure—the kind that has been steadily hollowed out over the past several decades, Mintz told me. American neighborhoods used to be more tightly knit. A lower proportion of mothers were employed outside the home, which meant that neighborhoods were filled with adults during the day who could keep an eye on one another's children. A strongly ingrained cultural respect for adult authority meant that “few questioned a neighbor's right to reprimand a child for rudeness or risk-taking behavior,” Mintz said, and the potential personal risks (legal or otherwise) of disciplining a child not your own were fewer: “Adults could discipline, correct, or even physically intervene without fear of being sued, shamed, or filmed.”

In an era when fewer people know or interact with their neighbors, and social trust has waned, the thought of reviving collective child-rearing norms may seem a little far-fetched. And yet, the Americans I spoke with seemed, on the whole, largely open to being a bit more direct with other people's kids—if only they could have assurance that such involvement would be welcome. I'll come out and say it: I would certainly welcome it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A new book reveals how health-care inequality fueled the spread of anti-science conspiracy theories.

For many Americans, health care is something to be dreaded and deferred—a source of pain, wasted time, or financial hardship. For luckier Americans, it could mean curling up on an exam table in a med spa and receiving a “gravity” colonic. Amy Larocca's new book about the wellness industry, How to Be Well: Navigating Our Self-Care Epidemic, One Dubious Cure at a Time, opens with the author undergoing exactly this procedure, against doctor's orders. The water forced into her colon will, she writes, discharge toxins, and the result will “change my life, provide perspective and purpose and a near-ecstatic lightness of being.”

Larocca, a reporter who spent two decades covering fashion for New York magazine, is being somewhat facetious. But only somewhat. She can't deny being a willing participant as well as a skeptic, and she's far from the only woman who has chased the idea of being not just healthy but well—a state she describes as the new “feminine ideal.” Wellness is a $6.3 trillion industry, according to a 2024 report from the Global Wellness Institute, an industry trade group. That's bigger than the GDP of Germany, and nearly four times the size of the global pharmaceutical industry. The real growth has been within the past 10 years—the GWI's report calls it the “wellness decade.” And women represent most of its consumers.

In a nation known for its relatively poor health, nearly everybody seems to be thinking about how to be healthy: According to a 2024 report from McKinsey, 82 percent of U.S. consumers consider wellness to be a “top or important priority in their everyday lives,” and 58 percent said they were prioritizing wellness more than they had the previous year.

Another year on, even more has changed. With Donald Trump's appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of Health and Human Services, the ethos of wellness has been incorporated into the “Make America healthy again” movement, a cause marked by extreme skepticism about conventional medicine (including vaccines) and extreme openness to purported alternative cures. MAHA reached a new apotheosis this month with Trump's nomination of the wellness influencer Casey Means for surgeon general. Means graduated from medical school but does not have an active medical license, having dropped out of her surgical residency because she “saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is,” as she wrote on her website. Although she's expressed skepticism about the national vaccine schedule for children, some MAHA adherents are worried that she's not anti-vax enough. If confirmed, she will join Mehmet Oz within the broader ranks of HHS; before being tapped to lead the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he was a celebrity physician and daytime TV host with a history of espousing unreliable medical advice. Mainstream medicine may have good reason to frown on these government officials, but their rise to power is explicable: Americans are exhausted from navigating a health-care system so costly and inconvenient that it has sent many of them scrambling for alternatives.

Read: The wellness women are on the march

MAHA is such a young movement that Larocca's book couldn't be expected to account for it. But the author deftly transcribes the writing on the wall. Wellness culture spread “like a rash,” she writes, showing up in the places you might expect—The White Lotus, the influencers selling detoxes to Los Angeles wildfire victims—and the places you wouldn't. The Financial Times, for example, recently published an article on the scientifically challenged practice of somatic “tapping,” under a vertical titled “Adventures in Woo-Woo.” Art in America's recent “Spring Wellness Issue” features a story about Marina Abramović's rebirth as an alternative healer. (The 78-year-old artist hawks “longevity drops” for roughly $130.) And good luck attending a wedding free of woo-woo this summer: An event planner told The New York Times last month that about 75 percent of the weddings she organizes contain a “wellness element”—sound baths, beach yoga, or “spiritual-growth sessions,” for example. The well women overtook the fashion world long ago: While researching this article, I received an invitation from the designer Maria Cornejo for a gathering at her downtown boutique. She was promoting not her latest collection but a new book on longevity. “Ayurvedic mocktails” were promised.

How to Be Well sets out to capture the depth and breadth of the wellness invasion—its fads, its legitimate practices, and its so-called cures. Larocca details the impressive variety of forms wellness can take: ingesting supposedly magical super-ingredients (ashwagandha, matcha, hyperlocal honey), chasing spiritual highs from fitness classes (SoulCycle, Peloton), or attending a $1,000 wellness-focused “traveling road show” from Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's health company, valued several years ago at $250 million.

There is something old and something new in this welter of products and practices. Even as the movement repackages traditional practices from China and India, it also promises better health through data collection, biohacking, and at its most extreme end, the Silicon Valley cult of longevity advanced by Peter Thiel and others. Larocca homes in on the often-caricatured type of the Lululemon-wearing, Pilates-toned girlie—“hopped up on her plant-based diet and elaborate adaptogen regimen”—whom she got to know well during her years writing about the fashion world. But she also devotes space to its advocates on the far right, including the conspiracist news site Infowars, which shills some supplements containing the same on-trend ingredient—ashwagandha root—that features in products sold by many mainstream wellness companies, including the Los Angeles hippie-chic brand Moon Juice.

The nomination of Means represents a merger between these anti-establishment forces on the left and the right. MAHA is generally associated with its own version of health and wellness—downvoting vaccines, seed oils, and hormonal birth control while promoting ideas ranging from the basic or commonsense (wholesome school lunches and preventive medicine, good; pesticides and microplastics, bad) to the dubious or risky (raw-dairy consumption, skipping shots, eschewing fluoride). Under Trump, MAHA's big tent draws in snake-oil salespeople alongside skeptics, paranoiacs, and ideologues. Uniting them is a deep disdain for the health-care industry. After critics pointed out that Means never finished her medical residency, Kennedy replied on X, “Casey is the perfect choice for Surgeon General precisely because she left the traditional medical system—not in spite of it.” Larocca asks: “Is wellness just consumerism, or is it a new politics, a new religion?” Perhaps it is all three.

If MAHA is a religion, it represents a kind of prosperity gospel in a country where access to health care is often determined by wealth. “Good health in America has been elevated as a luxury commodity as opposed to a fundamental right,” Larocca writes. The average American, she notes, spends just 19 minutes a year talking with a primary-care physician. Meanwhile, the average member of Parsley Health—a “direct primary care” health-and-wellness clinic whose standard membership costs $225 a month without insurance—spends at least 200 minutes a year being listened to. In short: To get that kind of attention from a doctor, you'll have to pay dearly for it.

Read: America can't break its wellness habit

Nearly a third of Americans don't have adequate access to primary-care services, including regular checkups, a 2023 PBS News report found. And 40 percent of adults reported that they were delaying or forgoing doctor visits because of high costs. More than a third of all U.S. counties are “maternity care deserts,” lacking a single obstetrician or birthing facility. The country spends more than twice as much money on health care as other high-income nations, with worse outcomes: 40 percent of Americans are obese, and six in 10 adults have a chronic illness.

For both the affluent and the aspirational customer, wellness seems to hold the promise of bridging a gap in medical care. The cost of wellness products and services has a very high ceiling, but the barrier to entry is low—almost anyone can purchase a $38 jar of adaptogenic “dust” that claims to improve your mood, and that option is much easier than bushwhacking your way toward finding a therapist who takes insurance. But most alternative cures are no more affordable than conventional medicine. Neither are members-only urgent-care practices that come with wellness bells and whistles. Sollis Health, for example, promises an average wait time of three and a half minutes or less—if you can pay its annual fee of at least $4,000.

The wellness industry and the MAHA movement may draw from different political cultures, but they both operate from a place of fear: We can't control skyrocketing infections or health costs, but we can try to manage—or at least tinker with—how we feel inside our bodies. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, “taking care of yourself was going to be the only way to get through our terrifying new world,” Larocca writes.

Particularly attracted to wellness's promises are women and people with chronic illnesses (also often women), Larocca writes, in part because the concerns of both groups have historically been played down by doctors. I find much truth in this argument, as many of my own forays into wellness have followed unsuccessful attempts to treat various ailments through the modern medical system. After years of visits with doctors to manage my migraines (none would prescribe one of the many available migraine medications; one suggested that I visit the ER if things “got really bad”), I found the solution in acupuncture and an individualized prescription for herbs. This successfully treated both the headaches and the joint pain roundly waved off by my rheumatologist. But the cure was costly: The herbs set me back $200 a month, the acupuncture $175 an hour—and you can imagine how much of this was covered by insurance.

Larocca does a good job of both explaining the wellness industry and ferreting out its scammier corners—the way that, for example, a variety of cleanses, clean-eating programs, and fasts are almost indecipherable from disordered eating. But she doesn't quite answer the bigger question: What are we owed in terms of our health? How much of it is our responsibility, as consumers, and how much can be laid at the feet of a government that has failed to create wide-scale solutions?

Read: How did healing ourselves get so exhausting?

That depends on whom you ask. The wellness industry views health as an individual pursuit, one that requires us to be model consumers and do the work necessary to recognize which goods and services to pay for. MAHA, meanwhile, seems to want to use the top-down power of legislation to mandate nutrition-labeling reform, limit the use of pesticides in our food system, create stricter rules for vaccine development, and call for the removal of toxins (however the government defines them) from the environment. (So far in his tenure, RFK Jr. has focused on redundancies at HHS, slashing thousands of jobs.)

But other messaging suggests that MAHA prefers to shift the burden onto the individual, too. “Once Americans are getting good science and allowed to make their own choices, they're going to get a lot healthier,” RFK Jr. said in a November interview with NBC. So maybe we're on our own, either way, when it comes to curing what ails us.

Finally, you might be wondering: Does any of the stuff detailed in the book actually work? In her conclusion, Larocca, who has subjected herself to more wellness treatments than can be listed here, points to the solutions we already know: hydrate, sleep, exercise, eat plants instead of processed foods, seek out “the best medical care you can manage.” (Hah.) She doesn't recommend a single product, practice, or service, although she does name one tip that helped her. Spoiler alert: It's a simple breathing exercise. And it's free.

An elderly president's physicians should press him to think through hard questions about his health.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

In contrast to his aging predecessor, President Trump appears robust and energetic. Yet, like Joe Biden, Donald Trump is an elderly man, and he will become the oldest sitting president in U.S. history by the end of his second term. In light of recent revelations about Biden's declining health, as a doctor and an expert in aging, I have been thinking about the responsibilities of Trump's doctors to him and to the American public. If the way we care for elderly people is distinct because their bodies and risks are distinct, perhaps the care of an elderly president should be, too.



Presidents are getting older—which is to be expected, given the doubling of the average human lifespan across the 20th century. As we age, the likelihood of disease goes up significantly each decade (which makes sense because human mortality is holding steady at 100 percent). An elevated risk of disease shouldn't exclude a person from any job—even one as important as the U.S. presidency—but in elderhood, certain diseases become more prevalent, such as heart disease and cancer, the leading causes of death for adults. After age 70, a person is also at increased risk for one or more health conditions in a category unique to old age, the so-called geriatric syndromes, which include cognitive impairment, functional decline, falls, and frailty.



On the surface, Trump seems stronger and less vulnerable than Biden did. Yet looks do not necessarily reflect risk for illness and disability. A hallmark of advanced age is its variability: One person may be physically powerful but have dementia; another might have hearing loss but no cognitive changes; a third could have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol—physiologic time bombs that increase a person's risk of major events such as heart attacks, strokes, and death.



And Donald Trump has lived in a way that raises his risk for heart and other serious diseases as he ages. For years, he has been overweight or obese, as measured by his BMI—which doesn't distinguish between lean, muscular weight, and fat, meaning he is likely even less healthy than his abnormal BMI suggests. His gait, though better than Biden's, demonstrates the same weakness of many lower extremity muscle groups, and his history of eschewing formal, particularly muscle-building, exercise means that his risk for falls and frailty is increasing more quickly than they would with resistance and balance training—recent signs that he might be adopting healthier habits notwithstanding. Equally important, fat on a body indicates fat in and around the body's critical organs and blood vessels, including the brain and heart.



To truly understand our current president's health, as a doctor I would want to know and follow not just his BMI but also his percentages of fat and muscle, and to track his strength, hand grip, and walking speed. His doctors should be discussing those predictive measures with him, as well as the negative effects his lifestyle might have on his heart health and cancer risk.



That would be true for any older patient, but the president's crucial role may well change which additional tests his doctors should consider. For example, routine screening for prostate cancer—which Biden reportedly did not undergo—is not recommended for men over age 70 because most, even if they develop prostate cancer, will die of something else. But these tests might make sense for a president over age 70 because the risks of a serious form of the cancer would affect not just the man but the country and the wider world. Other tests that fall into this category might include functional heart and brain scans, additional cancer screenings beyond usual age cutoffs, and certain biomarkers.



More aggressive screening would still have trade-offs for both the president and the nation. It could subject the president to unnecessary procedures and psychological stress. Opponents might use even a clinically insignificant diagnosis to their advantage. But more aggressive screening might also enable earlier diagnosis or, if a potentially disabling or lethal condition is found, succession planning.



Because the risk of adverse health events increases throughout the last third of life, we geriatricians recommend discussing what's known as “goals of care” with each patient—to get a sense of their values and their fears. We ask about what matters most to them in their life, which situations seem worth some suffering and which do not, and how they have handled and experienced past health events. Programs proven to help people clarify their priorities and plan ahead can help patients, families, and doctors choose a course most consistent with their values and goals.



For a president, such conversations are even more essential. First, they could help the president, as an individual, think through how to separate political pressures from personal needs and family responsibilities. Second, having a plan that protects the country should be a core responsibility for anyone in high office, and an elderly president in particular should think ahead of time about how to best serve the United States in the event of a majorly debilitating health event or general decline.



Goals-of-care conversations are difficult for some people—and some doctors. If Trump's doctors are not skilled at this sort of conversation, they should engage a consultant who is able to push him to reflect on how his answers to these questions would affect his ability to do his job, or the functioning of the country. Just as it's the president's responsibility to answer these difficult questions, so too is it his doctors' responsibility to pose them.  When asked to comment, the White House did not address questions about Trump's risk, mitigation strategies, or contingency planning, but Liz Huston, a spokesperson, said over email that Trump “receives the highest-quality medical care” from his doctors and “is in great health as evidenced by the results of his comprehensive annual physical exam.” (Huston also said the White House was not going to accept the unsolicited advice of “an activist Democrat doctor,” referencing a 2023 article on aging politicians in which I wrote, based on what reporters had told me, that journalists decades younger than Nancy Pelosi had trouble keeping up with her.)



Trump's physicians face another challenge that most clinicians do not: Which information about their patient's health should they share with the public? In both Trump terms, many physicians have struggled to believe the information provided by the president's medical team and have suspected that his risks are being substantially downplayed. And now we know the problem exists in both major political parties. Biden's team seemingly withheld information that would have made clear that he did not have the physical or cognitive ability to govern for a second term. Surely, with such high stakes, the president's health is an exception to the usual rules of patient privacy. When a person signs up for “public office,” by definition they forfeit some of the privacy protections the rest of us are entitled to by law. Their health and ability to do their job affect hundreds of millions of lives.



The U.S. could consider imposing a maximum age limit on the presidency. But that one-size-fits-all approach risks eliminating potentially fit and favored candidates. In its absence, the person leading the country should receive station-specific, evidence-based, and person-centered care—that attends to their role, medical conditions, functional abilities, and preferences. And the American public deserves transparency about the president's health.

When animal cruelty trumps capitalism.

by  Eric Levitz

Conservatives want the government to dictate what you can and cannot eat. Or so Republican policymaking increasingly suggests.

Earlier this month, Montana and Nebraska became the latest US states to ban lab-grown meat (also known as “cellular meat” or “cultivated meat”). Unlike plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger, lab-grown meat consists of actual animal tissue, but made without slaughtering animals. Instead, scientists take a sample of animal cells and feed them amino acids, salts, vitamins, and other nutrients until they grow into edible beef, pork, or poultry.

This technology isn't yet commercially viable. You can't buy cellular meat at a grocery store. And if you could, a serving might cost you the bulk of your savings. 

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

Nevertheless, self-styled champions of free enterprise in Nebraska, Montana, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and Wyoming have all sought to stymy the manufacture and sale of cellular meat within their borders.

Although these bans are of little immediate consequence, they're nevertheless alarming and unconscionable. Industrial agriculture as currently practiced entails the torture of billions of sentient beings. And when forced to choose between tolerating such cruelty and forfeiting cheap bacon, nearly everyone picks the former. 

Lab-grown meat faces many scientific and economic hurdles to viability. But it is nevertheless our best hope for eliminating torture from our food system. And the right's push for prohibiting the technology is fueled by little more than paranoia, greed, and cultural grievance. 

Human beings generally love the taste of flesh, and not without reason. Meat is highly nutrient-dense, providing protein and essential amino acids, as well as vitamins and minerals that can be challenging to assemble from plant-based foods. The slaughter and consumption of animals has also been a central feature of human cultures, from the Paleolithic to the present day. 

Of course, for much of our species' history, meat was scarce. Raising livestock requires more resources than cultivating wheat or rice, which has long rendered highly carnivorous diets unattainable for ordinary people. As soon as humans can afford to eat meat regularly, however, most do so: Around the world, meat consumption rises almost linearly with increases in national income.

This relationship may break down some in the wealthiest nations. Past a certain level of affluence, people seem to give more weight to environmental and medical arguments against heavy meat consumption — Germany, for example, has managed to modestly decrease its per capita meat consumption over the last decade. But even in extremely rich societies, moral or environmental arguments against meat consumption haven't made a significant dent on people's dietary choices. 

According to Gallup's polling, in 1999, 6 percent of Americans identified as vegetarians. By 2023, that figure had fallen to 4 percent (while an additional 1 percent of Americans identified as vegans). And other empirical research, such as studies of shoppers' grocery purchases, comports with Gallup's findings. 

In other words, despite massive increases in the quantity and quality of plant-based meat alternatives — and enormous amounts of animal rights advocacy and activism — the carnivorous share of the US public has stayed more or less constant over the past quarter-century.

It therefore seems implausible that moral suasion alone will ever drastically swell the ranks of America's vegetarians. Which is too bad, since the moral arguments against modern animal agriculture are incredibly strong. And it requires little philosophical sophistication to recognize as much.

Most Americans think that it is wrong to torture a dog for months and then kill it. Granted, I don't have hard data for that claim (for some reason, Gallup and Pew have not seen fit to poll that proposition). But it seems like a reasonable assumption, given the public's hostility to dog-fighting rings and other forms of canine abuse. 

Yet the reasons why we typically consider dogs to be beings of moral worth — their capacity for bonding with humans and other members of their species, intelligence, distinct personalities, empathy, and vulnerability to suffering — also apply to pigs, among other animals raised for slaughter. Yet we tolerate the systematic torture of tens of millions of pigs each year. Male piglets are routinely castrated without anesthesia. Most sows, or female breeding pigs, meanwhile, spend their entire lives in cages so small that they cannot stretch their legs or turn around. 

The scale of cruelty in meat cultivation is greater than it needs to be. But there is an inescapable trade-off between productivity and humanity in industrial agriculture. Pig farmers don't keep sows in tiny cages because they are sadists. Rather, they do so because the less space an individual sow takes up, the more you can breed in a given amount of square footage. Minimizing the resource-intensity of meat production — and therefore its cost to consumers — generally means deprioritizing the welfare of animals. 

At present, there is just no getting around the conflict between our collective appetite for meat and our common moral intuition that torturing animals by the billions is wrong. Some people resolve this tension by irrationally denying the cognitive and emotional similarity of house pets and many farmed animals. Others simply choose to become vegetarians or vegans. Many, like myself, uneasily accept that we are not prepared to fully live up to our values in this domain (while seeking to mitigate our moral culpability by citing our difficulty digesting beans and soy, or the scarcity of vegan restaurants in our area, or our family traditions, or how good carnitas tacos taste).

Maybe, eventually, my vegan colleagues will persuade me to stop eating animals and start worshipping seitan. But such conversions are unlikely to ever happen at scale. Thus, the only way to reconcile humanity's taste for meat with its sympathy for intelligent life is to decouple animals' flesh from their sentience. And lab-grown meat is our best hope for doing that.

Yet some conservatives see less promise than peril in cellular meat. The movement to ban the technology partly reflects crass material interests. Already alarmed by competition from plant-based milks, which now make up more than 10 percent of overall milk sales, some livestock interests have sought to nip lab-grown meat in the bud. When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his state's ban into law last year, he was flanked by cattle ranchers.

But the GOP's push to ban cellular meat isn't merely about deference to moneyed interests. If conservatives' position were solely dictated by Big Ag, they might actually support the technology. Although some farmers oppose the technology, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the Meat Institute have both objected to prohibitions on its sale. Meanwhile, JBS Foods, the world's largest meat processor, has itself invested in lab-grown beef. 

Some Republican politicians say they're motivated by safety concerns. But such objections are either ill-informed or disingenuous. To make it to market, lab-grown meat must withstand the same FDA scrutiny as the factory-farmed variety. 

Ironically, what some Republicans seem to fear about lab-grown meat is precisely that it could render mass animal torture unnecessary, and therefore, verboten. As DeSantis explained when he announced his cellular meat ban last May, “Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

The idea here is that an international cabal of billionaire progressives wants to outlaw traditional meat and make Americans eat insects and poor simulacrums of beef instead (in arguing this, DeSantis was riffing on a popular right-wing conspiracy theory about the World Economic Forum's tyrannical machinations). 

Other Republican opponents of cellular meat express similar concerns. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, himself a major pork producer, described his state's prohibition as an effort to “battle fringe ideas and groups to defend our way of life.”

DeSantis's conspiratorial version of this argument is patently irrational. The World Economic Forum is not trying to make you eat bugs, so as to establish a global dictatorship. But the notion that lab-grown meat could eventually lead to bans on factory-farmed animal products is less unhinged.

After all, progressives in some states and cities have banned plastic straws, despite the objective inferiority of paper ones. And the moral case for infinitesimally reducing plastic production isn't anywhere near as strong as that for ending the mass torture of animals. So, you might reason, why wouldn't the left forbid real hamburgers the second that a petri dish produces a pale facsimile of a quarter-pounder?

While not entirely groundless, this fear is nevertheless misguided. 

Plastic straws are not as integral to American life as tasty meats. As noted above, roughly 95 percent of Americans eat meat. No municipal, state or federal government could ever end access to high-quality hot dogs, ribs, or chicken fingers and survive the next election.

The only scenario in which lab-grown meats could fully displace farmed ones is if the former comprehensively outcompetes the latter in the marketplace. If cellular meat ever becomes both tastier and cheaper than conventional alternatives — across every cut and kind of animal protein — then it could plausibly drive factory farmers into ruin. And in a world where almost no one eats pork derived from tortured sows, it's conceivable that the government could ban such torture. In so doing, however, it would only be ratifying the market's verdict. 

It's worth emphasizing how far-fetched that scenario is. Labs are making some progress on approximating ground beef and chicken nuggets. But manufacturing a rack of ribs or chicken wings remains wholly the stuff of science fiction. In any case, creating one serving of chicken nuggets at gargantuan cost in a lab and producing such nuggets at a global scale and competitive price are radically different propositions. And many scientists contend that cellular meat will never achieve such viability, due to the inherent constraints of thermodynamics and cell metabolism. If they are right, then conservatives have nothing to worry about. 

But if those skeptical scientists are underestimating humanity's capacity for agricultural innovation (as some have done in the past), then the consequences could be downright utopian. 

Right now, the process for converting energy into animal tissue is riddled with inefficiency, environmental harms, and cruelty. We grow corn and soybeans to capture energy from the sun, then convert those crops into feed, then fatten animals on that feed for weeks, months, or years before slaughtering them. If labs found a commercially viable way to directly convert electricity into chicken wings, steaks, and bacon, we could radically reduce the resource intensity and cost of meat production. At the same time, we would free up the roughly 660 million acres of American land currently devoted to pasture and grazing — a third of the continental US — for housing, parks, or commerce, while eliminating a large share of global carbon emissions. And of course, such a technological revolution would allow carnivorous animal lovers to live our values, without forfeiting our favorite dishes. 

Biology or economics may ultimately block the path to such a utopian food system. But we must not let cultural grievance prevent us from finding out if that world is possible.

You may not know about it either, but the program helps keep people — and animals — in good health.

by  Benji Jones

Nearly two decades ago, scientists made an alarming discovery in upstate New York: Bats, the world's only flying mammal, were becoming infected with a new, deadly fungal disease that, in some cases, could wipe out an entire colony in a matter of months. 

Since then, the disease — later called white-nose syndrome — has spread across much of the country, utterly decimating North American bats that hibernate in caves and killing over 90 percent of three bat species. According to some scientists, WNS has caused “the most precipitous wildlife decline in the past century in North America.” 

These declines have clear consequences for human populations — for you, even if you don't like bats or visit caves. 

Bats eat insect pests, such as moths and beetles. And as they decline, farmers need to spray more pesticides. Scientists have linked the loss of bats in the US to an increase in insecticide use on farmland and, remarkably, to a rise in infant deaths. Insecticide chemicals are known to harm the health of newborns. 

The only reason we know any of this is because of a somewhat obscure government program in the US Geological Survey (USGS), an agency nested within the Interior Department. That program, known as the Ecosystems Mission Area, is the biological research division of Interior. Among other functions, it monitors environmental contaminants, the spread of invasive species, and the health of the nation's wildlife, including bees, birds, and bats.

The Ecosystems Mission Area, which has around 1,200 employees, produces the premier science revealing how animals and ecosystems that Americans rely on are changing and what we can do to keep them intact — or risk our own health and economy. 

This program is now at an imminent risk of disappearing.

The Trump administration has asked Congress to slash USGS funding by $564 million in its preliminary 2026 budget request. And while the proposal doesn't specify cuts to Ecosystems Mission Area, an email obtained by Vox indicates that his administration had proposed eliminating funding for the program. (The email was originally reported by Science.) Such cuts are also in line with Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy roadmap, which calls for the government to “abolish” Interior's Biological Research Division, an outdated name for the Ecosystems Mission Area.

USGS has requested that the White House maintain at least some funding for the program, according to a current senior Interior Department employee with knowledge of the Ecosystems Mission Area. Whether or not Trump officials heed that request will be made clear when the White House releases a more detailed budget proposal in the coming days. The employee spoke to Vox on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk with the press.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also reportedly trying to fire government employees in the Ecosystems Mission Area, though a federal judge has so far blocked those efforts. 

Eliminating biological research is not good. In fact, it's very bad.

For a decade now, EMA's North American Bat Monitoring Program, or NABat, has been gathering and analyzing data on bats and the threats they face. NABat produces research using data from hundreds of partner organizations showing not only how white-nose syndrome is spreading — which scientists are using to develop and deploy vaccines — but also how bats are affected by wind turbines, another known threat. 

Energy companies can and do use this research to develop safer technologies and avoid delays caused by wildlife regulations, such as the Endangered Species Act. 

The irony, another Interior Department employee told me, is that NABat makes wildlife management more efficient. It also helps reveal where declines are occurring before they become severe, potentially helping avoid the need to grant certain species federal protection — something the Trump administration would seem to want. The employee, who's familiar with Interior's bat-monitoring efforts, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration. 

“If they want to create efficiencies in the government, they should ask us,” yet another Interior employee told Vox. “The damage that can be done by one administration takes decades to rebuild.”

In response to a request for comment, an Interior Department spokesperson told Vox that “USGS remains committed to its congressional mandate as the science arm of the Department of the Interior.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In a Senate appropriations hearing last week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum refused to commit to maintaining funding for EMA.

“There's no question that they don't know what EMA does,” said the senior Interior employee.

Ultimately, it's not clear why the administration has targeted Interior's biological research. EMA does, however, do climate science, such as studying how plants and animals are responding to rising temperatures. That's apparently a no-go for the Trump administration. It also gathers information that sometimes indicates that certain species need federal protections, which come with regulations (also a no-go for President Donald Trump's agenda).

What's especially frustrating for environmental advocates is that NABat, now 10 years old, is starting to hit its stride.

“We should be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of this very successful program that started from scratch and built this robust, vibrant community of people all collecting data,” said Winifred Frick, the chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, an environmental group. “We have 10 years of momentum, and so to cut it off now sort of wastes all that investment. That feels like a tremendous loss.” 

Meanwhile, the cost of maintaining the program is less than 1 percent of Interior's overall budget.

The government's wildlife monitoring programs are “jewels of the country,” said Hollis Woodard, an associate professor of entomology at University of California Riverside who works with USGS on bee monitoring. “These birds and bats perform services for us that are important for our day-to-day lives. Literally everything I value, including food, comes down to keeping an eye on these populations. The idea that we're just going to wipe them out is just terrifying.”

From space exploration to taxidermy, here's what Gen Alpha kids want to do when they grow up.

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

Earlier this year, I went to Career Day at my older kid's school. The experience was sometimes humbling — at an elementary school career fair, no one can compete with the firefighters — but it was also incredibly joyful. Hearing from kids about what they want to be when they grow up can be a balm for anxious times.

Adults may be fearful for the future, kids are still dreaming and planning, figuring out the place they're going to inhabit in a world that's constantly changing. Yes, kids today will come of age in a time of climate change, war, and democratic backsliding — but they're also going to create new art, invent new technologies, and pioneer new policies that will make the world better and richer in ways we can't even imagine yet. 

With all this in mind, I asked a few kids — including some of the Scholastic Kid Reporters who have helped me out in the past — to tell me what they want to be when they grow up, and what changes they hope to see in the world. A selection of their responses, which have been condensed and edited, are below. If the kids in your life would like to weigh in too, you can reach me at anna.north@vox.com.

I want to be a gymnastics teacher. I want to get married and have kids, maybe five. I want to go to France. I want to do ballet in France. 

I want to do anything I want. I want more kittens on the planet. I want everyone to have their own house with their own family. I want self-driving lawnmowers. I don't want people to eat chickens, who should be treated like a princess.

—Mairead, age 8

During Covid, our math and science teacher would show us these videos about space. Those videos really inspired me. The idea that there might be life other than planet Earth was just really cool to me. Our universe is so big, there's so many places to explore, so many new things to learn. 

[As a Scholastic Kid Reporter, I wrote a story] about the total solar eclipse. I remember interviewing Mr. James Tralie. That was really cool, because he worked at NASA, but he was also an animator, and I also love art and drawing. From that experience, I learned being part of NASA and learning about space is not only about being a scientist or being an engineer, it's also about doing art, doing music, and just doing what you truly love related to space. 

When I was younger, I loved playing with Legos. I love building new things. I've learned a lot about being an aerospace technician or an engineer: building rockets, fixing issues related to space technology. I also love exploring. So being an astronomer is one of my dreams.

I just don't think it makes sense that there's only one planet in our entire universe where there's life. I hope to find life on other planets in the future.

—Aiden, age 13

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

I want to be a teacher because I see in my class a lot of different faces and colors of everyone, and I think it's going to be important to help other people grow like I grow in my school. 

In my class, I have people who are shy, people who need extra help, and people who are really smart, so I feel like getting education for everybody to reach the same [level] is going to be hard.

—Kimaaya, age 8

I would like to taxidermy a lamprey eel.

—Eleanor, age 6

Interviewing ukulelist James Hill as a Scholastic Kid Reporter and talking to him about music showed me that there are many different ways to play an instrument. On his ukulele, he doesn't just play a couple of chords — he makes creative musical sounds, even drumbeats. Talking with him inspired me to become a performer on the ukulele and guitar.

Not to brag, but I feel like I'm very skilled with ukulele. I feel like if someone gave me a sheet of music, I could learn it and play it for them maybe the next day perfectly.

My biggest goal is to experiment more with the notes and strings, learn some more tricks on it, and maybe someday make my own album.

—Owen, age 12

I want to do research in politics or economics that could bring about real changes in our world.

Growing up during the Covid pandemic, we were all stuck online. I was seeing a lot of stuff about the Black Lives Matter movement, lots of Instagram stuff about LGBT rights, there was the Trump administration, and it really got me curious about politics and social justice. 

I'm from Hong Kong as well, and in 2019 there were the protests that occurred about democracy. I'm really obsessed with the idea of preserving democracy, so I think that just pushed me further into reading more about politics. 

I think you could use the quantitative bit of economics and tie it into the qualitative bit of politics, and use data, like observing patterns and everything, and apply that to something that could cause change in the world. I think I would be studying politics and economics so that I could keep both doors open, depending on what I want to pursue in the future. Because I'm still 17. I'm not set yet, but I think both of these paths offer me the education, the knowledge to potentially bring impact.

—Macy, age 17

Watching the Olympics, hearing about doing archery, and seeing pictures [inspired me to want to be an Olympic archer]. Last year, I started saving up for an archery bow, and now I have one. We go to archery club every Sunday.

[I also want to be] a bat scientist. A few days ago, we went on a bat watch in the middle of the night. Have you heard of something called a bat detector? It's a little device, and it can intercept different kinds of bat calls with this little dial, and you turn it [to] different levels, and you can listen for bats. We were at this wood cabin, and there was a big light for the bugs, and the bats would quickly go for them. So we didn't really see them clearly, but we heard them very loud.

[I want to] study about bats: what they eat, what size they are, and where they like to go and everything.

—Flower, age 8

Your mom says you want to be an owl scientist. What makes you want to study owls?

They're so pretty.

What's your favorite owl?

Snow owl.

What do owls eat?

Mice, rabbits, bugs, bats. … If I have a pet owl, and Flower has a pet bat… [trails off]

—Tabby, age 4, Flower's sister

A 4-year-old girl came to the US legally in 2023 to get treatment for a severe medical condition called short bowel syndrome. Now her family's legal status has been terminated, and she could die without access to care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will stop recommending routine Covid vaccines for healthy children, part of a series of policy changes that could mean kids can't access the shots, even if their families want them.

Kids with autism can be at heightened risk of drowning, and traditional swim classes aren't always accessible to them. Now some nonprofits are stepping in to help.

My older kid and I have been reading Hooky, a graphic novel about twin witches who miss the school bus one day and become embroiled in a variety of hijinks. Fair warning: Hooky was originally serialized and there is a lot going on. I have repeatedly had to admit to my kid that I am confused.

This week I was on one of my favorite parenting podcasts, The Longest Shortest Time, talking about my experience getting a salpingectomy, a form of permanent birth control that can reduce your risk of ovarian cancer. You can listen here!

Two weeks ago, I wrote about “dry texting” and how teens use their phones to avoid in-person conflict with one another. Young people had a lot to tell me about this phenomenon, more than I could include in the original story. So I wanted to share what Gracelynn, age 12 and a Scholastic Kid Reporter, told me in an email:

Gracelynn said online arguments can be more complex than in-person confrontation because “when you are chatting online, they could copy and paste the text or media image and use it against you.” With in-person arguments, it's also easier for adults to overhear and intervene. Gracelynn also noted that even though her school uses GoGuardian software to keep kids off certain websites during the day, “they still manage to pull off crazy things.”

Thank you again to Gracelynn and everyone who talked to me for that story, and as always, you can reach me with comments or questions at anna.north@vox.com.

The search giant's midlife crisis is now your problem.

by  Adam Clark Estes

Somewhere between asking Google's new advanced AI to explain, in detail, how to become an expert birdwatcher in my neighborhood and using Google's new AI moviemaking tool to create cartoons of my 4-pound Chihuahua fighting crime, I realized something. Either Google is having a midlife crisis or I am. It could be both. 

Google has been quite publicly freaking out since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but things got more serious last fall, when OpenAI released ChatGPT Search, a direct competitor to Google Search. Last week, Google announced 100 new things at its I/O developer conferences, most of which involved going all in on AI. Suddenly, there's a new narrative: The search giant is for sure having a midlife crisis, and “it's glorious,” one industry expert said. 

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

I've spent the past week tinkering with Google's new AI tools, and I can confidently say the company is somewhere between crisis and glory. It may take years before we know which path wins.

Google has dominated not only the way we use the web but also the web's very existence for the last 15 years, mainly through its search and advertising divisions. As AI encroaches on every corner of our digital experience, it's not clear which company will dominate the next era or how we'll interact with it. It almost certainly won't be by typing keywords into a search engine. 

To find something online today, you typically type some keywords into Google, pick a blue link that you think has the information you're after, and click. Companies bid on search terms in order to get their ads in front of people browsing the web, powering Google's multibillion-dollar advertising business. Your click helps publishers, including Vox, make money from ads they host on their sites, many of which Google manages. Google is dominant enough that two federal judges recently ruled that it's operating as an illegal monopoly, and the company is currently waiting to see if it will be broken up. 

As AI encroaches on every corner of our digital experience, it's not clear which company will dominate the next era or how we'll interact with it.

The government might not be the biggest threat to Google dominance, however. AI has been chipping away at the foundation of the web in the past couple of years, as people have increasingly turned to tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity to find information online. These AI chatbots pull information from websites and present you with a tidy summary. This has become a real enough threat to Google that the number of Google searches in Safari fell for the first time ever in April. Google also recently saw its share of the search market dip below 90 percent for the first time in a decade, as AI search takes off. TikTok isn't helping either.

Google recognized this inevitability a few years ago and has been trying to reinvent itself accordingly. A couple years ago, it rolled out AI Overviews, which are summaries of search results created by Google's large language model, Gemini. Then Google expanded on that concept earlier this year with AI Mode, a chatbot-based search experience also powered by Gemini that looks an awful lot like ChatGPT and Perplexity. The company announced last week that AI Mode will be rolling out to everyone in the United States in the coming weeks — just look for a sparkly button on the righthand side of the search field that says “AI Mode.” 

AI Mode is how I've been trying to learn birding for the past week. Instead of plugging keywords into the old Google search box, I've been entering complex queries and getting back detailed reports. From one three-sentence prompt, AI Mode returned nearly 600 words. There were just nine links to sources, none of which I needed to click, since the chatbot had already summarized the content therein. Only by doing a little bit of digging did I realize that one of the main sources for this summary was a beginner's guide to birdwatching written by my Vox colleague Allie Volpe.

This search experience, as is the case with other AI chatbots, is not always awesome. The technology is powered by large language models, which are prone to hallucinations, and so these new search tools tend to be unreliable. Then again, because AI tends to write such convincing copy, you're not always compelled to double-check the results. Publishers are seeing huge declines in traffic from Google as more people bypass the web and ask AI chatbots for information. As I learned from my birding research, it's quicker. And let's be honest, not everything you find from clicking a blue link is 100 percent accurate either.

This is probably what the future of search looks like, and no, it almost certainly won't involve a list of blue links.

It's unnerving for me to admit that I like the new Google. And I expect to see a lot more of it. As part of its blitz of AI announcements, Google also rolled out Gemini in Chrome, which lets the AI assistant see what you're seeing on a website. (It's currently only available for people who subscribe to Google AI Plus or AI Ultra plans or for people running beta versions of Chrome.) You can ask questions about what's on the page or ask Gemini to summarize an article. The tool can even analyze YouTube videos in real time. You can almost think of this as a more targeted version of what the new AI Mode search experience does for the entire web, and it seems useful.

This is probably what the future of search looks like, and no, it almost certainly won't involve a list of blue links. While you'll undoubtedly be able to access the traditional search experience for quite some time, the sheer volume of Google's latest announcements suggests that AI everything is where we're headed. Headlines around that news echoed the gravity of it all. Reporting from Google's developer conference, Platformer's Casey Newton said, “everything is changing and normal and scary and chill.” Tech analyst Ben Thompson declared “the death of the ad-supported web,” thanks to Google. New York magazine's John Herrman put it more bluntly: “Google is burying the web alive.”

In the chaotic, early days of the web, Google got popular by simplifying the intimidating task of finding things online, as the Washington Post's Geoffrey A. Fowler points out. Its supremacy in this new AI-powered future is far less certain. Maybe another startup will come along and simplify things this time around, so you can have a user-friendly bot explain things to you, book travel for you, and make movies for you. 

In the meantime, I'll be trying to perfect my AI-generated crime-fighting Chihuahua cartoon, wondering when any of this will start to feel glorious.

If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.

by  Ian Millhiser

A federal court ruled on Wednesday evening that the massive tariffs President Donald Trump imposed shortly after beginning his second term are illegal. 

The US Court of International Trade's decision in two consolidated cases — known as V.O.S. Selections v. United States and Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security — is quite broad. It argues that the Constitution places fairly strict limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs in the first place — limits that Trump surpassed — and it reads several federal trade laws to place rigid constraints on Trump's ability to continue his trade war.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The decision may not be final; it can be appealed up to the Supreme Court. But if higher courts embrace the trade court's reasoning, Trump most likely will not be able to reimpose the sweeping kind of tariffs at issue in the V.O.S. Selections case, although he might still be able to impose more modest tariffs that are more limited in scope and duration.

The three-judge panel that decided V.O.S. Selections unanimously agreed that the Trump's tariffs, as they stand now, are illegal in an unsigned opinion. The panel included judges appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Trump himself.

Trump primarily relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) when he imposed his tariffs. That statute permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest,” but this power “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.”

The trade court's first significant holding is that, although a federal appeals court has held that this power to “regulate” foreign transactions sometimes permits the president to impose tariffs, this statute cannot be read to give Trump “unlimited tariff authority.” That is, the IEEPA does not give Trump the power he claims to impose tariffs of any amount, upon any nation, for any duration.

Significantly, the trade court, based in New York City, concludes that the statute cannot be read to give Trump unchecked authority over tariffs because, if Congress had intended to give Trump that power, then the statute would violate the Constitution's separation of powers because Congress cannot simply give away its full authority over tariffs to the president.

Among other things, the court points to a line of Supreme Court decisions establishing that Congress may only delegate authority to the president if it lays “down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to fix such [tariff] rates is directed to conform.” So, if the president's authority over tariffs is as broad as Trump claims, the statute is unconstitutional because it does not provide sufficient instructions on when or how that authority may be used.

The court's second significant holding arises out of Trump's claim that the tariffs are needed to address the nation's trade deficit — the fact that Americans buy more goods from foreign nations than we export. But, as the trade court explains, there is a separate federal law — Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — which governs the president's power to impose tariffs in response to trade deficits. 

This statute only permits the president to impose tariff rates of 15 percent or lower, and those tariffs may only remain in effect for 150 days. The trade court concludes that Trump may only rely on his authority under Section 122 if he wants to impose tariffs to respond to trade deficits. So, while he could potentially reimpose some tariffs under this law, they would expire after five months.

The court's third significant holding arises out of IEEPA's language stating that any tariffs imposed under this statute must “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.” Trump justified some of his tariffs by claiming that they will help deter the importation of illegal drugs into the United States, but the trade court concludes that these tariffs don't actually do anything to “deal with” the threat of drug trafficking — and thus they are illegal.

As the trade court argues, the tariffs do not directly prevent any illegal drugs from entering the United States. Trump's lawyers argued that the tariffs will help reduce illegal drug trafficking because other nations will crack down on drug dealers in order to be rid of the tariffs, but the court rejects the argument that the tariffs can be justified because they pressure other nations to shift their domestic policies.

“[H]owever sound this might be as a diplomatic strategy, it does not comfortably meet the statutory definition of ‘deal[ing] with' the cited emergency,” the court argues, adding that “it is hard to conceive of any IEEPA power that could not be justified on the same ground of ‘pressure.'” 

Finally, the court ends its opinion by permanently enjoining the tariffs on a nationwide basis. 

The Supreme Court is currently debating whether to limit lower courts' power to issue such nationwide orders, but the trade court makes a strong argument that it is constitutionally required to block the tariffs throughout the country: As the V.O.S. Selections opinion notes, the Constitution provides that “all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.” So, if these tariffs cannot lawfully be imposed on one person, the same rule must apply to all persons.

The trade court is the first federal court to rule on whether these tariffs are legal, but it is unlikely to be the last. This court's decisions ordinarily appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and then to the Supreme Court. And Trump is all but certain to ask higher courts to lift the trade court's injunction.

These higher courts could potentially reveal fairly soon whether they think the tariffs are legal. In an order accompanying the trade court's decision, the court announces that “within 10 calendar days necessary administrative orders to effectuate the permanent injunction shall issue.” So, if no higher court steps in, Trump's tariffs will cease to exist very soon.

Of course, Trump will no doubt seek a stay of the trade court's decision from the Federal Circuit and, if the Federal Circuit rules against him, the Supreme Court. That means that, depending on how the Federal Circuit rules, the Supreme Court may have to decide whether to reinstate the tariffs within weeks.

So, while higher courts will need to weigh in before we know if the tariffs will survive, we may know what the justices think about Trump's tariffs very soon.

The real cost of forcing foreign students away from elite universities like Harvard.

by  Bryan Walsh

In 1965, then-French finance minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing came up with the “mot juste” for describing the way that the supremacy of the dollar provided the foundation for the financial supremacy of the US. The fact the dollar was so dominant in international transactions gave the US, d'Estaing said, an “exorbitant privilege.” Because every country needed dollars to settle trade and backstop their own currencies, foreign countries had to buy up US debt, which in turn meant that the US paid less to borrow money and was able to run up trade and budget deficits without suffering the usual pain. The exorbitant privilege of the dollar was that the US would be able to live beyond its means. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

It's always been an open question as to how long that privilege would last, but President Donald Trump's harsh tariff policies, paired with a budget bill that right now would add trillions to the budget deficit, might just be enough to finally dislodge the dollar. Annual federal deficits are already running at 6 percent of GDP, while interest rates on 10-year US Treasuries have more than doubled to around 4.5 percent over the past few years, increasing the cost of interest payments on the debt. As of the last quarter of 2024, 58 percent of global reserves were in dollars, down from 71 percent in the first quarter of 1999. The dollar may remain king, if only because there seems to be no real alternative, but thanks to the US' own actions, the exorbitance of its privilege is already eroding — and with it, America's ability to compensate for its fiscal fecklessness.

But the dollar isn't the only privilege the US enjoys. Since the postwar era, America's best universities have led the world. Harvard, Princeton, MIT, CalTech — these elite universities are the foundation of the American scientific supremacy that has in turn fueled decades of economic growth. But also, by virtue of their unparalleled ability to attract the best minds from around the world, these schools have given the US the educational privilege of being the magnet of global academic excellence. In the same way that the dollar's dominance has allowed the US to live beyond its means, the dominance of elite universities has compensated for the fact that the US has, at best, a mediocre K-12 educational system. 

And now that privilege is under attack by the Trump administration. Cutting off federal funding for universities like Columbia and Princeton and eviscerating agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation were bad enough, but the administration's recent move to bar international students from Harvard would be a death blow, especially if it spread to other top schools. 

And it seems entirely possible that it might. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US would “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students and enhance future scrutiny on all applicants from China. (That includes applicants from Hong Kong — a once-free city that has come firmly under the boot of the Chinese government — who are precisely the kind of students a past America would have sought to defend.)

The ability to attract the best of the best, especially in the sciences, is what makes Harvard Harvard, which in turn has helped make the United States the United States. Just as losing the privilege of the dollar would force the US to finally pay for years of fiscal mismanagement, losing the privilege of these top universities would force the country to pay for decades of educational failure. 

As Vox contributor Kevin Carey wrote this week, foreign students are a major source of financial support for US colleges and universities, many of which would struggle to survive should those students disappear. But the financial picture actually understates just how much US science depends on foreign talent and, in turn, depends on top universities like Harvard to bring in top students and professors.

An astounding 70 percent of grad students in the US in electrical engineering and 63 percent in computer science — probably the two disciplines most important to winning the future — are foreign-born. Nineteen percent of the overall STEM workforce in the US is foreign-born; focus just on the PhD-level workforce, and that number rises to 43 percent. Since 1901, just about half of all physics, chemistry, and medicine Nobel Prizes have gone to Americans, and about a third of those winners were foreign-born, a figure that has risen in recent decades. It's really not too much to suggest that if all foreign scientists and science students were deported tomorrow, US science would grind to a halt.

Could American-born students step into that gap? Absolutely not. That's because as elite as America's top universities are, the country's K-12 education system has been anything but. 

Every three years, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is given to a representative sample of 15-year-old students in over 80 countries. It's the best existing test for determining how a country's students compare in mathematics, reading, and science to their international peers. 

In the most recent PISA tests, taken in 2022, US students scored below the average for OECD or developed countries in math; on reading and science, they were just slightly above average. And while a lot of attention has been rightly paid to learning loss since the pandemic — one report from fall 2024 estimated that the average US student is less than halfway to a full academic recovery — American students have lagged behind their international peers since long before then. Other wealthy nations, from East Asian countries to some small European ones, regularly outpace American peers in math by the equivalent of one full academic year.

To be clear, this picture isn't totally catastrophic. It's fine — American students perform around the middle compared to their international peers. But just fine won't make you the world's undisputed scientific leader. And fine is a long way from what the US once was. 

America was a pioneer in universal education, and it did the same in college education through the postwar GI Bill, which opened up college education to the masses. By 1950, 34 percent of US adults aged 25 or older had completed high school or more, compared to 14 percent in the UK and 11 percent in France. When NASA engineers were putting people on the moon in the 1960s, the US had perhaps the world's most educated workforce to draw from.

Since then, much of the rest of the world has long since caught up with the US on educational attainment, and a number of countries have surpassed it. But thanks in large part to the privilege that is elite universities like Harvard or the University of California, and their ability to recruit the best, no country has caught up to the US in sheer scientific brainpower. Take away our foreign talent, however, and US science would look more like its K-12 performance — merely fine.

It seems increasingly apparent that the Trump administration wants to make an example of Harvard, proving its own dominance by breaking a 388-year-old institution with strong ties to American power and influence. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to cancel all remaining federal contracts with Harvard, while Trump himself mused on redirecting Harvard's $3 billion in grants to trade schools. 

Grants and contracts are vital, but they can be restored, just as faith in the US dollar might be restored by a saner trade policy and a tighter budget. But if the Trump administration chooses to make the US fundamentally hostile to foreign students and scientific talent, there may be no coming back. Politico reported this week that the administration is weighing requiring all foreign students applying to study in the US to undergo social media vetting. With universities around the world now competing to make themselves alternatives to the US, what star student from Japan or South Korea or Finland would choose to put their future in the hands of the Trump administration, when they could go anywhere else they wanted?

The US once achieved scientific leadership because it educated its own citizens better and longer than any other country. Those days are long past, but the US managed to keep its pole position, and all that came with it, because it supported and funded what were far and away the best universities in the world. That was our privilege, as much as the dollar was. And now we seem prepared to destroy both.

Should that come to pass, we'll see just how little is left.

The ""first buddy"" is standing down.

Elon Musk said Wednesday he plans to leave the Trump administration, ending his time at the White House DOGE office focused on cutting spending and reshaping the federal government.

The announcement came a day after Musk criticized President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" for undermining the White House DOGE team's work and adding to the deficit. The billionaire has also signaled he plans to focus more of his efforts on his companies and that he plans to reduce his political spending.

""As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,"" Musk wrote in a post on X on Wednesday. ""The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.""

A White House official confirmed that Musk's offboarding was beginning.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO previously said he would be stepping back from his government work in May. Musk was designated a ""special government employee."" Federal law stipulates that those with this title cannot serve for more than 130 days in a 365-day period.

The tech titan had been closely involved in the White House DOGE office's efforts to cut government spending and eliminate fraud and waste.

Musk has also recently said he spent ""too much time"" on politics this year and that he plans to cut back his political spending. The billionaire spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and the GOP in the 2024 election.

Musk said in an X post on Saturday that he was back to ""spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" to the relief of Tesla investors.

Tesla's share price has been on the rise since his announcement in April that he'd be stepping back from his White House work. The company had been targeted by boycotts and protests over its CEO's work with the White House DOGE office.

The ruling would reduce the effective US tariff rate to below 6% from a high of almost 27% last month.

President Donald Trump's appetite for new tariffs remains undeterred, even after a pair of court decisions hit his signature duties with their most devastating blow yet.

Also an ESG matrix, endowment tax trades, disqualified lender lists and brain popping realizations.

The legal problem with President Donald Trump's tariffs is that the United States has a Constitution, and the Constitution says that Congress has the power to impose tariffs and the president doesn't. This is not some weird technicality; this is just what the Constitution says. “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” and “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” But Congress did not pass President Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, or any of the various up-and-down permutations since then. That was all him, acting by executive order.

Congress did pass a law, in 1977, that gives the president powers to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” (This law is called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA.) Specifically, the president can “investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” That long list is usually abbreviated, in this context, to “regulate … importation”: The IEEPA allows the president to regulate imports in an emergency. If he can regulate imports, can he impose tariffs on them? Eh, maybe, sounds like a regulation.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The New York Times on Thursday struck a deal with Amazon allowing it to use the storied news organization's content across its artificial intelligence platforms.

The multi-year deal ""will bring Times editorial content to a variety of Amazon customer experiences,"" the Times said in a release. The agreement also includes content from the newspaper's other properties like NYT Cooking and The Athletic.

""This will include real-time display of summaries and short excerpts of Times content within Amazon products and services, such as Alexa, and training Amazon's proprietary foundation models,"" the Times said.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI in 2023 for copyright infringement, accusing the companies of abusing the newspaper's intellectual property to train large language models. 

Both Microsoft and OpenAI sought unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out. Other news publications have joined the Times in suing Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright violations, including the New York Daily News and the Center for Investigative Reporting.

A growing number of news outlets have opted to strike licensing deals with tech companies rather than pursue litigation.

Amazon has launched a flurry of generative AI products over the past several months as it looks to keep up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Google and others. 

Amazon announced Alexa+, a new version of its decade-plus old voice assistant embedded with generative AI in February. Other products include its own set of Nova models, Trainium chips, a shopping chatbot, and a marketplace for third-party models called Bedrock.

Major League Baseball will make a strategic investment in the newly launched Athletes Unlimited Softball League, the league announced Thursday.

The deal marks MLB's first comprehensive partnership with a women's pro sports league and comes as women's sports see rapid growth in everything from television viewership to team valuations.

Terms of the deal were not provided.

As part of the agreement, MLB will help raise the visibility of the AUSL and its athletes through its sales, marketing, broadcast and social media platforms. The baseball league will also make a significant financial investment toward league operational costs and key growth initiatives as it starts its inaugural season this year.

""During this extraordinarily exciting time for women's sports, we want softball to thrive. MLB is committed to help build a sustainable and impactful league that drives fandom, serves the softball community, and benefits all female athletes,"" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.

Athletes Unlimited co-founder and CEO Jon Patricof, who also owns and operates pro volleyball and basketball leagues, said the partnership will boost professional women's softball, a sport that has seen major growth in recent years.

""The sport is growing at the grassroots level, the college level and it will be back in the Olympics in 2028"" in Los Angeles, Patricof said. ""It's kind of a giant among pro women's sports right now.""

MLB said it will also air select AUSL games on MLB Network and MLB.TV.

Last February, ESPN signed a deal with Athletes Unlimited to broadcast at least 30 softball games across its networks. It has reason to believe the sport is attracting a big audience: More than 2 million viewers tuned in for the NCAA Division I Women's College World Series finals in 2024, a 24% increase over the previous year, ESPN said.

AUSL Commissioner Kim Ng called the deal with MLB a watershed moment for women's sports and softball.

""MLB's investment will supercharge our efforts to build the sustainable professional league this sport has long deserved, and sends a powerful message about the value of female athletes and the importance of creating professional opportunities for them,"" she said.

The AUSL will kick off its debut season on June 7 and feature four teams each playing in a 24-game campaign, followed by an All-Star Cup. The games will take place in 12 different cities this year and then transition to a city-based league in 2026.

The league is planning to expand from four to six teams next season in 2026.

""Together, we're going to reach new fans and inspire the next generation of softball players,"" said Ng.

In this article

Best Buy on Thursday missed quarterly revenue expectations and cut its full-year sales and profit guidance as higher tariffs increase the costs of many consumer electronics that it sells.

For its fiscal 2026, the retailer said it now expects $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion of revenue, down from its previous range of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $6.15 to $6.30, which compares with prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.60.

Best Buy already increased prices on some items to blunt the costs from tariffs, with changes taking effect by mid-May, CEO Corie Barry said on a call with reporters. She called price hikes ""the very last resort"" after the company takes other steps to offset higher expenses. But she declined to specify which items are affected, citing competitive reasons.

First-quarter earnings reports have highlighted just how disruptive President Donald Trump's ever-evolving trade policy has been to many U.S. companies that rely on a global supply chain. Best Buy joins other companies like Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy's in cutting its profit outlook this week due to tariffs. Other businesses, such as E.l.f. Beauty, have declined to provide full-year guidance because of the levies. 

On the call with reporters, Barry referred to the latest development that may change the backdrop once again: a federal trade court striking down many of Trump's tariffs late Wednesday. And she said that ruling reinforces that the company has to stay nimble.

""If you look back over the last, let's call it four months, the variety of points where there has been a change in approach to global trade, they are myriad,"" she said. ""And so what I really tried to work with the team on is to not actually overreact to any given moment in time, but instead to stay maniacally focused on our customers and ensure we are bringing the right assortment price and promotionality to them, whatever the backdrop.""

Here's how the consumer electronics company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the company's fiscal first quarter, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares of Best Buy fell more than 9% in morning trading.

Best Buy's net income in the three-month period that ended May 3 declined about 18% to $202 million, or 95 cents per share, from $246 million, or $1.13 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time expenses, including restructuring charges for its Best Buy Health business, the company reported earnings of $1.15 per share.

First-quarter revenue dropped from $8.85 billion in the year-ago period.

Comparable sales, defined by Best Buy as revenue from online sales and stores open at least 14 months, dropped 0.7% year over year. In the U.S., comparable sales also fell 0.7% year over year as shoppers bought fewer home theaters, appliances and drones than a year ago. The company said weakness in those categories was partially offset by growth in the computing, mobile phone and tablet categories.

Best Buy is a closely watched name when it comes to the impact of tariffs since it sells iPhones, TVs, laptops, kitchen appliances and many other consumer electronics that tend to be made in China or other parts of Asia. That's why Barry said on a March earnings call that the retailer would likely have to raise prices because of the duties.

However, Barry said on a separate earnings call Thursday that Best Buy's mix of imports has changed in recent months. China continues to be a major source of merchandise, but the country now accounts for 30% to 35% of its merchandise compared with the 55% metric that it shared in March.

About 25% of its merchandise comes from U.S. or Mexico, which do not have tariffs due to domestic production or exemptions, she said. The remaining roughly 40% comes from other areas, including Vietnam, India, South Korea and Taiwan, which are subject to a 10% tariff.

The U.S. currently has an up to 30% tariff on imports from China, while goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt from the Trump administration's 25% duty on Mexico. It is unclear now how those rates will change after the federal trade court's ruling on Wednesday.

Barry on the Thursday earnings call outlined ways that Best Buy is adjusting to current tariffs, while acknowledging the backdrop could change after the court ruling. The vast majority of what the retailer sells — about 97% or 98% of its merchandise — is imported by vendors rather than directly by the company.

Best Buy has encouraged vendors to manufacture in multiple countries, negotiated lower costs and adjusted the mix of merchandise that it carries, she said.

On the earnings call, Barry pointed to Best Buy's strategic priorities for the year that will help the company increase profits and control costs. She said the company aims to improve the customer experience to better connect its digital and in-store businesses, launch and grow its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses, and drive efficiency ""to fund strategic investments and offset pressures.""

She also called out new product launches that could drive excitement and purchases. For example, she said, there's strong demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 video game console that will debut early this summer. Barry said Best Buy is tapping into that by offering preorders and opening its doors at midnight on June 5 to allow customers to pick up their consoles or get a new game right away.

Smartphone sales have been a bright spot for Best Buy, too. Barry said Verizon and AT&T have both bulked up staffing at Best Buy stores. She said phone sales and activations have risen, and the company posted comparable sales growth for mobile phones for the first time in three years.

As of Wednesday's close, shares of Best Buy are down nearly 17% so far this year. That trails behind the roughly flat performance of the S&P 500 year to date. Best Buy closed at $71.52 on Wednesday, bringing the company's market value to $15.14 billion.

In this article

Nvidia shares jumped on Thursday after posting a positive set of earnings, sparking a rally in global semiconductor stocks.

Shares of Nvidia were 6% higher after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, even as it took a hit from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China.

Nvidia has been seen by investors as a bellwether for the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks, with its latest strong numbers sparking a rally among global semiconductor names.

Nvidia's earnings helped boost other chip names, with Taiwan Semiconductor, AMD and Qualcomm all up about 1%.

In Japan, Tokyo Electron closed more than 4% higher, while SK Hynix, which is a supplier of high bandwidth memory to Nvidia, was nearly 2% up at the close of markets in South Korea.

In Europe, ASM International, BE Semiconductor Industries and ASML were all in positive territory.

The semiconductor industry has faced a number of headwinds from uncertainty around tariff policy in the U.S. and chip export restrictions to China. 

Companies such as ASML, which makes machines that are critical for manufacturing the most advanced chips, have seen billions wiped off their value as a result.

Nvidia on Wednesday said it wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory that it couldn't ship to China because of export curbs, saying it also calculated $2.5 billion of lost revenue as well.

The restrictions on China do not seem to be going away. 

The U.S. has ordered a number of companies, including those producing chemicals and design software for semiconductors, to stop shipping goods to China without a license, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.

Despite this, Nvidia still managed to post financial results for the April quarter that beat market expectations, allaying fears that demand for its graphics processing units, which have become key for training huge AI models, is dwindling.

U.S. President Donald Trump could still find a work-around after suffering a major blow to a core part of his economic agenda.

The U.S. Court of International Trade on Wednesday ruled that the president had overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on numerous countries.

The New York-based court ordered a permanent halt to most of Trump's tariffs and further barred their future modification. A panel of three judges gave the White House 10 days to complete the formal process of stopping the tariffs. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling.

Goldman Sachs economists said the White House has a few tools at its disposal that could ensure the court ruling is only a temporary problem.

""This ruling represents a setback for the administration's tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners,"" Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note.

""For now, we expect the Trump administration will find other ways to impose tariffs,"" they added.

The Wall Street bank said the ruling blocks the 10% baseline tariff imposed by Trump on most imports, as well as the additional duties on China, Canada and Mexico – but not sectoral levies, such as those imposed on steel, aluminum and autos.

The Trump administration nevertheless has other legal means of imposing tariffs, Goldman says, flagging Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930.

Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 does not require a formal investigation and could therefore be one of the swiftest ways to get around the court roadblock.

""The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,"" analysts at Goldman said. They noted, however, that such a move would only last for up to 150 days after which law requires congressional action.

Trump could also swiftly launch Section 301 investigations on key U.S. trading partners, laying the bureaucratic groundwork for tariffs — although Goldman said that this process will likely take several weeks at a minimum.

Section 232 tariffs, which are already in place for steel, aluminum and auto imports, could also be broadened to other sectors. This trade law allows the president to take action against threats to national security.

Section 338, meanwhile, allows the president to impose levies of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. Goldman noted that this particular measure has not been used before.

Michelle Schulz, founder and managing partner at Schulz Trade Law PLLC, echoed the possibility that the Trump administration would seek work-arounds, including looking at ways the White House has imposed tariffs in the past.

""We have had section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods even under the previous administration, which were pretty harsh. So I can imagine that the administration will look at these provisions again and see if they can use 232, or 301, or some other mechanism where, whereby they can enforce the tariffs,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

Schulz also pointed to the fact that such tariffs require investigations.

""I think that's the difference here. All of the tariffs that we're talking about today with IEEPA were issued under executive order and pretty much just by the executive branch,"" she said. ""When you look at these other sections, you're going to have the involvement of the Commerce Department and other agencies investigating whether there really has been damage"" to justify tariff action.

Schulz added that such investigations could take months.

CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

James Ransdell, partner at the law firm Cassidy Levy Kent, said the court opinion marks the first of many other cases still pending — and the first substantive opinion out of federal court ""to really address the meat of the plaintiffs challenge.""

Ransdell said the speed of the Trump administration's appeal was ""very unusual"" and suggests the government could be working through the night to prepare its motion for an emergency stay of the order.

He added that it was ""certainly a possibility"" that the Supreme Court could end up having the last say.

""There is not a lot of precedent on this particular statute and on similar actions by the president, so there might be an interest that the Supreme Court has in taking this up,"" Ransdell told CNBC's ""The China Connection"" on Thursday.

Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, said Trump had a ""very good"" level of understanding of how to play the courts to get what he wants in terms of playing for time.

""The first thing he will probably do is an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court … wanting to get a ruling from them that basically says you can keep these tariffs in place while the appeals process runs through,"" Blitz said Thursday.

""This king-like executive order was always going to, at some point, going to run into the courts. … The difference between being a monarchy and being a constitutional democracy is the legal system,"" he added.

Equity markets around the world broadly rose on Thursday as investors reacted to the legal ruling. Asia-Pacific markets ended the day mostly higher and U.S. futures jumped.

Market reaction in Europe was more muted, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up a mere 0.3% by early afternoon London time. The euro was last seen trading at $1.1285, little changed for the session after paring earlier losses.

Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA, said in a note that the limited market reaction was ""because Trump still has various options to raise tariffs.""

""Things are more complicated but the end goal for Trump remains the same. In politics when there is a will, there is a way,"" he said.

The U.S. dollar rose slightly against major rivals, with the U.S. dollar index up 0.07%. So far this year, the dollar index has tumbled close to 8% amid continued market turmoil.

Senate Republicans will soon debate trillions of tax breaks approved by House lawmakers, including a bigger deduction for small business owners, contractors, freelancers and gig economy workers.  

Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Section 199A deduction for qualified business income, or QBI, is currently worth up to 20% of eligible revenue, with some limitations.

Without action from Congress, the QBI deduction will expire after 2025. But the House Republicans' ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would make the provision permanent and expand the maximum tax break to 23% starting in 2026.

The QBI deduction applies to so-called pass-through businesses, which report profits or losses on individual tax returns.

This includes partnerships and S-corporations, along with some trusts and estates. Sole proprietors, such as freelance, contract and gig economy workers, also qualify.

For 2025, the tax break starts to phase-out when taxable income reaches $197,300 for single filers and $394,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The deduction can be reduced or eliminated completely, depending on your earnings and type of business (more on that below).

For tax year 2022, the most recent data available, there were roughly 25.6 million QBI deduction claims, up from 18.7 million in 2018, the first year of the tax break, according to IRS data. 

However, the deduction has been controversial because ""most of the benefits flow to taxpayers with a lot of income,"" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy.

""These are not taxpayers who work a W-2 job and earn a salary,"" she said. ""They're business owners who receive business profits on their individual tax returns.""

Currently, certain white-collar professionals — doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and others — known as a ""specified service trade or business,"" or SSTB, can't claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits.

There's also an income phase-out for non-SSTB businesses, but that doesn't go to zero.  

The House bill would change the phase-out calculation, which could provide a bigger tax break for certain SSTB owners, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Ben Henry-Moreland, senior financial planning nerd for advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the bill last week.

If enacted, the higher 23% deduction could offer ""some [tax] benefit"" for all income levels, but the phaseout changes would primarily benefit higher-income SSTB owners, he said.

The House proposed QBI deduction changes would be ""more generous and more valuable to higher-income people, especially those in certain industries including lawyers and lobbyists,"" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University Law, wrote in early May.

Chinese startup DeepSeek, which caused shockwaves across markets this year, quietly released an upgraded version of its artificial intelligence reasoning model.

The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade of DeepSeek R1 was released on AI model repository Hugging Face.

DeepSeek rose to prominence this year after its free, open-source R1 reasoning model outperformed offerings from rivals including Meta and OpenAI. The low-cost and short time of development shocked global markets, sparking concerns that U.S. tech giants were overspending on infrastructure and wiping billions of dollars of value of major U.S. tech stocks like AI stalwart Nvidia. These companies have since broadly recovered.

Just as was the case with DeepSeek R1's debut, the upgraded model was also released with little fanfare. It is a reasoning model, which means the AI can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process.

The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics.

""DeepSeek's latest upgrade is sharper on reasoning, stronger on math and code, and closing in on top-tier models like Gemini and O3,"" Adina Yakefu, AI researcher at Hugging Face, told CNBC.

The upgraded model has ""major improvements in inference and hallucination reduction,"" Yakefu said, adding that ""this version shows DeepSeek is not just catching up, it's competing."" Hallucination refers to AI that provides incorrect information.

DeepSeek has become the poster child of how Chinese artificial intelligence is still developing despite U.S. attempts to restrict the country's access to chips and other technology. This month, Chinese technology giants Baidu and Tencent revealed how they were making their AI models more efficient to deal with U.S. semiconductor export curbs.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, which designs the graphics processing units required to train huge AI models, slammed U.S. export controls on Wednesday.

""The U.S. has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips,"" Huang said. ""That assumption was always questionable, and now it's clearly wrong.""

""The question is not whether China will have AI,"" Huang added. ""It already does.""

In this article

United Airlines has a new friend in Queens.

The airline plans to return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport again, this time through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways.

The partnership, called Blue Sky, will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and let JetBlue customers earn frequent flyer miles on United and vice versa. It also includes reciprocal loyalty benefits like priority boarding and roomier seats for travelers with elite status. The deal is subject to regulatory review, the airlines said.

Some aspects of the partnership, which the carriers announced Thursday, will begin as early as the fall, though the airlines didn't provide exact timing. They also did not provide financial details of the deal.

JetBlue's leaders have long said they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and their shared rival Delta Air Lines, the most profitable U.S. carrier.

United CEO Scott Kirby told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday that in addition to the JFK access, the airlines together will have the largest presence in Boston and that United will be able to extend its reach in Florida and the Caribbean, where JetBlue has a robust network. In turn, JetBlue loyalists will get access to United's globe-spanning destinations.

""It makes each airline more competitive,"" Kirby said.

The new partnership stops short of the flight coordination that JetBlue had in its former alliance in the Northeast with American Airlines, which was struck down by a federal court on antitrust grounds two years ago. Last year, a judge blocked JetBlue's plan to buy struggling budget carrier Spirit.

""This collaboration with United is a bold step forward for the industry — one that brings together twocustomer-focused airlines to deliver more choices for travelers and value across our networks,"" JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty said in a news release.

United left JFK in 2015, and Kirby has called that a mistake because moving transcontinental flights to Newark, New Jersey, allowed American to win over some corporate clients. It briefly returned in 2021, thanks to a Covid-era lull in traffic at the airport, where capacity is normally tightly controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration.

United left JFK again in 2022 because it wasn't able to secure longer-term slots there.

Kirby has repeatedly said he wants the airline to return to JFK. The carrier has struggled in recent weeks with air traffic staffing shortages and congestion at its Newark hub.

Under the new agreement, United will be able to fly up to seven daily round-trip flights at congested Kennedy Airport, giving it more breadth in the New York City area, though the new operation will still be dwarfed by United's main hub in the area at Newark Liberty International Airport.

United's JFK flights will begin in 2027 at the earliest, the carriers said. JetBlue, meanwhile, will get eight flights at Newark. United didn't say which routes it plans to operate at JFK, though its last foray was for service to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

They airlines called the swap a ""net neutral exchange.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","The U.S. government's new strategic reserve: Billions in seized crypto","https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/05/29/bitcoin-strategic-reserve-crypto-trump/","Thu, 29 May 2025 16:30:00 GMT","

Some crypto insiders have mixed feelings about the White House and Treasury embracing digital cash invented to escape government oversight.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March that boosted the spirits of cryptocurrency investors — and created a digital money mystery.

Trump directed the treasury secretary to create two national stockpiles of crypto assets, putting digital currencies alongside gold, foreign currencies and other assets in the U.S. reserve.

The assets are to include crypto seized by federal agencies in criminal or civil proceedings. But the government has not disclosed how much bitcoin, or which other crypto coins, it holds.

New data on what crypto cash the U.S. government has seized may now provide some answers. It suggests the crypto reserves will together hold more than $21 billion in cryptocurrency.

Trump ordered the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump described as “a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold,” and a separate U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile to hold other cryptocurrencies. The stockpile will be funded with whatever crypto assets the Treasury holds other than bitcoin, leaving the stockpile's composition to be largely determined by a mixture of chance and criminal conduct.

That unconventional method for selecting government financial holdings had the benefit of making the reserves cost-neutral for the taxpayer. It also provided a way to estimate what exactly might go into the two pools before results are released from an official accounting of U.S. crypto holdings that is underway.

Because government seizures are disclosed in court documents, news releases and other sources, crypto-tracking firms can use those notices to monitor which digital assets the U.S. government holds.

Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, reviewed cryptocurrency wallets that appear to be associated with the U.S. government for The Washington Post. The company estimated how much bitcoin it holds, and the other crypto tokens in its top 20 digital holdings as of May 13, by tracking transactions involving those wallets.

The United States' top 20 crypto holdings according to Chainalysis are worth about $20.9 billion as of 3 p.m. Eastern on May 28, with $20.4 billion in bitcoin and about $493 million in other digital assets. It has been scooped up from crimes such as stolen funds, scams and sales on dark net markets.

Those estimates put the U.S. government's top crypto holdings at less than the approximately $25 billion worth of oil held in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Their value is nearly double the Fed's listing for U.S. gold holdings, although that figure uses outdated pricing and would be over $850 billion at current prices.

The Treasury declined to comment on U.S. government crypto holdings.

Before Trump's order established the crypto reserves, the U.S. government had not had a cohesive plan for handling its digital assets, said Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research lead at Chainalysis. It had regularly off-loaded pieces of its digital holdings through asset sales and restitution to crime victims, he said, apparently in part because crypto wasn't an asset it was considered strategic.

The crypto tokens headed for the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile according to the Chainalysis list include ethereum, the world's second-largest digital asset, and a string of other crypto tokens with punier name recognition.

They include derivatives of bitcoin and ethereum that mirror those cryptocurrencies' prices, several stable coins designed to be pegged in value to the U.S. dollar, and 10 tokens tied to specific companies, including the cryptocurrency exchanges FTX, which imploded in 2022 after defrauding customers, and Binance.

The 20 tokens on the list are generally those with the largest market capitalizations in the $1.3 trillion crypto industry. Trump's March 2 Truth Social post that announced his intention to establish the reserves said they would include XRP, Solana and Cardano, causing their prices to jump, but none feature in Chainalysis's estimate of the top 20 tokens held by the government.

Trump's order said creating the reserves would centralize disparate government crypto caches and that “there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.” Economists have warned that national reserves of cryptocurrency are likely to benefit only existing investors in the coins selected for inclusion, who could reap profits if the U.S. government's endorsement causes prices to increase.

There is broad support for the digital reserves from the crypto industry, which Trump has embraced. Lawsuits and investigations into crypto firms by federal regulators have melted away since his return to office. Last week, the president dined with top investors of a meme coin named after him that generates profits for Trump and his family.

Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a crypto infrastructure company, said in an interview that the bitcoin reserve provides the industry a reputational boost, signaling the U.S. government considers crypto a safe-haven asset, like gold, currencies and government bonds.

Nazarov was not aware his company's own crypto token, LINK, appears to have a good shot at landing in the Digital Asset Stockpile until The Washington Post informed him. He called the coin's potential inclusion “a generally positive thing.”

Chainalysis estimates the government holds about $1.5 million worth of the token, which has a market capitalization of over $10 billion, placing it among the top 20 crypto tokens by value.

Not everyone in the crypto community favors the U.S. government anointing cryptocurrency as a strategic national asset.

“The original spirit” of crypto, Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of ethereum, said in a March interview with The Washington Post, “is about counterbalancing power,” including government and corporate power.

Bitcoin, the first widely adopted cryptocurrency, was created during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, amid deep skepticism about traditional finance. Buterin is excited about the idea of governments embracing certain aspects of crypto technology. But the movement becoming too closely associated to “one particular government team or even a particular corporate team,” he said, could violate crypto's original mission of decentralization and openness.

Austin Campbell, a professor at New York University's business school and a principal at crypto advisory firm Zero Knowledge, sees hypocrisy in crypto enthusiasts cheering the government's strategic reserves. The bitcoin community in particular “has historically been about freedom from sovereign interference,” he said.

Campbell argues the U.S. government could put seized crypto coins — and its gold — to better use, by filling in some of the national debt or reducing spending. He would not oppose a crypto reserve, he said, if the United States were running a budget surplus.

Trump's use of an executive order bypassed congressional debate on crypto reserves but state lawmakers attempting to establish similar reserves have gotten mixed results.

New Hampshire and Arizona's governors this month signed bills paving the way for state crypto reserves.

Other states — including Florida, Oklahoma and Wyoming — have rejected or postponed similar bills. One common concern has been that cryptocurrencies are more volatile than many conventional financial assets.

A 2024 Pew Research Center report found that 17 percent of Americans have invested in, traded or used crypto. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, the figure was 29 percent. Some younger investors even consider highly speculative meme coins to be their generation's best shot at the American Dream.

One challenge to consumer adoption of crypto has been the need to invent tools and services to make it easy to manage digital assets. Owning crypto depends on a private cryptographic key a few dozen characters long — making it easy to transfer funds but also to lose them or get scammed.

Some crypto enthusiasts and institutions store bitcoin in special devices not connected to the internet, to stop hacks. The U.S. government has lost some of its seized crypto dating back to the takedown of the Silk Road dark net marketplace in 2013.

“The government has built better and better processes of managing crypto assets over time, but there have still been some mistakes,” Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview this month.

The Department of Justice announced in July 2024 that it had awarded a five-year contract to Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, to provide crypto custody and trading services for its cryptocurrency assets. The company declined to comment further on the U.S. crypto reserves.

Levin predicts there will now be “a greater level of sophistication” applied to managing and securing the government's reserves.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","cryptocurrency"

When it comes to stockpiling Bitcoin, U.S. states aren't just racing against each other, according to New Hampshire Rep. Keith Ammon (R). He believes that they are also competing against the federal government, which will be forced to print money to limit the impact of ballooning U.S. debt.

In an interview with Decrypt, Ammon said that states should be closely tracking the amount of money that the federal government has borrowed to keep Washington humming. On Thursday, that sum totalled roughly $37 trillion, according to the U.S. Debt Clock.

Ammon carries a small device in his pocket displaying that metric, which updates by the millisecond, growing by the thousands.

“The state is tied to this debt because we are tied to the U.S. dollar,” he said. “The only way out of this debt is for the federal government to print more money [and] devalue the currency, so that this debt isn't worth as much over time. That's what every government does.”

Earlier this month, New Hampshire became the first U.S. state to sign a bill into law enabling it to start accumulating Bitcoin. A day later, Arizona passed a similar initiative. Texas could also be on the precipice of establishing its own strategic Bitcoin reserve, yet several states have rejected Bitcoin-related bills since the White House began moving in that direction.

“That's a big state,” Ammon, who first became a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2014. “I just think it would snowball from there.”

Ammon is among lawmakers that increasingly view the U.S. debt levels as unsustainable. Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott recently opposed U.S. President Donalds Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill this week, namely because it does not do enough to reign in massive deficits.

Ammon proposed his Bitcoin bill as a way to shield the Granite State from a constant decline in the dollar's purchasing power. Fiscal policy is largely a national issue, but Ammon has seen the impact of poor management firsthand, down to the county level.

“Every budget is blown out because the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has eroded 25% in the last four years,” he said. “If a state is going to survive, it's got to figure out how to navigate that.”

That doesn't mean New Hampshire is going all in on Bitcoin with its pension plans and trusts. Ammon's bill empowers the state's treasurer, charged with overseeing revenue and finances, to allocate a small percentage of resources to Bitcoin that's constantly rebalanced. Taking on too much risk could affect the state's overall credit rating, he added.

“If you go off like Yosemite Sam, putting everything into Bitcoin, that rating is going to drop, and then your cost to borrow money is going to go way up,” he said. “You want to have a little bit of risk, but not so much.”

Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin on the digital currency market, has made significant gains as it decoupled from Bitcoin (BTC). In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has increased in value, with a price gain of over 3%, as against Bitcoin, which declined by 0.9%.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum is worth $2,722.89, representing a 3.45% increase as press time. The asset rallied from $2,611.16 and rose rapidly to $2,784.75 as investors favored Ethereum on the broader market.

Buterin: Ethereum Needs to Be Resilient and Private 

ByAlex Dovbnya





This development saw Ethereum's trading volume spike by a significant 21.16%, or $26.54 billion, within the same time frame. Comparatively, Bitcoin only managed a 1.36% increase in trading volume as investors stayed cautious.

This indicates that Ethereum has begun to ascend independent of Bitcoin's performance on the crypto market. The current price surge is a bullish sign for investors and holders alike, as ETH has experienced intense volatility in the last seven days.

Notably, Ethereum saw its price plunge to a low of $2,482, when Bitcoin was recording massive gains and hit a peak of $111,763.

The top altcoin appears to have commenced its rally to hit the $3,000 target. A technical analysis of Ethereum shows it is gearing up for a potential breakout if the ecosystem sustains the current momentum.

If Ethereum breaches the $3,000 price level, bullish momentum could push it toward the $4,500 and $5,300 range. The asset's chart shows that its long-term ascending channel is still in play, and if trading volume remains high, ETH might achieve these targets.

The ecosystem's investors might support these price targets as the community remains bullish. As U.Today reported, Ethereum recently posted massive open interest of $19.1 billion. This indicates that investors and traders are betting on a further increase in the value of ETH.

New York, May  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — XBIT DEX Exchange has officially announced the implementation of the Ethereum-based Pectra protocol upgrade.

Pectra Protocol Upgrade: Technological Innovation

The Pectra protocol upgrade introduces several core technical improvements to XBIT. By adopting a Multi-Dimensional Consensus Algorithm, XBIT significantly increases transaction throughput and confirmation efficiency without compromising on decentralization. Moreover, the Pectra upgrade enhances the flexibility of smart contract execution, supporting a wide range of assets and cross-chain transactions, greatly improving the platform's scalability and user experience.

Reshaping the Cryptocurrency Trading Ecosystem

XBIT's Pectra upgrade is set to reshape the current cryptocurrency trading landscape.

XBIT breaks this bottleneck through the Pectra protocol, dramatically increasing transaction speed, reducing fees, and enhancing cross-chain capabilities. The upgraded XBIT will enable users to trade across multiple chains more efficiently, driving the growth of the DEX market share.

Bitcoin (BTC) failed to rally after repeated bullish announcements at the Bitcoin Conference 2025. BTC price is declining slightly on Thursday, trading above $107,100 at the time of writing. While Bitcoin traders were unimpressed by the recent market updates, Ethereum (ETH) price climbed to its highest level since February 2025 before retreating. 

Experts believe there is a structural rotation in the current market cycle and Ethereum could rally higher. Traders are watching the psychologically important $3,000 target for ETH. 

Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas brought together BTC believers, holders, maximalists and some of the biggest names supporting BTC, including US Vice President JD Vance and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Bitcoin traders were visibly unimpressed with the bullish statements and assurances, as headlines have been recycled several times since January 2025 with little action to show for it. 

BTC trades at $107,100 at the time of writing. While BTC trades less than 5% away from its all-time high at $111,980, technical indicators on the daily timeframe flash mixed signals. 

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line, implying an underlying bearish momentum in Bitcoin price trend. Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 62 and is sloping upward, supporting a likelihood of gains in Bitcoin price. 

A key support level is $102,314, the upper boundary of a Fair Value Gap (FVG) on the BTC/USDT daily price chart.

Despite bullish headlines, there's no significant rally in Bitcoin, while Ethereum, Ethereum-based tokens like staking and Layer 2 tokens and AI tokens rallied in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. 

 Ethereum rallied to $2,788 on Thursday, marking its highest level since February 2025, before retreating to the $2,640 level at the time of writing. The ETH/BTC pair climbed 6% from its local lows with the rally and Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, says that the gain in the pair was not retail-driven. 

Kooner said: 

“The SBET Ethereum Treasury announcement is a key catalyst. The ETH/BTC reversal signals a shift in dominance—early-stage moves that often precede broader altcoin outperformance. The fact that this strength is happening alongside, not after, BTC price acceleration makes it especially bullish: capital isn't exiting Bitcoin, it's compounding across L1s. This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins.”

Derivatives data from Coinglass shows the long/short ratio on derivatives exchanges like Binance and OKX exceeds 1, meaning more traders are taking long positions than short. Derivatives traders are betting on an increase in the Ethereum price.

Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet: 

“Whales have accumulated 1.4 million ETH since April, reducing exchange supply and applying upward pressure. Ethereum could target $3,000–$3,400 in the near term after its break above $2,700. The momentum will depend on volume trends, macro conditions, and continued institutional support.​​”

Solana's uptrend is generally steady, rising slightly to trade at $172 at the time of writing on Thursday. Interest in the smart contracts token continues to grow despite the recent delay in approving the related SOL spot Exchange Traded Fund.

Bitcoin edges up slightly but remains between the $106,000 support level and the $110,000 resistance level. Sentiment in crypto markets improves after a US court ruled Trump tariffs are unlawful.

Pepe is up over 6% at press time on Thursday after US President Donald Trump shared a post on Truth Social with the frog mascot in the background, igniting new hype and hinting at a potential breakout from a consolidation range for bullish follow-through.

Bitcoin price increases slightly to trade above $108,000 on Thursday after dipping over the last two days. Crypto markets turn risk-positive after a US court blocked US President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $111,000 on Friday after reaching a new all-time high of $111,900 this week. Corporate accumulation, institutional demand, signs of easing regulations and fiscal woes in the US have fueled BTC's rally.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","XRP's profitability surges over 90%, outpacing Ethereum, Chainlink, and others","https://cryptoslate.com/xrps-profitability-surges-over-90-outpacing-ethereum-chainlink-and-others/","Thu, 29 May 2025 12:09:00 GMT","

XRP's on-chain profitability suggests investor confidence despite recent price dip and SEC case developments.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

More than 90% of XRP's supply is currently profitable, even though the token's price has remained relatively flat for the past three months.

Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals that most of XRP's circulating supply was acquired at lower price points than its current market value.

This level of profitability places XRP ahead of several major altcoins. For comparison, only 71.5% of Ethereum, 77.9% of Dogecoin, 71.0% of Cardano, and 80.5% of Chainlink holdings are in profit.

However, XRP trails only Bitcoin, which leads with 98.4% of its circulating supply in the green.

Analysts at Santiment explained that this profitability metric is often used to assess investor sentiment. According to them, a higher percentage of profitable wallets can lead to near-term sell pressure as holders take profits.

But when most investors are at a loss, markets often show signs of fear or undervaluation, which can attract new buyers and long-term capital.

Still, despite a recent 6% dip in XRP's price this week, the strong on-chain profitability could indicate a foundation for a potential rebound.

Market analysts suggest developments beyond price charts could catalyze XRP's next growth phase.

Ripple's drawn-out case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has essentially resolved, lifting a significant overhang from the token.

However, progress on that front recently slowed because Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint motion due to procedural issues. 

Nevertheless, the broader market sentiment on the XRP remains largely positive because the token has drawn notable attention.

For context, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has revealed plans to establish a $121 million XRP-backed treasury. This development marks a first for a US-listed public company and reinforces the belief in XRP.

In addition, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is experiencing rapid expansion within its ecosystem, as evidenced by its adoption by major institutions.

This month, the Dubai Land Department tapped the blockchain network to power a real estate tokenization project.

At the same time, new stablecoin products have also launched on the network, expanding its utility across fintech and traditional financial institutions.

Moreover, the institutional appetite for XRP-related trading products is rising.

This is evidenced by the fact that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recently introduced XRP futures products, and the US SEC is currently considering multiple filings for a spot XRP ETF.

Together, these developments suggest growing institutional confidence and a broader push toward XRP adoption, which could bolster its price.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","‘End of Bear Market'","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/05/28/end-of-bear-market-analyst-says-altcoins-about-to-shine-updates-forecast-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum/","Thu, 29 May 2025 00:01:27 GMT","

A crypto strategist thinks that altcoins are about to upstage Bitcoin (BTC) after years of languishing in the background.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the period of altcoin underperformance against Bitcoin is almost over based on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart.

The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A bearish BTC.D indicates that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin.

According to Van de Poppe, altcoins are now poised to outpace Bitcoin as the BTC.D chart is flashing a bearish reversal signal on the weekly chart.

“The end of the bear market (yes, a bear market on altcoins underperforming Bitcoin) is still here.

Strong bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance, implying we're about to reverse and altcoins about to shine.

Nothing has changed.” 

At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.89%.

Looking at Bitcoin, the trader thinks BTC will retest a key psychological area as support before rallying to fresh record-high levels.

“I'm monitoring the current price action and I won't be surprised if we're seeing a slight correction happening on Bitcoin.

Probably macro-driven or whatever reason, but I wouldn't be surprised to build some more stamina before we continue the rally to $120,000-$130,000.” 

At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $109,112.

As for Ethereum (ETH), the analyst says a correction toward the $2,000 price level would present a solid opportunity for long-term investors.

“Similarly, I think it's vital that, if ETH drops beneath $2,400, that will give a tremendous opportunity.

Ethereum rallied from $1,800 to $2,700 in a few days. If there's a 10-20% correction, pretty normal, great opportunity to get yourself positioned into it.”

At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,663.

Bitcoin Stalls, But Macro Trend Strengthens



Bitcoin remains locked in a tight range around $107,000, consolidating just below resistance. Though momentum feels slow, BTC continues to close above the daily TBO Cloud. Each day spent above that cloud contributes to the curling upward of the TBO Slow line, reinforcing a growing bullish macro trend. Traders eager for an immediate breakout must remember past patterns—patience is often rewarded in extended bullish setups.



Ethereum Shows Outperformance and Bullish Structure



Ethereum has taken the spotlight over the last several days, outperforming BTC in both price action and technical structure. The weekly RSI is pushing toward 70, an important threshold that would confirm long-term bullish momentum. Despite some weakness in ETH/BTC volume, the real test will be whether it can break above the 0.236 Fibonacci level. On a broader timeframe, ETH/BTC remains below the weekly TBO Cloud, keeping it technically in “strong bearish” territory.

Bitcoin Dominance Slips, Giving Altcoins Room to Breathe



BTC.D has fallen back into the daily TBO Cloud, signaling a return to bearish consolidation. This shift is allowing altcoins to stage short-term recoveries, especially as Top 10 Dominance lags and OTHERS.D continues to look increasingly strong. A second TBO Close Short on the 4-hour chart for OTHERS.D, printed above support, supports a short-term bullish thesis for ALTs—assuming BTC doesn't suddenly steal back market attention.

ETH Dominance Breaks Out of Long-Term Resistance



ETH.D has made a notable move above the daily TBO Cloud for the first time since June 2024. This breakout is significant given its prolonged bearish structure and reinforces Ethereum's leadership role in the current altcoin cycle. The development could mark a longer period of ETH-driven altcoin strength if BTC remains steady.

TOTAL Market Cap Chart Holds Steady at Resistance



The TOTAL crypto market cap chart has yet to challenge the long-term overhead resistance from January but continues to print a strong setup. Two recent TBO Breakouts remain in play. The weekly view is even more encouraging, with price far above the TBO Cloud, RSI above 70, OBV trending higher, and weekly volume approaching its moving average line.

OTHERS Market Cap Faces Resistance, But Volume Supports Upside



OTHERS is testing a new resistance trendline but has already pierced it once, suggesting bullish momentum is brewing. While the weekly chart lacks confirmation with a sub-60 RSI and a fight to stay above the weekly TBO Cloud, increasing volume and rising OBV are notable bullish developments. Traders should watch for continued momentum, especially if BTC stays steady.

Volatility Drops, Opening Opportunity



BVOL7D has dropped back into its Bounce Zone, typically signaling reduced volatility. This is generally a good sign for altcoins, which tend to flourish in periods of relative BTC calm. If BVOL7D remains low, the market could be primed for broader participation in the next move.

Altcoins Mixed: Strength from UNI, APT, and TON



XRP and SOL continue to show weakness on their daily charts, while TON saw a notable pump following a partnership announcement between Telegram and xAI. XMR suffered a -13% drop, likely due to market manipulation, but remains within range. UNI is showing strength alongside ETH, and APT is once again above resistance, which needs to hold for further upside. A variety of altcoins—including TIA—are printing TBO Close Short clusters on the 4h, a common precursor to short-term bounces.

Keep a Plan in Place—More Room Left in the Bull Market



Even with resistance stalling major moves in BTC, the broader crypto market remains strong. SPX6900 has hit a local high and is moving toward historical resistance, another signal of bullish strength. Traders are advised to take profits selectively and resist the urge to fully exit positions too early. With 4–5 months of the bull market potentially remaining and many altcoins yet to make substantial moves, the opportunity window is still wide open.

This month, four altcoins are standing out from the crowd, each offering a unique angle on the future of blockchain. These projects draw serious attention, whether through real-world asset tokenization, privacy protection, lightning-fast DeFi infrastructure, or scalable Ethereum alternatives. But only one is making waves for offering the kind of asymmetric upside that can redefine a portfolio in weeks, not years.

If there's one project capturing the imagination of early investors right now, it's Rexas Finance (RXS). The project has already delivered a 566% return from its presale floor of $0.03 to its current price of $0.20, and momentum shows no signs of slowing. With over $48.6 million raised and over 92% of tokens sold, the clock is ticking toward its highly anticipated launch on June 19, 2025, at $0.25. But the appeal goes far beyond presale hype. Rexas is positioning itself to dominate one of the largest untapped crypto markets: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Tokenizing real-world assets like property, commodities, and art, Rexas enables fractional ownership for sectors once dominated by the super-rich.. This model removes traditional barriers like high capital requirements and illiquidity, making blue-chip assets accessible to anyone. The numbers speak volumes: the RWA sector is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, and Rexas is positioning itself as a major on-ramp to that market. Its growing ecosystem includes tools like the Rexas Token Builder, AI-powered smart contract auditing, and a Launchpad designed to bring tokenized assets to market quickly and securely. For investors looking for a project with real utility, explosive growth potential, and a product already in motion, Rexas Finance stands out as the rare opportunity where both vision and execution are aligned. If demand holds post-launch, analysts believe RXS could climb into double-digit territory, offering the kind of returns early Solana or Avalanche investors enjoyed just a few years ago.

While newer projects chase hype and headlines, Monero (XMR) continues to do what it does best: offer ironclad privacy in a digital world trending toward surveillance. With governments increasingly scrutinizing blockchain transactions and centralized exchanges clamping down on withdrawals, Monero's use case has never been more relevant. More than just a “dark web” currency, Monero offers legitimate, secure, and censorship-resistant transactions. It's trusted by privacy advocates, developers, and users who demand true financial sovereignty. Despite lacking flashy marketing campaigns, Monero's consistent demand and loyal community keep it on savvy investors' radar, especially during geopolitical tension or regulatory uncertainty.

Designed from the ground up for high-speed decentralized finance, SEI is building a layer-one blockchain where sub-second finality isn't a bonus, it's the baseline. As DeFi platforms demand faster transaction times and greater scalability, SEI is emerging as a foundational infrastructure solution. Explicitly optimized for orderbook-based trading and complex financial apps, SEI allows decentralized protocols to match the performance of centralized exchanges. Projects building on SEI are already proving that speed and decentralization coexist—a rare combination that could make SEI essential to the next wave of DeFi growth. With crypto moving from speculative playground to real financial infrastructure, SEI offers a rare case of a Layer 1 that solves a real problem.

If you want Ethereum's security without Ethereum's gas fees, Polygon (MATIC) remains the clear choice. As one of the most established Layer 2 ecosystems, Polygon is leveraging zkEVM technology, expanding enterprise partnerships, and staying tightly integrated with Ethereum development. Polygon's modular structure means developers can create purpose-built blockchains that remain interoperable with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. From tokenized assets to NFTs and stablecoins, Polygon continues to deliver speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency—all without compromising decentralization. In May 2025, Polygon sees growing interest from institutional players exploring real-world applications, further validating its staying power as a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure.

While Monero, SEI, and Polygon each offer powerful value propositions, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands in a league of its own this May. With a revolutionary approach to real-world asset tokenization, an explosive presale trajectory, and a clear roadmap into a trillion-dollar market, RXS combines utility with unmatched upside.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-african-innovators-are-using-blockchain-to-solve-real-problems","Thu, 29 May 2025 13:32:33 GMT","

 While regulators in Europe and the US debate crypto's future, young Africans are already using blockchain to solve pressing challenges from unstable currencies to internet access. 

While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it's a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. 

The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare's Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.

“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. 

In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.

Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya's E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets.

“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. 

Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.

Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It's self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.

Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don't need a middleman. It's fair and trackable,” he said.

Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic:

NFTs, those authentic digital assets, no longer shine like they did in 2021. Despite recent peaks in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, enthusiasm has largely faded. Once celebrated by celebrities and collectors, their market is collapsing. The situation is alarming, as revealed by DappRadar: volumes are free-falling, NFT loans have dropped dramatically, and activity is experiencing massive decline. Yet, the emergence of real-world assets tokenized (RWA) brings new hope, offering prospects for stabilization and revival for this crypto industry in full transformation.

The NFT market is undergoing a deep crisis, showing a 63% drop in the first quarter of 2025, and NFT loans are no exception. According to DappRadar, the total loan volume fell from one billion dollars in January 2024 to 50 million in May 2025, a drop of 97%. Activity follows the same trend: the number of borrowers decreased by 90%, lenders by 78%. Sara Gherghelas, analyst at DappRadar, states:

2025 has not yet brought sufficient catalysts to revive NFT loans.

The average loan size dropped by 71%, falling from 22,000 dollars in 2022 to 4,000 dollars in May 2025. The average loan duration also decreased, from 40 to 31 days. These developments reflect a more frequent use of short-term loans, a sign of a more cautious approach in the crypto world.

On the side of collections used as collateral, Pudgy Penguins dominate with 40% of loans, followed by Azuki and BAYC. On the rapidly growing GONDI platform, CryptoPunks and art NFTs attract attention. This trend marks a shift towards assets considered more stable and culturally relevant.

In short, the crypto community seems to be moving away from speculative models toward a more reasoned approach. However, without major innovation, the sector risks stagnation.

Real-world assets (RWA), or tokenized tangible assets, could reverse the trend. These NFTs linked to tangible assets, such as real estate or financial instruments, bring stability and trust. According to DappRadar, they represent one of the few catalysts capable of reviving the NFT loan market. Sara Gherghelas explains:

NFTs backed by real assets could unlock more stable and trustworthy collateral sources.

These innovations allow overcoming the limits of purely digital NFTs, which are often too volatile. By integrating RWAs, the crypto world can create hybrid financial products offering security and liquidity. This evolution also opens the door for broader adoption by traditional investors.

Protocols are beginning to explore these possibilities by developing smart infrastructures. For example, under-collateralized loans, credit scores, and artificial intelligence are being considered to enhance user experience. Thus, tokenization of real assets stands as a fundamental lever for the future of decentralized finance.

NFT loans allow holders of unique tokens to obtain liquidity without selling their assets. These loans can be peer-to-peer through NFT platforms or peer-to-protocol directly with smart contracts. A notable example is using a NFT representing a luxury watch as collateral, enabling a $35,000 loan in DeFi.

The appeal of NFT loans lies in the absence of traditional credit checks, opening the door to greater inclusion in the crypto realm. However, NFT volatility and regulatory uncertainty pose major risks. In case of default, the NFT is transferred to the lender, who may liquidate or keep it.

Fractionalization of NFTs further enriches this market by making expensive assets accessible to a broader community. Combined with RWAs, this technology offers a new dimension to decentralized finance.

A few key figures summarize the current situation:

This transformation shows the crypto industry is restructuring, seeking more solidity and maturity.

NFTs backed by real-world assets (RWA) and NFT bonds open new investment horizons, according to Cointribune. These innovations could give the NFT market a second life, combining utility, security, and broader access within the crypto community.

A report by technical staff found NFT-based revenue generation was technically possible but impractical due to legal risks and high costs

North Korea conducted covert experiments from January through May in China to test whether it could generate foreign currency through NFTs based on its unique content.

A Daily NK source said recently that “several technical staff from the Korea Computer Center disguised themselves as trade representatives starting in late January, rented multiple locations in China, and experimented with earning foreign currency by selling NFT (Non-Fungible Token) works on NFT marketplaces.”

The source added that “the technical staff submitted their final report to North Korea on May 19 and have since withdrawn.”

The experiment was part of North Korea's efforts to secure new foreign currency revenue streams. The technical staff, divided into groups of two to three people, spent about five months in various Chinese cities accessing overseas networks to examine technical feasibility and profitability.

“North Korea was more interested in the marketplace platforms where NFTs are traded and structures that allow anonymous asset transfers than in NFTs themselves,” the source said. “They experimented with methods to conceal actual ownership through blockchain wallets and manage NFT assets and profits by registering under third-country corporate names.”

According to the source, the technical staff converted unique content such as Mount Kumgang landscape photos, Goryeo celadon images and internal maps of North Korean mines into digital NFTs. They attempted to register and sell these on Southeast Asian NFT marketplaces in Thailand and the Philippines, where identity verification requirements are less stringent.

The staff rented multiple locations under the names of a tourism and leisure company registered in Beijing and a real estate development company registered in Zhuzhou, Hunan province, where they conducted their experiments. After completing their final report on May 19, they withdrew, leaving behind no personnel or materials.

“The technical staff's final report included an explanation that ‘coins are digital currency operating on blockchain, while NFTs are digital assets or vouchers placed on top of that,'” the source said. “While technical feasibility was confirmed, they concluded there were institutional and practical limitations to generating profits.”

The report found that while NFT-based foreign currency generation was technically possible, various problems existed including legal risks in China, instability of Southeast Asian NFT marketplaces and high operating costs relative to profits, making it impractical as an immediate revenue source.

“While there were expectations within North Korea that this could become a new foreign currency acquisition method to evade sanctions, the technical staff determined it was inefficient,” the source said.

“This was just one experiment among various foreign currency strategies. While it's unlikely to be used as a practical revenue method in the near term, further research based on this five-month experiment and report is expected to continue.”

Crypto World News

May 29, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

The Tron price prediction is heating up as TRX shows signs of renewed momentum. With more DeFi projects and NFT platforms choosing to build on the Tron network, analysts say the coin could surge toward the $1.50 mark. 

Tron's low fees and fast transactions make it attractive for developers and users alike, especially in emerging markets. If adoption continues to grow at this pace, TRX may finally break past its long-standing resistance and reach new highs in the coming months.

Early May brought a major milestone for Tron. USDT's supply topped $150 billion, and the altcoin now holds nearly half of that at 48.57%, overtaking Ethereum. That shift has caught the attention of traders.

Tron currently trades at around $0.27 after a modest 1% daily uptick and a 12% monthly gain. Analysts view this gradual increase as a sign of growing trust in the network.

Source: TradingView

One of the key factors for Tron's rapid rise is its new partnership with Rumble Cloud. This alliance strengthens the network by moving it away from traditional cloud services and onto a more sovereign, decentralized setup. By using Rumble's cloud tech, Tron adds another layer of resilience to its infrastructure.

Tether also recently minted $2 billion worth of USDT on Tron, reinforcing its role in stablecoin transactions. However, it's not just about volume. Tron is gaining ground in DeFi and NFTs, attracting developers and users who seek faster and more cost-effective tools.

If adoption keeps rising, Tron has a real shot at hitting $1.50 sooner than expected. 

Fresh figures from Token Terminal show Tron is now handling over $611 billion in monthly USDT transactions and more than 65 million transfers. Also, USDT supply on the Tron network has ballooned to roughly $77.7 billion. These numbers point to a platform that's growing fast in the stablecoin market.

Source: Token Terminal

TRX is drawing stronger interest from traders who are beginning to pay attention to the network's real usage. Meanwhile, Ethereum's hold is slipping after its brief USDT surge, making room for Tron's steady advance.

Practical factors, including low fees, high transaction speeds, and a growing user base, are fueling Tron's rise. However, it's the network's consistency that's setting it apart in a space that moves quickly.

Experts watching the shift say Tron's stablecoin dominance could be just the start. If growth keeps tracking this way, TRX may head higher than many expect.

Tron's network strength and TRX's steady rise have many watching closely. Nonetheless, Remittix is taking a different approach by offering a way for users to send cryptocurrency as fiat directly to bank accounts. Whether it's paying bills or sending money abroad, the platform supports over 100 cryptos and more than 30 fiat currencies. 

At its core is RTX, the native token now in presale at $0.0781. An audited wallet system secures the RTX token and offers staking rewards ranging from 4% to 8% annually. That setup appeals to users looking for both utility and long-term value.

Remittix stands out by doing what most projects promise but rarely deliver bridging digital assets with everyday financial needs. This kind of traction puts RTX in serious contender territory.

Remittix is addressing real problems with a functional crypto-to-fiat system and growing rapidly. Over $15.4 million has been raised and a $250,000 giveaway is live for early holders. With strong utility and early traction, now's the time to get in.

Sectors

Home / Insights

In data protection terms, the old Chinese curse means the ICO or an EU supervisory authority landing. And in 2024, that became a reality for thousands of organisations.

The ICO received nearly 35,000 complaints — and issued enforcement action across a wide range of sectors.

Most complaints don't lead to fines, but we still saw significant penalties, including:

So, drawing on these regulatory actions, what are the key compliance lessons we can take into 2025?

Here are our top 10 takeaways — with a practical focus on managing regulatory risk:

1 – Maintain robust cybersecurity

Cyber-attacks don't just target the under-prepared — big brands like M&S, Harrods and Co-op have all been hit. Regulators expect you to have MFA, up-to-date patching, and vulnerability scanning in place — even if you outsource IT. As the Advanced Computer Software case showed, processors are now directly accountable under UK GDPR.

2 – Respond to data breaches

The law requires breach notifications within 72 hours of becoming aware — not after your forensics team finishes. A personal data breach is not just a hacking attack. The most common data breaches are misdirected emails, and lost devices with unencrypted data. But not all breaches are notifiable. You only need to notify the ICO if the breach is likely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms (e.g. identity theft, financial loss, or reputational harm). If the risk is high, you must also inform the affected individuals without undue delay. Have a clear incident response plan in place so you don't have to make it up as you go along against a ticking clock. And remember to record all breaches in an internal log, even if notifiable.

3 – Handle DSARs properly

Over 40% of UK complaints were about subject access. Many organisations fail to identify informal DSARs that don't mention “GDPR” — but still count. Train staff and use an internal DSAR policy to ensure timely and compliant responses.

 4 – Take care when relying on consent or legitimate interests for marketing

Electronic marketing (emails, texts, calls) is governed by PECR, not just UK GDPR. Under PECR, for unsolicited marketing to individuals (B2C), consent is generally required. That means freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent — no pre-ticked boxes or bundled terms. The only exemption is the “soft opt-in”, which may apply if: (i) you obtained the contact details in the course of a sale or negotiation for a sale of a product or service, (ii) you're marketing similar products/services, and (iii) you gave the individual a chance to opt out at the point of collection and in every subsequent message. If those conditions aren't met, consent is required.

Legitimate interests (LI) under UK GDPR may be relevant for the lawful basis for processing, but it cannot override PECR's consent requirement where PECR applies.

For corporate subscribers (e.g. generic work addresses like info@company.com), PECR does not require consent for marketing emails. However, the use of personal data still needs a valid lawful basis under UK GDPR — typically legitimate interests — which must be balanced against the individual's rights. And even where consent isn't required, recipients must always be given the right to opt out.

Regulators are cracking down on vague opt-ins, missing unsubscribe links, and bought-in lists where consent is not valid or transferable. If you're relying on consent, keep records of who, what, when, and how it was obtained — and make it easy to withdraw.

5 – Respect data minimisation and retention

Only collect what you need, for a defined purpose. Holding on to unnecessary personal data increases risk and undermines compliance with rights like erasure. Regular audits, data mapping, and retention schedules are your best tools here.

6 – Use appropriate safeguards for international transfers

The Uber and TikTok fines show regulators are serious about cross-border data flows. If you're exporting data outside the UK or EU, ensure your transfer mechanisms — like SCCs or IDTA — are legally and operationally sound. And document your transfer risk assessments.

7 – Embed accountability

Having a privacy policy isn't enough. You need to show how compliance is lived across the organisation: through training, audits, DPIAs, and breach drills. A culture of accountability can stop small errors becoming regulatory events.

8- Apply extra care to children's and special category data

Sensitive data (e.g. health, biometrics, religion) and children's data require additional safeguards and stricter legal bases. Recent EU fines show that this is a growing focus; if you handle this type of data, your controls must reflect the higher risk.

9 – Stay ahead of emerging risks

Expect growing regulatory scrutiny of AI systems, processor accountability, and children's services. The ICO's guidance on AI emphasises fairness, transparency, and explainability — and the EU AI Act is coming.

10 – Engage proactively with the ICO (or any regulator)

The ICO prefers early resolution. If you're cooperative, responsive, and quick to remediate, you're in a far stronger position. Don't go silent or adversarial unless you have a strategy.

If you do come to the attention of the authorities — that “curse” may not need to end badly. With clear policies, strong processes, and a proactive mindset, you can stay ahead of regulatory risk.

If you have questions about compliance or if you require risk management advice and support, please contact our data protection and privacy team.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a reprimand to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) over “serious shortcomings” in its storage and handling of CCTV footage.

It comes after the force was “unable to recover” two hours missing CCTV footage while a person was held in custody for 48 hours in February 2021.

GMP's Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) later submitted an internal request to retain this information beyond the typical 90-day period. When responding to a subsequent related subject access request, the force later realised two hours of the footage was missing.

GMP states that, despite all attempts, it is unable to recover the missing two hours of footage. This led GMP to self-report a personal data breach to the ICO on September 5, 2023.

The ICO's investigation assessed GMP's compliance with data protection laws related to the storage of CCTV footage. The ICO has ruled that GMP has failed to provide the complainant with their personal data, both without undue delay and by the end of the applicable period of one month, and failed to ensure that the appropriate technical or organisational measures were in place to protect the accidental loss of the CCTV data it was processing.

The ICO's investigation found two key failings in GMP's data protection practices:

Sally Anne Poole, head of Investigations at the ICO, said: “CCTV footage, particularly of a person at their most vulnerable, can contain highly sensitive personal data and must be properly protected. It is vital that authorities like police forces have the strictest measures in place to protect personal data to maintain public trust.

“It is clear in this case that GMP failed its obligation to keep the complainant's personal data safe and demonstrated serious shortcomings in how it handles CCTV footage. Data protection is not an afterthought; it is a core responsibility. In this case, we see the potential consequences when this responsibility is not properly adhered to.

“Police forces and public bodies across the country can learn from failures like this and ensure they have the right systems and oversight in place to prevent these mistakes from happening again. Public trust depends on it.”

In the time since the incident, GMP has taken remedial action, including:

The ICO said there is an ongoing investigation into the wider case by the Independent Office of Police Conduct.

Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to push digital asset regulations, with four new bills landing in the State Senate to promote BTC mining and ban the looming digital dollar.

With House Bill 4510, the Great Lakes State seeks to pave the way for the state treasurer to invest in digital assets. Introduced by Bill Schuette, the Republican State Rep. for the 95th district, the new bill amends the state's retirement system investment laws to allow investment in digital assets. However, it limits investment to assets that have averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the past calendar year.

The bill also outlines that the state can only hold digital assets as exchange-traded products issued by registered companies. This stipulation comes at a time when spot ETFs have exploded in the U.S. and now hold over $50 billion in assets.

Michigan's Bureau of Investment, which the state treasurer oversees, held $165 billion by the end of 2024, most of which is from the public retirement systems.

Michigan joins dozens of states racing to implement digital asset reserves in response to a similar push at the federal level by President Donald Trump. In February, two State Senators introduced a bill allowing the Michigan state government to establish a BTC reserve. It limited the investment to 10% of the assets, which would be around $17 billion by the latest figures.

Michigan bans the digital dollar

In the second proposed bill, House Bill 4511, the state seeks to ban the digital dollar, again aligning with Trump's position against the proposed sovereign digital currency.

The bill “prohibits the advocacy or support through certain actions by certain state governmental officers and entities of a central bank digital currency by the United States government.”

Introduced by Republican Rep. Bryan Posthumus, the bill mirrors dozens of others across the U.S. that have sought to halt any prospective digital dollar at the state level. The earliest opposition came from Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis led anti-CBDC campaigns years before Trump's election.

While several states have advanced bills resisting the digital dollar, the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is unlikely to see the light of day under the Trump presidency. Upon retaking office earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order prohibiting the Fed from launching a CBDC, which he argued “threatens the stability of the financial system.”










Beyond the CBDC, the same bill also prohibits Michigan from banning digital assets or denying licenses to holders. The state must also not prohibit the operation of blockchain nodes or participation in staking.

The other two bills, House Bill 4512 and House Bill 4513, focus on block reward mining. The first will permit the revival of abandoned oil and gas wells to mine BTC, and the second will expand the tax laws to accommodate income from such mining activities. The miners would shoulder the costs of well restoration, with the State's Supervisor of Wells having jurisdiction over the sector.

The block reward mining bills come amid a rise in anti-mining campaigns across the U.S. and beyond by local communities. In dozens of ongoing lawsuits, these communities have accused miners of noise pollution, which they say is pushing them away from their homes.

Russia pushes miners to the north amid power shortages

Meanwhile, in Russia, the Ministry of Energy plans to push BTC miners to the northern regions as it navigates power shortages in the more densely populated eastern and southern regions.

In an interview with state-owned news agency TASS, Deputy Minister Yevgeny Grabchak revealed that the government intends to incentivize miners to relocate to the north. Russia's north is the least populated region, with harsh weather—especially its severe winters—mostly to blame. However, the region also has the most abundant natural resources, including oil and gas.

“[The north] is where we can think about something with miners, put them there and consider the possibility of a network tariff. But this is not a benefit as such, but a different principle of tariff formation,” the minister stated.

In particular, the ministry intends to relocate the miners to power grid centers whose capacity was previously used to mine oil.

Repurposing unused or excess electricity to mine digital assets is becoming common globally. The U.S., Pakistan, Japan and Germany are among the countries that have announced new initiatives to leverage the surplus capacity to mine BTC.

The Korea Times reported that Governor Rhee Chang-yong personally visited the country's six largest banks to discuss wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) projects, in what it described as an “unprecedented move.” The intervention comes as Korea's largest banks announced plans to create a joint stablecoin just weeks after joining a central bank pilot project for tokenized deposits, setting up a potential race between public and private digital currency initiatives.

This competition in Korea could serve as a template for similar challenges worldwide, as central banks race to maintain monetary control in an increasingly digital financial landscape.

To appreciate the significance of these discussions, it's important to note three key differences between stablecoins and most tokenized deposits. One is that stablecoins are fully backed, resulting in so-called “narrow banking”, which impedes the availability of credit available in the economy compared to fractional reserve banking. Another relates to central bank involvement. In some jurisdictions, despite stablecoins being used for payments, they are not always under the central bank's supervision, potentially impeding their ability to influence monetary policy. Finally, most tokenized deposit projects use permissioned blockchains, whereas stablecoins are on permissionless blockchains which have significant audiences and developer bases and are more open for creating applications.

The Governor spent 30 minutes last week at the headquarters of each major bank – KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NH NongHyup, and Industrial Bank of Korea – for one-on-one meetings with the CEO, with wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) projects being a focus of the discussions.

Governor Rhee outlined the long-term benefits of participating in two central bank projects and agreed to shoulder one-third of the costs of Project Hangang, the domestic tokenized deposit initiative. This financial incentive came as the banks – except for Hana Bank – had announced plans for their joint stablecoin just weeks after the Hangang pilot's commencement in April.

The central bank is currently involved in two major CBDC-related projects, both involving wholesale CBDC for institutional use. One is Project Agorá for cross-border payments organized by the BIS and involving seven central banks and more than 40 institutions. The other is Project Hangang, a domestic project in which wCBDC supports tokenized deposits that consumers can use for blockchain-based payments, with trials involving the major banks plus 100,000 consumers.

Following the individual meetings, on Monday there was a joint meeting at the central bank that included the bank CEOs and Timothy Adams, the CEO of the Institute of International Finance (IIF). The IIF coordinates the cross-border CBDC Project Agorá. Stablecoins and deposit tokens were also discussed at the meeting.

The Governor has previously expressed concerns about the potential for stablecoins issued by companies like Visa to threaten monetary sovereignty. However, in a separate report by Korea's News1, the central bank appears to be making a strategic accommodation, with Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol saying it was considering allowing deposit tokens on public blockchains.

“We are considering a direction in which it (deposit tokens) will coexist within the entire digital currency system in conjunction with stablecoins issued by the private sector,” said Mr Lee, while reiterating monetary sovereignty concerns about global stablecoins.

This potential shift toward allowing deposit tokens on public blockchains could bridge the gap between the controlled environment of CBDC projects and the open ecosystem that makes stablecoins attractive to developers and users.

Project Hangang already supports different types of tokenized deposits. There are those backed by bank deposits, with the wCBDC used for interbank settlement. But it also envisages an e-money style deposit token that is fully backed by wCBDC. For tokens used on third-party platforms such as for the settlement of securities transactions, it envisages using a variation of the e-money style tokens.

The country is in the process of working on stablecoin legislation, with the BOK vying to have a central role in their supervision.

Korea's experience represents more than a domestic policy debate. The unprecedented nature of the Governor's bank visits suggests the urgency central banks feel in the transition to digital currencies. As other jurisdictions grapple with similar tensions between innovation and control, Korea's approach of combining direct engagement, financial incentives, and strategic accommodation could become a playbook for central banks worldwide seeking to maintain their role in an evolving digital payments landscape.

Stablecoins are not just a tech innovation, but an increasingly vital pillar of US fiscal stability, argues GlobalData analyst Blandina Hanna Szalay

Among the first US Presidential orders was banning the Federal Reserve's (Fed) digital dollar creation in January 2025 to keep the Central Bank from entering the organically developing digital currencies space. The move signalled a clear break from state-issued digital currencies and an ideological shift toward market-driven innovation.

By May, Bitcoin hit another all-time high above $111,000 and the country's top banks—JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo—announced a joint stablecoin initiative, showing a 180-degree shift from the Democrat-era cryptocurrency sentiment. Not only does this mark a reputational pivot for institutions that once distanced themselves from crypto, but it also underscores how regulatory tailwinds can rapidly reshape institutional strategy.

Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) set up new groups to explore digital euro use cases in its most-recent push. Yet, the share of euro-backed stablecoins remains under 1% of the total supply dominated by USD-backed coins (99%+); highlighting the disproportionate influence of US monetary infrastructure on global digital finance. This imbalance has emerged as a silent yet powerful driver of USD demand, especially important at a time when appetite for the dollar is weakening globally amid growing trade wars.

The largest US incumbents moving into the crypto space via a stablecoin initiative was anticipated following the most-recent advancement of the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act in the Senate. Years of restrictive regulation on crypto assets has left traditional banks with no choice but to campaign against the industry, which is arguably the biggest competitive threat to traditional finance and its institutions yet. The four banks' joint stablecoin announcement now signals a systemic shift, as the GENIUS Act is set to bring long-awaited federal oversight to the stablecoin market in the form of consumer protection and national security measures. The timing suggests a strategic play of US banks aligning with federal efforts to regulate stablecoins in an attempt to steer it in their favour.

Meanwhile, Europe's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation proved too restrictive for by far the largest stablecoin Tether to comply, which is now unavailable on European exchanges. Though, the biggest demand for Tether's services is concentrated in emerging markets out of necessity for fast, cheap, and reliable transfers.

With that said, the ECB's two, new ‘Pioneers' and ‘Visionaries' workstreams are currently looking for and testing potential functionalities and use cases for the digital euro that aims to launch by the end of the year. The scope of these trials suggests that beyond consumer payments, the ECB is considering applications in programmable finance, automated tax collection, and cross-border trade—all areas where it seeks to reduce its dependence on US-based infrastructure.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

So far, the trajectory of private vs government-issued digital currencies shows strong correlation with national interests and its regulatory backing, which is expected to continue shaping stablecoins' and Central Bank Digital Currencies' (CBDCs) regional development paths moving forward. The ECB is unlikely to relax MiCA rules as it recently named the digital euro one of the three structural economic policy priorities, amid their ongoing push for payments independence from US providers. On the other hand, creating a supportive regulatory environment for stablecoins aligns with the Fed's monetary interests too; given that stablecoin issuers are set to become the largest US Treasury securities holders globally by 2030 as foreign government demand drops. This makes stablecoins not just a tech innovation, but an increasingly vital pillar of US fiscal stability.

The administration's full-throated support of crypto is raising concern from ethics experts who say it overlaps with the president's personal investments.

President Donald Trump and his allies are deepening their ties to crypto, embracing the digital currency he once called a “scam” and bringing digital assets into the mainstream.

Just this week, Vice President JD Vance headlined a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, while Trump Media said it would raise $2.5 billion to invest in bitcoin. And in a move that could affect millions of savers, the Labor Department rescinded guidance on Wednesday that discouraged 401(k) plans from buying cryptocurrency.

“There's a new sheriff in town,” Vance said at the conference, adding: “With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.”

The administration's full-throated support of crypto is continuing to raise concern from ethics experts who say it overlaps with the president's personal investments in the market and could undermine the industry.

“The president's actions will make people outside the industry question whether his crypto agenda is promoting innovation or just promoting his personal gain,” said Timothy Massad, who chaired the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration.

Even the appearance of preferential treatment can undermine efforts to regulate, some experts say.

The Labor Department's move “might or might not be a good idea,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor with expertise in campaign finance regulation and government ethics. But considering the Trump family's business interests, “you can reasonably wonder whether the administration made the decision because it's good public policy or because it's good for an industry in which they are so invested,” he said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its press office has denied conflicts of interest, saying the president's assets are in a blind trust managed by his sons.

The price of bitcoin reached a record this month, after increasing about 16 percent since January and more than 57 percent in the past year.

Crypto's advocates argue it can liberate financial transactions from the control of government and financial institutions. Administration officials and allies echoed those arguments this week.

Vance promoted crypto Wednesday as a hedge against bad government policy, inflation and a “private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.”

Eric Trump, speaking at the same conference, said he would like to see “some of the big banks go extinct.”

Trump Media, the money-losing company that operates Truth Social, said the purchase of its stock by institutional investors would help fund the creation of a “bitcoin treasury.”

“This investment will help defend our company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes said in a statement.

Trump, for his part, has pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” He has also appointed a “crypto czar” and hosted the White House's first crypto summit. In March, he signed an executive order to treat bitcoin as a reserve asset — something crypto leaders have called for at least since Trump's election.

Among the moves most criticized by ethics experts was the launch by Trump and the first lady of $Trump and $Melania meme coins in January, as well as the president's recent attendance at a black-tie gala with his meme coin's top purchasers. (The administration previously said that the dinner wasn't an official function and that the president attended in his personal time.)

Trump family members have also backed a bitcoin mining firm and a crypto venture that launched the stablecoin USD1 this spring.

Trump and his family profit when people buy his meme coin, which is a kind of cryptocurrency. Stablecoins are also a form of cryptocurrency, but with their value tied to other assets, such as the U.S. dollar.

Since Trump's meme coin was debuted, Trump-affiliated businesses have received $312 million from crypto sales and $43 million in total fees, according to a Washington Post analysis of data through mid-May. But for many small investors, the Trump meme coin venture has been a bust, The Post found.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Why ‘wrench attacks' on wealthy crypto holders are on the rise","https://www.inquirer.com/business/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-attacks-digital-wealthy-owners-violent-20250529.html","Thu, 29 May 2025 09:00:01 GMT","

Some of the digital currency's key characteristics help explain why those who hold a lot of the assets can be ripe targets for violent thieves.

The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.

The alleged attempted robbery is known as a “wrench attack.” It's a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.

Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency's move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.

“Criminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,” Ariss said.

Some of the crypto's key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell, or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.

Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one's private keys, which are like passwords used to access one's crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is “not your keys, not your coins.”

Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold, or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.

In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.

Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it's usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars' worth of crypto in recent years.

In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called “cold wallets.” Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.

But they can't defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.

The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive's finger.

Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.

Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Korea may be the first battleground in a global struggle between central banks and private stablecoins for control of digital payments, as the Bank of Korea (BOK) governor makes unprecedented visits to major banks to promote CBDC, tokenized deposit alternatives over private stablecoin initiatives.

Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to push digital asset regulations, with four new bills landing in the State Senate to promote BTC mining and ban the looming digital dollar.

With House Bill 4510, the Great Lakes State seeks to pave the way for the state treasurer to invest in digital assets. Introduced by Bill Schuette, the Republican State Rep. for the 95th district, the new bill amends the state's retirement system investment laws to allow investment in digital assets. However, it limits investment to assets that have averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the past calendar year.

The bill also outlines that the state can only hold digital assets as exchange-traded products issued by registered companies. This stipulation comes at a time when spot ETFs have exploded in the U.S. and now hold over $50 billion in assets.

Michigan's Bureau of Investment, which the state treasurer oversees, held $165 billion by the end of 2024, most of which is from the public retirement systems.

Michigan joins dozens of states racing to implement digital asset reserves in response to a similar push at the federal level by President Donald Trump. In February, two State Senators introduced a bill allowing the Michigan state government to establish a BTC reserve. It limited the investment to 10% of the assets, which would be around $17 billion by the latest figures.

Michigan bans the digital dollar

In the second proposed bill, House Bill 4511, the state seeks to ban the digital dollar, again aligning with Trump's position against the proposed sovereign digital currency.

The bill “prohibits the advocacy or support through certain actions by certain state governmental officers and entities of a central bank digital currency by the United States government.”

Introduced by Republican Rep. Bryan Posthumus, the bill mirrors dozens of others across the U.S. that have sought to halt any prospective digital dollar at the state level. The earliest opposition came from Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis led anti-CBDC campaigns years before Trump's election.

While several states have advanced bills resisting the digital dollar, the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is unlikely to see the light of day under the Trump presidency. Upon retaking office earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order prohibiting the Fed from launching a CBDC, which he argued “threatens the stability of the financial system.”










Beyond the CBDC, the same bill also prohibits Michigan from banning digital assets or denying licenses to holders. The state must also not prohibit the operation of blockchain nodes or participation in staking.

The other two bills, House Bill 4512 and House Bill 4513, focus on block reward mining. The first will permit the revival of abandoned oil and gas wells to mine BTC, and the second will expand the tax laws to accommodate income from such mining activities. The miners would shoulder the costs of well restoration, with the State's Supervisor of Wells having jurisdiction over the sector.

The block reward mining bills come amid a rise in anti-mining campaigns across the U.S. and beyond by local communities. In dozens of ongoing lawsuits, these communities have accused miners of noise pollution, which they say is pushing them away from their homes.

Russia pushes miners to the north amid power shortages

Meanwhile, in Russia, the Ministry of Energy plans to push BTC miners to the northern regions as it navigates power shortages in the more densely populated eastern and southern regions.

In an interview with state-owned news agency TASS, Deputy Minister Yevgeny Grabchak revealed that the government intends to incentivize miners to relocate to the north. Russia's north is the least populated region, with harsh weather—especially its severe winters—mostly to blame. However, the region also has the most abundant natural resources, including oil and gas.

“[The north] is where we can think about something with miners, put them there and consider the possibility of a network tariff. But this is not a benefit as such, but a different principle of tariff formation,” the minister stated.

In particular, the ministry intends to relocate the miners to power grid centers whose capacity was previously used to mine oil.

Repurposing unused or excess electricity to mine digital assets is becoming common globally. The U.S., Pakistan, Japan and Germany are among the countries that have announced new initiatives to leverage the surplus capacity to mine BTC.

The May 12 roundtable included representatives from traditional financial institutions, exchanges, asset managers, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and legal and policy experts to examine the current state of asset tokenization and identify potential regulatory, technological, and operational implications of transitioning traditional financial assets onto blockchain-based platforms. 

The Tokenization Roundtable is the fourth roundtable in the series Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity. The roundtables reflect the Staff's continued interest in understanding how crypto asset technologies interact with existing securities laws and signal growing momentum toward formal rulemaking and interpretive guidance in this area. 

The panelists broadly agreed that tokenization has the potential to transform capital markets while also underscoring the need for regulatory clarity, technical standards, and appropriate safeguards to ensure market integrity and investor protection.

Across the discussion, a consistent theme emerged: tokenization is best understood as a technology-enabled process, not a new type of asset. At its core, tokenization refers to placing real-world financial instruments (such as equities, bonds, or fund interests) onto a blockchain, enabling programmable ownership and related transaction features. 

Some compared this transformation to the evolution from certificated shares to electronic records, with the leap to tokenization offering the prospect of additional features such as the ability to incorporate automated compliance, real-time settlement, and improved transparency and inclusion for investors.

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins gave the keynote address, highlighting the energy behind moving from traditional “off-chain” databases to blockchain-based “on-chain” ledger systems. Chairman Atkins stated that migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market, enabling new ways of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities, such as using smart contracts for transparent dividend distribution or enhancing capital formation by transforming illiquid assets into liquid investment opportunities. He noted this technology holds promise for novel use cases not currently contemplated by the SEC's legacy rules.

Chairman Atkins stated his objective is to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that consists of clear rules for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to deter illegal activity. He outlined the SEC's goals and the challenges it faces with respect to three areas of focus for crypto asset policy:

1. Issuance

The SEC intends to establish clear and sensible guidelines for distributions of crypto assets that qualify as securities or are subject to an investment contract. Challenges currently exist with satisfying disclosure requirements and determining if a crypto asset is a security. Chairman Atkins criticized past approaches, described as “head in the sand” and “regulation through enforcement,” which did not adapt disclosure requirements for this new technology. 

The SEC is now pursuing a new course, with Staff recently issuing statements on disclosure obligations and clarifying that certain distributions and assets do not implicate federal securities laws. However, existing registration exemptions and safe harbors may not be fit for purpose, making SEC action—beyond Staff pronouncements—vital and necessary. The Staff is considering whether additional guidance, exemptions, and safe harbors are needed to create pathways for crypto asset issuances in the United States.

2. Custody 

The SEC supports providing registrants with greater optionality in determining how to custody crypto assets. The recent rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 is viewed as removing a significant impediment to the custody of crypto assets, however, further clarity is needed on which types of custodians qualify as “qualified custodians” and on reasonable exceptions for common crypto practices. 

Updates to custody rules may be necessary to allow advisers and funds to engage in self-custody under certain circumstances. The “special purpose broker-dealer” framework may need to be repealed and replaced with a more rational regime, and clarity is needed on applying customer protection and net capital rules to crypto custody by broker-dealers.

3. Trading 

Chairman Atkins favors allowing registrants to trade a broader variety of products, responding to market demand. This could include enabling “super apps” or “pairs trading” between securities and non-securities. Staff have been asked to explore modernizing the Alternative Trading System regulatory regime and whether guidance or rulemaking is needed for listing and trading crypto assets on national securities exchanges.

In addition to outlining the three areas of focus for the SEC's regulation of crypto assets going forward, Chairman Atkins proposed exploring whether conditional exemptive relief would be appropriate for registrants and nonregistrants bringing new products and services to market that may not currently be compatible with existing rules. Chairman Atkins stated the goal is to coordinate the SEC's efforts with the administration and the US Congress to make the United States the global leader of crypto asset markets.

Before the panel discussions began, the SEC commissioners provided insight into challenges and objectives they believe the Staff and the panelists should take into consideration when discussing the regulation and facilitation of tokenization. 

SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw expressed concerns and potential shortcomings of tokenization and its ability to increase market efficiency. She expressed significant doubts about the ability of tokenization to speed up settlement due to issues with scaling, and also suggested that the delay created by the current T+1 settlement cycle is a feature and not a bug, providing for more stable markets in times of stress. 

She explained that the current system facilitates netting, which drastically reduces the volume requiring final settlement, which is key to handling high trading volumes, market stability, and facilitating liquidity. She called for extreme regulatory caution and reiterated the importance of protecting traditional markets, noting that it is estimated that less than 5% of US households are involved in crypto and therefore any changes to financial market regulations must not be detrimental to the TradFi markets that most Americans depend on. 

SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda noted that the new technologies related to tokenization could benefit investors by enhancing liquidity for otherwise relatively illiquid assets, reducing delays associated with intermediation, and decreasing transactional costs. Tokenization also has the potential to simplify or streamline certain compliance functions through smart contracts for on-chain assets. 

These potential improvements are tied to key characteristics of blockchain technology such as its transparent ledger and decentralized nature. Commissioner Uyeda stated that when considering the implications of new technologies the Commission should focus on designing a framework that includes critical safeguards rather than trying to address every possible investment permutation and scenario. 

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce listed the potential benefits that tokenization may have on securities markets, including increased operational efficiency, transactional transparency, liquidity, and accessibility; faster settlement (potentially near-instant and simultaneous on the same network); and greater investor opportunity. Tokenized securities can be used as collateral and a means of settlement for other crypto assets on-chain. Commissioner Peirce expressed the need for legal clarity for tokenization to reach its full potential. 

She noted several issues that create uncertainty, including whether a crypto network can serve as the master securityholder file for Exchange Act transfer agent rules, confusion regarding a broker-dealer's ability to custody tokenized traditional securities due to the special purpose broker-dealer statement, and a proposed Advisers Act custody rule amendment that could preclude tokenized traditional securities on public, permissionless networks from an exception to the qualified custodian requirement. She concluded that, absent a compelling factual and legal reason, the SEC should treat tokenized securities the same as traditionally issued securities.

The first panel of the Tokenization Roundtable featured a diverse panel of experts from leading financial institutions from the crypto asset industry. The discussion addressed terminology used by the crypto industry, exploring opportunities and challenges presented by current regulatory infrastructure and existing law, and offered practical advice from the industry to the SEC on how to best move forward. 

Key Discussions

Opportunities in Tokenization and Blockchain: Panelists discussed the potential of tokenization to enhance shareholder communication, improve proxy and dividend distributions, and increase operational efficiencies. Tokenization was generally described as a way to de-risk markets by shortening settlement cycles and present a pathway toward 24/7 global capital markets. 

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges: The panel highlighted the desire for a regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation and stressed the importance of regulatory interoperability among different tokenization platforms. They emphasized the need for a clear crypto asset taxonomy and, accordingly, to adjust rules and regulations to fit the evolving financial landscape.   

Investor Protections and Compliance: Improved investor protections and compliance capabilities were examined, and panelists discussed how to ensure that only eligible investors could engage with tokenized securities. The role of smart contracts in automating compliance and reducing costs was also highlighted by the panel.   

Evolution of Financial Markets: The panelists reflected on the evolution of financial markets from paper to digital and the role of fintech in providing trading and market surveillance capabilities. They discussed how tokenization could ease congestion within the traditional market system and improve collateral management.  

Future of Capital Markets: The discussion included the potential for tokenized securities to democratize access to investing and the role of digital assets in providing real-time market efficiencies. The panelists explored the idea of tokenized stable value yield funds and their benefits for institutional investors.  

Practical Advice for the SEC

Regulatory Framework: The panelists advised the SEC to consider a regulatory framework that supports innovation while remaining focused on investor protection. They suggested using exemptive and no-action relief to address market-driven issues and emphasized the importance of a common regulatory framework to facilitate capital formation.  

Intermediary Evolution: The panel discussed the role of intermediaries in the evolving financial landscape, with a focus on how intermediaries would need to adapt to these new technologies. The panelists highlighted the importance of choice in intermediary interactions and the potential for automated market making without intermediaries.  

Regulatory Innovation Programs: The panel again discussed the use of regulatory sandboxes to test new technologies and better inform legislation, and emphasized the need for a practical sandbox environment that focuses on how test runs can directly inform regulatory rules. 

The panel concluded with a call for the traditional financial industry to embrace new technologies and for the SEC to adopt regulatory frameworks that support innovation while maintaining investor trust and market acceptance. The panelists stressed the importance of not allowing outdated regulations to hinder the progress of new players in the financial markets.

The second panel of the Tokenization Roundtable, The Future of Tokenization, showcased a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including academics, legal scholars, digital asset platform leaders, and investors. The discussion explored the evolving landscape of tokenization, examining future use cases and potential regulatory considerations for the SEC as it navigates the evolving digital asset space.

Identified Benefits: Efficiency, Inclusion, and Market Modernization

The panelists identified several key benefits that tokenization could bring to capital markets, centered around operational efficiency, broader market access, and structural innovation:

Regulatory Considerations and Challenges

While the technological promise of tokenization was widely acknowledged, the panelists also highlighted several regulatory and legal uncertainties that need to be addressed to foster broader adoption:

The panel concluded with diverging perspectives on how the SEC should navigate the complexities of tokenization and blockchain regulation. Some panelists suggested convening a meeting of experts from various fields to collaborate and address these challenges, while others advocated for the SEC to establish its own set of guiding principles. 

The discussion also highlighted the difficulties the SEC faces in attempting to regulate technologies and entities that currently fall outside its existing framework as well as certain technological issues that remain unresolved by mathematicians, such as the interoperability of blockchain systems. These challenges underscore the need for a flexible and thoughtful approach to regulation that balances innovation with market integrity.

The Tokenization Roundtable reflects the SEC's ongoing efforts to engage with industry stakeholders and explore the integration of emerging technologies into the regulatory landscape. As tokenization continues to evolve, market participants should monitor regulator developments and assess the implications for their operations and compliance obligations. The SEC's Crypto Task Force will hold its fifth and final roundtable, DeFi and the American Spirit, on June 9, 2025.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — Cybercriminals use AI video on TikTok to steal users' personal information and one of the largest cryptocurrency companies in the United States fell victim to a cyberattack that cost some $400 million in losses.

Cybersecurity expert and personal security attorney Leeza Garber said Coinbase employees were bribed to leak information on users, and then the company was ransomed for $20 million. The company has refused to pay.

As far as the AI TikTok videos, a generated voice tells users how to change settings on their profile to allegedly get free access to other apps, when in reality, they are letting hackers into their other accounts.

Crypto exchange Bybit has been granted a license in Austria in compliance with Europe's framework for dealing in digital assets, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime, according to the website of the local regulator FMA.

Europe's new MiCA rules came into force at the start of this year, prompting firms to select the most appropriate member state to base operations and passport services across the 27-country trading block.

Austria is also the MiCA home base of crypto trading firm Bitpanda which also holds a licence in Germany.

Founded in 2018 by entrepreneur Ben Zhou, Bybit, which has risen to become the second largest exchange by volume according to CoinMarketCap, is based in Dubai having moved its headquarters from Singapore in 2022.

In February 2025, the exchange was hacked resulting in the loss of $1.5 billion in assets in the largest cryptocurrency theft on record.

Bybit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bitcoin BTC$106,721.36 is currently consolidating between $107,000 and $109,000, remaining just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high. While this tight range may appear stable on the surface, on-chain data suggests a shift in sentiment among some of the market's most influential participants,  the large holders known as whales.

Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score, a measure of accumulation behavior across various wallet-size cohorts, offers deeper insight into this evolving market dynamic. 

The metric evaluates the strength of purchasing by combining the size of wallet entities with the volume of bitcoin acquired over the past 15 days. For the largest holders, the value has dropped to 0.4. A reading closer to 1 indicates strong buying, whereas a level near 0 points to sales. Crucially, wallets associated with exchanges and miners are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of investor behavior.

What stands out is that entities holding 10,000 BTC or more typically classified as whales were the first to begin accumulating at the market's April lows at around $75,000. Now, they are starting to reduce their holdings while the other wallet cohorts remain in accumulation mode. This pivot suggests a strategic shift, potentially driven by a desire to lock in profits near historic highs or a more cautious outlook on short-term price direction.





Supporting evidence for this shift in behavior comes from exchange-flow data that shows whale wallets had been steadily withdrawing bitcoin over the past month, a bullish signal that implies they were not looking to sell their holdings in the short term. 

This trend now appears to be reversing. In two of the past three days, whales have deposited BTC back onto exchanges, a pattern commonly associated with imminent selling activity.



This nuanced behavior raises the critical question: Are whales anticipating a local top?

Bitcoin BTC$106,721.36 treasury firm Twenty One has raised an additional $100 million through convertible senior secured notes, pushing its total capital raised to $685 million as it advances toward a planned merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows.

The fresh financing comes from existing investors and sponsors who exercised their option to buy more of the notes, originally granted during the April fundraising round, the regulatory filing said.

The new notes carry a 1% coupon and are due in 2030. The $100 million boost adds to the $385 million initially committed, bringing the total note financing to $485 million. That's on top of $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) disclosed last month.

CEP is lower by 1.5% in morning U.S. trade as bitcoin slips below $107,000.

Twenty One is the latest example of firms with a crypto treasury strategy, following Michael Saylor's Startegy (MSTR). The firm is being launched by Brandon Lutnick—the son of U.S. Commerce Secretary and former Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Howard Lutnick—via a a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) structure using Cantor Equity Partners. Owners include iFinex—the parent company of Bitfinex—and Tether, the issuer of the $150 billion USDT. The company will be led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers.

The company recently disclosed a $458 million BTC acquisition earlier this month.

 Solana's reliance on memecoins threatens long-term growth as Ethereum gains strength through layer-2 expansion. 

Key takeaways: 

SOL/ETH has broken below a rising wedge pattern, signaling a potential 40% decline.

Solana's memecoin revenue has collapsed since April, weakening its core value proposition.

Standard Chartered warns Solana may underperform as Ethereum's L2 ecosystem grows more competitive.

Solana's (SOL) multiyear outperformance against Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is losing momentum, with technical breakdowns and weakening onchain activity pointing to a potential sharp decline in the SOL/ETH pair next.

As of May 29, the SOL/ETH pair has confirmed a breakdown from its multimonth rising wedge pattern, a bearish structure that often precedes significant declines.

In technical terms, a rising wedge breakdown typically results in a drop equal to the pattern's maximum height. 

For SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.

The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.

A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge's lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge's upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.

The breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. 

A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. 

Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.

The platform had been a major contributor to Solana's revenue growth, especially between December 2024 and March 2025. 

During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.

A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative. The bank warned that Solana may underperform if it cannot diversify beyond memecoins, which currently dominate its transaction activity. 

Standard Chartered said that Ethereum is gaining ground with scalable layer-2 solutions that offer comparable fees and deeper infrastructure for real-world applications.

Chartist Alex Clay asserts that a so-called “Ethereum outperformance season” has already arrived, reiterating confidence in the rising wedge breakdown on the SOL/ETH charts.

 Donut's AI agents understand page intent and autonomously execute blockchain transactions for token swaps, yield farming or portfolio optimization. 

New York-based Donut Labs has raised $7 million in a pre-seed funding round to build what it claims will be the world's first “agentic” crypto browser, a tool using artificial intelligence to help users interact with blockchain-based applications.

The round was led by Sequoia, Bitkraft and HackVC, with participation from angel investors including Solana and other ecosystem leaders, such as Matrix Partners, Sky9 Ventures, Makers Fund and SonicSVM.

The $7 million will support the development of Donut, an executable crypto browser powered by artificial intelligence agents, with a native cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange integration, decentralized network access and onchain execution.

Unlike traditional web browsers, Donut's AI algorithms understand page context and user intent, helping it autonomously execute blockchain-based operations.

“The traditional browser hasn't changed for more than 30 years. We're re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We're reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”

Donut's users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer.

“Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.”

Donut's AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets or earn passive yield on digital assets.

While Donut's earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade.

Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.

However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:

In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

 President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced plans to build “CryptoCity,” aiming to establish a regulatory sandbox for digital assets. 

Kazakhstan plans to launch “CryptoCity,” a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services, the country's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said. according to a May 29 announcement on the official website of President .

Speaking at the Astana International Forum 2025, Tokayev said the pilot zone will be used to explore cryptocurrency adoption within a regulated sandbox environment. 

“We are planning to create a pioneering pilot zone called CryptoCity where cryptocurrencies might be used for purchasing goods, services, and even beyond,” he said  in his remarks, a transcript of which was published on the president's official website.

Several crypto-related announcements have recently emerged from Kazakhstan. Kanysh Tuleushin, the country's first vice minister of digital development, this month said Kazakhstan has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia if regulatory restrictions are eased. In 2024, Kazakhstan launched a pilot project with its central bank digital currency, which reportedly reduced value-added tax refund wait times.

A May 29 report by local news outlet Tengri News cited Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development Zhaslan Madiyev saying “the government and regulators are currently working together to determine the most suitable location.” One city is already under serious consideration.

“Of course, the most promising place for CryptoCity is the new city of Alatau – it's the President's initiative,“ he said.

Alatau is a settlement relatively close to the south-eastern border of Kazakhstan. It was established in 1957 as an unnamed settlement for scientific institutions and their workers and houses the Institute of Nuclear Physics, the Kazakhstan National Nuclear Center, with an experimental nuclear reactor and cyclotron, and the Physics and Technology Institute.

In addition to serving as Kazakhstan's research hub, Alatau hosts a special economic zone known as Innovation Technology Park. Consequently, regulators may feel that adding another one to the mix is a natural step that could result in synergies that might attract additional capital. Madiyev shed light on how ubiquitous crypto would be in the area:

Madiyev expressed his hope that the project would attract developers, programmers and IT specialists to Kazakhstan, thereby boosting local economic growth. 

While noting that the focus is on working on the regulatory framework, “the city itself is already under development,” he said, noting that “CryptoCity implies free circulation of cryptocurrency, crypto-friendly legislation and crypto as a legitimate means of payment.”  

“These conditions need to be reflected in the law,“ he added.

Astronomers Discover Mysterious Object Bursting with X-Rays

A celestial object some 15,000 light-years away is emitting bright flashes of radio and X-rays that scientists are struggling to explain

By Robert Lea & SPACE.com

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

One of the strangest cosmic objects ever seen just got even weirder — NASA's Chandra X-ray telescope caught it blasting out X-ray radiation and radio waves.

The mystery object, known as ASKAP J1832- 0911, is located within the Milky Way about 15,000 light-years away from Earth. It's now known to flash in both radio waves and X-rays for a two-minute period every 44 minutes.

This is the first time an object like this, a so-called ""long-period transient"" or ""LPT,"" has been seen in high-energy X-ray light as well as low-energy radio wave light. The team behind this discovery hopes the finding could help reveal what these flashing objects actually are and how they launch their mystery signals.

However, not only is there no explanation for how the signals from LPTs are generated yet, but astronomers also don't know why these signals ""switch on"" and ""switch off"" at long, regular and unusual intervals.

""This object is unlike anything we have seen before,"" team leader and Curtin University researcher Zieng (Andy) Wang said in a statement.

LPTs are flashing cosmic bodies that emit radio pulses separated by a few minutes or a few hours. They were first discovered in 2022, making them a very recent discovery. Since this initial detection, astronomers from around the globe have discovered a further 10 LPTs.None seem to be quite like this one, though — not yet anyway.ASKAP J1832- 0911 was first spotted by astronomers using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope in Wajarri Country, Australia.The team then followed this initial LPT discovery in radio waves with further investigation using NASA's Chandra X-ray telescope, shockingly finding that its highly periodic and unusual radio emissions are mimicked in X-rays.

In fact, catching ASKAP J1832- 0911 throwing its regular X-ray tantrum was a matter of good fortune.

""Discovering that ASKAP J1832-0911 was emitting X-rays felt like finding a needle in a haystack,"" Wang said. ""The ASKAP radio telescope has a wide field view of the night sky, while Chandra observes only a fraction of it. So, it was fortunate that Chandra observed the same area of the night sky at the same time.""

The team believes the true nature of ASKAP J1832-0911 is a dead star, they just don't quite know what form that star takes. A highly magnetic neutron star, or ""magnetar,"" is one option, and a a white dwarf — the kind of stellar remnant the sun will leave behind when it dies in over 5 billion years — is another.

“ASKAP J1831- 0911 could be a magnetar, the core of a dead star with powerful magnetic fields, or it could be a pair of stars in a binary system where one of the two is a highly magnetized white dwarf, a low-mass star at the end of its evolution,"" Wang said. ""However, even those theories do not fully explain what we are observing.""This discovery could indicate a new type of physics or new models of stellar evolution.""

The hope is the discovery that at least one LPT emits X-rays in the same way it does radio waves could help shed light on the mysterious origins of these objects.That's because the fact that X-rays are so much more energetic than radio waves are means whatever the object behind ASKAP J1832- 0911 is, it must be able to produce both types of radiation. That should narrow down the field of suspects — and, there should be more LPTs out there acting just like this one, the study team reasons.

""Finding one such object hints at the existence of many more,"" Nanda Rea, study team member and a researcher at the Institute of Space Science (ICE-CSIC) and Catalan Institute for Space studies (IEEC), said in the statement. ""The discovery of its transient X-ray emission opens fresh insights into their mysterious nature.""

The team's research was published on Wednesday (May 28) in the journal Nature.

At some point, RNA must have replicated itself before the evolutionary arrival of DNA and proteins, and now we might know how.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Where did we all come from? It's a question that has lit fires of curiosity in philosophers, theologians, and more recently (at least, historically speaking) scientists for millennia. While the the older guard of high thought used stories or metaphors to derive life's origin story, scientists instead learn about the inner workings of life's smallest building blocks in an attempt to understand how they first formed life billions of years ago.

This long scientific exploration has led most evolutionary biologists to the conclusion that, for at least 400 million years, Earth was an “RNA World.” The hypothesis suggests that life first took form due to self-replicating RNA, before the evolutionary arrival of DNA or even proteins. 

But there's a couple problems. 

First, there's no trace of this “first replicator” in known biology. And second, scientists have failed to convincingly replicate RNA in an environment similar to early Earth. While scientists are very much still on the hunt for evidence that validates the first of these two issues, a team from University College of London (UCL) is closing in on solving the second problem. 

Published in the journal Nature Chemistry, a team of UCL scientists (along with experts from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge) used three-letter “triplet” RNA building blocks subjected to acid and heat in water. This separated the RNA double-helix—the structure that makes replication so difficult—and scientists froze the solution. 

What occurred next is possibly an intimate glimpse of how life first formed on Earth—between the liquid gaps of the ice crystals, these building blocks coated the RNA strands and prevented them from zipping back together. After the scientists thawed the solution and and made adjustments to pH and temperature, the RNA replicated again and again. Eventually, the strand was so long that these structures could perform biological functions. 

“The triplet or three-letter building blocks of RNA we used, called trinucleotides, do not occur in biology today, but they allow for much easier replication. The earliest forms of life are likely to have been quite different from any life that we know about,” James Attwater, lead author of the study from UCL, said in a press statement. “The changing conditions we engineered can occur naturally, for instance with night and day cycles of temperature, or in geothermal environments where hot rocks meet a cold atmosphere.”

UCL has long been involved in constructing the play-by-play of life's origins on Earth. In 2017, for example, a study analyzed the chemistry that provided Earth with the very nucleotides necessary to construct the first RNA structures. This new study now attempts to understand, in a lab setting, how those ancient RNA first began replication, a process that's essential to understanding the foundation of life. 

“Life is separated from pure chemistry by information, a molecular memory encoded in the genetic material that is transmitted from one generation to the next,” Philipp Holliger, the senior author of the study from MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said in a press statement. “For this process to occur, the information must be copied, i.e. replicated, to be passed on.” 

Currently, the researchers have only been able to replicate roughly 17 percent of the RNA strand (roughly 30 out of 180 letters), but the team says there's no reason they won't achieve complete replication with improved enzyme efficiency. The researchers also note that this reaction can't occur in saltwater (the salt disrupts the freezing process), but geothermal freshwater lakes or ponds would be the perfect chemical setting for RNA replication to take hold. 

Although many questions remain, Earth's ancient RNA World could have actually had the capacity for self-replication. It's an intriguing step forward, but the scientific journey continues.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Researchers engineer a herpes virus to turn on T cells for immunotherapy","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528131827.htm","Thu, 29 May 2025 02:13:52 GMT","

Recent research points to the potential utility of a familiar sounding foe-herpes virus-in the fight against cancer.

The idea: the virus has evolved to commandeer cellular machinery in order activate signaling pathways inside cells and these strategies can be repurposed to bolster immunotherapy against diseases like cancer.

T cells are front line defenders against pathogens, like viruses, and cancer because they can kill infected or malignant cells.

Scientists have for years been trying different techniques to direct these immune cells to protect against disease.

CAR-T therapy is one such example of prompting the body's own immune system to attack certain forms of cancer using T cells.

However, the therapeutic potential of T cells can be limited by the suppressive environment present within tumors that impairs T cell survival and function.

The University of Michigan team identified herpes virus saimiri, which infects the T cells of squirrel monkeys, as a source of proteins that activate pathways in T cells that are needed to promote T cell survival.

The work, led by the lab of Adam Courtney, Ph.D., in the Department of Pharmacology and the U-M Rogel Cancer Center, exploits this ability in order to investigate whether a modified viral protein could be used to activate transcription factors known as STAT proteins.

The approach is borne of observations that stimulation of the JAK-STAT5 pathway by cytokines like interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps boost the therapeutic ability of T cells to kill cancer cells.

The team engineered a variant of the tyrosine kinase interacting protein from the herpes virus to bind LCK (a kinase active in resting T cells) and recruit it to activate STAT5.

In this way, the team determined that direct activation of STAT5 could sustain T cell function in tumors of mouse models of melanoma and lymphoma.

Their findings hint at a new approach -- using genes from organisms with proven ability to modulate human cells -- to enhance the power of immunotherapy.

Ph.D. candidate Yating Zheng, of the Department of Pharmacology at U-M Medical School is first author of the paper.

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide. Even if known traditional risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure are treated, the disease worsens in half of all cases, especially in older patients. Researchers at UZH have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites can accelerate the ageing of blood vessels and trigger cardiovascular disease.

Phenylacetic acid triggers cell aging

The human body consists of around 30 to 100 trillion bacteria that reside in our organs. Ninety percent of these bacteria live in the intestine, processing the food we eat into metabolic products, which in turn affect our bodies. ""Half of these substances have not yet been recognized,"" says Soheil Saeedi. His research group at the Center for Translational and Experimental Cardiology is investigating how the microbiota composition changes with age and whether this affects the cardiovascular system.

Using data from more than 7,000 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 95 as well as a mouse model of chronological aging, the researchers found that the breakdown product of the amino acid phenylalanine -- phenylacetic acid -- accumulates with age. In several series of experiments, Saeedi's team was able to prove that phenylacetic acid leads to senescence of endothelial cells, in which the cells that line the inside of blood vessels do not proliferate, secrete inflammatory molecules, and exhibit aging phenotype. As a result, the vessels stiffen up and their function is impaired.

Responsible bacterium found

By conducting a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the microbiome of mice and humans, the researchers were able to identify the bacterium Clostridium sp.ASF356, which can process phenylalanine into phenylacetic acid. When the researchers colonized young mice with this bacterium, they subsequently showed increased phenylacetic acid levels and signs of vascular aging. However, when the bacteria were eliminated with antibiotics, the concentration of phenylacetic acid in the body decreased. ""We were thus able to show that the intestinal bacteria are responsible for the increased levels,"" explains Saeedi.

The body's own fountain of youth

However, the microbiome in the gut also produces substances that are beneficial to vascular health. Short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibers and polysaccharides in the intestine, act as natural rejuvenating agents. The research group used in-vitro experiments to show that adding sodium acetate can restore the function of aged vascular endothelial cells. When analyzing intestinal bacteria, they found that the number of bacteria that produce such rejuvenating agents decreases with age.

""The aging process of the cardiovascular system can therefore be regulated via the microbiome,"" says Saeedi. The pharmacologist and his team are now investigating which diet has a positive influence on the complex interaction between bacteria and humans. Dietary fibers and foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties boost the body's own ""fountain of youth."" In contrast, intake of food and drinks that are rich in phenylalanine, e.g. red meat, dairy products and certain artificial sweeteners, should be limited to slow down vascular aging. The researchers are also working on ways to reduce phenylacetic acid in the body through medication. Initial attempts to curb the formation of phenylacetic acid with the help of genetically modified bacteria have been promising.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New AI tool reveals single-cell structure of chromosomes -- in 3D","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528131824.htm","Thu, 29 May 2025 02:13:50 GMT","

In a major leap forward for genetic and biomedical research, two scientists at the University of Missouri have developed a powerful new artificial intelligence tool that can predict the 3D shape of chromosomes inside individual cells -- helping researchers gain a new view of how our genes work.

Chromosomes are the tiny storage boxes that hold our DNA. Since each cell has about six feet of DNA packed inside it, it must be folded up tightly to fit. This folding not only saves space -- it also controls which genes are active or inactive. But when the DNA doesn't fold the right way, it can disrupt normal cell functions and lead to serious diseases, including cancer.

Historically, scientists have relied on data that averaged results from millions of cells at once. That makes it almost impossible to see the unique differences between individual cells. But the new AI model developed by Yanli Wang and Jianlin ""Jack"" Cheng at Mizzou's College of Engineering changes that.

""This is important because even cells from the same part of the body can have chromosomes folded in very different ways,"" Wang, a graduate student and lead author of the study, said. ""That folding controls which genes are turned on or off.""

Studying single cells is tricky because the data is often messy or incomplete. But the new AI tool is specially designed to work with those challenges. It's smart enough to spot weak patterns in noisy data, and it knows how to estimate a chromosome's 3D shape even when some information is missing.

It also understands how to ""see"" biological structures correctly, even when they're rotated. Compared to a previous deep learning AI method, Mizzou's tool is more than twice as accurate when analyzing human single-cell data.

The team has made the software free and available to scientists around the world. That means researchers can now use it to better understand how genes function, how diseases start and how to design better treatments.

""Every single cell can have a different chromosome structure,"" Cheng, a Curators' Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, said. ""Our tool helps scientists study those differences in detail -- which can lead to new insights into health and disease.""

The researchers now plan to improve the AI tool even further by expanding it to build the high-resolution structures of entire genomes. Their goal: to give scientists the clearest picture yet of the genetic blueprint inside our cells.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Timing, consistency of activity linked to better fitness","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528131819.htm","Thu, 29 May 2025 02:13:45 GMT","

Some people spring into action at dawn, while others prefer a slower start to their day. Whether you rise with a grin or a groan, scientists say your internal clock -- known as the circadian rhythm -- might influence that behavior and much more.

These biological clocks regulate not only sleep-wake cycles but also a wide range of daily physiological and metabolic functions. A growing body of research suggests that circadian rhythms are fundamental contributors to health and resilience.

Now, a new University of Florida Health study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, or NIA, shows that the timing and consistency of your daily activity might be associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness and walking efficiency -- two key indicators of healthy aging.

The NIA is a part of the National Institutes of Health.

The study found that older adults with earlier and more consistent daily activity patterns had better heart and lung fitness compared with those with later or more irregular schedules.

""While we've long known that being active supports healthy aging, this study reveals that when you're active may also matter,"" said Karyn Esser, Ph.D., senior author and professor and chair of the UF College of Medicine's Department of Physiology and Aging. ""The circadian mechanisms that generate daily rhythms in our system are important for our well-being.""

Published in April in Medicine & Science in Sports and Exercise, the study does not prove causation, Esser emphasized. While the results are promising, more research is needed to determine whether adjusting activity timing can lead to health improvements and whether these findings extend to younger populations, she said.

Researchers enrolled about 800 independent older adults in the study with an average age of 76. Participants wore wrist devices that continuously monitored activity for seven days. They then underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing to obtain a comprehensive assessment of their heart and lung health.

Key findings include:

Activity includes all daily movement -- walking, gardening, cleaning or shopping -- not just formal exercise.

The body's internal clock helps align physiological functions, such as hormone release, blood pressure and core temperature, to the natural cycle of day and night. Disruptions to this rhythm, such as those experienced during jet lag or shift work, can have negative consequences for sleep, mood and physical functioning.

Esser emphasized that although her study suggests a link between earlier, consistent activity and better health, it doesn't prove that following such a schedule will improve health and fitness.

Still, the findings open intriguing possibilities for personalized medicine, she said. Because circadian rhythms vary from person to person, future health strategies could include tailoring activity and treatment schedules to an individual's internal clock.

""Each of us has a chronotype -- a biological tendency to be more alert in the morning or evening -- and that variation may play a significant role in our health,"" Esser said. ""We're moving toward a future where understanding and respecting our individual rhythms can help guide medical care and daily living.""

Scientists use an easy shorthand to describe whether someone is a morning or an evening person. An early riser is a ""lark,"" the name taken from the bird whose song is often heard around dawn. The late risers are ""owls,"" named, of course, after the bird that hunts at night and sleeps in the day.

In case anyone is wondering, Esser is a lark.

""The morning chronotype, that's me,"" she said. Lest anyone think all scientists share this trait, Esser notes, ""I have a number of colleagues who are truly owls and don't like mornings at all.""

Modelling liver disease requires in vitro systems that replicate disease progression1,2. Current tissue-derived organoids fail to reproduce the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture observed in vivo3. Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Strikingly, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof-of-concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Taken together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage, and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis, in an all-in-one model.

Metrics details

Pseudomonas aeruginosa has long served as a model organism in microbiology, particularly for studies on gene expression, quorum sensing, antibiotic resistance, virulence and biofilm formation. Its genetic tractability has advanced the understanding of complex regulatory networks and experimental evolution. The versatility of this bacterium stems from its genomic variability, metabolic flexibility and phenotypic diversity, enabling it to thrive in diverse environments, both as a harmless saprophyte and an opportunistic human pathogen. P. aeruginosa can cause acute and chronic human infections, particularly in patients with underlying immune deficiencies. Its intrinsic antibiotic tolerance and resistance, together with its ability to produce multiple virulence factors while rapidly adapting to infection conditions, pose a major clinical challenge. In this Review, we explore key features contributing to the ecological and pathogenic versatility of P. aeruginosa. We examine the molecular mechanisms and ecological and evolutionary implications of quorum sensing and biofilm formation. We explore the virulence strategies and in vivo fitness determinants, as well as the evolutionary dynamics and global epidemiology of P. aeruginosa, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance. Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to control P. aeruginosa infections and address outstanding questions in the field.

Metrics details

Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual–omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into ‘sentences' by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.

Computational biology has advanced notably with artificial intelligence (AI) for tasks such as gene expression enhancement, single-cell perturbation prediction, tissue annotation, diagnosis, primary tumor origin predictions and image retrieval from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Recently, foundation models like CLIP8, CoCa9 and DeCLIP10 have been adapted to the field, fine-tuned with pathology images and captions, as seen in PLIP and CONCH11,12. These visual–language foundation models support applications like text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval, histology image classification, captioning and diagnosis improvement.

Omics data, including transcriptomics and genetics, provide crucial insights into cell types in health and disease, enhancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, lineage tracing and disease mechanisms13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Combining omics data with histology images offers complementary information for both research and clinical applications, and has been used for predicting cancer outcomes, prognosis and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy3. However, existing methods remain task specific and lack a unified multimodal AI model to integrate histology and omics data. Additionally, challenges remain in developing infrastructure to efficiently analyze sequencing data and pathology images together.

To address these gaps, we introduce omics and image pretraining, OmiCLIP, a transcriptomic–image dual-encoder foundation model and Loki platform, an infrastructure of multimodal analysis using OmiCLIP as a backbone. To train OmiCLIP, we curated the ST-bank dataset with 2.2 million tissue patches from 1,007 samples across 32 organs with paired whole-slide images (WSIs) and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Inspired by large language model-based single-cell models like GenePT23 and Cell2Sentence24, we represented transcriptomics of a tissue patch by a ‘sentence' of top-ranking highly expressed genes, separated by spaces (‘ '). Using this large-scale set of transcriptomics–histology image pairs, we trained the CLIP-based foundation model, integrating both genomic and image data. Building upon OmiCLIP, the Loki platform offers five core functions: tissue alignment, tissue annotation, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and ST gene expression prediction (Fig. 1). Loki provides several distinctive features, including aligning H&E images with ST data, annotating tissue H&E images based on bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or marker genes and decomposing cell types from H&E images with reference to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We evaluated Loki's functions against 22 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on 5 simulation datasets, 19 publicly available experimental datasets and 4 in-house experimental datasets, showing Loki's consistent accuracy and robustness across tasks. We also investigated OmiCLIP's embeddings for clustering and annotating scRNA-seq data and predicting The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) participants' risk levels (Supplementary Notes 1 and 2).

Transcriptomics provides insights into cellular diversity within tissues, making it a natural indicator of tissue diversity25. ST technologies bridge histopathology images and transcriptomics data, enabling the development of a foundation model that integrates both. We introduce OmiCLIP, a visual–transcriptomics foundation model trained on ST-bank, which includes diverse histopathology images and over 2.2 million paired transcriptomics from 113 studies (Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Table 1). ST-bank covers 32 organ types, including conditions like health, cancer, heart failure and Alzheimer's disease (Fig. 1b,c). We applied a quality-control pipeline to retain ST data with high-resolution H&E images. As the batch effects may strongly affect the generalization ability of the model, the adopted rank-based strategies inspired by recent single-cell foundation models such as GeneFormer26 and scFoundation27 successfully eliminate batch effects through rank-based approaches rather than relying directly on raw read counts or normalized gene expression values. Specifically, we standardized text descriptions of the associated images by converting all Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols and removing housekeeping genes. To format transcriptomics for language models, genes symbols were ranked from high to low by expression levels and structured into sentences for the text encoder (Fig. 1a).

OmiCLIP was fine-tuned using CoCa9, a SOTA visual–language foundation framework, comprising an image encoder, a text encoder and a multimodal fusion decoder. The image and transcriptomics modalities were aligned in a common representation space utilizing contrastive learning (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). In this dual-modality space, paired image and transcriptomic embedding vectors were optimized to be similar.

To evaluate OmiCLIP's reliability to image quality variability across samples due to technological limitations, we simulated low-quality H&E images by adding Gaussian noise and compared the similarity scores between the paired transcriptomic and original image embeddings, with paired transcriptomic and simulated low-quality image embeddings, which were encoded by OmiCLIP's image and transcriptomic encoders. PLIP and OpenAI CLIP served as benchmarks (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and results demonstrated that OmiCLIP is robust to variations in image quality.

For sequencing depth variability across technologies, we first analyzed the sequencing depth ranges in ST-bank and categorized samples into high, medium and low sequencing depth groups, identified as 11,792 unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts, 4,512 UMI counts and 615 UMI counts, respectively. Second, we generated low sequencing depth ST simulations using the downsampling function implemented in scuttle28. We evaluated transitions from high-to-medium sequencing depth, medium-to-low sequencing depth and high-to-low sequencing depth. We compared similarity scores between paired images and original transcriptomic embeddings, with paired images and downsampled transcriptomic embeddings. These embeddings were encoded using OmiCLIP's image and transcriptomic encoders, using PLIP and OpenAI CLIP as benchmarks (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Results demonstrated OmiCLIP's robustness across sequencing depths, highlighting its adaptability to datasets generated across different technologies.

The key advantage of contrastive-aligned visual–transcriptomics pretraining is its unique capability to drive the development of cross-modality tissue analysis tools. As a proof of concept, we developed Loki, a unified AI platform for multimodal analysis. In Loki, five modules were implemented, including Loki Align for multi-section tissue alignment, Loki Annotate for multimodal tissue annotation, Loki Decompose for cell-type decomposition from transcriptomics or histology, Loki Retrieve for histology image–transcriptomics retrieval and Loki PredEx for ST gene expression prediction from histology images (Fig. 1b). While these initial modules demonstrate its potential, Loki is designed to expand, supporting the development of more tools to further enhance multimodal tissue reconstruction and analysis. Loki could serve as the infrastructure that efficiently transfers transcriptomics such as scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq data and even marker genes into pathology image analysis via the pretrained model (OmiCLIP) (Fig. 1d), streamlining workflows, accelerating analysis and minimizing sequencing cost in research areas such as three-dimensional (3D) tissue studies and pathology diagnosis.

OmiCLIP's image embeddings capture the morphology of tissues, while its transcriptomic embeddings represent genomic characteristics. Since OmiCLIP includes both transcriptomics and image encoders, here we evaluated whether contrastive learning enhances the ability of each encoder to represent tissue types better than the initial encoders. To assess clustering performance, we moved beyond qualitative visualizations and introduced quantitative metrics to assess the quality of the clustering. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualizations showed that both embeddings clustered similar tissue types (Extended Data Fig. 2); however, the results were limited in their ability to quantify clustering quality and may have appeared unstable in some cases. Therefore, we computed the Calinski–Harabasz (CH) score29, a widely used clustering validation metric, which balances the dispersion between clusters with the cohesion within clusters (Methods). Higher CH scores reflect better clustering performance by indicating more distinct and internally consistent clusters.

First, we calculated CH scores across 95 tissue samples from the ST-bank dataset, which included expert-annotated cell types from breast, healthy heart, kidney cancer and lung tissues and heart tissue with myocardial infarction (Supplementary Table 2). These annotated cell types served as ground-truth cluster labels. Our results showed a significant increase (P value < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 1) in CH scores for embeddings after contrastive learning compared to before, demonstrating improved clustering performance.

Second, we expanded the CH score calculations to the rest of the ST-bank samples, where no cell-type annotations are directly available. For these samples, the clusters were identified by the Leiden algorithm on the ST (Methods). After contrastive learning, CH scores significantly increased in all organ types (P value < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 2). OmiCLIP's image embeddings also outperformed SOTA models like UNI7 and GigaPath30 by aligning image and transcriptomic data, not just image–image interactions. The results demonstrated OmiCLIP's ability to capture tissue heterogeneity.

Researchers recently began investigating spatial biology in 3D, revealing new insights into tissue organization and cellular interactions. This requires tools to align multiple H&E images or ST sections, and even cross-align H&E images with ST slides. However, spatial distortions and biological variations between sections make alignment challenging. To address this, we developed the module Loki Align to align ST-to-ST data, H&E image-to-H&E image, and H&E image-to-ST data. Loki Align first embeds patch-level transcriptomics or H&E images into a 768-dimension space using OmiCLIP, and then applies the adapted coherent point drift (CPD) method31 to align two embeddings, preserving probability distribution and topology (Fig. 2a and Methods). We evaluated Loki Align on four datasets including two simulation datasets, a set of eight adjacent small intestine tissue sections, and a set of two adjacent ovarian carcinosarcoma sections. To ensure compatibility with datasets that may not be represented in the ST-bank, we used fine-tuning as a default setting for the Loki Align in the alignment tasks. Fine-tuning minimized contrastive loss between image embeddings and the paired text embeddings of the top-expressed gene name sentence (Methods). We further evaluated the zero-shot performance on an ovarian carcinosarcoma dataset.

P values were calculated using a one-sided Wilcoxon test. c, Alignment results on eight adjacent normal human small intestine samples using Loki (ST-to-ST and image-to-ST) and baseline methods PASTE (ST-to-ST), GPSA (ST-to-ST) and CPD (ST-to-ST), respectively. We colored the samples using the top three PCA components of OmiCLIP transcriptomic embeddings, mapped to red, green and blue color channels, respectively. For visualization, we stacked the eight samples together along the perpendicular axis before and after different alignment methods, respectively, and visualized from the side view. The source2 that has no spatial variable gene selected by GPSA to run it is marked as ‘not applicable' (NA). Box plots show the comparison of tissue alignment performances on these seven source samples respectively and combined, represented by the PCC (and Kendall's tau coefficient in Supplementary Fig. 1) of highly variable gene expression between target and source samples after alignment at the same location, using Loki and baseline methods (PASTE, GPSA and CPD using PCA embeddings as input), respectively. In the box plots, the middle line represents the median, the box boundaries indicate the interquartile range, and the whiskers extend to data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range. d, Tissue alignment of two adjacent human ovarian carcinosarcoma samples using Loki (ST-to-ST and image-to-ST) and baseline methods PASTE (ST-to-ST), GPSA (ST-to-ST) and CAST (ST-to-ST), respectively. We colored the samples as described in c. e, Alignment performance comparison using PCC and Kendall's tau coefficient of the highly expressed gene expression between the target sample and the source sample at aligned locations, using Loki (ST-to-ST and image-to-ST) and baseline methods PASTE (ST-to-ST), GPSA (ST-to-ST) and CAST (ST-to-ST), respectively. In the box plots, the middle line represents the median, the box boundaries indicate the interquartile range, and the whiskers extend to data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range; n = 147.

First, we simulated paired H&E images and ST data by perturbing gene expression and spatial locations with varying noise levels, covering diverse tissue types and disease types (Methods). We measured the distance between Loki-aligned data and the ground truth, and compared Loki Align with PASTE and GPSA, which are designed for ST section alignment32,33. At both high and low noise levels, Loki ST-to-ST alignment and Loki image-to-ST alignment ranked first and second, respectively, among the four methods (Fig. 2b), significantly outperforming PASTE and GPSA (P values < 0.001, Wilcoxon test). This superiority likely stems from PASTE's design for linear transformations, which maintains topological integrity but struggles with spatial warping32, while GPSA aims to map readouts to a common coordinate system, risking topological fidelity33.

Second, we tested Loki Align on eight adjacent human small intestine tissues sections34. Real-world datasets often present challenges due to distortions such as rotation, tilt, uneven slicing and missing fragments. For better performance, we fine-tuned OmiCLIP using the target slide's H&E image and ST data. We aligned seven source ST datasets to target ST data and seven source H&E images to target ST data using Loki Align and applied PASTE and GPSA to align seven source ST datasets to target ST data. Loki Align successfully aligned all source sections to the target section. To evaluate the performance, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Kendall's tau coefficient. For ST-to-ST scenarios, we compared the aligned ST data and the target ST data. For image-to-ST scenarios, after aligning the H&E image to the target ST dataset, we compared the paired ST data corresponding to the H&E image with the target ST dataset. The median PCC for Loki's image-to-ST and ST-to-ST alignment ranged from 0.67 to 0.80 and 0.62 to 0.83, respectively (Fig. 2c). The median Kendall's tau coefficient ranged from 0.16 to 0.27 for Loki's image-to-ST and 0.18 to 0.27 for ST-to-ST alignment (Supplementary Fig. 1a). On the vertical plane, Loki correctly aligned the same tissue types by image-to-ST and ST-to-ST alignment, while PASTE and GPSA twisted the tissues. PASTE rotated three source sections (sources 1–3; Fig. 2c) and the PCC and Kendall's tau coefficient ranged from −0.25 to 0.39 and −0.06 to 0.13, respectively. GPSA found common coordinates in six of the seven slices but introduced tremendous distortions, resulting in a PCC of 0.27 to 0.56 and Kendall's tau coefficient of 0.06 to 0.13. Overall, Loki ST-to-ST and image-to-ST alignments outperformed the SOTA methods. To isolate the contributions of OmiCLIP embeddings versus the superior registration method (CPD), we applied CPD to both OmiCLIP embeddings and transcriptomic embeddings that was reduced to two principal components using principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 2c). OmiCLIP embeddings significantly improved the performance of alignment compared to PCA embeddings (P value < 0.001, Wilcoxon test).

Third, we assessed Loki Align's performance on two adjacent human ovarian carcinosarcoma sections35 (Fig. 2d). With fine-tuning, Loki's ST-to-ST and image-to-ST achieved the best performance, with median PCCs of 0.88 and 0.86, and Kendall's tau coefficients of 0.21 and 0.18, respectively. PASTE, GPSA and CAST36 had median PCCs of 0.26, 0.43 and 0.71 and median Kendall's tau coefficients of 0.03, 0.04 and 0.09, respectively (P value < 0.01; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The spatial expression patterns of representative genes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Fourth, we evaluated Loki Align on a human breast cancer dataset37 with paired 10x Visium and Xenium slides (Extended Data Fig. 4). We generated simulation data by performing rotation and translation of Xenium data. To perform the alignment, we first calculated transcriptomic embeddings for the Visium slide using gene sentences derived from Visium transcriptomic data. For the Xenium slide, we created pseudo-Visium data by averaging gene expression values across pseudo-spots. These pseudo-Visium data were then used to calculate transcriptomic embeddings via the transcriptomic encoder of OmiCLIP. Finally, Loki Align was applied to align the transcriptomic embeddings of the Xenium slide with those of the Visium slide, with performance measured by the mean distance between the aligned and target spots. The resulting distance between the aligned Xenium slide and the target Visium slide was 0.08 mm, demonstrating that Loki Align effectively aligns Visium and Xenium slides with high precision.

Fifth, we evaluated the performance of three training strategies: pretraining plus fine-tuning, pure pretraining and pure training from scratch on ovarian carcinosarcoma samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). The best performance was achieved with pretraining plus fine-tuning, resulting in a median PCC of 0.86 and a Kendall's tau coefficient of 0.17. Pure pretraining showed comparable performance, with a median PCC of 0.85 and a Kendall's tau coefficient of 0.18. In contrast, training from scratch exhibited the lowest performance, with a median PCC of 0.53 and a Kendall's tau coefficient of 0.06. Overall, we recommend fine-tuning as a default setting for Loki Align, as it ensures compatibility with datasets underrepresented in the ST-bank.

Lastly, we examined whether Loki Align could leverage both modalities simultaneously for alignment over a single modality. To evaluate this, we integrated image embeddings and transcriptomic embeddings by averaging them and used the combined embeddings to align two adjacent ovarian carcinosarcoma samples. We then calculated the PCC and Kendall's tau coefficient for the image embeddings, transcriptomic embeddings and averaged embeddings to assess performance (Supplementary Fig. 4). The results indicated that the averaged embeddings did not outperform single-modality embeddings. Altogether, by addressing spatial distortions and biological variability, Loki Align enables the accurate alignment of multiple H&E images and ST sections, thereby supporting advanced 3D reconstructions of tissue organization, particularly for cross-modality studies that combine H&E images and ST data.

Next, we evaluated Loki's capability to analyze H&E images using bulk RNA-seq data, which is commonly used in both basic research and clinical practice. During OmiCLIP pretraining, the cosine similarities between paired ST and histology images were maximized, allowing the similarity between the H&E image of tissue patches and tissue-type-specific bulk RNA-seq data to indicate tissue-type enrichment. We developed Loki Annotate to annotate H&E images using tissue-type-specific bulk RNA-seq data as a reference. We used OmiCLIP to encode tissue patches from a WSI and the tissue-specific bulk RNA-seq data, then calculated the cosine similarity between the encoded embeddings (Fig. 3a). Higher similarity values indicate greater presence of the tissue type.

The major tumor regions, fibroblast cell-enriched regions and adipose regions are annotated by pathology experts in black lines. Heat map shows the similarity of WSIs to the corresponding reference bulk RNA-seq of tumor, fibroblast and adipose, respectively. The color of the heat map reflects the similarities between WSIs and reference bulk RNA-seq data, with red indicating high similarity and blue indicating low similarity. CLAM attention heat maps were generated using CLAM with default parameters.

We evaluated Loki Annotate on breast cancer, normal breast, and heart failure tissues. In three breast cancer tissues, H&E regions corresponding to tumor tissue showed high similarity with the bulk RNA-seq data from tumor biopsies, which include tumor-related markers such as COL1A1 (ref. 38) and ACTB39 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarity scores within the tumor regions were significantly higher than those outside (P value < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Additionally, higher similarity scores were consistent with higher diagnostic values of tumors calculated by clustering-constrained-attention multiple-instance learning40 (CLAM, a SOTA WSI tumor analysis model; Fig. 3b). Next, we tested the similarity between H&E images of heart failure tissues and fibroblast RNA-seq data, as well as between H&E images of normal breast tissues and adipose RNA-seq data. The similarity scores in the corresponding pathology annotated regions were remarkably higher than the non-corresponding regions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5). In summary, Loki Annotate effectively annotates H&E images by using tissue-type-specific bulk RNA-seq data as a reference.

When bulk RNA-seq is unavailable, Loki Annotate can also annotate tissues using predefined marker genes, similar to the workflow of using bulk RNA-seq data without fine-tuning. We created tissue-specific gene lists using well-established markers, such as ‘TP53, EPCAM, KRAS, …, DSP' for tumors (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). As with the bulk RNA-seq approach, we used OmiCLIP to encode tissue patches from histology images and the gene name sentence composed from the marker gene list. We applied Loki Annotate to four benchmark histopathology datasets including CRC7K41 (eight tissue types), WSSS4LUAD42 (normal and tumor), PatchCamelyon43 (normal and tumor) and LC2500044 (benign and malignant). Tissue-type annotation was determined by cosine similarity derived from the dot product of normalized text embeddings and H&E image embeddings, with the highest cosine similarity score assigned as the predicted tissue to the query image. Based on these annotations, precision was defined as the proportion of correctly predicted tissues (true positives) of all predicted tissues, while recall was defined as the proportion of correctly predicted tissues of all actual tissues. The F1 score was calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which was used to measure classification performance. We measured annotation performance using F1 score and compared our results to the OpenAI CLIP model. Our analysis showed that Loki consistently outperformed OpenAI CLIP across all four datasets (Fig. 4b,c). The F1 scores of Loki ranged from 0.59 to 0.96, while the F1 scores of OpenAI CLIP ranged from 0.03 to 0.34 (Fig. 4c).

a, Schematic illustration of tissue annotation using H&E image and reference marker genes. The annotation result is decided by choosing the candidate texts with the highest similarity score to the input image query. For Loki, we used the text content of marker gene symbols of each tissue type. For the PLIP model, we used the text content of natural language description of each tissue type. b, Examples of similarity scores of images and texts calculated by Loki and OpenAI CLIP model, respectively. c, Comparison of zero-shot performances, represented by weighted F1 scores, across four datasets using Loki and OpenAI CLIP, respectively.

Several studies have developed visual–language foundation models using paired histopathology images and captions11,12. Given that transcriptomics and natural language provide complementary information, we investigated whether their combination could improve annotation performance without additional training. We applied PLIP, a visual–language foundation model for pathology image analysis, to annotate the tissue images by descriptive prompts, such as converting ‘tumor' to ‘an H&E image patch of colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium' in the CRC7K dataset. Overall, PLIP performed comparably to Loki, with F1 scores ranging from 0.5 to 0.93 (Fig. 4d). We then combined Loki and PLIP by averaging their similarity scores of an H&E image and a given tissue type (Fig. 4a and Methods), resulting in the best performance across all four benchmark datasets (Fig. 4d,e). In CRC7K, PLIP misclassified 63% of colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium images as cancer-associated stroma, while Loki misclassified 15% of tumor images as normal colon mucosa. Notably, combining Loki and PLIP achieved a 93% recall rate, demonstrating that combining transcriptomic and natural language enhances overall performance compared to each modality alone (Fig. 4f).

Since OmiCLIP can project the Visium ST data and H&E images to a shared embedding space, we developed Loki Decompose, a feature to decompose cell types in both ST data and H&E images, using scRNA-seq as a reference. Inspired by ST decomposition models like Tangram and CytoSPACE45,46, we used OmiCLIP to encode the patches (the same size as a Visium spot) of an H&E image and scRNA-seq transcriptomic profile into this embedding space. As an application of Tangram with OmiCLIP embeddings instead of gene expression data, Loki Decompose applied Tangram's nonconvex optimization algorithm47 to deconvolute the OmiCLIP embeddings of an H&E image patch or the embeddings of a Visium spot's transcriptomic profile rather than raw gene expression data, providing the cell-type composition of an image patch or a Visium spot (Fig. 5a). We assessed Loki Decompose on our in-house triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) dataset, a human colorectal cancer dataset48 and a brain dataset49,50.

The blue color indicates the performance of replacing OmiCLIP embeddings with other transcriptomic foundation models' embeddings. d, Cell-type decomposition results on three major cell types of the TNBC sample using the image by Loki and using ST by Tangram, with Xenium data as ground truth.

CLAM attention heat maps were generated using CLAM with default parameters. h, Cell-type decomposition results on the brain sample.

Right, heat map shows the cell-type distribution of VLMCs, astrocytes, L2/3, L4/5, L6 and oligodendrocytes, with color reflecting the distribution of each cell type.

First, we performed a Xenium experiment on the in-house TNBC sample and captured paired H&E images. We generated pseudo-Visium data from the Xenium data as a benchmark for evaluating Loki Decompose, using publicly available scRNA-seq data as a ref. 51. The Xenium data classified tissue into three main cell types: cancer epithelial cells, immune cells and stromal cells (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We used Loki to decompose pseudo-Visium spots and H&E images, using paired sequencing and image data from one-fourth of a WSI for fine-tuning followed by cross-validation (Methods). Decomposition accuracy was evaluated using Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). These metrics were calculated by comparing the predicted cell-type proportions to the ground truth derived from the Xenium data. Since JS divergence and SSIM operate on different scales, we standardized their values by calculating z-scores among different methods (details in Methods). The z-score for JS divergence was inverted (that is, multiplied by −1), as lower values indicate better performance. Finally, we averaged the z-scores of JS divergence and SSIM to calculate an overall impact score, which provides a unified metric for comparison across methods. Loki Decompose in ST mode and image mode ranked as the top two methods with impact scores of 1.32 and 1.11, respectively, outperforming other SOTA methods52 including Tangram, Spatial Seurat53, CARD54, CytoSPACE, Cell2location50, SpatialDWLS55 and RCTD56, with impact scores ranging from 0.87 to −1.82 (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5c). As single-cell foundation models such as GeneFormer26, scGPT57 and scFoundation27 can also provide the transcriptomic embeddings, to further evaluate the approach, we replaced OmiCLIP gene expression embeddings with those from single-cell foundation models GeneFormer, scGPT and scFoundation. Results showed that scGPT, scFoundation and GeneFormer ranked 6th, 8th and 9th, respectively (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 5c).

Second, we evaluated Loki Decompose using pseudo-Visium data generated from whole-genome sequencing Visium-HD data of human colorectal cancer as a benchmark (Fig. 5e). We fine-tuned OmiCLIP on regions with paired sequencing and image data (Methods). Remarkably, the transcriptomic embeddings for scRNA-seq data effectively captured cell heterogeneity, even without training on scRNA-seq data (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Note 1). Loki Decompose successfully predicted the spatial distribution of key cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6b). We developed a technique inspired by non-maximum suppression (NMS)58 to refine spatial probabilistic maps, enhancing decomposition performance by reducing ambiguity in complex spatial scenarios and focusing predictions on the most confident cell-type assignments. Using JS divergence and SSIM scores, Loki Decompose based on either the ST data or the H&E images was comparable to Tangram, which used gene expression as input (Fig. 5f).

Third, we extended the analysis to the entire WSI (20 mm) of the same human colorectal cancer tissue (Fig. 5g), segmenting it into image patches matching Visium spot size. Similarly, we used OmiCLIP to encode image patches and transcriptomics of scRNA-seq and then decomposed those using scRNA-seq data. Loki Decompose accurately predicted densities of tumor, fibroblast, intestinal epithelial, smooth muscle, immune and inflammatory cells, aligning closely with pathology annotations (Fig. 5g). Additionally, our predicted tumor cell density matched that of CLAM40, further validating Loki Decompose's robustness (Fig. 5g).

Fourth, to test Loki Decompose in a more challenging scenario, we applied it to a brain tissue, where neurons share similar morphology. Our dataset included vascular and leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs), astrocytes, and neurons from layers 2/3 (L2/3), layers 4/5 (L4/5) and layer 6 (L6), as well as oligodendrocytes (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 6). VLMCs and astrocytes are concentrated near the cortical surface and pial borders (for example, layer 1), while oligodendrocytes are more prevalent in deeper layers and within white matter tracts49. To decompose the mouse brain cortex slice, we applied a workflow similar to the one for other decomposition tasks. First, we fine-tuned OmiCLIP using adjacent Visium data and H&E images, then segmented the WSI into patches, corresponding to Visium spot size. The transcriptomic encoder of OmiCLIP was used to encode the scRNA-seq data from the Allen Institute atlas49, while the image encoder was used to encode the H&E image. Finally, Loki Decompose was applied to predict cell-type distributions within the brain cortex H&E image. Loki Decompose accurately predicted the distribution of VLMCs, astrocytes, neurons from L2/3, L4/5 and L6 and oligodendrocytes, aligning closely with brain anatomic ref. 49.

Lastly, we tested the performance of decomposition using three training strategies: pretraining plus fine-tuning, pure pretraining and pure training from scratch on TNBC samples (Extended Data Fig. 7). The analysis showed that pretraining plus fine-tuning had the best performance, achieving a mean SSIM score of 0.30 and a mean JS divergence of 0.40. In contrast, pure pretraining resulted in a mean SSIM score of 0.13 and a mean JS divergence of 0.43, while pure training from scratch performed the worst, with a mean SSIM score of 0.00070 and a mean JS divergence of 0.44. Although pure pretraining achieved a comparable JS divergence score to the pretraining plus fine-tuning method (0.43 versus 0.40), it showed a notable decline in the SSIM (0.13 versus 0.30), underscoring the importance of fine-tuning for optimal performance. Therefore, we strongly recommend fine-tuning the model for this task to achieve optimal results.

Altogether, Loki Decompose effectively inferred cell-type fractions from H&E images and ST data, demonstrating its potential to enhance spatial tissue analysis by utilizing H&E images to reduce experimental costs and processing time, particularly in multi-section tissue studies.

One of the basic functions of contrastive learning models is retrieval. Leveraging such ability of OmiCLIP, we developed Loki Retrieve to identify and retrieve transcriptomics data corresponding to a given H&E image. Using OmiCLIP's image encoder, query images were encoded to embeddings to retrieve the most similar transcriptomic entries from the ST-bank dataset in the aligned latent space (Fig. 6a). We presented the top 50 most similar transcriptomics results, as demonstrated by the ST-paired images from the ST-bank dataset (Fig. 6b). Then, we systematically evaluated our model on diverse datasets including four independent histopathology datasets of colorectal cancer, lung cancer and lymph node metastasis, along with eight in-house tissues of heart failure, Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer human tissues (Supplementary Fig. 7). Because ground-truth transcriptomics data were unavailable, retrieval accuracy was assessed by measuring similarity between the query image and the retrieved transcriptomics-paired images. Overall, Loki Retrieve significantly outperformed OpenAI CLIP and PLIP by a large margin (Fig. 6c,d; P value < 0.05), achieving median similarity scores ranging from 0.7 to 0.9.

The top-K quantile most similar transcriptomics were retrieved. We report Recall@K for K ∈ {5%, 10%} (Methods). f, Example image-to-transcriptomics retrieval results. The retrieved transcriptomics are shown by the paired image.

We further evaluated image-to-transcriptomics retrieval performance by calculating the rank of the correct pair using Recall@K (5% and 10%). This metric measures the proportion of correctly retrieved data within the samples retrieved using the top-K quantile (Methods). We used four reserved samples from ST-bank as validation datasets including brain, heart, kidney and breast tissue samples and four independent ST studies as a test dataset, including desmoplastic small round cell tumor, colorectal cancer, vascular and colon samples (Supplementary Table 4). Results demonstrated that Loki notably outperformed both OpenAI CLIP and PLIP across all validation datasets. Specifically, Loki achieved Recall@5% of 0.125 and Recall@10% of 0.227 for brain (average 2.3-fold higher than OpenAI CLIP and 2.5-fold higher than PLIP), Recall@5% of 0.186 and Recall@10% of 0.291 for heart (average 3.2-fold higher than OpenAI CLIP and 3.1-fold higher than PLIP), Recall@5% of 0.173 and Recall@10% of 0.297 for kidney (average 3.2-fold higher than OpenAI CLIP and PLIP) and Recall@5% of 0.140 and Recall@10% of 0.240 for breast (average 2.6-fold higher than OpenAI CLIP and PLIP; Fig. 6e). On the test dataset, Loki further demonstrated substantial improvements, achieving Recall@5% of 0.117 and Recall@10% of 0.208 (average 3.1-fold higher than OpenAI CLIP and 3.0-fold higher than PLIP; Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 4). Together, these results confirm Loki's superior performance in accurately retrieving paired transcriptomic information from images.

Building on the success of Loki Align, Annotate and Decompose in analyzing tissue across the H&E image and transcriptomics data, we developed Loki PredEx to predict gene expression for image patches. Loki PredEx computes a weighted sum of gene expression from reference ST spots where weights are determined by similarity scores between the query image and ST data, both encoded by OmiCLIP (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Methods). Several studies have explored predicting gene expression from H&E images using AI models59,60,61,62. We compared Loki PredEx with them on a normal human heart dataset comprising 39 samples. Loki accurately predicted highly variable gene expression, as demonstrated by the spatial distribution of the predicted gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 8). To evaluate the performance, we used mean squared error (MSE) and PCC as two metrics. Loki PredEx demonstrated superior performance, achieving the best results based on MSE scores in 28 of 39 cases, and ranking as the best in 16 of 39 samples based on PCC compared to Hist2ST, HisToGene, BLEEP and mclSTExp (Extended Data Fig. 9a). These results showed the robustness of OmiCLIP in predicting ST data across diverse datasets (Extended Data Fig. 9b). A major limitation of deep learning models like HisToGene is their heavy hardware requirements. Models like HisToGene and Hist2ST were optimized for smaller legacy ST datasets, with fewer spots. For instance, HisToGene is typically trained on less than 7,000 spot–image pairs. However, with modern ST technologies such as Visium, slides contain over 4,000 spots, pushing memory demands above 300 GB and complicating GPU-based training. In our experiments, training HisToGene on over 80,000 spots from 35 tissues required 4 h on 16 2.60 GHz Intel Xeon Gold 6348 CPUs for 100 epochs and Hist2ST took 31 h under similar conditions. Loki PredEx avoids these resource-intensive training needs, providing a more efficient alternative. Together, Loki PredEx delivers accurate ST gene expression predictions, and avoids these resource-intensive training needs, providing a more efficient alternative based upon the use of pretrained weights, highlighting its potential as a scalable infrastructure.

Existing dual-modality foundation models in computational biology11,12 primarily combine images with textual descriptions, proving their utility in histopathology annotation and analysis. However, the natural language descriptions lack molecular insights for disease characterization. Our study first suggests that publicly available ST datasets provide sufficient volume and diversity to pretrain a foundation model bridging tissue morphology with genomics. The success of the development of our foundation model could represent a substantial step toward understanding molecular mechanisms regulating tissue phenotypes in health and disease.

We presented OmiCLIP, a high-performance histopathology image–omics foundation model by contrastive learning. Unlike visual–language foundation models, OmiCLIP integrates molecular insights with pathology images, complementing language descriptions. Benchmark results indicate that OmiCLIP performs comparably to, and in some cases surpasses visual–language foundation models in tissue annotation, suggesting that marker genes could serve as effective tissue labels independent of language. Notably, our annotation of tissue types incorporating both language description and marker genes shows promise for triple-modal foundation modeling of image, transcriptomics and language. Using marker genes as a label could potentially facilitate molecular investigation-related studies such as drug repurposing, immune response prediction and disease mechanism discovery.

A key question is whether OmiCLIP's transcriptomic encoder generalizes to other sequencing techniques like bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. We evaluated the information of transcriptomic embeddings by cell annotation of scRNA-seq data (Supplementary Note 1) and tumor classification of bulk RNA-seq data (Supplementary Note 2). Our results show that OmiCLIP's transcriptomic embeddings efficiently cluster participants with cancer without specific training and accurately annotate cell types with even 1% of labeled cells.

Loki could potentially enhance 3D tissue analysis by integrating imaging and molecular modalities in a scalable and efficient manner. Emerging 3D histology and omics techniques already show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy by preserving native 3D tissue morphology, leading to better prognostic predictions and ultimately improved patient care63,64,65,66. However, challenges remain in spatial distortions and aligning molecular data across different modalities. Loki addresses these by aligning tissue slices and integrating ST, histology and scRNA-seq data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue architecture and cellular interactions, which is crucial for 3D tissue analysis. Incorporating Loki into workflows facilitates detailed molecular and spatial features analysis across tissue sections, supporting automated, scalable and high-resolution 3D tissue analysis.

Loki provides an AI-powered platform supporting the expansion of additional tools in a unified framework. Among the existing modules, Loki Annotate automates annotation and interpretation of molecular and spatial tissue features using associated or external RNA-seq data or marker genes. Loki PredEx predicts spatial gene expression from histology images, reducing reliance on costly and laborious ST experiments. These modules, leveraging contrastively aligned embeddings, enable efficient multimodal tissue reconstruction and analysis, providing a scalable solution to the growing demand for high-resolution tissue studies. Loki's ability to integrate diverse data types across tissue sections minimizes cost and complexity while accelerating workflows in enabling deeper insights into biological systems.

Compared to billion-scale datasets for developing visual–language models in the general machine-learning domain, the major limitation of this study is pretraining data size. We expect that continued use of training datasets may further improve the zero-shot performance. However, several biomedical multimodal foundation models were efficiently trained on million-scale datasets by removing duplicates and noise11,12,67, a strategy we used to optimize training efficiency.

Notably, as a contrastive learning framework, OmiCLIP is not generative and cannot directly generate the accurate transcriptomic profile of the query image. Instead, it retrieves tissues with the most similar transcriptomic profiles to the query tissue. While it effectively embeds transcriptomic and histology data at the patch level, it does not inherently generate new data, such as reconstructing a WSI with gene expression patterns. However, OmiCLIP's patch-level embeddings could support generative approaches, such as diffusion models, to reconstruct WSIs with ST details. Future studies could refine the transcriptomic encoder using RNA-seq datasets like scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data. Although ST-bank includes 32 organ types, rare conditions may be underrepresented. We suggest fine-tuning alignment and decomposition tasks to ensure compatibility with datasets that are not covered in ST-bank (Extended Data Fig. 10).

Unlike single-cell foundation models like scGPT57, Geneformer26 and scFoundation27, our approach models omics data as text, effectively bridging molecular and visual modalities. Representing gene expression data as text leverages natural language processing models to embed biological information into a high-dimensional space, offering several advantages over using gene expression values directly. First, text embeddings integrate omics data with various biological entities such as pathways, functional annotations68 and cell types69, extending the model's capabilities beyond tissue alignment and decomposition, making it adaptable to a broader range of biological tasks. Second, this approach aligns with other multimodal foundation models, and allows incorporation of proteomics, metabolomics and DAPI images into the same unified space. In contrast, raw gene expression values lack flexibility for such integrations and require additional preprocessing. Third, text-based foundation models trained on billions of tokens provided robust text embeddings, like GenePT23, demonstrating that gene embeddings from textual descriptions can match or surpass models trained on extensive gene expression datasets. This supports our approach of utilizing text-based embeddings to capture rich biological information efficiently.

While integrating two modalities enhances information capture, it may also introduce noise or misalignment, potentially overshadowing benefits. If one modality dominates, performance gains from dual-modality fusion may be minimal.

Loki Decompose is valuable in scenarios where sequencing costs limit transcriptomic profiling. By estimating cell-type proportions from images, researchers can preselect, screen or perform batch processing of samples cost-effectively for exploratory studies and large-scale screenings. Loki Retrieve utilizes curated reference images for ground-truth comparisons, aiding validation and interpretation, especially when training data for prediction models like Loki PredEx are scarce. Together, our approach contributes to a unified, scalable framework for multimodal analysis.

To conclude, we created ST-bank, a dataset of over 2 million pathology-specific image–transcriptomics pairs. We developed OmiCLIP to integrate these data, forming a visual–omics foundation model. Leveraging OmiCLIP, we built Loki, an infrastructure enabling multimodal analysis for tissue alignment, tissue annotation, cell-type decomposition, histology image–transcriptomics retrieval and ST gene expression prediction. These capabilities represent a fundamental step toward bridging and applying foundation models in genomics for histopathology.

We curated a large dataset of histopathology image–transcriptomics pairs using publicly available 10x Visium datasets (Supplementary Table 1). H&E images were cropped to match ST spot sizes, and text sentences were generated by combining the top 50 expressed genes per spot into sentences. For example, the top-expressed genes in one spot, for example, SNAP25, ENO2, CKB, GRIN2C and CAMK4, will be combined into a sentence: ‘SNAP25 ENO2 CKB GRIN2C CAMK4 … MTOR VPS13D'. Data preprocessing involved removing duplicates and excluding low-resolution H&E images (<2,000 × 2,000 pixels), and normalizing raw count matrices following standard protocols using Seurat70 and Scanpy71. For datasets in transcripts per million or fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped formats, which cannot be normalized to standard gene expression profiles, were retained unchanged. Quality control was applied to filter out contaminated, extremely low-quality or damaged cells, retaining only those with over 200 expressed genes. Ensembl gene IDs were converted to gene symbols for consistency. Housekeeping genes were removed to ensure a more biologically relevant analysis. These steps resulted in ST-bank, a pathology-specific image–transcriptomics caption dataset of 2,185,571 pairs.

Simulated datasets were generated from ten human tissue slices including two breast cancer72,73, one colorectal liver cancer74, one liver cancer75, one prostate cancer76, one 10x Genomics prostate cancer, one 10x Genomics colon cancer, one embryonic lung77, one normal small intestine34 and one sleep apnea tonsil sample78. We simulated new ST experiments by perturbing both gene expression and spatial locations at different levels of noise, generating 10 simulated datasets per real dataset, totaling 200 datasets (100 low-noise, 100 high-noise). Real-world data tests used a normal human small intestine Visium dataset34 of eight adjacent tissue slices, a human ovarian carcinosarcoma Visium dataset35 of two adjacent tissue slices and a human breast cancer Visium and Xenium dataset37.

Bulk RNA-seq data-based annotation used three normal human breast and three human heart failure histology images79,80 and three breast cancer histology images from TCGA. Pathology experts annotated different tissue regions. Bulk RNA-seq datasets including 663 human adipose and 504 fibroblast samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal and three paired tumor biopsy samples from TCGA. Marker gene-based annotation included four datasets: CRC7K (6,333 colorectal adenocarcinoma images), WSSS4LUAD (10,091 LUAD images), LC25000 (25,000 lung and colon images) and PatchCamelyon (32,768 lymph node images).

We downloaded a human colorectal cancer dataset48 to create pseudo-Visium spots in the Visium-HD capture area. Pathology experts annotated different tissue regions. We collected an in-house TNBC patient-derived xenograft for processing on Xenium slides, to create pseudo-Visium spots with an external scRNA-seq reference of TNBC51 for decomposition. We also downloaded a mouse brain Visium dataset50 and a scRNA-seq dataset49 from the Allen Institute.

We collected our in-house heart failure patient tissue, paraffin-embedded Alzheimer's disease patient tissue, and metaplastic breast cancer and TNBC patient-derived xenografts. The validation datasets included brain, heart, kidney and breast samples, and the test dataset included desmoplastic small round cell tumor, colorectal cancer, vascular and colon samples (Supplementary Table 4).

We used a normal human heart sample dataset81 of paired ST data and H&E images including 39 samples.

OmiCLIP consisted of an image encoder and a text encoder following CoCa9 settings. The image encoder was based on a standard vision transformer (ViT)82 with an input image size of 224 × 224 pixels. The text encoder was based on a causal masking transformer with input text length of 76 tokens. Regarding the initial embeddings of ST data, the initial text encoder was not trained from scratch but on LAION-5B83, including biological literature, which may explain its tendency to cluster similar tissue patches. The model was trained for 20 epochs, using one NVIDIA A100 80-GB GPU with a local batch size of 64. The output vectors of the image and text encoders with dimensions of 768 were optimized by minimizing the contrastive loss on a given batch. All experiments were run in Python v.3.9. Detailed software versions are: CUDA v.12.2; torch v.2.3.1; torchvision v.0.18.1; scipy v.1.13.1; pillow v.10.4.0; scikit-learn v.1.5.2; pandas v.2.2.3; numpy v.1.25.0; and scanpy v.1.10.3.

To improve performance on downstream tasks, OmiCLIP allows fine-tuning with user datasets. The fine-tuning dataset is created by preprocessing Visium data using a standard 10x Space Ranger pipeline and generating gene name sentences as describe in ‘Training dataset curation', ensuring compatibility with the pretraining dataset format. Fine-tuning is done using contrastive loss9 between image embeddings and paired text embeddings of the top-expressed gene sentences. The contrastive loss is calculated according to equation (1):

where \({x}_{i}\) and \({y}_{j}\) denote the normalized image and text embeddings, respectively. N denotes the batch size, while \(\sigma\) represents the temperature parameter. The pretrained model was fine-tuned for ten epochs for the tissue alignment task and five epochs for the cell-type decomposition task, using a local batch size of 64, minimizing the contrastive loss.

We first fine-tuned OmiCLIP using paired ST data and H&E image of the target sample. The fine-tuned OmiCLIP text encoder and image encoder then encoded ST data and image, respectively. We used a nonrigid point set registration algorithm based on the CPD method31, which iteratively aligns two point sets by minimizing the statistical discrepancies.

The algorithm initializes the transformation matrix \(W\) to zero and sets the variance \({\sigma }^{2}\) of point displacements as shown in equation (2):

Where \(D\) is the point's dimensionality, \(M,N\) are the number of points in each set, and \(x,y\) are the source and target points in sets \(X\) and \(Y\), respectively. Point sets are modeled as Gaussian mixture samples, with correspondence probability matrix \(G\) computed as shown in equation (3):

This forms the basis for expectation–maximization steps, which iterate until convergence. During the E-step, posterior probabilities \(P\) of correspondences update as given by equation (4):

In the M-step, \(W\) updates according to equations (5)–(7):

where the transformation weights \(W\) are constrained to \(0\le W\le 1\). Parameters \(\beta > 0\) controls transformation stiffness and the trade-off between data fidelity and smoothness, respectively.

We optimized CPD by adding the first two principal components of embeddings generated by OmiCLIP image encoder or text encoder, along with the original two-dimensional coordinates. The M-step was optimized by updating only the coordinates to minimize loss. We further calculated the homography matrix with translation and rotation between spots before and after alignment to avoid tremendous distortion. For PASTE, GPSA and CAST, we used their default configuration for tissue preparation and alignment in Visium data.

OmiCLIP enables zero-shot annotation by learning an aligned latent space for image and transcriptomic embeddings, eliminating the need for retraining. We used OmiCLIP text encoder to encode bulk RNA-seq data and image encoder for H&E images, then calculated cosine similarity between transcriptomic and image embeddings at spot level.

Annotation was determined by selecting candidate texts with the highest similarity score to image query. We evaluate this using four datasets: CRC7K, LC25000, PatchCamelyon and WSSS4LUAD. For Loki, text candidates were generated according to marker genes of each tissue type (Supplementary Table 3). For the PLIP model, text candidates were generated from tissue-type descriptions (Supplementary Table 3). The OmiCLIP image encoder encoded images resized to 20 × 20 pixels, consistent with its pretraining. OpenAI CLIP and PLIP models used their default configuration and functions for image and text processing.

For jointly using Loki and PLIP, we summed their normalized similarity scores. Let, \({s}_{{Loki}}\left(I,T\;\right)\) and \({s}_{{PLIP}}\left(I,T\;\right)\) represent the similarity scores between an image \(I\) and text \(T\) computed by Loki and PLIP, respectively. Normalized scores were obtained according to equations (8)–(10):

The candidate text \({T}^{* }\) with the highest combined similarity score was identified as given by equation (11):

To decompose human colorectal cancer slices, we fine-tuned OmiCLIP using paired Visium ST data and H&E images. We then used fine-tuned OmiCLIP text encoder to encode scRNA-seq data and pseudo-Visium ST data, and image encoder to encode H&E images. For in-house TNBC human samples, we fine-tuned OmiCLIP using a quarter of a region (top-right, top-left, bottom-right or bottom-left) of pseudo-Visium ST data and H&E images, then encoded scRNA-seq data and ST data via the text encoder and H&E images via the image encoder. Similarly, for mouse brain cortex slices, we fine-tuned OmiCLIP using adjacent Visium ST data and H&E images, then encoded scRNA-seq data and H&E images accordingly.

We used a nonconvex optimization algorithm implemented by Tangram to co-register OmiCLIP embeddings of scRNA-seq data with those of ST data or H&E images. We aimed to obtain a probabilistic mapping matrix \(M\) aligning single cells to specific spots based on embedding similarities between scRNA-seq and ST data or scRNA-seq and H&E images. The mapping matrix \(M\) of dimensions spots-by-cells quantifies the likelihood that a given single cell is located within a particular spot. The scRNA-seq data matrix \(S\) is structured as cells-by-embeddings, while the ST data or H&E image matrix \(G\) is formatted as spots-by-embeddings. The optimal mapping matrix \(M\) is derived by minimizing the loss function \(L\left(S,M\right)\) as shown in equation (12):

Here, \({\cos }_{{\rm{distance}}}\) denotes the cosine distance between OmiCLIP embeddings of the mapped single cells and those of ST data or H&E images. The loss function aims to minimize the cosine distance between the projected single-cell embeddings \({M}^{T}S\) and the embeddings of ST data or H&E images \(G\), thereby ensuring that the embeddings of the single cells, when mapped, resemble those observed in the spatial data as closely as possible. Each element \({M}_{{ij}}\) in the matrix represents the probability that \({\rm{cell}}_{i}\) correspond to \({\rm{spot}}_{j}\), integrating the cellular composition of the spatial spot. For Tangram, we used a uniform density prior for each spot without target count, aligning with Loki Decompose. To enhance efficiency, we adapted the mapping at the cell cluster level. The same settings were used for Loki, while Spatial Seurat, CARD, CytoSPACE, RCTD, Cell2location and spatialDWLS utilized their default configurations and tissue preparation and decomposition functions. For scGPT, scFoundation and GeneFormer, we used default configuration and tissue preparation functions before using the Tangram method with same default configurations to decompose cell types. To evaluate their performance, we used cell-type information from Xenium, Visium-HD and pathology annotation as ground truth.

To improve decomposition performance in regions with complex cellular heterogeneity, we developed a refinement strategy inspired by NMS58. This method prioritizes the most probable cell type within each spot, reducing overlapping or ambiguous assignments when multiple cell types have comparable probabilities. This refined method is recommended in complex spatial scenarios, such as colorectal cancer. For \(N\) total spots (indexed by \(i=1,\ldots ,N\)), and \(C\) cell types, we defined \({P}_{i,c}\) as the original probability of cell type \(c\) at spot i. The NMS-based refinement follows two steps: selecting the highest probability cell type and suppressing others. The most likely cell type at each spot i was determined as given by equation (13):

Then refined probabilities \({P}_{i,c}^{({\rm{NMS}})}\) was defined according to equation (14):

This NMS-based refinement ensured that only the cell type with the highest likelihood remained at each spot, eliminating competing probabilities and improving spatial decomposition accuracy.

Similarly to Loki Annotate, the retrieval results were decided by choosing candidate transcriptomics with the highest similarity score to the image query.

Here, as shown in equation (15), \(K\) indicates the set of all pairs, \({I}_{q}\) indicates the image embeddings of a given query, \({I}_{k}\) indicates the transcriptomics embeddings and \({k}^{* }\) indicates the candidate transcriptomics with the highest similarity score. We then calculated the similarity between the embeddings of the query image and the image that is paired with the retrieved transcriptomics as the ground truth.

We applied 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate Loki PredEx's performance. In each fold, OmiCLIP was fine-tuned on the training set for ten epochs, and then we used the fine-tuned OmiCLIP text encoder to encode the ST data of training sets and the image encoder to encode the image of validation sets. For each spot in the validation set, cosine similarity between its image embeddings and all the transcriptomic embeddings in the training set was computed, and these weights were used to generate ST gene expression prediction for validation set spots via a weighted average as given by equation (16):

where \(T\) is the set of all spots in the training set, Xi is the predicted gene expression for validation spot i, wi,j is the similarity score between validation spot i and training spot j, and Xj is the gene expression for training spot \(j\).

To benchmark performance, we compared Loki PredEx against HisToGene, Hist2ST, BLEEP and mclSTExp, on the same dataset. In each fold, the top 300 expressed genes in the validation set were selected for prediction. We followed default training settings: 100 epochs for HisToGene, 4 epochs for BLEEP, 90 epochs for mclSTExp and 110 epochs reduced from 350 due to computational resource constraints for Hist2ST. By applying the same cross-validation procedure and evaluating the top 300 expressed genes in each fold, we ensured a fair comparison between Loki PredEx and baseline models.

In ‘OmiCLIP improves image and transcriptomics representations', we used the Leiden algorithm in Scanpy71 to cluster ST with default parameters including a resolution of 1 and a sparse adjacency matrix derived from neighbor connectivity. We then calculated the UMAP embeddings with an effective minimum distance of 0.5 and three dimensions.

The CH score, also referred to as the variance ratio criterion, was used to evaluate clustering quality for a given dataset by comparing between-cluster dispersion and within-cluster dispersion. It was computed using two sets of ground truth, a benchmarked dataset containing 95 tissue samples from the ST-bank, which included expert-annotated cell types (Supplementary Table 2) and the Leiden clustering (described above) labels for samples without cell-type annotations. For a dataset with \(n\) points \(\left\{{x}_{1},\ldots ,{x}_{n}\right\}\) divided into \(k\) clusters \(\left\{{C}_{1},\ldots ,{C}_{k}\right\}\), CH score is the ratio normalized by the number of degrees of freedom for between-cluster and within-cluster dispersions, respectively, as given by equation (17):

Between-cluster sum of squares (BCSS) is calculated as the weighted sum of squared Euclidean distances from each cluster's centroid to overall centroid, as given by equation (18):

Here, \({n}_{i}\) is the number of points in cluster \({C}_{i}\), \({c}_{i}\) is the centroid of cluster \({C}_{i}\), and \(c\) is the overall centroid. BCSS quantifies separation between clusters, with higher value indicating better separation. Within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) measures the cohesion of the clusters with smaller values indicating tighter clustering and is the total squared Euclidean distances from each data point to its cluster centroid, as given by equation (19):

The PCC, which ranges from −1 to 1, assessed tissue alignment and gene expression prediction. Given paired data \(\left\{\left({x}_{1},{y}_{1}\right),\ldots ,\left({x}_{n},{y}_{n}\right)\right\}\) consisting of n pairs, PCC represented by \({r}_{{xy}}\) is defined in equation (20):

where \(n\) is the sample size, and \({x}_{i},{y}_{i}\) are the individual sample points indexed with i.

Kendall's tau coefficient, which ranges from −1 to 1, assessed tissue alignment, as given by equation (21):

where \(P\) denotes the number of concordant pairs, \(Q\) is the number of discordant pairs, while \(T\) and \(U\) represent ties occurring solely in \(x\) or solely in \(y\), respectively.

JS divergence, which ranges from 0 to 1, assessed cell-type decomposition. To calculate JS divergence between two probability distributions \(P\) and \(Q\), we first computed the pointwise average distribution, as given by equation (22):

Then, we calculated Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence of each distribution with respect to \(M\): \({D}_{\rm{{KL}}}\left({P||M}\right)\) and \({D}_{\rm{{KL}}}\left({Q||M}\right)\). KL divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second distribution, as given by equation (23):

JS divergence is the average of these two KL divergences as given by equation (24):

The SSIM, which ranges from −1 to 1, assessed cell-type decomposition, where we considered the cell-type distribution in spatial as image. For two images \(x\) and \(y\), as shown in equation (25):

where \({u}_{x}\) and \({u}_{y}\) are the mean intensities of images \(x\) and \(y\), \({\sigma }_{x}^{2}\) and \({\sigma }_{y}^{2}\) are the variances of \(x\) and \(y\), \({\sigma }_{{xy}}\) is the covariance between \(x\) and \(y\), \({C}_{1}\) and \({C}_{2}\) are small constants to stabilize the division when the denominators are close to zero.

MSE assessed ST gene expression prediction by comparing the Euclidean distance of the highly expressed gene expression between ground truth and prediction for each method within the same location.

The impact score assessed the performance of cell-type decomposition. For each decomposition method \(m\), we computed the mean JS divergence, \({\rm{JS}}_{m}\), and the mean SSIM, \({\rm{{SSIM}}}_{m}\), across all cell types as given by equations (26) and (27):

where \({p}_{c}\) and \({q}_{c}\) represent the ground truth and predicted proportions, respectively. \(N\) represents the total number of cell types. We standardized SSIM and JS divergence across methods to enable direct comparison, as they operate on different scales. The standardized metrics \({Z}_{{\rm{SSIM}}_{m}}\) and \({Z}_{{{JS}}_{m}}\) are calculated according to equation (28):

where \({\mu }_{\rm{SSIM}}\) and \({\sigma }_{\rm{SSIM}}\) are the mean and standard deviation of SSIM across methods. Because lower JS divergence indicates better performance, we inverted the standardized JS divergence values by multiplying them by −1, as given by equation (29):

where \({\mu }_{\rm{JS}}\) and \({\sigma }_{\rm{JS}}\) are the mean and standard deviation of JS divergence across methods. To generate a unified metric for decomposition accuracy, we averaged the inverted JS divergence z-scores and the SSIM z-scores for each method as given by equation (30):

F1 score, which ranges from 0 to 1, assessed zero-shot and linear probing methods as given by equation (31):

Here, \(\rm{{TP}}\) represents true positives, \({\rm{FP}}\) represents false positives and \(\rm{{FN}}\) represents false negatives. A higher F1 score indicates better overall performance in classification tasks. The weighted F1 score was calculated by averaging the F1 scores for each class, with each class's contribution weighted based on its frequency in the data.

Recall@K assessed image-to-transcriptomics retrieval. Let \(Q\) be the set of all queries, and \(N\) be the total number of queries. For each query \(q\in Q\), the retrieval model outputs a ranked list of candidate targets as given by equation (32):

where \({c}_{q,i}\) is the \({i}^{{th}}\) highest-ranked candidate for query \(q\) based on cosine similarity, and \({\rm{quantile}}\left(q\right)\) is the quantile of the smallest index i of the ground-truth target. \({\rm{Recall@K}}\) is defined as the fraction of queries for which the ground-truth target occurs at rank \(K\) or better as given by equation (33):

where \({\rm{I}}\left[\bullet \right]\) is an indicator function that takes the value of 1 if \({\rm{quantile}}\left(q\right)\le K\) and 0 otherwise.

Two-sided Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to assess statistical significance between models.

a, Clustering performance on ST-bank data with cell type annotation. Left: clustering performance using transcriptomic embeddings generated from OmiCLIP model before and after training. Right: clustering performance usings image embeddings from OmiCLIP model before and after training. The Calinski-Harabasz scores were calculated on the embeddings (Methods) using the pretrained OmiCLIP transcriptomic (left) and image (right) encoders, evaluated for each organ type. Higher Calinski-Harabasz scores indicate better separation capability between clusters of the embeddings. In the box plots, the middle line represents the median, the box boundaries indicate the interquartile range, and the whiskers extend to data points within 1.5× the interquartile range. b, Image and transcriptomic embeddings of the lung, kidney cancer, healthy heart, and Myocardial Infarction (MI) heart samples. Each row corresponds to a WSI and showcases information from two modalities. The first column are H&E images showing tissue morphology; the second column are the heatmaps of ST data with the colors indicating the cell types; the third column are the UMAP of image embeddings colored by cell types before and after contrastive learning; the fourth column are the UMAP of transcriptomics embeddings colored by cell types before and after contrastive learning.

Metrics details

Electrocatalysis offers a promising route to convert CO2 into alcohols, which is most efficient in a two-step cascade reaction with CO2-to-CO followed by CO-to-alcohol. However, current alcohol-producing CO2/CO electrolyzers suffer from low selectivity or alcohol crossover, resulting in alcohol concentrations of less than 1%, which are further diluted in downstream cold-traps. As a result, electrocatalytic alcohol production has yet to be scaled beyond the lab (1-10 cm2). Here, we reverse the electroosmotic drag of water using a cation exchange membrane assembly, enabling the recovery of over 85% of alcohol products at a concentration of 6 wt.%. We develop a multi-step condenser strategy to separate the produced alcohols from the effluent gas stream without dilution. Scaling up this approach to an 800 cm2 cell resulted in an output of 200 mL alcohol/day.

The electrosynthesis of ethanol through carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2R) provides a potential carbon-neutral pathway for converting intermittent renewable energy into liquid products that are storable and shippable1,2,3,4,5. Ethanol (C2H5OH) and n-propanol (C3H7OH) have been identified as particularly appealing electrolysis products in this regard, in view of their market size and carbon intensity6. The conventional approach to ethanol production is carbon-intensive, as life-cycle assessments indicate a carbon intensity of bioethanol exceeding that of conventional gasoline, thus motivating the development of low-carbon alcohol production pathways7. While bio-electrochemical and thermochemical methods are capable of upgrading CO2 to ethanol and other multicarbon products, they suffer from lower efficiencies or higher carbon footprints compared to electrochemical production8,9,10,11,12,13.

Recent advances in gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), electrolyzer design, and catalysts have enabled the production of alcohols with a high faradaic efficiency (FE)14,15,16,17 while operating at industrially relevant current densities (>100 mA/cm2)6,18. However, these systems are not suited for scale-up due to a combination of crossover of produced alcohol to the anode electrolyte, low single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE), and low energy efficiency (EE)19.

In traditional membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) equipped with an anion exchange membrane (AEM), up to 80% of alcohols cross the AEM to the anolyte20 via diffusion21 and electroosmotic drag22,23,24. This crossover risks the oxidation of produced alcohols to acetate or CO2, and the alcohols that remain are diluted (to ~0.05 wt.%) in the anolyte25. Alcohols in such low concentrations cannot be economically recovered, because the energy cost for purification would exceed the energy content of the alcohols by more than an order of magnitude25,26. Strategies to collect concentrated alcohols with low crossover rates typically require multi-membrane or solid-state electrolyte systems prone to high cell voltages (>3 V)20,25,27,28 and limitations in SPCE (CO2 utilizations <25%)29,30,31,32,33,34. The complexity of such multi-membrane systems poses an additional barrier to scaling, which is a challenge that demands electrocatalytic routes to concentrated alcohols without compromising SPCE or EE.

Cascade electroreduction of CO2 to CO followed by carbon monoxide reduction (COR) offers high overall SPCE and energy efficiency. This approach takes advantage of comparably mature and efficient CO2-to-CO electrolyzers, such as solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs), followed by CO reduction to multicarbon products in a dedicated electroloyzer35,36. This approach also avoids the issue of reactant CO2 loss to carbonate formation, which is typical of one-step CO2R electrolyzers. Since CO does not form carbonates, COR systems can operate with alkaline electrolytes at both the anode and cathode, minimizing the cathode overpotential and Nernstian pH gradient potential. Previous studies combining SOECs with COR demonstrated CO-to-C2H4 electrolyzers with 20% EEs and superior SPCEs compared to CO2R systems37.

Despite progress in reducing CO to multicarbon products such as ethylene38,39 and acetate40,41,42, high-concentration, low-crossover CO-to-alcohols electrolyzers have yet to be produced at a relevant scale43,44,45. Electrodes for CO-to-alcohol systems are currently limited in size to <5 cm2 14,17,46,47, while CO-to-acetate systems have achieved scales upward of 100 cm2 for individual cells42. In addition, the method to collect and measure alcohols from the gas outlet in both COR and CO2R systems dilute the final alcohol product in water-filled cold-traps. This method enables the measurement of the pre-diluted alcohol concentration but prevents scaled production, which requires the product in concentrated form.

Here, we report large-scale electrocatalytic alcohol production from CO at high recovery rates. We prevented the dilution of alcohols observed in conventional AEM electrolyzers by reversing the ion flow and the associated electroosmotic water flux. Using a cation exchange membrane (CEM) electrolyzer, we collected > 85% of alcohols produced by COR from the cathode gas outlet. Scaling this approach from 5 to 50 cm2 highlighted the limitation of the conventional cold-trap method for capturing the alcohol products. To address this, we developed a scalable multi-step condensation strategy that recovers 95% of alcohols from the effluent gas stream at viable concentrations, without dilution. We further demonstrated the scalability by operating an 800 cm2 cell, which is the largest single COR electrolyzer to date42, with an output of 200 mL of alcohol per day. Our approach enabled stable alcohol electrosynthesis for over 100 hours. With a stable, large area cell, this work provides a model for scaled alcohol electroproduction.

We sought first to understand how membranes affect alcohol production and crossover in COR MEA electrolyzers. We began by assembling an AEM (PiperION-40 μm) MEA and a CEM (Nafion 1110) MEA with cathodes consisting of a high PTFE content gas diffusion layer (GDL) and a catalyst of sprayed CuO nanoparticles (CuONP) (Fig. 1A and B). A high PTFE content was used to prevent flooding of the electrolyzer due to excess water from the CEM48. These tests employed a commercial CuO NP catalyst in a standard MEA electrolyzer. We selected the PiperION AEM for its low water uptake, which reduces electroosmotic drag from the cathode to anode to minimize the alcohols transported to the anolyte. For the CEM MEA electrolyzer, we selected a thick Nafion membrane with low water transport (1110 CEM) to minimize the electroosmotic drag of water from the anode-to-cathode that can dilute the alcohols. This configuration limits the diffusion of alcohols through the membrane and reduces electroosmotic drag of water from the anolyte, enabling high cathodic alcohol concentrations.

While both cells demonstrated a similar product distribution, the CEM electrolyzer produced a higher total alcohol FE of 35%, compared to 24% alcohol FE with the AEM electrolyzer, at a current density of 200 mA/cm2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We chose a current density of 200 mA/cm2 because higher current densities are preferable for industrial application2. The difference in alcohol FE of the CEM electrolyzer is due to the elevated hydroxide and cation concentration at the cathode, which enhances CORR rate and reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The negatively charged CEM retains OH- ions at the cathode and facilitates the transport of cations from the anolyte, increasing the cation concentration and stabilizing active intermediates in the CORR process49,50,51. Furthermore, the CEM electrolyzer suffered less alcohol crossover, retaining > 85% of the generated alcohols on the cathode side, compared to only 16% with the AEM electrolyzer (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We attributed this difference in alcohol crossover between the AEM and CEM to reversing the direction of electroosmotic drag, which served to block advective and diffusive transport of ethanol from the cathode to the anode (Fig. 1A and B). The CEM MEA had a higher full-cell potential of -2.58 V compared to -2.47 with the AEM MEA due to greater ohmic resistance from the thicker membrane (254 µm vs. 40 µm). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed series resistance (Rs) values of 0.45 Ω for the AEM MEA and 1.13 Ω for the CEM MEA (Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite the higher voltage, the CEM outperforms the AEM in terms of alcohol retention on the cathode-side, with an EEalcohol-cathode of 10%, compared to 2% for the AEM.

We further explored the effect of electroosmotic drag in control experiments where we added 4 wt.% ethanol to the catholyte and operated the cathode under hydrogen evolution reaction at 200 mA/cm2 (Supplementary Fig. 3). We measured the drop in ethanol concentration after 5 hours of operation, with or without current, to quantify ethanol crossover caused by electroosmotic drag. We did not measure ethanol concentration in the anolyte as oxidation to acetate or CO2 occurs25. Applying current decreased cathode-side ethanol concentration in the AEM system, while it increased in the CEM system compared to no current. These results indicate that the direction of ion flow modulates ethanol crossover. The CEM also reduced alcohol crossover without current, likely due to its greater thickness52,53.

We then investigated the effect of the CEM thickness on alcohol crossover and electrolyzer performance (Supplementary Fig. 4). Reducing the membrane thickness from 254 µm to 127 µm decreased the full-cell voltage by up to 0.08 V, reaching a value of −2.5 V, comparable to the AEM MEA. However, the thinner Nafion 115 membrane retained nearly 10% less alcohol at the cathode side compared to the thicker Nafion 1110, consistent with previous studies showing higher alcohol crossover in thinner CEMs53. This highlights a trade-off between cell voltage and alcohol crossover with membrane thickness.

Increasing the applied current density in both the AEM and CEM MEAs revealed a shift in alcohol selectivity from propanol to ethanol (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, alcohol crossover increased with current density in the AEM MEA, while the effect was less pronounced in the CEM MEA. The increase in alcohol crossover in the AEM MEA highlights the effect of electroosmotic drag, where the water flux from the anode to the cathode increases with the applied current, transferring more alcohol to the anolyte. The effect is less pronounced in the CEM MEA likely due to the already low degree of alcohol crossover at the measured currents.

We performed a technoeconomic analysis that revealed alcohol dilution due to crossover in the AEM system, both in COR and CO2R configurations, increased the downstream separation costs by seven-fold (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Testing the CEM MEA with a CO2 feed revealed an HER of > 90% due to immediate salt precipitation at the cathode54, suggesting that the single-membrane CEM configuration is uniquely suited to CO feeds (Supplementary Fig. 9). Compared to other CO2 electrolyzers targeting alcohol production, the CEM CO electrolyzer used in this work achieves greater alcohol recovery at the cathode side and does so in a simple single-membrane configuration that is easier to scale (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Note 2). Moreover, comparing the CEM MEA to previous alcohol-producing systems revealed a lower total production energy cost due to the lower voltage and alcohol crossover achieved in the single membrane system (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). We concluded that this single-membrane CEM CO electrolyzer model is currently the most suitable for scaling.

To minimize the energy cost of product separation, it is crucial to maximize the amount of alcohols recovered from the cathode gas outlet at the highest possible concentration (Fig. 1C). Previous CO2R AEM systems employed elevated temperatures to enhance alcohol evaporation into the cathodic gas stream25. The increased vapor pressure of alcohols at higher temperatures increased alcohol concentration and reduced alcohol crossover to the anode side. Here, in the COR CEM MEA electrolyzer, we found that increasing the temperature from 20 °C to 50 °C did not have a significant influence on the alcohol FE or crossover (Fig. 2A). However, the increase in cell temperature resulted in less-concentrated alcohol on the cathode side (Fig. 2B). Higher cell temperatures increase the membrane's water uptake55, which can induce more water electroosmotic drag from the anode to the cathode. The increased water uptake leads to greater evaporation of water from the cathode at higher temperatures, diluting the alcohol condensed from the outlet gas. However, the increased water uptake did not lead to higher alcohol crossover, as it is counter to the direction of alcohol transport in the CEM architecture.

The source data for the results is provided as a Source Data file.

Controlling the gas flow rate is another means of influencing the outlet alcohol concentration23. We found that increasing the gas flow rate from 10 sccm to 50 sccm doubled the cathodic alcohol concentration to 6 wt.%, while improving FE and decreasing crossover (Fig. 2C and D). We attributed the increase in cathodic ethanol concentration to higher alcohol vaporization rates caused by increased convective mass transfer at higher carrier gas (CO) flowrates (Fig. 2E). While increasing gas flowrate lowers carbon conversion efficiency (CE), bypassing this issue is possible by condensing the alcohol products and recirculating the outlet gas for multiple passes, which is an advantage unique to the phase-separable mixtures of reactant and product.

We scaled the CEM CO electrolyzer initially to 50 cm2. To simulate industrial-scale separation for alcohol production, we examined the feasibility of employing a condenser to collect the produced alcohols on the cathode side to avoid the limitations posed by conventional cold-trap liquid collectors. Although dilution cold-traps are convenient in laboratory-scale settings, they dilute the generated alcohols by adding excess water during the bubbling step. This lowers the alcohol concentration by an order of magnitude after product collection and may introduce more error in the measurement (Supplementary Note 3). We ran an initial experiment at 200 mA/cm2 using a single low-temperature condenser at 10 °C. We observed a large drop in alcohol FE compared to a 5 cm2 bench-scale test with the liquid-collector (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 10). We posited that the missing FE was due to the single condenser failing to trap all the alcohol products. We tested this hypothesis by simulating the condensation of the generated alcohols in Aspen Plus (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11). We found that approximately 30% of cathodic ethanol cannot be trapped in the single 10 °C condenser due to the high flow rate of the carrier CO gas and the vapor pressure of ethanol. Since a high flow rate is needed to minimize alcohol crossover, a method to condense alcohol while still maintaining a high flow rate CO stream was required.

C Results from the Aspen Plus simulation showing the fraction of ethanol condensed from a stream containing CO, gas products, and water vapor. D Alcohol FE distribution and crossover as functions of the number of condensers applied to the cathode gas outlet. Products marked with a stage-1 indicate products collected from the first condenser, products marked with a stage-2 indicate products collected from the second condenser, and products marked with an A indicate those collected from the anolyte. E The concentration of alcohols collected from the 5 cm2 electrolyzer set up, which includes only 1 condenser, and the concentration of alcohols collected from the first and second stage condensers are applied to the 50 cm2 cell. The source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

We hypothesized that the residual alcohols could be recovered by introducing a second downstream condenser at a lower temperature (Fig. 3B). We conducted simulations with the second condenser at various inlet flowrates to determine the fraction of total ethanol in the outlet stream that would be condensed, depending on the temperature of the second condenser (Fig. 3C). We found that a second condenser with a temperature < -30 °C is needed to condense 95% of the ethanol in the outlet gas stream at these conditions.

We replicated the 50 cm2 experiment using the two-stage condenser strategy. The first condenser remained at 10 °C, while we kept the second at −78 °C by immersing it in a bath with a dry ice/isopropanol mixture, ensuring the condensation of all alcohols. The first condenser removed most of the water and prevented freezing in the second condenser. The FE for all products reached 98%, with a total alcohol FE of approximately 28%, mirroring the results of the bench-scale test (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10). The second condenser produced a stream of 28 wt.% ethanol and 20 wt.% propanol, summing up to 48 wt.% for all alcohols (Fig. 3E). Thus, the two-stage condenser strategy both eliminates the water dilution step, allowing alcohols to be captured at a higher concentration, and improves the overall alcohol recovery. A subsequent energy analysis indicates that the energy cost of operating a second condenser is small (<~3% of total energy input, Supplementary Note 5). This approach can be readily scaled to collect concentrated alcohols produced by much larger electrolyzers.

Building upon the outcomes from the 50 cm2 testing, we scaled up the electrolyzer size to 800 cm2, which is suitable for stacking in industrial applications and compatible with currently available commercial membranes (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Further details on the design of the 800 cm2 cell can be found in an earlier study56. Due to the large amount of water expected to be transported to the cathode via electroosmotic drag, we added a third pre-condenser stage at room temperature (20 °C) to remove the excess water. The electrolyzer operated at a lower current density of 100 mA/cm2 compared to the previous test due to limitations of the mass flow controller, increasing propanol FE to 18.5%. We achieved an ethanol FE of ~19%, similar to the 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 electrolyzer (Fig. 4B). The 800 cm2 electrolyzer experienced greater alcohol crossover to the anolyte, with approximately 65% of alcohols retained at the cathode outlet, compared to ~88% for the 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 cells. We attributed the increased alcohol crossover in the 800 cm2 electrolyzer to the higher feed-gas pressure, as the flow field design in the larger electrolyzer was not optimized to maintain the same pressure drop as in the smaller electrolyzers, with an overall pressure drop of 10 psi. This higher feed-gas pressure resulted in greater alcohol transport across the membrane and less ethanol evaporation, leading to greater alcohol crossover (Supplementary Fig. 14). Improvements in pressure distribution on both sides of the MEA were needed to reduce pressure gradients. After adding the room-temperature condenser, both the 10 °C and −78 °C condensers collected higher alcohol concentrations (~40 wt.%), as most of the water was removed in the first stage (Fig. 4C). The 800 cm2 electrolyzer demonstrated a production rate of 96 mL/day of ethanol and 84 mL/day of propanol (Fig. 4D). To our knowledge, this system represents the largest-single cell COR demonstration, for any product, to date42. The 800 cm2 cell operated for two hours with no measurable change in performance and produced 15 mL of alcohol during that run time.

Voltages represent the full-cell MEA potential and are not iR-corrected. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

To establish the stability of the CEM electrolyzer, we conducted a test with the 5 cm2 cell over a longer duration. The system maintained a total alcohol FE of ~35% at a full-cell potential of around −2.4 V for more than 100 hours (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Table 15). The alcohol concentration remained stable, averaging around 6 wt.%, with over approximately 84% of the alcohols extracted from the cathode side, indicating the potential for long-term COR-based production of alcohol. To further validate the long-term operation of the large-scale electrolyzer, we operated the 800 cm2 electrolyzer for an additional 7.5 hours (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 16), which is the maximum allowable duration due to lab restrictions preventing the use of high CO flow rates for longer durations. We observed no considerable changes in the catalyst structure or ionomer binder after this stability test (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17). We also observed no significant degradation in alcohol FE or crossover, supporting the scalability of the CEM MEA for large-scale alcohol production from CO.

We developed a scalable COR electrolyzer that produces CO2-derived alcohols with lower energy intensity. We found that the conventional AEM MEA diluted the alcohol products due to electroosmotic drag, which we mitigated by reversing the ion flow using a CEM MEA to minimize alcohol crossover. Optimization tests on the CEM MEA demonstrated that increasing the CO flow rate enhanced alcohol recovery, achieving over 85% recovery from the cathode side at concentrations up to 6 wt.%. Scaling to a 50 cm2 electrolyzer initially led to significant product loss due to high feed gas flow rates, which required us to add a second low-temperature condenser, which captured over 95% of alcohols from the gas phase. Experimental validation confirmed concentrations up to 48 wt.% using the second condenser. We achieved further scalability validation by operating an 800 cm2 electrolyzer, where most of the alcohols remained on the cathode side and were effectively extracted from the cathode outlet using a multi-stage condenser strategy. Additionally, the optimized CEM electrolyzer configuration demonstrated more than 100 hours of stability when applied to the 5 cm2 cell, maintaining low alcohol crossover rates. This represents the largest COR cell to date, validating industrial-scale COR for alcohol production.

The gas diffusion electrodes were prepared by spraying a catalyst layer onto a custom high PTFE content gas diffusion layer. A CuO nanoparticle catalyst ink was prepared by mixing 200 mg of CuO nanoparticles (Sigma Aldrich, 544868), 150 mg of Nafion D521 dispersion (Fuel Cell Earth, D521), 150 mg of PTFE nanoparticles (100 nm), and 36 mL of methanol. The catalyst nanoparticle ink was sonicated for 2 h in an ultrasonic bath and spray-coated onto a 50 cm2 custom GDL with an airbrush until a loading of 1.5 mg/cm2 was reached. The ink was altered proportionally for the 800 cm2 test.

The custom gas diffusion layer preparation is based on our previous report48. Briefly, a carbon slurry was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of carbon black (Alfa Aesar, 39724) with 5 drops of Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, X100) and 35 mL of isopropyl alcohol. A PTFE dispersion was made by diluting 5 g of a commercial PTFE dispersion (Sigma Aldrich, 665800) with 5 g of DI water. The slurry and dispersion were mixed, combined, and blade-coated onto a wet-proofed carbon paper (Fuel Cell Earth MGL190, 50% wet proofed, 80190 T) using a blade height of 0.6 mm. The gas diffusion layers were then heat-treated in a furnace at 180 °C for 3 h, at 280 °C for 3 h, and 340 °C for 1 h to remove solvents, surfactants, and sinter the PTFE.

The COR electrochemical measurements were performed in a 5 cm2, 50 cm2, or 800 cm2 MEA cell with a stainless steel or titanium serpentine cathode flow field and a titanium serpentine anode flow field. The tests were all completed under ambient conditions. The cells were assembled by sandwiching a 254 μm-thick Nafion 1110 membrane (Fuel Cell Store) (in CEM experiments) or a 40 μm-thick PiperION-A40-HCO3 membrane (Versogen Inc.) (in AEM experiments) between a cathode and a Ir-mixed, metal oxide coated titanium felt anode (Magneto Special Anodes). The Nafion 1110 membrane was replaced by a Nafion 117 membrane for 800 cm2 experiments due to the limited availability of Nafion 1110 in larger sizes. Nafion 115 was also evaluated. The membranes were treated according to the supplier specification. The 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 cells were sealed with a 250 μm silicone gasket on the cathode and a 1/16” viton o-ring on the anode side. The 800 cm2 cell was sealed with a 3/16” buna o-ring. To maintain proper cooling in the 800 cm2 electrolyzer, the electrolyte was circulated through a stainless-steel radiator with a fan, keeping the temperature constant at approximately 30 °C, as monitored by inline thermocouples throughout the experiment.

The CO stream was fed without humidification to the cell at 50 sccm with a mass-flow controller. Humidification of the CO gas was not required, as the water transported through the membrane was sufficient to support the COR reaction. A 1 M KOH anolyte was prepared by adding potassium hydroxide pellets (BioShop, PHY202) with deionized water prior to each test. The 1 M KOH anolyte was supplied to the anode at 10 mL/min with a peristaltic pump from a 200 mL container. The electrochemical measurements were performed with a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT204) equipped with a 10 A booster in galvanostatic mode or a power supply (Magna-Power SL series 10 V 250 A programmable DC power supply). The data was exported and processed in Excel. The cell was left for 1 h at each condition to accumulate liquid products. The cell voltages are all reported without iR-correction.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on the 5 cm2 cell using an EIS module (Autolab FRA32M) over a frequency range of 105 Hz to 1 Hz with an AC perturbation amplitude of 5 mA. The resulting Nyquist plots were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model (Supplementary Fig. 2). All experiments were conducted at ambient lab conditions (20 °C, 1 atm).

The COR gas products were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Clarus 590) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The gas chromatograph was equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5 A Capillary Column and a packed Carboxen-1000 Column with argon as the carrier gas. The gas flowrates were measured with a bubble column or with a Coriolis mass flowmeter (Endress and Hauser).

The COR liquid products were measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H+ NMR). The liquid products crossed-over to the anode side were obtained by taking samples from the anolyte. The cathode liquid products were obtained using either a liquid-collector or gas condenser applied downstream to the cathode gas outlet. The liquid-collector was a vial containing 10 mL of DI water held at 0°C with an ice bath, in which the cathode gas outlet was bubbled through to collect the liquid products. The condensers were glass spiral condensers that circulated water from an ice bath or isopropyl alcohol from a dry-ice bath to achieve the desired condensation temperatures. The samples were diluted with D2O and DMSO was used as the internal standard. The analysis was performed with an Agilent DD2 500 spectrometer in water suppression mode.

The amount of alcohol crossover was measured by comparing the FE of the alcohols obtained from the vapor-phase in the cathode outlet gas to the total alcohol FE:

The FE of the liquid and gas products were calculated as follows:

Where \({n}_{i}\) is the number of moles of each liquid product, F is the Faraday Constant, \({z}_{i}\) is the number of electrons transferred for each product, Q is the total charge passed during liquid product collection, \({x}_{i}\) is the volume fraction of each gas product, \(v\) is the gas flowrate, \({P}_{0}\) is atmospheric pressure, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

The United States government has collected DNA samples from upwards of 133,000 migrant children and teenagers—including at least one 4-year-old—and uploaded their genetic data into a national criminal database used by local, state, and federal law enforcement, according to documents reviewed by WIRED.

The records, quietly released by the US Customs and Border Protection earlier this year, offer the most detailed look to date at the scale of CBP's controversial DNA collection program. They reveal for the first time just how deeply the government's biometric surveillance reaches into the lives of migrant children, some of whom may still be learning to read or tie their shoes—yet whose DNA is now stored in a system originally built for convicted sex offenders and violent criminals.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests or public government documents. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

The Department of Justice has argued that extensive DNA collection activity at the border provides “an assessment of the danger” a migrant potentially “poses to the public” and will essentially help solve crimes that may be committed in the future. Experts say that the children's raw genetic material will be stored indefinitely and worry that, without proper guardrails, the DNA dragnet could eventually be used for more extensive profiling.

Spanning from October 2020 through the end of 2024, the records show that CBP swabbed the cheeks of between 829,000 and 2.8 million people, with experts estimating that the true figure, excluding duplicates, is likely well over 1.5 million. That number includes as many as 133,539 children and teenagers. These figures mark a sweeping expansion of biometric surveillance—one that explicitly targets migrant populations, including children.

The DNA samples are registered in the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, a database administered by the FBI, which processes the DNA and stores the resulting genetic profiles. A network of criminal forensic databases, CODIS is used by local, state, and federal enforcement agencies to match DNA collected from crime scenes or convictions to identify suspects.

On May 10, 2024, for instance, records say that CBP agents from the El Paso, Texas, field office collected a DNA sample from the mouth of an individual in its custody whom CBP identified as Cuban and who was detained for allegedly being an “immigrant w/o docs.” Swabbing the individuals' cheek, the agents obtained a DNA sample containing the individual's entire genetic code and then sent the sample to the FBI for processing.

According to CBP records, the individual was just 4 years old.

Of the tens of thousands of minors whose DNA was collected by Customs and Border Protection over the past four years, as many as 227 were 13 or younger, including the 4-year-old. Department of Homeland Security policy states that individuals under 14 are generally exempt from DNA collection, but field officers have the discretion to collect DNA in some circumstances. The data shows additional entries for kids aged 10, 11, 12, and 13. The numbers spike beginning at age 14; more than 30,000 entries were logged for each age group from 14 to 17.

Under current rules, DNA is generally collected from anyone who is also fingerprinted. According to DHS policy, 14 is the minimum age at which fingerprinting becomes routine.

As many as 122 minors were categorized as American citizens, 53 of whom were not detained for any criminal arrest, CBP records say. (People asking to enter the United States to apply for asylum are put in civil rather than criminal custody.)

Neither DHS nor CBP provided comment ahead of publication.

Multiple legal, privacy, and immigration experts described the findings as deeply troubling. “It's horribly dystopian,” says Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “It's impossible for me to think of a reason to collect a 4-year-old's DNA and upload it to a database that's explicitly supposed to be about criminal activity.”

As one of the world's largest law enforcement agencies, CBP is responsible for intercepting and processing individuals who cross the US border without authorization. While Immigration and Customs Enforcement handles long-term detention and deportation, CBP controls the earliest, most vulnerable hours of a migrant's legal journey in the US, often when they are first taken into custody, questioned, and in many cases fingerprinted and swabbed for DNA.

Both CBP and ICE operate under the Department of Homeland Security and, under current policy, are authorized to collect fingerprints and DNA from anyone in their custody as young as 14 years old. Exceptions for younger children can be made in certain cases involving “potentially criminal situations”; however, the CBP data analyzed by WIRED indicates this was the case in as few as 2.2 percent of the hundreds of kids subjected to DNA swabs.

Of the 227 people listed in the data as children under 14 and having their DNA submitted to the FBI, most of them are simply labeled “detainee.” Only five were listed as arrestees or linked to criminal charges.

CBP's participation in the CODIS program isn't new, though it expanded significantly after a 2020 Department of Justice rule amending a previous exemption that effectively allowed DHS to avoid collecting DNA from civil immigration detainees.

Sara Huston, an expert in genomics policy and the principal investigator at the Genetics and Justice Laboratory and a research assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, tells WIRED that CODIS is a powerful tool for law enforcement when solving violent crimes, sexual assaults, and missing persons cases.

Huston explains that typically when DNA is collected from a crime scene—such as in a sexual assault case—it's processed and uploaded to CODIS and compared with DNA from anyone in the database, which includes people who have been previously arrested for certain crimes or convicted. A match can help investigators connect unsolved cases, identify suspects, and share critical leads across jurisdictions.

But the inclusion of migrants, the vast majority of whom were not listed in CBP data as having been accused of any felonies, raises deeper questions about what kind of data belongs in a criminal database. CODIS was designed to track criminal offenders, not to permanently catalog the genetic information of undocumented children passing through immigration custody.

“It's not that we can't solve crimes by collecting these samples—that's why CODIS exists, and it's a wonderful tool,” Huston says. “But it's not a fair system to keep DNA of people who have not committed crimes on the assumption that they likely will.”

Apprehensions of migrants who crossed the border unlawfully between ports of entry have since fallen to historic lows during the current Trump administration; it's unclear whether the pace of DNA collection has also slowed, as the most recent data ends on December 31, 2024.

The data, which CBP published to its website in February, shows that DNA collection accelerated under the Biden administration, with daily submissions to CODIS increasing sharply in 2024 alongside a reported rise in border apprehensions. On a single day in January 2024, for example, the Laredo, Texas, field office submitted as many as 3,930 DNA samples to the FBI—252 were listed as 17 or younger, CBP records show.

The DOJ has defended the mass collection of DNA at the border as necessary for solving crimes. In its official rationale, the agency argues that this sweeping effort is “essential” not only for identifying migrants who may have committed crimes in the past but also for potentially solving crimes they might commit in the future.

For Stevie Glaberson, the director of research and advocacy at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, the implication is clear: The US government is treating every person who crosses the border, regardless of age, legal status, or whether they're accused of any wrongdoing, as a possible suspect in crimes yet to occur.

If the government's goal is to determine whether a detainee is connected to past crimes, Glaberson tells WIRED, there would be no need to add that person's DNA to CODIS—they could simply check for a match against existing profiles. “It's hard to imagine a situation where a 4-year-old was involved in criminal activity,” Glaberson says.

“Taking DNA from a 4-year old and adding it into CODIS flies in the face of any immigration purpose,” she says, adding, “That's not immigration enforcement. That's genetic surveillance.”

Multiple studies show no link between immigration and increased crime.

In 2024, Glaberson coauthored a report called “Raiding the Genome” that was the first to try to quantify DHS's 2020 expansion of DNA collection. It found that if DHS continues to collect DNA at the rate the agency itself projects, one-third of the DNA profiles in CODIS by 2034 will have been taken by DHS, and seemingly without any real due process—the protections that are supposed to be in place before law enforcement compels a person to hand over their most sensitive information.

CBP collects DNA using buccal swab kits—long cotton-tipped sticks used to scrape the inside of a detainee's cheek. While the DNA sample itself contains a person's entire genetic code, Huston says that what's uploaded to CODIS is better understood as a lower-resolution snapshot—a DNA profile made up of select genetic markers used solely to identify individuals—and is not intended to reveal traits, health conditions, or genetic predispositions. However, both she and Glaberson note that the raw DNA sample itself could be stored indefinitely.

The DOJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did it answer questions about how long raw DNA samples are stored. However, a current DOJ official, speaking to WIRED on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retribution, defended the collection and retention of migrant DNA. Storing raw samples, they say, is necessary for due process—to confirm that a match in CODIS can be traced back to the original raw material. “If you aren't committing a crime, being in this database isn't going to affect you,” they say, arguing that a larger pool of DNA increases the chances of finding a match.

Under federal law, CODIS data and the raw genetic samples can only be used for identification in criminal cases. DHS policy states that DNA samples may not be used to discriminate “in the provision of health benefits or other services” and that DNA samples are not used by the FBI to “reveal any physical traits, race, ethnicity, disease susceptibility, or other sensitive information about an individual.”

But privacy advocates worry that those rules aren't enough, since policies can change and new uses can emerge alongside new technology. For instance, privacy and civil liberties experts have warned that the government could one day use DNA to link immigrants to family members, who could also be targeted by law enforcement. Another concern is that genetic data might be reanalyzed to predict health-related markers or inherited conditions—potentially influencing decisions about admissibility or whether someone is likely to require government support.

As Glaberson warns, “The warehousing of genetic samples containing the entirety of people's genetic code presents a risk in the future.”

Some species of hummingbird are adapting to urban life by undergoing evolutionary changes in their anatomy, influenced by the proliferation of artificial drinking fountains. According to some biologists, this might show that these birds are on their way to becoming commensal with humans—benefiting from living closely alongside them—like pigeons have in urban areas.

A recent study found that the size and shape of the beaks of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna), a species native to North America, have changed. A hummingbird's beak is naturally long and slender in order to access nectar located in deep inside flowers. However, in recent decades, the beaks of urban Anna's hummingbirds have evolved to be significantly longer and larger to better access sugar-laced drinking fountains installed outside of homes, which have proliferated in urban areas. This adaptation suggests that these feeders offer hummingbirds more food than nectar-filled flowers.

The study, which looked at reported sightings of the birds as well museum specimens from the past 160 years, also found that males are developing sharper, more pointed beaks, possibly to compete with other hummingbirds for access to these sugar-filled fountains.

Populations of these hummingbirds expanded northward in California at the same time as the establishment of urban centers where feeding could take place. The researchers discovered that the population density of Calypte anna has also increased over time, and found that this appears to be linked to the proliferation of feeding fountains and nectar-producing eucalyptus trees, both of which were introduced to the region by humans.

These morphological changes to the hummingbirds have occurred rapidly. According to the study, Calypte anna populations in 1930 were very different from those in 1950, when the birds' bills had already begun to grow. In just 20 years, equivalent to about 10 generations of these birds, evolution left its mark, the authors note.

To conduct the research, the team used sighting data for the species in all 58 Californian counties between 1938 and 2019, in addition to analyzing specimens preserved in museums. They also turned to old newspaper advertisements to estimate the number of feeders in use during the last century. Finally, they developed a computational model to predict hummingbird expansion, taking into account assisted feeding and the presence of eucalyptus trees.

“They seem to be moving where we are going and changing quite rapidly to succeed in their new environments. We can think of the Anna's hummingbird as a commensal species, similar to pigeons,” says Nicolas Alexandre, coauthor of the study and a geneticist at Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology and de-extinction company based in Dallas, Texas.

Hummingbird feeders or drinkers use sugar water to attract hummingbirds and provide food during seasons when flower nectar is scarce. According to the journal Science, one of the oldest records of these devices dates back to 1928, although they were probably in use much earlier. In general, they do not pose a risk to the species, as long as they are cleaned regularly to avoid the proliferation of bacteria and fungi that can affect hummingbirds.

Another species of bird, the common pigeon (Columba livia) has also adapted to living in cities. Pigeons can be found in urban spaces around the world, taking advantage of the plentiful nesting sites and food that cities have to offer. They exist in urban environments without having a significant impact on human activities, this being a clear example of commensalism, where one species gains advantages by linking with another without directly harming it.

Columba livia originally inhabited rocky areas of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. However, it was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago as a source of food and due to its excellent sense of direction, which meant the birds could be used for carrying written messages. As a result, many were released into new habitats, with some choosing to live in cities, becoming part of the urban fauna. Today, they are one of the most common birds in the world.

As I watch through my computer screen, Tom Bender, the product lead for Instagram's Edits, places a finger on his smartphone and the software traces an outline around a chubby cat from some meme video. He then takes the furry cutout and drops it over an existing video of himself within the Edits app, adjusting the animal's opacity to make the cat slightly see-through and ensuring that his own visage in the background stays visible.

This ability to fine-tune overlay opacities was just one of many new and upcoming features he demonstrated in a recent app walk-through for WIRED. While the Instagram platform was first known for photography, it's now dominated by video. The new Edits app serves as a companion to Instagram, but one that gives the next generation of video creators all the tools they need to make Reels.

Edits launched last month on Apple and Android devices, after months of delays. Meta, which owns Instagram, is putting Edits forward as a challenger to ByteDance's CapCut app. That mobile video editing tool, designed to support TikTok creators, was released internationally in 2020 and has become the default choice for creating videos on your phone.

Although Edits initially squeaked past CapCut on Apple's free downloads charts during release week, the app now sits outside of the 100 most downloaded apps on iOS. It sits far below its main competitor, which is comfortably positioned in the top 10. (Meta declined to share current usage numbers or other statistics for Edits.)

Bender knows he needs to make the app more attractive to creators. So, what's his plan? Iteration, iteration, iteration.

“We launched a minimum viable product,” he says. “I think the most important thing, from our perspective, is to listen to creators and just launch great features every month or every week.” More video effects and filters are rolling out now. Soon, you'll be able to adjust the volume across all of the clips in a project. In the next few weeks, an in-app teleprompter—so creators can look right at the camera as they're reading scripts—is set to drop.

With Edits, Instagram isn't trying to usurp powerful desktop video editing tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. Rather, the developers are targeting anyone looking for better ways to craft social media videos on their smartphone. Bender touts Edits' preproduction tools, such as the existing Inspiration tab for finding video ideas and saving trending Reels, as an example of Instagram integrations designed with mobile video editors in mind. “Creators will have a long Notes app file or DM threads where they send examples of videos,” he says. “There's not a great way to keep track of all your ideas today.” After posting, users can see insights into how the video performed on Instagram Reels inside of the Edits app.

Social media video creators rarely post their work on just a single platform; they'll edit in one app (typically CapCut) and post to TikTok, Instagram, X, and elsewhere. So why should they consider switching to Edits from software they're familiar with, beyond the Instagram integrations?

“We definitely hear that creators share to a lot of different platforms now,” says Bender. One way to entice them to use Edits is to let all creators export their video in high quality without adding a watermark. This gives it a leg up on CapCut, which stamps an identifying watermark to the end of exported video projects unless the user upgrades to a paid subscription. While Edits currently has fewer features than CapCut, it's completely free to use.

Edits is receiving several updates in the coming weeks, including the ability to adjust the volume across all of the clips in a project.

In addition to removing watermarks, paying CapCut subscribers unlock more advanced and minute features, including a bevy of AI-focused tools: product photos, posters, models, and effects. Bender believes AI tools that automate common tasks for mobile videos, like cutouts and effects, are an area for growth in Edits. “There are ways we can keep human creativity at the center, but just take out the tedium,” he says. His team is also exploring how AI can be used to better analyze past videos from creators that performed well on Instagram and suggest potential future topics tailored to their niche audience.

Users have been able to post videos on Instagram for over a decade, and the algorithmic Reels feed first launched in 2020. Still, the Edits app represents a new era for the social media platform. It's a clear sign the company currently prioritizes streamlined video creation of audience-engaging posts. “That would be good for Instagram because creators will make more videos,” says Bender. “The videos will be better, and then that makes Instagram better for people watching videos.” It's all part of Instagram's plan for more Reels, more viewers, and an overall more video-centric app.

It looks like some kind of seed pod or pine cone caught mid-explosion. At the center, there's a jumble of trumpets-turned-terraria—conical containers for space-going plants—and from this central core extend more than two dozen curved and spindly arms, each with a heavy-looking disc at its end.

This is a Space Garden. Well, a one-third-scale model of one that was exhibited last week at the Venice Biennale exhibition in Italy. The people who came up with Space Garden want to send a full-size version, stocked with real plants and seeds, to low Earth orbit within the next five to seven years.

It is, in part, an effort to reimagine what life in space could be like. “People will commute to space for work,” asserts Ariel Ekblaw, CEO of Aurelia Institute, a nonprofit space architecture design lab. And they're going to appreciate having some greenery around when they get up there, she adds. “If we start with nature, we might go on a more fruitful pathway to a life worth living in space,” explains Stuart Wood, executive partner at Heatherwick Studio, a London-based design and architecture firm that is collaborating with Aurelia Institute on the Space Garden project.

For decades, astronauts have dabbled in space gardening. Russian cosmonauts were the first to grow plants in space during the 1970s—their crops included onions, some of which were later eaten by residents aboard the Salyut 1 space station. Other orbital adventurers have grown thale cress, tomatoes, zinnias—and a Chinese probe even carried cotton seeds to the far side of the moon in 2019. Two weeks post-landing, the seeds had sprouted (but, ahem, they soon froze to death during the outrageously cold lunar night).

While off-world agriculture has long seemed nascent and experimental, that could soon change. Researchers are currently pushing plants and seeds to extraordinary limits, to test their space-hardiness—often with encouraging results. Space-travelling vegetation must battle cosmic radiation, uneven temperatures, air that isn't quite like the air on Earth, and many other challenges.

Intrepid flora could help otherwise artificial and sterile environments—space stations, pods, and capsules—seem more like home, though. The designers of Space Garden say it's time orbital horticulture took a quantum leap, something like the giant interstellar greenhouses of the film Silent Running. They want to include “hero” species at the center of their cosmic garden, chosen for their aesthetic or cultural significance, in order to connect rocket men and women with the beautiful Earth below. Perhaps a small fig or pomegranate tree, for example. “It's not all watercress and lettuce,” says Wood.

But the journey, invariably, begins with seeds. People who want to boldly sow where no-one has sown before already have a wealth of studies to pore over. And quite a few of them have been carried out by Mike Dixon at the University of Guelph in Canada, and colleagues. Dixon has sent literally millions of seeds into space over the years. Generally, once back on Earth, they germinate without problems.

In 2021, he and others sent seeds to the International Space Station (ISS). While in space, they were contained within a contraption positioned outside the cocoon-like environment of the space station itself, a suitcase-shaped enclosure called the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE). “Quite frankly, I didn't expect the ones outside the space station to survive,” says Dixon. But they did. The seeds were exposed to some cosmic radiation, but being in a shaded position aboard MISSE, they were spared the worst of the rays, and their temperature never exceeded 50 degrees Celsius. Truly direct sunlight in the vacuum of space can be incredibly intense.

Research also suggests that, once plants sprout in space, they might cope with a fair amount of interstellar abuse. They don't mind reduced pressure and oxygen levels, says Dixon. And while temperatures must be kept within a reasonable threshold—consider those short-lived cotton plants on the moon—plants are more tolerant of such variation than mammals, including humans, says Dixon: “Plants won't be the limitation in our exploration of space—it's us. We're kind of wimpy in many respects.”

But space gardeners will still need to be conscientious growers. Ye Zhang of NASA's Kennedy Space Center has carried out extensive research on space-going seeds and has noticed differences in the hardiness of certain species. “Tomatoes and lettuces are sensitive to the space environment, especially,” she says, referring to previous work. In 2021, she and colleagues also sent seeds to MISSE, which after eight months returned to Earth. They were held in little foil-lined packets, just like the seed packets you buy at garden centers. All of the seeds, for various different plants including kale, radish, and carrot, germinated reliably, suggesting that their position within the MISSE device was protective enough to ensure seed survival.

As for actually cultivating large numbers of plants in orbit in the future, a key challenge will be water management, suggests Zhang, noting that plants' uptake of water might vary in space: “Overwatering will stress the plants, and then the plants will be more susceptible to microbial or other problems.” Separately, seeds can clearly survive the powerful vibrations of a rocket launch, but certain established plants might not. Plus, it remains an open question as to how certain plants will fare on really long space voyages that last, say, multiple years.

Zhang adds that further research will help us understand how space travel changes the genes in seeds and plants, since that could significantly affect how they grow. There are already hints that genes related to plants' immune systems turn on or off in space—which might influence their resistance to infections, for example.

A concept such as Space Garden, however, peers past these details to a future where the intricacies of off-world horticulture are largely solved. For Ekblaw and her colleagues, the vision depends partly on spaceflight becoming far more accessible than it is today. Launching things into orbit is going to have to get a lot cheaper and fall from thousands of dollars per kilogram at present to perhaps as little as $100–200 per kilogram, which some analysts predict will happen. “That's like Fedex, that's like DHL,” says Ekblaw.

She imagines industrial activity in space, freeing up land on Earth. Hollywood directors shooting films in orbit. And botanists traveling back and forth to check on their Space Gardens. She and her colleagues are currently seeking funding to help make their concept a space-going reality. The model, made by London-based design firm Millimetre, is for display only. A real version, if it ever flies, would also be uninhabited by humans, at least initially. I ask why her team was so desperate to come up with an aesthetically pleasing design, in that case. It's “something that can recapture the public's imagination,” she explains.

Space Garden with its appendages closed.

These can be opened to give the garden's plants access to light.

But is it practical? The thin, lobe-bearing arms that protrude from Space Garden look very fragile. Ekblaw says these telescopic appendages will typically be retracted. “Most of the time, the structure looks a little more like a berry—without those spindly arms,” she adds. When closed, the lobes will shield plants at the center, behind their thick windows, from light—but the structure can open up in order to let light reach the plants. It's a mechanically controlled alternative to Earth's day-night cycle.

Eventually, Ekblaw suggests, astronauts might occasionally stop by Space Garden to collect samples from it. Open-source data tracking the environmental conditions on board, and plant growth rates, would also add to our understanding of how to cultivate food successfully in space, she says.

When I show Space Garden to Dixon, he says it looks “fancy” and immediately opines that there might not be much need to grow food in space anytime soon: “We can arm ourselves with enough supplies to manage that.” He says he cannot see “large-scale” gardens floating around in space, but he does say that the psychological benefit of having familiar plants alongside astronauts is “a good idea.”

Alistair Griffiths, director of science at the UK's Royal Horticultural Society, was involved in a project that sent rocket seeds—an apt choice—to the ISS with British astronaut Tim Peake in 2015. Of the Space Garden idea, given its complicated shape, he says there could be some practical challenges when transporting such a design, but he praises the overall approach: “I think it should be beautiful and linked in to nature.”

Gardens here on Earth are incredibly diverse. They contain plants and design features that represent the personalities of the people behind them. Space gardens might be no different. Given the chance, green-fingered astronauts will surely bring their preferences with them.

Dixon, for one, has long experimented with barley seeds, sending many to orbit and back to Earth, with much of his research supported by the Glenlivet whiskey distillery in Scotland. “It's my bucket list. I'm going to grow barley on the moon,” he says.

For Griffiths, another option comes to mind. “I would grow a strawberry plant,” he says after a moment considering the many possibilities. “But a strawberry plant that also has bright red petals.” Fragaria x ananassa is the cultivar he selects. If it's going all the way to space, it's got to be extra pretty as well as edible, he argues.

Someone's going to have to come up with a Space Dairy, though, if anyone up there wants fresh cream with their cosmic strawbs.

Tesla is a business built, in part, on government regulations and incentives, from a Department of Energy loan guarantee in 2009 to the regulatory credits it sells to other automakers, which have driven a third of its $32 billion in profits since 2012. 

Now, the company's energy business — a rare bright spot amid faltering demand for its EVs — is under assault.

House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate.

If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla's energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year.

With CEO Elon Musk claiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energy appealed to Senate Republicans.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.”

Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's passage.

Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said.

The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk. 

Last year, 93% of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months.

Like many residential solar installers, Tesla's energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, SunRun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%.

Nearly two years after suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, The New York Times has agreed to license its editorial content to Amazon to train the tech giant's AI platforms. 

The agreement will “bring Times editorial content to a variety of Amazon customer experiences,” the outlet said in a statement. That includes content like news articles, material from NYT Cooking, a site dedicated to food and recipes, and The Athletic, its sports-focused site. 

The company also noted that Amazon's use of The Times's editorial content could extend to Alexa software on its smart speakers. 

“Whenever it makes sense within the consumer experience on Amazon's products, they will provide direct links to Times products, where readers can get the full Times experience,” Danielle Rhoades Ha, a New York Times spokesperson, told TechCrunch.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it's the first of such agreements for Amazon. OpenAI has signed multiple similar deals with publishers, including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, Axel Springer, and more. 

This is also the first time The Times is agreeing to a generative AI-focused licensing arrangement, and it comes after the outlet accused OpenAI and Microsoft of using millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models without consent or compensation. 

“We have a long-standing approach to ensure that our work is valued appropriately, whether through commercial deals or through the enforcement of our intellectual property rights,” the spokesperson said.

Both OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected allegations of wrongdoing.

Tech mogul and billionaire Elon Musk confirmed on Wednesday that he's ending his stint as a U.S. special government employee, a move that implies he'll also step down as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a body that seeks to drastically slash U.S. government spending.

Thanking U.S. president Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk expressed his belief that DOGE is here to stay: “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”

Musk's departure follows what could be construed as a slow cooling of his relationship with the Trump administration. Sales of his EV company Tesla have also suffered, as his political activities and alignment with Trump have had a massively negative effect on the brand.

Since it was established, DOGE has implemented a drastic wave of cuts to U.S. government spending that resulted in thousands of job cuts, complete departments being shut down, and reams of litigation. DOGE went after USAID spending, publicly supported broadcasters, national park budgets, the Department of Education, and more.

Musk could not be reached for comment. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours.

Social network X said on Thursday that it is pausing its encrypted DMs feature as it works to make some improvements.

In a post on X, the company's engineering account said users will be able to access their existing encrypted messages, but they won't be able to send new ones. It did not mention when the feature will be available again.

After Elon Musk bought Twitter, he announced ambitious plans to overhaul direct messages and compete with privacy-focused messaging service Signal.

The company rolled out the encrypted DMs feature in 2023 for verified users, but it comes with several drawbacks. For instance, the feature isn't available for group chats and only supports encryption for text and links, not media. It also does not offer protections against man-in-the-middle attacks, and your encrypted conversations do not carry over to new devices.

The defense tech startup Epirus has developed a cutting-edge, cost-efficient drone zapper that's sparking the interest of the US military. Now the company has to deliver.

Imagine: China deploys hundreds of thousands of autonomous drones in the air, on the sea, and under the water—all armed with explosive warheads or small missiles. These machines descend in a swarm toward military installations on Taiwan and nearby US bases, and over the course of a few hours, a single robotic blitzkrieg overwhelms the US Pacific force before it can even begin to fight back. 

Maybe it sounds like a new Michael Bay movie, but it's the scenario that keeps the chief technology officer of the US Army up at night.

“I'm hesitant to say it out loud so I don't manifest it,” says Alex Miller, a longtime Army intelligence officer who became the CTO to the Army's chief of staff in 2023.

Even if World War III doesn't break out in the South China Sea, every US military installation around the world is vulnerable to the same tactics—as are the militaries of every other country around the world. The proliferation of cheap drones means just about any group with the wherewithal to assemble and launch a swarm could wreak havoc, no expensive jets or massive missile installations required. 

Since Russia's invasion, Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov has become an influential, if sometimes controversial, force—sharing expert advice and intel on the ever-evolving technology that's taken over the skies. His work may determine the future of Ukraine, and wars far beyond it.

While the US has precision missiles that can shoot these drones down, they don't always succeed: A drone attack killed three US soldiers and injured dozens more at a base in the Jordanian desert last year. And each American missile costs orders of magnitude more than its targets, which limits their supply; countering thousand-dollar drones with missiles that cost hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars per shot can only work for so long, even with a defense budget that could reach a trillion dollars next year.

The US armed forces are now hunting for a solution—and they want it fast. Every branch of the service and a host of defense tech startups are testing out new weapons that promise to disable drones en masse. There are drones that slam into other drones like battering rams; drones that shoot out nets to ensnare quadcopter propellers; precision-guided Gatling guns that simply shoot drones out of the sky; electronic approaches, like GPS jammers and direct hacking tools; and lasers that melt holes clear through a target's side.

Then there are the microwaves: high-powered electronic devices that push out kilowatts of power to zap the circuits of a drone as if it were the tinfoil you forgot to take off your leftovers when you heated them up. 

That's where Epirus comes in. 

When I went to visit the HQ of this 185-person startup in Torrance, California, earlier this year, I got a behind-the-scenes look at its massive microwave, called Leonidas, which the US Army is already betting on as a cutting-edge anti-drone weapon. The Army awarded Epirus a $66 million contract in early 2023, topped that up with another $17 million last fall, and is currently deploying a handful of the systems for testing with US troops in the Middle East and the Pacific. (The Army won't get into specifics on the location of the weapons in the Middle East but published a report of a live-fire test in the Philippines in early May.) 

Up close, the Leonidas that Epirus built for the Army looks like a two-foot-thick slab of metal the size of a garage door stuck on a swivel mount. Pop the back cover, and you can see that the slab is filled with dozens of individual microwave amplifier units in a grid. Each is about the size of a safe-deposit box and built around a chip made of gallium nitride, a semiconductor that can survive much higher voltages and temperatures than the typical silicon. 

Leonidas sits on top of a trailer that a standard-issue Army truck can tow, and when it is powered on, the company's software tells the grid of amps and antennas to shape the electromagnetic waves they're blasting out with a phased array, precisely overlapping the microwave signals to mold the energy into a focused beam. Instead of needing to physically point a gun or parabolic dish at each of a thousand incoming drones, the Leonidas can flick between them at the speed of software.

Of course, this isn't magic—there are practical limits on how much damage one array can do, and at what range—but the total effect could be described as an electromagnetic pulse emitter, a death ray for electronics, or a force field that could set up a protective barrier around military installations and drop drones the way a bug zapper fizzles a mob of mosquitoes.

I walked through the nonclassified sections of the Leonidas factory floor, where a cluster of engineers working on weaponeering—the military term for figuring out exactly how much of a weapon, be it high explosive or microwave beam, is necessary to achieve a desired effect—ran tests in a warren of smaller anechoic rooms. Inside, they shot individual microwave units at a broad range of commercial and military drones, cycling through waveforms and power levels to try to find the signal that could fry each one with maximum efficiency. 

On a live video feed from inside one of these foam-padded rooms, I watched a quadcopter drone spin its propellers and then, once the microwave emitter turned on, instantly stop short—first the propeller on the front left and then the rest. A drone hit with a Leonidas beam doesn't explode—it just falls.

Compared with the blast of a missile or the sizzle of a laser, it doesn't look like much. But it could force enemies to come up with costlier ways of attacking that reduce the advantage of the drone swarm, and it could get around the inherent limitations of purely electronic or strictly physical defense systems. It could save lives.

Epirus CEO Andy Lowery, a tall guy with sparkplug energy and a rapid-fire southern Illinois twang, doesn't shy away from talking big about his product. As he told me during my visit, Leonidas is intended to lead a last stand, like the Spartan from whom the microwave takes its name—in this case, against hordes of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. While the actual range of the Leonidas system is kept secret, Lowery says the Army is looking for a solution that can reliably stop drones within a few kilometers. He told me, “They would like our system to be the owner of that final layer—to get any squeakers, any leakers, anything like that.”

Now that they've told the world they “invented a force field,” Lowery added, the focus is on manufacturing at scale—before the drone swarms really start to descend or a nation with a major military decides to launch a new war. Before, in other words, Miller's nightmare scenario becomes reality. 

Miller remembers well when the danger of small weaponized drones first appeared on his radar. Reports of Islamic State fighters strapping grenades to the bottom of commercial DJI Phantom quadcopters first emerged in late 2016 during the Battle of Mosul. “I went, ‘Oh, this is going to be bad,' because basically it's an airborne IED at that point,” he says.

He's tracked the danger as it's built steadily since then, with advances in machine vision, AI coordination software, and suicide drone tactics only accelerating. 

Then the war in Ukraine showed the world that cheap technology has fundamentally changed how warfare happens. We have watched in high-definition video how a cheap, off-the-shelf drone modified to carry a small bomb can be piloted directly into a faraway truck, tank, or group of troops to devastating effect. And larger suicide drones, also known as “loitering munitions,” can be produced for just tens of thousands of dollars and launched in massive salvos to hit soft targets or overwhelm more advanced military defenses through sheer numbers. 

As a result, Miller, along with large swaths of the Pentagon and DC policy circles, believes that the current US arsenal for defending against these weapons is just too expensive and the tools in too short supply to truly match the threat.

We're living through the first drone wars, but AI is poised to change the future of warfare even more drastically.

Just look at Yemen, a poor country where the Houthi military group has been under constant attack for the past decade. Armed with this new low-tech arsenal, in the past 18 months the rebel group has been able to bomb cargo ships and effectively disrupt global shipping in the Red Sea—part of an effort to apply pressure on Israel to stop its war in Gaza. The Houthis have also used missiles, suicide drones, and even drone boats to launch powerful attacks on US Navy ships sent to stop them.

The most successful defense tech firm selling anti-drone weapons to the US military right now is Anduril, the company started by Palmer Luckey, the inventor of the Oculus VR headset, and a crew of cofounders from Oculus and defense data giant Palantir. In just the past few months, the Marines have chosen Anduril for counter-drone contracts that could be worth nearly $850 million over the next decade, and the company has been working with Special Operations Command since 2022 on a counter-drone contract that could be worth nearly a billion dollars over a similar time frame. It's unclear from the contracts what, exactly, Anduril is selling to each organization, but its weapons include electronic warfare jammers, jet-powered drone bombs, and propeller-driven Anvil drones designed to simply smash into enemy drones.

In this arsenal, the cheapest way to stop a swarm of drones is electronic warfare: jamming the GPS or radio signals used to pilot the machines. But the intense drone battles in Ukraine have advanced the art of jamming and counter-jamming close to the point of stalemate. As a result, a new state of the art is emerging: unjammable drones that operate autonomously by using onboard processors to navigate via internal maps and computer vision, or even drones connected with 20-kilometer-long filaments of fiber-optic cable for tethered control.

But unjammable doesn't mean unzappable. Instead of using the scrambling method of a jammer, which employs an antenna to block the drone's connection to a pilot or remote guidance system, the Leonidas microwave beam hits a drone body broadside. The energy finds its way into something electrical, whether the central flight controller or a tiny wire controlling a flap on a wing, to short-circuit whatever's available. (The company also says that this targeted hit of energy allows birds and other wildlife to continue to move safely.)

Tyler Miller, a senior systems engineer on Epirus's weaponeering team, told me that they never know exactly which part of the target drone is going to go down first, but they've reliably seen the microwave signal get in somewhere to overload a circuit. “Based on the geometry and the way the wires are laid out,” he said, one of those wires is going to be the best path in. “Sometimes if we rotate the drone 90 degrees, you have a different motor go down first,” he added.

The team has even tried wrapping target drones in copper tape, which would theoretically provide shielding, only to find that the microwave still finds a way in through moving propeller shafts or antennas that need to remain exposed for the drone to fly. 

Leonidas also has an edge when it comes to downing a mass of drones at once. Physically hitting a drone out of the sky or lighting it up with a laser can be effective in situations where electronic warfare fails, but anti-drone drones can only take out one at a time, and lasers need to precisely aim and shoot. Epirus's microwaves can damage everything in a roughly 60-degree arc from the Leonidas emitter simultaneously and keep on zapping and zapping; directed energy systems like this one never run out of ammo.

As for cost, each Army Leonidas unit currently runs in the “low eight figures,” Lowery told me. Defense contract pricing can be opaque, but Epirus delivered four units for its $66 million initial contract, giving a back-of-napkin price around $16.5 million each. For comparison, Stinger missiles from Raytheon, which soldiers shoot at enemy aircraft or drones from a shoulder-mounted launcher, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop, meaning the Leonidas could start costing less (and keep shooting) after it downs the first wave of a swarm.

Epirus is part of a new wave of venture-capital-backed defense companies trying to change the way weapons are created—and the way the Pentagon buys them. The largest defense companies, firms like Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin, typically develop new weapons in response to research grants and cost-plus contracts, in which the US Department of Defense guarantees a certain profit margin to firms building products that match their laundry list of technical specifications. These programs have kept the military supplied with cutting-edge weapons for decades, but the results may be exquisite pieces of military machinery delivered years late and billions of dollars over budget.

Rather than building to minutely detailed specs, the new crop of military contractors aim to produce products on a quick time frame to solve a problem and then fine-tune them as they pitch to the military. The model, pioneered by Palantir and SpaceX, has since propelled companies like Anduril, Shield AI, and dozens of other smaller startups into the business of war as venture capital piles tens of billions of dollars into defense.

Like Anduril, Epirus has direct Palantir roots; it was cofounded by Joe Lonsdale, who also cofounded Palantir, and John Tenet, Lonsdale's colleague at the time at his venture fund, 8VC. (Tenet, the son of former CIA director George Tenet, may have inspired the company's name—the elder Tenet's parents were born in the Epirus region in the northwest of Greece. But the company more often says it's a reference to the pseudo-mythological Epirus Bow from the 2011 fantasy action movie Immortals, which never runs out of arrows.) 

While Epirus is doing business in the new mode, its roots are in the old—specifically in Raytheon, a pioneer in the field of microwave technology. Cofounded by MIT professor Vannevar Bush in 1922, it manufactured vacuum tubes, like those found in old radios. But the company became synonymous with electronic defense during World War II, when Bush spun up a lab to develop early microwave radar technology invented by the British into a workable product, and Raytheon then began mass-producing microwave tubes—known as magnetrons—for the US war effort. By the end of the war in 1945, Raytheon was making 80% of the magnetrons powering Allied radar across the world.

Large tubes remained the best way to emit high-power microwaves for more than half a century, handily outperforming silicon-based solid-state amplifiers. They're still around—the microwave on your kitchen counter runs on a vacuum tube magnetron. But tubes have downsides: They're hot, they're big, and they require upkeep. (In fact, the other microwave drone zapper currently in the Pentagon pipeline, the Tactical High-power Operational Responder, or THOR, still relies on a physical vacuum tube. It's reported to be effective at downing drones in tests but takes up a whole shipping container and needs a dish antenna to zap its targets.)

By the 2000s, new methods of building solid-state amplifiers out of materials like gallium nitride started to mature and were able to handle more power than silicon without melting or shorting out. The US Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars on cutting-edge microwave contracts, one for a project at Raytheon called Next Generation Jammer—geared specifically toward designing a new way to make high-powered microwaves that work at extremely long distances.

Lowery, the Epirus CEO, began his career working on nuclear reactors on Navy aircraft carriers before he became the chief engineer for Next Generation Jammer at Raytheon in 2010. There, he and his team worked on a system that relied on many of the same fundamentals that now power the Leonidas—using the same type of amplifier material and antenna setup to fry the electronics of a small target at much closer range rather than disrupting the radar of a target hundreds of miles away. 

The similarity is not a coincidence: Two engineers from Next Generation Jammer helped launch Epirus in 2018. Lowery—who by then was working at the augmented-reality startup RealWear, which makes industrial smart glasses—joined Epirus in 2021 to run product development and was asked to take the top spot as CEO in 2023, as Leonidas became a fully formed machine. Much of the founding team has since departed for other projects, but Raytheon still runs through the company's collective CV: ex-Raytheon radar engineer Matt Markel started in January as the new CTO, and Epirus's chief engineer for defense, its VP of engineering, its VP of operations, and a number of employees all have Raytheon roots as well.

Markel tells me that the Epirus way of working wouldn't have flown at one of the big defense contractors: “They never would have tried spinning off the technology into a new application without a contract lined up.” The Epirus engineers saw the use case, raised money to start building Leonidas, and already had prototypes in the works before any military branch started awarding money to work on the project.

On the wall of Lowery's office are two mementos from testing days at an Army proving ground: a trophy wing from a larger drone, signed by the whole testing team, and a framed photo documenting the Leonidas's carnage—a stack of dozens of inoperative drones piled up in a heap. 

Despite what seems to have been an impressive test show, it's still impossible from the outside to determine whether Epirus's tech is ready to fully deliver if the swarms descend. 

The Army would not comment specifically on the efficacy of any new weapons in testing or early deployment, including the Leonidas system. A spokesperson for the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, or RCCTO, which is the subsection responsible for contracting with Epirus to date, would only say in a statement that it is “committed to developing and fielding innovative Directed Energy solutions to address evolving threats.” 

But various high-ranking officers appear to be giving Epirus a public vote of confidence. The three-star general who runs RCCTO and oversaw the Leonidas testing last summer told Breaking Defense that “the system actually worked very well,” even if there was work to be done on “how the weapon system fits into the larger kill chain.”

And when former secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth, then the service's highest-ranking civilian, gave a parting interview this past January, she mentioned Epirus in all but name, citing “one company” that is “using high-powered microwaves to basically be able to kill swarms of drones.” She called that kind of capability “critical for the Army.” 

The Army isn't the only branch interested in the microwave weapon. On Epirus's factory floor when I visited, alongside the big beige Leonidases commissioned by the Army, engineers were building a smaller expeditionary version for the Marines, painted green, which it delivered in late April. Videos show that when it put some of its microwave emitters on a dock and tested them out for the Navy last summer, the microwaves left their targets dead in the water—successfully frying the circuits of outboard motors like the ones propelling Houthi drone boats. 

Epirus is also currently working on an even smaller version of the Leonidas that can mount on top of the Army's Stryker combat vehicles, and it's testing out attaching a single microwave unit to a small airborne drone, which could work as a highly focused zapper to disable cars, data centers, or single enemy drones. 

While neither the Army nor the Navy has yet to announce a contract to start buying Epirus's systems at scale, the company and its investors are actively preparing for the big orders to start rolling in. It raised $250 million in a funding round in early March to get ready to make as many Leonidases as possible in the coming years, adding to the more than $300 million it's raised since opening its doors in 2018.

“If you invent a force field that works,” Lowery boasts, “you really get a lot of attention.”

The task for Epirus now, assuming that its main customers pull the trigger and start buying more Leonidases, is ramping up production while advancing the tech in its systems. Then there are the more prosaic problems of staffing, assembly, and testing at scale. For future generations, Lowery told me, the goal is refining the antenna design and integrating higher-powered microwave amplifiers to push the output into the tens of kilowatts, allowing for increased range and efficacy. 

While this could be made harder by Trump's global trade war, Lowery says he's not worried about their supply chain; while China produces 98% of the world's gallium, according to the US Geological Survey, and has choked off exports to the US, Epirus's chip supplier uses recycled gallium from Japan. 

The other outside challenge may be that Epirus isn't the only company building a drone zapper. One of China's state-owned defense companies has been working on its own anti-drone high-powered microwave weapon called the Hurricane, which it displayed at a major military show in late 2024. 

It may be a sign that anti-electronics force fields will become common among the world's militaries—and if so, the future of war is unlikely to go back to the status quo ante, and it might zag in a different direction yet again. But military planners believe it's crucial for the US not to be left behind. So if it works as promised, Epirus could very well change the way that war will play out in the coming decade. 

While Miller, the Army CTO, can't speak directly to Epirus or any specific system, he will say that he believes anti-drone measures are going to have to become ubiquitous for US soldiers. “Counter-UAS [Unmanned Aircraft System] unfortunately is going to be like counter-IED,” he says. “It's going to be every soldier's job to think about UAS threats the same way it was to think about IEDs.” 

And, he adds, it's his job and his colleagues' to make sure that tech so effective it works like “almost magic” is in the hands of the average rifleman. To that end, Lowery told me, Epirus is designing the Leonidas control system to work simply for troops, allowing them to identify a cluster of targets and start zapping with just a click of a button—but only extensive use in the field can prove that out.

In the not-too-distant future, Lowery says, this could mean setting up along the US-Mexico border. But the grandest vision for Epirus's tech that he says he's heard is for a city-scale Leonidas along the lines of a ballistic missile defense radar system called PAVE PAWS, which takes up an entire 105-foot-tall building and can detect distant nuclear missile launches. The US set up four in the 1980s, and Taiwan currently has one up on a mountain south of Taipei. Fill a similar-size building full of microwave emitters, and the beam could reach out “10 or 15 miles,” Lowery told me, with one sitting sentinel over Taipei in the north and another over Kaohsiung in the south of Taiwan.

Riffing in Greek mythological mode, Lowery said of drones, “I call all these mischief makers. Whether they're doing drugs or guns across the border or they're flying over Langley [or] they're spying on F-35s, they're all like Icarus. You remember Icarus, with his wax wings? Flying all around—‘Nobody's going to touch me, nobody's going to ever hurt me.'”

“We built one hell of a wax-wing melter.”

Movies and TV are nothing without sound. It makes up 50% of the movie-watching experience. You can have the best picture in the world available, but it won't leave its full impact if the audio is just coming out of the TV. The best way to improve your home audio for watching movies, football games, and big budget TV shows without breaking your own budget is with a soundbar. You'll find a soundbar to be a significant enhancement to what the built-in speakers you TV is working with which usually sound tinny and weak in comparison. You deserve to immerse yourself fully in your media. Take for instance this LG 5.1.1 channel soundbar surround sound system. It's going for 40% off which brings the price down from $500 to just $300. That's one heck of a savings.

See at Best Buy

Surround yourself with speakers to bring that cinema experience right to your living room. The LG 5.1.1 sound system will upgrade your audio with crystal-clear dialogue, a booming bass and immersive sound. This is all thanks to the rear speaker kit and a slew of supported features of the sound bar.

Bring a new dimension of sound that will make your feel like you're in the movie or game with the rich sound. The soundbar utilizes a series of up-firing channels designed to bounce off your ceiling and fill the room with moving audio that flows around you. The system uses AI room calibration and spatial awareness to better understand the layout and acoustics of the room. It can then balance soundbar audio settings, finetuning it to the environment so it always sounds natural and accurate. Plus is has support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.

The rear speaker and subwoofer are all wireless so you don't need to worry about hiding cables when setting up your living room home theater. And the soundbar supports HDMI passthrough with support for 120Hz so you don't need to sacrifice visuals for great sound, especially while gaming.

The soundbar lets you customize your speakers treble, bass, and midrange through the LG Soundbar App. You can boost the level of that center channel separately from the volume of the rest of your sound system. Why do this? Well dialogue is primarily set to come through that center channel so this can be a game changer when watching a poorly mixed movie or show where the dialogue all feels silent against loud, room-shaking action moments. Even it out to what's best for the room you're viewing in.

For a limited time, you can upgrade your home theater sound system for 40% off, getting the LG 5.1.1-channel S70TR home theater soundbar with rear speakers for just $300.

It's hard to stand out in the phone world. Outside of foldable screens like the Flip and Fold pioneered by Samsung, most phones nowadays wind up looking suspiciously iPhone-esque—a rectangular glass slab with small variations in chassis that equate to flat or less-flat edges. That's why, when phone upstart Nothing put out its Phone 1, a few design tweaks went a long way. First and foremost, the phones have a “transparent design,” which basically just means a slightly see-through backplate that showcases some internal components.

Perhaps even more defining than that semi-transparent design aesthetic, however, is the Glyph Interface—an array of LEDs that light up the phone's backside to show notifications, timers, etc. A design choice that, according to a brief-but-telling post on X, may soon wind up in the graveyard.

We killed the Glyph Interface. pic.twitter.com/wlLHNzzc72

— Nothing (@nothing) May 29, 2025



“We killed the Glyph Interface” doesn't leave much to the imagination, especially with Nothing CEO Carl Pei chiming in underneath the seemingly straightforward update to say, “RIP.” So, that's it, right? Nothing just unceremoniously killed its phones' defining feature—maybe one that's even more defining than the design ethos they're kind of known for. Maybe! But maybe not. Rumors indicate that though the Glyph Interface as we know it may be done for, there's a new luminous sheriff in town, and it may give Nothing phones a whole new look.

While these are firmly rumors, Nothing fans have been speculating about a new kind of Glyph Interface—the dot matrix—and not all of the speculation is unfounded. Last week, Nothing tweeted out a teaser for its upcoming Phone 3, which is set to be unveiled in July, that gave a pretty big hint at a future dot-style design choice.

New dots. Phone (3). Coming July 2025. pic.twitter.com/blYmoCNlJo

— Nothing India (@nothingindia) May 23, 2025



“New dots” isn't much to go off of and could easily just be an update to its existing dot matrix aesthetic in NothingOS, but at the same time, the fact that Nothing bothered to issue a full-on teaser says a lot. And if I'm to put on my LED-clad tin foil hat for a moment, it would seem to me that a company as obsessed with its design and image as Nothing wouldn't so confidently announce that its next phone is about to get a lot more boring if it didn't have some other trick up its sleeve.

One thing is for sure: There's a big change a-comin' and the Glyph Interface is at the center of that. However you feel about the Glyph Interface, it makes sense from a pure economics perspective to switch things up. LEDs are expensive and actually limiting when you break them down. They might be good for timer bars because of the granularity, but they can't show text and other word-based information. Either way, we'll find out soon enough, because Nothing is set to release its next phone this summer, and we'll more than likely have a device to test and show off when they finally roll around.

As much as I treasure the Steam Deck as my closest gaming companion, the handheld's limitations will inevitably become more stark with time. Valve's handheld PC is still one of the cheapest of its class. It's comfortable, relatively light, and provides a beautiful picture with the OLED screen (if you have that model like I do). But when I'm struggling to play graphically intensive titles without making my precious handheld feel ill, streaming has proved an antidote to my woes. Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming games service now sports a full native Steam Deck app, and it has become my favorite way to play today's slate of ultra-hyped games from the comfort of my couch.

Performance isn't everything, especially for something as portable as a handheld. The Steam Deck is still one of the best devices for playing less-intensive titles, but that doesn't mean the hardware isn't looking long in the tooth. Getting stable performance out of recent titles like Doom: The Dark Ages on the 3-year-old device has proved impossible. I've played games like Metaphor: Refantazio on Steam Deck—90 hours from beginning to end—and even though that game wasn't pushing pixels to their limit, I still experienced sluggish performance in Metaphor's open areas.

Nvidia previously declared it would bring a dedicated GeForce Now app to Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, and Steam Deck. The company gave me early access to the app in the few weeks before launch, and it's been seamless enough I don't think I can go back. I was already smitten with Razer Cortex for Windows PC-to-handheld streaming, but for simplicity's sake, GeForce Now is the reigning champion of simple and seamless streaming on a SteamOS handheld. Nvidia could not confirm if the app will work on the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S running SteamOS. We would be surprised if Nvidia doesn't provide some support for Lenovo's 1200p-resolution handheld in the future.

You could previously use GeForce Now running on a Steam Deck, though it involved running the streaming service through a browser and setting up your own control bindings. SteamOS offers one of the most console-like experiences for handhelds, but downloading GeForce Now requires more finagling than searching for it on the Steam store. You need to load up your device into desktop mode and then download and install the app from Nvidia's website. After that, it will appear on the Steam Deck menu's “Non-Steam” folder. Playing my Steam Deck with the app was a godsend for battery life. If I can normally barely squeak two hours out of a 3D game on my Steam Deck OLED running natively, I managed to do around four to five hours before I even noticed my device needed to be plugged in.

The browser-based app has several limitations, including limiting the display resolution to 1440p. The Steam Deck app allows for 4K resolutions and a max of 60 fps if you're paying for the Ultimate subscription. That's still not the full extreme of 120 fps on the PC app, though at least the handheld version supports HDR10 and Nvidia Reflex. Nvidia told me they were considering upgrading the max fps to 90, but for the sake of using the app on handheld devices, the 60 fps ceiling is workable. That limit means it doesn't even matter if the game is running Nvidia's DLSS 4 AI upscaling. On the latest Steam Deck's OLED display, I didn't spot any distortion that can appear on in-game visuals when using the app through the browser-based app.

Steam Decks are made to play your Steam library. That doesn't mean you can't play games through Xbox, Epic Games Store, or GOG, but it's more difficult, and I have encountered a few compatibility issues with the Steam Deck's Proton compatibility layer. GeForce Now becomes the easiest way to access all your games spread out across all platforms. Xbox recently added the option to stream your games through GeForce Now rather than Microsoft's own servers. I combined my Game Pass subscription with Nvidia's streaming app to play Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion on Steam Deck, which proved far more stable than using Game Pass on Steam Deck with the browser app. Doom: The Dark Ages, unfortunately, claims it needs a driver update and remains unplayable.

Nvidia's app also makes the Steam Deck a far more capable handheld if you combine it with a 4K display. Unlike the mobile app, the version for Steam Deck includes options for resolutions above 1440p. This requires at least 45 Mbps internet speeds if you want to maintain the max 60 fps (you only need 25 Mbps for streaming at less than 1080p and 60 fps). I combined my Steam Deck with a dock hooked up to my TV through HDMI, and I found myself preferring to navigate SteamOS with the comfort of a controller from a couch than having to switch to a keyboard and mouse on Windows. The big limitation of 60 fps means that a Steam Deck in docked mode has fewer capabilities than it does on PC or even an Nvidia Shield streaming box.

It's my new choice for streaming on my TV, although at $100 for the Ultimate subscription, I can't imagine it should be your first choice if you want to dedicate GeForce Now for Steam Deck. The free version has limits of 1-hour sessions and limits resolution to 1080p, which doesn't matter nearly as much since the Steam Deck's max resolution is 1,280 x 800, but ads are the real reason you may want to consider a “Performance” subscription for $30 in the first six months. If you consider the price of buying a more capable handheld, especially as they get more expensive, streaming starts to seem that much more attractive.

Vice President JD Vance and the sons of President Donald Trump, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, hyping the cryptocurrency and promising to do everything in their power to ensure a friendly regulatory environment. And it's just the latest reminder that the Trump regime is all-in on crypto.

Vance was eager to thank the Winklevoss brothers, Tyler and Cameron, who are longtime crypto investors and donated millions to the crypto super PAC Fairshake in the 2024 election cycle. Vance said that many people in Silicon Valley were nervous to support President Trump in his bid to retake the White House and credited the Winklevoss twins as some of the first to really get on board.

“Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, I think they were some of the first big names in Silicon Valley to take that step and a whole host of people followed them. So Cameron and Tyler, thank you for that,” Vance said.

Vance also thanked Coinbase, one of the organizers of the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, and a company that the SEC dropped its investigation into about a month after Trump again took power. The Trump regime has drawn criticism for dropping investigations into powerful people and companies that are seen as friendly to the president, and nobody seems to understand that better than the crypto community, which complained during Joe Biden's tenure that they were being unfairly targeted for being crooks.

Vance told the audience he holds “a fair amount of bitcoin,” without disclosing an exact number. The vice president previously reported that he held somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of bitcoin, according to financial disclosure paperwork he filed in the summer of 2024, shortly before the election. It's not clear if the VP has purchased more or sold any since that disclosure almost a year ago.

Vance said he was “eliminating the rules, the red tape, and the lawfare that we saw aimed at crypto by our predecessors,” referring to the Biden administration. And the VP specifically called out former SEC chairman Gary Gensler, long hated among crypto enthusiasts.

“Maybe the most important thing that we did for this community, we reject regulators and we fired Gary Gensler and we're going to fire everybody like him,” Vance told the crowd.

While Vance did his part to assure conference attendees that he was doing everything he could to make sure people like Gensler were no longer able to influence policy, the president's sons leaned into the hype with a much more blunt approach.

“Every single day, people are allocating billions and billions of dollars to it. You know, 0.1 Bitcoin is going to be worth an absolute fortune,” Eric Trump said. The price of 0.1 bitcoin is about $10,700 today.

Asked by a moderator what they thought bitcoin's price would be by 2026, Eric said “the moon,” while his brother Donald Jr. said it would land somewhere between 150,000 and 175,000 dollars. The current price is hovering around $107,900, near an all-time-high.

Eric Trump made a passing reference to his father's company Trump Media, the owner of Truth Social, which had just announced plans for a $2.5 billion investment in a bitcoin treasury this week. And he insisted “everyone wants it, nobody wants to get rid of it,” doing his best to pump up the price.

The bitcoin conference will have other speakers for its final day on Thursday, including Paolo Ardoino, the head of stablecoin company Tether. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the infamous darknet market Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison and served 11 years before being pardoned by Donald Trump, is also slated to speak Thursday.

If you've ever found yourself squinting at a laptop screen or wishing your console gaming setup had a bit more real estate, you're not alone. Many people feel constrained by the small screens of their devices but surprisingly few know there's an easy solution: portable monitors. These lightweight and slim screens can expand your workspace or play space immensely, and the newer models are easier than ever to use and carry around with you.

Take the MNN 1080p 15.6-inch portable monitor for example: Currently, Amazon is selling this revolutionary device at an unmatchable price. Initially priced at $89, it is now available for only $61 which is a 31% off offer that is almost too good to resist. If you appreciates convenience and comfort (especially if you work remotely or if you travel a lot), this offer is a great chance to enhance your tech equipment.

See at Amazon

We can only infer mechanical compatibility based on the shipping data.

Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket for next-generation Nova Lake CPUs is rumored to match its predecessor's size and may retain cooler compatibility. Ruby_Rapids on X highlighted NBD shipping manifests detailing the socket dimensions of LGA1954. At 45mm x 37.5mm, the size remains largely unchanged, despite offering roughly 100 more pins than LGA1851. However, full compatibility is still up in the air due to potential hotspot shifts with Nova Lake, depending on how and where Intel designs the cores.

Intel's current Arrow Lake processors utilize the LGA1851 socket, which was originally designed to support the now-axed Meteor Lake-S family on desktop. Though there are whispers of a potential Arrow Lake Refresh up in the air, it is expected to mirror Raptor Lake Refresh with improved silicon, higher clock speeds, and potentially more cache.

In essence, the next major desktop release from Intel should be Nova Lake, which has officially been slated for a 2026 launch. If rumors hold true, these CPUs will use the LGA1954 socket, necessitating a new motherboard, which is a bummer if you've already invested a lot in the current platform. That being said, you may be able to keep your current cooler. Shipping data from NBD indicates the LGA1954 socket measures 45mm x 37.5mm, matching the size of LGA1851 and even LGA1700. This at least hints at mechanical compatibility for the CPU cooler.

Here, with identical socket dimensions, we can infer a similar cooler mounting pattern. This was previously seen with LGA1156 (Nehalem/Westmere) all the way up to LGA1200 (Comet Lake/Rocket Lake), which could share the same CPU cooler due to a consistent mounting pattern (75mm x 75mm holes) throughout. Naturally, you'd need to confirm if your CPU cooler can dissipate the heat Nova Lake produces, though we don't expect it to exceed Arrow Lake in this regard.

Mechanical compatibility also does not guarantee full thermal compatibility. With the switch to a chiplet-based architecture, Intel has the flexibility to alter the placement of the Compute Tile on the interposer, or even change the positions of the P-cores and E-cores within the tile itself. For example, both core types were arranged in distinct blocks with Meteor Lake. However, Intel shifted to an interspersed layout with Arrow Lake, which directly affects thermal hotspots. All things considered, we'll need to wait for official confirmation from Intel.

Raking in more cash.

Nvidia on Wednesday disclosed its financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, posting revenue of $44.062 billion — its best quarter ever.

The company's sales increased almost across the board both in terms of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons. As the company ramped up its Blackwell GPUs, it also set revenue records both for gaming and datacenter revenues. But the recent shipments ban of H20 GPUs to China hurt Nvidia's margins quite significantly.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvida reported GAAP revenue of $44.062 billion, marking a 12% rise quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and a 69% increase year-over-year (YoY). The company's gross margin fell sharply to 60.5%, primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge related to writing down of H20 inventory due to the latest U.S. export restrictions imposed in early April. 



Without the charge, Nvidia's non-GAAP margin would have been 71.3%, still considerably lower than 78.9% in Q1 FY2025 or 73.5% in Q4 FY2025. Nvidia's operating income was $21.6 billion, down 10% from the prior quarter but up 28% year-over-year, as for net income, it reached $18.8 billion, a 15% sequential decline but a 26% increase from the same period a year ago.

Nvidia's data center revenue set a new record $39.112 billion, comprising of $34.155 billion compute revenue and $4.957 billion networking revenue. The result represented a 10% quarter-over-quarter growth and 73% year-over-year growth, driven by surging global demand for AI infrastructure.

Nvidia does not provide the split between sales of Blackwell and Hopper AI GPUs as well as Blackwell and Hopper systems, but it said that transition to Blackwell is almost complete. This means that while there are still some customers interested in Hopper processors, the vast majority of its clients now want Blackwell products. In addition, the company highlighted strong momentum in Blackwell-based systems as NVL72 GB200 machines ramped to full-scale production during the quarter.

""Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer — a 'thinking machine' designed for reasoning — is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. ""Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate.""

Nvidia's gaming products also achieved record-breaking revenue of $3.8 billion — a 48% increase from the previous quarter and a 42% rise YoY — in the first quarter of FY2025. This growth was driven by multiple factors, including insufficient gaming GPU shipments in the previous quarter as well as  launch of Nvidia's mainstream GeForce RTX 5070 and 5060-series products based on the Blackwell architecture. As for OEM and other segment, it generated $111 million, down 12% sequentially but up 42% year-over-year. 

Nvidia's professional vizualization (ProViz) business reported revenue of $509 million, down from $511 million QoQ, but up 19% from $427 million in the same quarter a year go. Such results may indicate that workstation makers continued to purchase Ada Lovelace-based professional graphics cards despite the imminent release of Blackwell-based RTX Pro graphics boards in May, perhaps because of uncertainities with the U.S. tariffs. 

It is noteworthy that sales of Nvidia's client and professional GPUs — which are reported under gaming, ProViz, OEMs, and other monikers — totaled $4.42 billion, which is lower than sales of Nvidia's networking gear. 

Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment earned $567 million, down from $570 million in the previous quarter, but up a whopping 72% from $329 million in Q1 FY2025. 



For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia expects revenue of approximately $45.0 billion ± 2%. The company's Q2 revenue outlook could have been $8.0 billion higher if there was no H20 export restrictions. However, the company projects GAAP gross margins of 71.8% and Nvidia's goal is to reach mid-70% gross margins later in the year. This recovery reflects improving product mix and normalization after the Q1 inventory charge related to unsellable H20 units. 

Operating expenses in Q2 FY2026 are projected to be around $5.7 billion on a GAAP basis. The vast majority of that sum will be used for research and development (R&D).

The backdoor evades detection and survives firmware updates


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Thousands of Asus routers have been compromised due to a newly discovered botnet called ‘AyySSHush.' The stealth attack was detected in March 2025 by cybersecurity firm GreyNoise, which reportedly exploits authentication and makes use of the router features to maintain long-term access. Notably, the backdoor does not make use of any malware, and the unauthorized access cannot be removed using firmware updates.

The attack begins with threat actors targeting the routers through brute-force login attempts and exploiting authentication bypass techniques, some of which remain undocumented without assigned CVEs. Once inside, they target and exploit CVE-2023-39780, a known command injection vulnerability, to execute arbitrary system-level commands. This technique allows the attackers to manipulate the router's configuration using legitimate functions within the firmware.

The attackers use official Asus router features to gain persistent access. They also gain the ability to enable SSH on a non-standard port (TCP 53282) and install their own public SSH key, enabling remote administrative control. Since the backdoor is written to the router's non-volatile memory (NVRAM), it can survive both firmware updates and device reboots. Additionally, by disabling system logging and the router's AiProtection security features, the attackers ensure that they cannot be detected.

According to GreyNoise's report, the techniques used by the attackers suggest thorough planning for long-term access and demonstrate a deep knowledge of the system's architecture. Over 9,000 Asus routers have been confirmed as compromised, according to data from Censys, a platform that monitors and maps internet-facing devices globally. Censys identifies devices that are exposed to the internet, while GreyNoise detects which of those devices are being actively targeted or exploited. This offers a clearer picture of both the scale and stealth of the ongoing campaign.

The discovery of the exploit was made using GreyNoise's AI-powered analysis tool called 'Sift.' It flagged just three HTTP POST requests targeting Asus router endpoints for deeper inspection, which were then observed using emulated Asus profiles running factory firmware. Surprisingly, Sift detected only 30 malicious requests over a period of three months, despite compromising thousands of devices.

Asus has released a new firmware update addressing CVE-2023-39780, as well as the initial undocumented login bypass techniques. However, the update is more or less a preventive measure. Any router that has been exploited previously, upgrading the firmware is not going to remove the SSH backdoor. This is because the malicious configuration changes are stored in non-volatile memory and are not overwritten during standard firmware upgrades.

To ensure routers are fully secured, users are advised to take additional manual steps, including checking for active SSH access on TCP port 53282, reviewing the authorized_keys file for unfamiliar entries, and blocking the known malicious IP addresses that may be associated with the campaign. If a device is suspected to be compromised, it is best to perform a full factory reset and then reconfigure the router from the beginning.

Open Source spool tagging could redefine multicolor printing.

Elegoo has confirmed that full color printing is coming to the Centauri Series of FDM 3D printers by the third quarter of 2025. The highly anticipated Automatic Filament Switching System will be the first to feature open-source RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, a move that could shake up filament management in the 3D printing industry.

Bambu Lab was the first to introduce RFID-tagged spools to consumer-grade printers. The tags, taped to the spool's inner cardboard core, store information on the material's type and color for the printer to read. This information is then transmitted to the slicer, saving the user the extra steps of squinting at spools, writing down print temperatures, and then manually configuring materials on their computer. Creality and Anycubic followed suit with the introduction of their own multimaterial 3D printers and house lines of filaments. However, each system can only read its own RFID tag and is encrypted to prevent third-party access.



This system of convenience has misguided many new Bambu Lab users into believing their printers can only operate with proprietary filament. An open-source system would encourage users to step outside their walled garden to explore the vast world of filament created by other manufacturers.

Elegoo's RFID tags will embed information about the type, color, brand, and remaining weight of the spools with a rewritable storage tag. The data structure has been posted to GitHub, and Elegoo has invited the community at large to freely create or modify compatible filament products. The company stated in a press release that it aims to promote cross-brand compatibility and the adoption of industry standards.

To refine the system, Elegoo is actively seeking feedback on tag structure and development directions through GitHub issues and social media comments. The company emphasizes that community input will be key to building a flexible, intelligent, and open RFID ecosystem.

“As we prepare to launch this innovative system, we're committed to building it with the community,” Elegoo stated. “Together, we can unlock new possibilities for the future of 3D printing.”

Prusa Research also uses RFID tags in their spools, but only for internal quality control tracking. A QR code lasered onto each spool of Prusament allows customers to track their spool to a website and discover the filament's production date, manufacturing location, tolerance specs, weight, length, and best print settings. This has led to speculation on the internet that Prusa Research could easily implement its own tagging system for the MMU3 and tool-swapping Prusa XL. Joseph Prusa is widely known as a supporter of Open Source.

Universally tagged spools – or the ability to add tags to spools you already own – would make slicing multicolor prints much easier. I often need to load filament and then take a photo of it in the AMS – or my Prusa XL's spool holders – then refer to the photo to configure the slicer. Worse yet, when files are pre-colored by the designer, I often need to rearrange the spools in the machine to match the model's palette.

The White House says it will launch an appeal.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled that President Trump's sweeping tariffs, levied on nations including China, were unlawful, in a move that could significantly reshape the ongoing trade war and impact the price of technology. The court declared that all of President Trump's measures are ""invalid as contrary to law"" because the emergency law used to pass them does not give the President unilateral authority to impose such sweeping measures.

In a ruling dated May 28, three judges concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 ""does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders"" considered by the court in the case. Specifically, they say the Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff orders imposed by Washington ""exceed any authority granted to the President by the IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.""

Regarding Trafficking Tariffs, the court says these fail ""because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders."" Consequently, the court ordered that all the challenged Tariff Orders be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.

The White House has already filed a notice of appeal, and such decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, and of course, the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a statement reported by the BBC, the administration said, ""It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency."" Continuing, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, ""President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.""

Considering previous reports, tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70%. Legal suspension of tariffs levied on countries, including China, could be an enormous relief to suppliers of hardware, including the semiconductor industry, as well as component parts, notably GPUs.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Nvidia has raised prices by 10-15% to combat rising manufacturing costs and tariffs, while TSMC recently called on Washington to drop tariffs on semiconductors made outside the U.S.. Responding to a U.S. Commerce Department's call for public comments, the global silicon leader said ""we respectfully request that the Administration avoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of the United States,"" claiming tariffs raise the cost of endconsumer products and lower demand for such products and the components they contain.

My results may differ from others because I emphasize results that are comparable to real-world use. This means that I test CPU coolers inside of a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which makes weak coolers appear stronger than they are. Some publications have also used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions. I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions a CPU cooler is used in.

My previous reviews have tested Intel's latest platform, using the Core Ultra 9 285K Arrow Lake CPU. But we're retiring this from our testing suite. Between BIOS changes and Windows updates, Arrow Lake's thermal characteristics have changed in some scenarios, rendering much of our previous testing data useless.

With today's review, we're also testing AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is a beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market. It can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

The installation of this cooler is simple for both Intel and AMD CPUs.

1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.



2. Next, you'll set the rubber standoffs on both Intel and AMD systems.



3. Then you'll want to take the mounting bars and place them on top of the standoffs, securing them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy guide on how to apply thermal paste.

5. Mount the heatsink on top of the CPU, using a screwdriver to secure the screws in the middle of the unit.



6. Attach the fans to the heatsink using the included clips, and then use the included PWM cable to connect the fans to the motherboard.

Enemas have been used in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman medicine for several millennia. The Ebers Papyrus and texts by Hippocrates, Celsus, Galen, Oribasius, Aetius, and Avicenna document their use, as do Ayurveda in the sixth century BC and Chinese medicine in the third century AD.

Enemas reached their heyday under Louis XIV, and from the 19th century onward, physicians studied their applications and mechanisms.

Florence Nightingale, often regarded as the first modern nursing theorist, used coffee enemas to relieve soldiers' pain during the Crimean War. This practice reportedly continued during the First World War, when doctors turned to coffee enemas as an alternative because of opioid shortages. They were also included in nursing manuals and listed in the editions of the Merck Manual throughout the 20th century.

Max Gerson, MD, and William Donald Kelley, DDS, recommended several daily coffee enemas in addition to raw, plant-based diets for the treatment of cancer. Surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch observed benefits in advanced bone, joint, and skin tuberculosis.

Gerson therapy is claimed to aid migraine, multiple sclerosis, deforming arthritis, epilepsy, skin diseases, Graves disease, liver, gallbladder, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders, obesity, hypertension, and end-stage cancer.

Several studies have reported no evidence of its effectiveness in cancer treatment. Patient well-being improvements are often attributed to the placebo effect, although practitioners such as Linda L. Isaacs, MD, argue that skeptical patients experienced genuine benefits despite the cumbersome procedure and required motivation.

In modern practice, enemas are administered before diagnostic or surgical procedures in obstetrics and pediatrics for severe constipation, spinal cord injury, drug administration, or as part of bowel management in inflammatory bowel disease. Enemas act mechanically, thermally, and chemo-osmotically to stimulate the intestinal mucosa and peristalsis.

Prenatal bowel cleansing with an enema or suppository is now obsolete, as no reduction in perineal injuries, impaired wound healing, or infections has been observed. Increased intestinal peristalsis also increases uterine activity. Midwives use enemas to stimulate labor, but studies on their effect on the duration of labor are contradictory.

Healthcare professionals reported greater satisfaction with the labor process when enemas were used, yet women reported no difference. An enema may be administered during childbirth at the patient's request or when the rectal ampulla is full.

The alkaloid caffeine contained in coffee has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart via catecholamine release and raises systolic blood pressure; for instance, 250 mg raises systolic pressure by 10 mm Hg after 15 minutes. Caffeine causes mild cerebral vasoconstriction, relaxes bronchial smooth muscles, increases gastric acid secretion via gastrin release, and transiently increases diuresis. Theobromine and theophylline alkaloids in caffeine act as vasodilators, cough suppressants, and bronchodilators. The habituation effect occurs over time.

Four to five cups of coffee daily can reduce gout attacks in men by up to 40% through increased uric acid excretion, while more than six cups may reduce attacks by 59%, although decaffeinated coffee is preferable as a supportive measure.

Coffee enriched with chlorogenic acid–rich green coffee bean extracts showed increased DNA protection against oxidative damage and increased plasma-reduced glutathione via glutathione reductase activation. Roasting lowers chlorogenic acid, trigonelline, cafestol, and kahweol levels while increasing melanoidin and nicotinic acid levels.

Coffee also contains pro-oxide compounds, such as caffeic acid, which can cause cancer at high doses.

Moderate intake of three to five cups daily is linked to a reduced risk for endometrial and hepatocellular carcinoma and, to a lesser extent, melanoma, other skin cancers, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.

Six to seven cups daily were not significantly associated with a 30%-50% lower risk for type 2 diabetes. Chlorogenic acid inhibits intestinal glucose absorption and the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, and high-volume intake can increase homocysteine levels by 18%. Caffeine affects glucose storage, and quinic acid increases insulin sensitivity.

Caffeine may stimulate the liver, promote bile flow by dilating the bile ducts, and improve toxin elimination. High doses of kahweol and cafestol have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic diterpenes and can inhibit cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, leading to an increase in cholesterol levels by 11%.

When coffee is filtered through a paper filter, most harmful compounds are removed, unlike boiled coffee or metal filters, such as those used in espresso machines. As a result, this method of preparation is considered healthier and does not increase cardiovascular risk.

Low to moderate coffee consumption was associated with an 11%-20% lower risk for stroke and a reduced risk for dementia. However, drinking more than six cups of caffeinated coffee per day was associated with a smaller total brain volume and a 53% higher risk for dementia.

High coffee and tea intake may reduce the risk for depression, unlike soft drinks. Coffee elevates mood and improves cognitive performance. Four to five cups can reduce the mortality risk by up to 12%. Increased caffeine intake is also associated with a lower risk for arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia, independent of genetically varying caffeine metabolism.

Moderate coffee consumption is recommended, as it may alkalize the body. Caution is advised in peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, hyperthyroidism, seizure disorders, histamine intolerance, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and high doses during pregnancy.

Interactions with certain antibiotics, specifically gyrase inhibitors, can interact with caffeine, leading to reduced caffeine metabolism, prolonged effects, and potentially increased gastrointestinal side effects or, with caffeine intake exceeding 1.5 g, restlessness, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, hypertension, headaches, and vomiting. Therefore, active ingredient extracts should be investigated rather than whole coffee for therapeutic benefits. However, coffee can be used in unexpected ways beyond mere consumption.

Patients reported relief from headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties, malaise, and constipation, as well as improved well-being; these effects were not observed with coffee alone.

Physicians use coffee enemas to support the treatment of atropine poisoning, postoperative anesthetic effects, shock, and pyloric obstruction. The controversial self-poisoning hypothesis, which links intestinal disorders to psychological conditions, is gaining renewed attention amid emerging microbiota research on the gut-brain axis.

Enemas may enhance bile flow in the liver and gallbladder, stimulate peristalsis, and promote excretion of metabolic by-products and bowel emptying. The isolated caffeine was ineffective, suggesting that other compounds were responsible. A gallbladder-cleansing study before capsule endoscopy demonstrated increased bile flow using a coffee enema.

Oral coffee increases gallbladder contraction and plasma cholecystokinin and glutathione levels. Oral absorption of caffeine is more efficient than rectal absorption, although rectal delivery is slightly faster, which is potentially true for other compounds.

Coffee enemas may exhibit detoxification, cleansing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, metabolism-stimulating, and pain-relieving effects. However, they should be prepared using green coffee rather than roasted or decaffeinated varieties because of their higher caffeine and palmitic acid content.

These active compounds reach the liver directly via portal circulation, thereby avoiding irritation of the gastric mucosa. As a result, even individuals with coffee intolerance may tolerate the procedure when used at a reduced dose and for a shorter duration.

For administration, the brewed coffee was diluted and cooled to a body temperature not exceeding 40 °C. Low volume and gentle pressure were intended to target the rectum and extend only to the descending colon.

Rare fatalities attributed to coffee enemas likely reflect underlying terminal illnesses with vomiting-related electrolyte disturbances, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, immunosuppression, and susceptibility to infection with sepsis.

Enemas should be used with caution or avoided in early pregnancy in cases of vomiting, acute abdomen, post-intestinal surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, mechanical ileus, immunosuppression, fluid overload, renal insufficiency, and severe cardiac disease.

Regular defecation supports natural cleansing of the body. A diet rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pseudocereals, nuts, seeds, and fermented foods with adequate hydration underpins good intestinal health and reduces the risk for cancer.

Intermittent or short-term fasting is effective without colon cleansing. Enemas may support preparation for therapeutic fasting lasting several days by preventing hunger pangs or fasting crises.

 May 29, 2025  

In the past two decades, the global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has increased dramatically as a result of the obesity epidemic. Researchers project that by 2040, rates of MASH will increase by 55%. Prior to that most liver diseases were caused by alcohol use and hepatitis C, a viral infection that primarily affects the liver.

MASH, a preventable form of liver disease previously called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is caused by a buildup of visceral fat cells that accumulate on top of the internal organs, in this case the liver, and keep it from functioning properly. The liver's primary role is to filter blood, nutrients, and bile used for digestion, as well as to remove toxins from the body. Excess fat cells blanket the liver and keep it from working at full capacity.

Fat cells are also metabolically active and can cause a chronic state of inflammation in the part of the body where they reside. Over time, these fat cells can cause cirrhosis of the liver, or permanent scarring. Once patients reach this stage, the only option is a liver transplant.

Until recently, the lone treatment for early-stage MASH was weight loss to reduce the number of fat cells that surround the internal organs. But new research has shown that GLP-1 agonists can reduce and even reverse the condition. In a study published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers were able to show that semaglutide resolved fatty liver and inflammation in over 60% of cases and decreased scar tissue in just over a third of patients.

“These findings suggest that semaglutide may prevent fatty liver disease from progressing to cirrhosis and can indeed reverse the course of the disease,” said Arun J. Sanyal, MD, study author and director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia.

Another study published last year in JAMA Internal Medicine had a similar finding, showing that GLP-1 agonists were associated with less progression of the disease and reduced mortality in patients with MASH and diabetes. Another large-scale observational study published in Nature Medicine found that GLP-1s reduced the risk for hepatic failure, which occurs when the liver is unable to perform basic functions, as well as liver cancer, both of which are downstream consequences of MASH.

“These medications reduce fat burden, which results in fat loss everywhere, including around the liver,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine & Geriatrics at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and author of the recent study in Nature Medicine. “When fat cells are reduced in size and volume, the normal liver cells have more room to grow and function.”

These medications also seem to work on reducing the inflammation and oxidative stress caused by metabolic disease, which allows for a better environment for the liver to function.

“Fat is not an inert tissue, it's metabolically active, causing a slow burn to all the cells surrounding it,” said Al-Aly. These medications keep the disease from progressing and reduce scarring, which improves the damage that's already been done, he said.

Primary care physicians are most often the first line of defense against liver disease, and as a result, they need to be vigilant in the way that they screen for the condition, said Charu Sawhney, DO, MPH, an internal medicine physician with Harbor Health in Round Rock, Texas.

Physicians need to be aware that even if liver enzymes appear even slightly elevated, there still could be a reason to utilize these medications to prevent later-stage MASH.

“Normal levels for liver enzymes in some patients can be lower than what labs show,” said Sawhney. This is especially true if a patient has other metabolic risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, or high cholesterol.

If liver enzymes continue to go up even after diet and lifestyle changes, patients might require liver imaging, specifically a wave-based ultrasound called elastography, which measures the elasticity or stiffness of tissues on the liver and can judge if certain portions of it have scarred or hardened. When liver cells change texture and become harder, the scan can estimate levels of fibrosis and, therefore, the stage of MASH that a patient is in.

Additionally, the severity of fatty liver disease depends on other factors besides weight and can sometimes be surprising.

“How bad fatty liver disease is in a patient isn't always related to how much weight someone has gained,” said Carolynn Francavilla, MD, a nationally recognized obesity physician who owns and operates Green Mountain Partners for Health and Colorado Weight Care, both in Denver.

It's important for physicians to realize that some patients with fatty liver disease might not have obesity as would be expected. For these patients, adipose tissue seems to accumulate on the liver before it does on other parts of the body. This could be related to the quality of our food system, including the use of sugar substitutes like high fructose corn syrup, which research has shown is even harder on the liver. There might also be a genetic propensity toward fat storage around the organs.

If indeed GLP-1s are a potential treatment in those with MASH, this might also change the way that primary care physicians treat these patients and how the medication is prescribed in those with earlier stages of the disease, said Francavilla. Right now, there's not an official approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prescribing GLP-1s in patients with MASH, but Francavilla hopes that it's forthcoming.

“It will be really exciting to have these medications as a treatment option because right now there's only one medication, and it's for people who have pretty advanced fatty liver disease,” said Francavilla. This medication, called resmetirom, is approved by the FDA to target a protein in the liver to reduce fat and inflammation and scarring. But GLP-1s can be used much earlier to prevent the condition.

“With so many cases of MASH happening so much younger, it's a disease that physicians really need to take seriously,” said Sawhney. “If we want to catch this disease at the early stages when we can still do something about it, it's most likely going to be primary care physicians who see it.”

Nearly three-quarters of UK hospitals are not routinely screening older surgical patients for frailty, despite known risks of adverse outcomes.

A study by the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) and the University of Nottingham found that 71% of hospitals do not assess frailty in patients over 60.

The research, published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, shows that 1 in 5 surgical patients in this age group are living with frailty. This condition significantly increases the risk of complications, extended hospital stays, delirium, and death.

The findings are from the RCoA's third Sprint National Anaesthesia Project (SNAP3), the UK's most comprehensive study on frailty and multimorbidity in surgical patients. 

Researchers collected data from 7129 patients aged over 60 across 214 NHS hospitals. Data was gathered over 5 consecutive days in March 2022. 

The observational study found that older patients living with frailty: 

The researchers identified limited clinician awareness about the impact of frailty and multimorbidity on postoperative outcomes as a key barrier to improving outcomes.

The researchers recommended routine frailty assessments for all patients over 60 before surgery. This would allow for tailored care, with input from geriatricians where appropriate.

The Clinical Frailty Scale is a simple assessment tool that clinicians can use to identify frailty and guide appropriate referrals, the RCoA said. 

Dr Claire Shannon, president of the RCoA, said universal frailty screening could significantly improve patient recovery. 

“With older people accounting for an increasing proportion of surgical patients, implementing effective screening for frailty is becoming ever more necessary,” she said. “Universal adoption of frailty assessments will not only help patients recover better from surgery but also help improve efficiency by avoiding extended lengths of stay in hospital.”

Iain Moppett, chief investigator of SNAP3 and professor at the University of Nottingham's School of Medicine, said screening supports better decision-making.

“Identifying frailty is straightforward and should lead to open and honest discussions with patients,” he said. “Good teamwork between the right specialists — surgeons, anaesthetists, and geriatricians — helps to get patients living with frailty as fit and well as possible before surgery, make the right decisions, and get the best care after surgery.”

More than 60% of patients with cervical cancer and 30% of those with endometrial cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when survival rates are lowest. Although intensifying screening may seem logical, unnecessary procedures can be harmful.

Routine procedures such as ultrasound, though often considered harmless, can lead to poorly indicated hysteroscopies and unnecessary biopsies, causing physical and psychological discomfort, warned Louise De Brot, MD, PhD, in the Department of Pathology, São Paulo, Brazil.

Therefore, prevention does not require as many clinical tests.

“The real challenge is applying screening to the population that will actually benefit from it,” explained Eduardo Batista Cândido, MD, PhD, president of the National Specialized Commission on Gynecologic Oncology of the Brazilian Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Associations (FEBRASGO).

This is the principle behind quaternary prevention, which avoids unnecessary medical interventions that may cause more harm than good. However, this can be challenging for healthcare professionals who lack confidence. Studies have shown that less experienced doctors, particularly those with less than 10 years of practice, are more likely to prescribe unnecessary tests, leading to higher costs for patients.

International and Brazilian guidelines, such as those from the Ministry of Health and the National Cancer Institute, recommend cervical cancer screening using oncotic cytology in women aged 25-64 years who are sexually active. After two consecutive normal results, screening may be repeated every 3 years.

In women aged under 25 years, human papillomavirus infections are often cleared without progressing to malignant disease. Cândido stated that “If I identify a cellular alteration, I will have to perform a colposcopy, a targeted biopsy, and sometimes a mutilating procedure, such as high-frequency surgery, and this will have deleterious effects on the patient's health, without any benefit.”

In the Unified Health System, oncotic cytology has been replaced by the human papillomavirus DNA test, a genomic test designed to identify viral subtypes 16 and 18, which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer precursor lesions.

In addition to its high specificity, the test can be performed every 5 years.

Andréia Gadelha, MD, a clinical oncologist and president of the Brazilian Group of Gynaecological Tumours, explained that patients who test positive should be closely monitored.

It is important to perform diagnostic tests and assess their clinical relevance. Therefore, continuing the screening of older patients is often not beneficial for the patients. According to Louise, these patients may no longer be candidates for curative treatments.

Although screening strategies for cervical cancer are well established, other types of gynaecologic cancers require a different approach. Ovarian and endometrial cancers should not be routinely screened in asymptomatic women without a family history of the disease. “There is no evidence that imaging tests reduce mortality from a population perspective,” said Cândido.

In these cases, imaging tests are not screening tools but serve as diagnostic aids when symptoms are present. “If the patient has postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial thickening detected by ultrasound, the next step is to obtain a sample of the endometrium by biopsy,” explained Cândido.

“There's no need for an immediate biopsy if the lesion has completely benign characteristics and remains stable over time, if the complementary tests are reassuring, and if the patient is asymptomatic and at low epidemiological risk,” added Gadelha.

According to the gynaecologic oncologist, further investigation is warranted in cases involving a complex mass or abnormal vascularisation, persistent bleeding with endometrial thickening, high-grade cytology or glandular atypia, growth of an adnexal mass, or elevated biomarkers with suspicious findings.

“Early detection is beneficial when it improves the prognosis without causing unnecessary harm. This means selecting patients with relevant risk factors and avoiding screening in low-risk populations,” explained Gadelha, reinforcing that clinical practice must be based on updated evidence and recommendations.

Rifaximin significantly reduces the risk for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with cirrhosis, with greater effectiveness observed with longer treatment durations.

“RFX [rifaximin] therapy is effective and well-tolerated in preventing HE and can be used as the first choice in the prophylaxis of HE after TIPSS,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Yangyang Hu, Hebei Medical University Third Hospital, Shijiazhuang, China, and published online in PLOS One.

The analysis excluded unpublished literature, potentially introducing publication and reporting bias. Only randomized controlled trials were included, and six lacked blinding, which could have affected the stability of the results. Variability in rifaximin interventions (eg, drug dosage and treatment duration) may have also affected the findings.

Dr LoConte and the panel discuss the limits of using cancer incidence as the primary endpoint in alcohol-related studies. Because cancer develops slowly, more immediate clinical markers — such as liver function changes, cognitive effects, falls, and even motor vehicle accidents — are often better indicators of harm. The panel also explores the challenges of measuring alcohol intake from a patient perspective, highlighting how misleading the concept of “a drink” can be.

Patients with transplant kidney failure who started dialysis had higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) at initiation, were nearly twice as likely to receive in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD), and had almost twice the risk for 90-day mortality compared with those with native chronic kidney disease (CKD).

""Our findings highlight disproportionately higher mortality; lower access to planned, home-based dialysis initiation; and initiation at higher eGFRs for those under specialist care with transplant failure compared to individuals with native CKD,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Matthew Beresford, Bristol Medical School, Bristol, England. It was published online on May 22, 2025, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

This study did not include individuals who underwent pre-emptive transplantation or re-transplantation or those who opted for conservative management, which could have affected comparisons between groups. The restricted cohort was formed from a convenience sample of centres, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, limited data prevented differentiation between patients who withdrew from dialysis without recovery and those who regained kidney function at 90 days.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Welcome to Impact Factor, your weekly dose of commentary on a new medical study. I'm Dr F. Perry Wilson from the Yale School of Medicine.

My job (my real job) as a clinical researcher is complex. It's cognitively challenging; there are multiple studies to keep track of, grants and papers to write, a large group of mentees and trainees and staff in the lab to manage. It's emotionally stressful too — recently more than ever, in fact. But if I'm tired, or I ate a bad burrito for lunch, or I get some bad news on a personal level, it's not a crisis. I'm not making life-or-death decisions in a split second. I can take a break, gather myself, prioritize, and come back when I'm feeling better. 

Not every job has that luxury. A surgeon doesn't get to take a break in the middle of an operation if they feel like they are not at 100%. An air traffic controller can't walk away from ensuring that planes land safely because their kid woke them up in the middle of the night. These jobs and others like them have a unique challenge: a constant cognitive workload in a high-stakes environment. And the problem with constant cognitive work is that your brain can't do it all the time. If you force it to, you start to make mistakes. You can literally get tired of thinking.

Think of how the world might change if we knew exactly how overloaded our cognitive processes were. I'm not talking about a subjective rating scale; I'm talking about a way to measure the brain's cognitive output, and to warn us when our ability to keep thinking hard is waning before we make those critical mistakes.

We're closer than you think.

The standard metric for assessing cognitive workload is the NASA Task Load Index. Yes, that NASA. The Task Load Index is a survey designed to assess how hard a task is. It was originally designed to be used in human-machine interactions, like piloting a spaceship. 

It's subjective. It asks you to rate how mentally demanding a task is, how frustrating, how much effort it takes, and so on. Cognitive researchers have used this scale to demonstrate how successive mentally stressful tasks degrade task performance. Science has demonstrated that taking breaks is a good thing. I know — news at 11.

The problem with subjective scales, though, is that people have a tough time being objective with them. Astronauts might tell you a task was easier than it really was because they want to be chosen to ride on the rocket. Or a doctor might evaluate a complex surgery as less mentally taxing so they can continue to operate that day.

Bringing objectivity to the brain is hard. Sure, you can do an fMRI scan, but sitting inside a metal tube is not conducive to real-world scenarios. You can measure brain fatigue in the real world with an EEG, though. The problem is that an EEG involves wires everywhere. You're tethered. And the goo, the sticky stuff that they use to put the electrodes on your head, is very sensitive to motion. In anywhere but a dedicated neuroscience lab, this isn't going to work. 

I thought the day of real-time monitoring of cognitive load would be pretty far off because of these limitations, and then I saw this study, appearing this week in the journal Device, from CellPress. 

It reimagines the EEG in a way that could honestly be transformational. There's a not-too-distant future when you'll be able to recognize people with highly cognitively intense jobs because they will look something like this.

What you're looking at is a completely wireless EEG system. The central tech here is what the researchers call an “e-tattoo” — but think of it like those temporary tattoos your kids wear. Conductive wires are printed on a thin transparent backing which conforms to the forehead. 

Electrodes make contact with the skin via a new type of conductive adhesive. The squiggles in the wires allow you to flex and move without breaking connections. That whole printed setup is made to be disposable; apparently the material cost is something like $20.

The blue square is the ghost in the machine, a processor that receives the signals from the electrodes and transmits them, via low-energy Bluetooth, to whatever device you want. It's got a tiny battery inside and lasts for around 28 hours. In other words, even in this prototype phase, you could wear this thing at your cognitively intense job all day. And yeah, you might get a few looks, but the joke will be on them when the algorithm says your brain is full and you need to take a 15-minute rest.

Of course, cool tech like this is only cool if it actually works, so let's take a look at those metrics.

The first thing to test was whether the device could perform as well as an EEG on a simple task. Six adults were recruited and wore the tattoo at the same time as a conventional EEG. They were then asked to open and close their eyes. There's a standard finding here that with eyes closed, alpha frequencies, mid-range brain oscillations, dominate. 

You can see the patterns recorded by the standard EEG and the new tattoo system here. They are basically indistinguishable. 

But the tattoo system, with its flexible design, offers some particular advantages. One of the problems with conventional EEGs is how sensitive they are to motion. You turn your head, you get a bunch of noise. Walk around, and the signal becomes useless.

Not so with the tattoo. These graphs show the electronic noise levels when the participant was doing various motions. Broadly speaking, you can see that the tattoo continues providing solid, reliable recordings even when walking or running, while the EEG goes all over the place with noise. The only exception to this was with eyebrow raising — maybe not surprising because the tattoo goes on the forehead. 

But I didn't start off telling you we have a new flexible EEG tech. I told you we had tech that could quantify our cognitive load. Here's how they tested this.

In the lab, they had their volunteers do a cognitive task called the N-back test.

It starts at level 0. Basically, they ask you to click a button whenever you see the letter Q or something. Easy.

Level 1 is a bit harder. You have to click the button when the image on the screen matches, in either location or content, the image from one screen ago — one image back. Get it?

Level 2 is even harder. You click when the current image matches, in content or location, the image from two screens ago.

Level 3 gets really stressful. You have to click when you see something that matches three screens ago. And, of course, this keeps going, so you have to keep this information in your memory as the test continues. It's hard. It taxes the brain.

Here are the results on the NASA survey scale. This is what the participants reported as to how mentally taxed they were. As the N gets higher, the cognitive stress gets higher. So the system works.

The participants, you won't be surprised to hear, performed worse as the N increased. At higher N, the detection rate — the rate at which matches were appropriately clicked — declined. The reaction time increased. False alarms went up. All hallmarks of cognitive stress.

And the e-tattoo could tell.

Feeding its wireless output into a machine learning model, the researchers could predict the level of cognitive stress the participant was under. 

They show the results for the participant where the system worked the best — a bit of cherry-picking, certainly, but it will illustrate the point. 

The blue line indicates what level of the N-back test the participant was actually taking. The red line is what the machine learning model thought the participant was doing, just from reading their brain waves. They match pretty well.

Again, that was just the time the experiment worked best. The overall results aren't quite as good, with a weighted accuracy metric ranging from 65% to 74% depending on the subject. Clearly better than chance, but not perfect.

Still, these are early days. It seems to me that the researchers here have solved a major problem with monitoring people doing cognitively intense tasks — a way to read brain waves that does not completely interfere with the task itself. That's a big hurdle.

As for the accuracy, even an imperfect system may be better than what we have now, since what we have now is nothing. But I have no doubt that with more data and refinement, accuracy will increase here. When it does, the next step will be to test whether using these systems on the job — in air traffic control towers, in operating rooms, in spaceships — will lead to more awareness of cognitive strain, more rest when it is needed, and better decision-making in the heat of the moment.

In patients with chronic vulvar complaints, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) shows high prevalence with 86.6% exhibiting positive patch test reactions, of which 37.9% were clinically relevant. Nearly half of patients (43.3%) had reactions to spices and herbs, with 34.5% having clinically relevant reactions.

“Both topically applied cosmetic and medicinal products, as well as systemically ingested substances, such as spices and herbs, may contribute to ACD affecting the vulvar region. To enhance diagnostic accuracy, patch test series should be tailored to the patient's clinical history and specific allergen exposures,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Tirza Blom, Department of Dermatology, Amsterdam University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online in Contact Dermatitis.

According to the authors, this study's retrospective design and potential referral bias from being conducted at a tertiary hospital may limit generalizability of results. Selection bias was noted as patients with higher suspicion of contact allergy were more likely to undergo patch testing. Additionally, clinical relevance was not assessed for 6.9% of positive patch test reactions, and the lack of routine patch test readings at days 6/7 may have resulted in missed positive reactions.

The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

Individuals older than 50 years with bipolar or major depressive disorder were more likely to have retinal disease, and those with a diagnosis of retinal disease and a psychiatric illness were at sharply higher risk for impaired vision than those with retinal disease alone.

“Individuals with psychiatric disorders are often considered a vulnerable population due to systemic, social, and biologic factors that contribute to worse health outcomes compared to the general population,” the authors of the study wrote. “Psychiatric disorders are also associated with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome that are known to increase risk of retinal disease such as diabetic retinopathy. Our findings suggest the need for closer monitoring of retinal disease and visual impairment in individuals with psychiatric disorders.”

This study was led by Jeffrey Chu of the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland. It was published online on May 20, 2025, in Eye.

The retrospective nature of this study and potential variations in coding practices among clinicians and institutions limited the findings. Data for optical coherence tomography and visual acuity were unavailable in the network database. Additionally, unaccounted variables such as use of medication, duration of psychiatric disorders, lifestyle factors like smoking, socioeconomic status, and healthcare access may have introduced confounding effects that could not be controlled for.

The prevalence of concurrent hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) doubled from approximately 6% to 12% in the United States between 1999 and 2018, with the coexistence of these conditions being associated with a notable increase in the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

“Given the growing aging population in the US and globally and the associated projected chronic disease burden, our findings underscore the critical need for public health policy and interventions that prevent and address multiple cardiometabolic morbidities to mitigate their downstream impact on further morbidity, extend the lifespan, and preserve quality of life,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ye Yuan, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in Diabetes Care.

This study was limited by the lack of longitudinal data on changes in hypertension and T2D status, control, and medication use throughout the follow-up period, hindering the ability to assess how these changes affected the risk for mortality over time. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data for hypertension and T2D medication use, as well as other covariates such as alcohol use and smoking, may have introduced measurement error.

The use of an electronic health record (EHR)–based clinical decision support (CDS) system in emergency departments (EDs) increased adherence to geriatric prescribing recommendations for potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs).

""Geriatric clinical decision support implemented in the ED for targeted potentially inappropriate medications significantly increased the proportion of ED orders and discharge prescriptions adherent to geriatric drug therapy recommendations,"" the authors wrote. ""As the volume of older patients in the ED increases, electronic health record–based clinical decision support can allow for care that is both better tailored and safer for this vulnerable population,"" they added.

The study was led by Gina A. Elder, PharmD, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland. It was published online on May 13 in Academic Emergency Medicine.

Prescriber behavior changes and shared decision-making with patients could have influenced the findings.

A recent study found that patients with psoriasis showed better adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet but a higher consumption of processed foods than participants without psoriasis. However, patients with more severe psoriasis and with comorbidities were more likely to have a lower overall diet quality, suggesting opportunities for targeted dietary interventions.

""Participants with psoriasis showed slightly better adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (assessed between 0 and 6 years after recruitment) compared to those without psoriasis, which may indicate an active interest in dietary changes for symptom management in this population. However, their diets were also higher in processed meat, sodium, free sugars, and alcohol,"" the authors wrote. ""These findings underscore the role of dietary management in preventative care for psoriasis,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Yifan Xu, PhD, Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Life Course and Population Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, England. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in Clinical Nutrition.

The cross-sectional study design limited the establishment of causal inference, as dietary changes may have occurred both before and after diagnosis. Self-reported 24-hour recall data may have been subjected to misreporting and recall bias. The assessment of psoriasis severity on the basis of self-reported medication use lacked the reliability offered by clinical measurements like the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index or Dermatology Life Quality Index. The study population's restricted age range at enrolment (40-69 years) and tendency towards health consciousness limited the study's generalisability.

Hypertension Canada has released a guideline that aims to enhance the standard of hypertension management in primary care settings with evidence-based, pragmatic, and easy-to-implement recommendations.

The guidance is based on the World Health Organization's HEARTS framework to improve hypertension control and reduce cardiovascular burden.

The previous guideline was published in 2020. “For the 2025 guideline, a new approach was selected in view of the declining rates of hypertension control in Canada,” guideline committee co-chairs Rémi Goupil, MD, University of Montreal, and Gregory Hundemer, MD, University of Ottawa, told Medscape Medical News. “The first step is this Primary Care Hypertension Canada guideline, which is tailored specifically to primary care providers, who manage 90% of people with hypertension.”

The guideline, published online in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, was designed from inception with primary care in mind, and most members of the writing committee were primary care providers, they said. The target users are family physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, as well as policymakers and patients and caregivers affected by hypertension.

“The guideline provides pragmatic diagnostic and treatment algorithms, listing specific drugs, their dosage, and the sequence in which they should be prescribed,” they added. “Patient voices were included in all steps of the process, and a patient-specific guideline is published alongside the primary care guideline.”

The guideline committee made nine recommendations covering hypertension diagnosis and treatment. The most important recommendations , according to Goupil and Hundemer, are:

Other recommendations include:

“This guideline is only the first step in Hypertension Canada's approach,” Goupil and Hundemer said. “The next step is the comprehensive guideline, in which specific topics will be evaluated in-depth to provide recommendations for more specific situations, such as the optimal management of hypertension in diabetes or in resistant hypertension.” The comprehensive guideline is expected in 2026.

Canadian Cardiovascular Society spokesperson Sheldon Tobe, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto and Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Toronto, commented on the guideline for Medscape Medical News.

“We have evidence that Canada's position of best blood pressure awareness, treatment, and control in the world has been slipping, and that was before the pandemic,” he said. “One of the reasons is loss of support for dissemination and implementation by the Public Health Agency of Canada more than a decade ago. The promotion of the HEARTS framework will help to bring policymakers into the implementation of blood pressure control again. The simplified approach to one BP target will facilitate dissemination efforts as well.”

A concern, however, is the small number of people involved in creating the guideline. “In the past, a very large part of the hypertension community was involved, which ensured that there was widespread agreement with the process and results,” said Tobe, who was not involved in developing the guideline. “This included the interprofessional community of nurses and dietitians, in addition to pharmacists and doctors. If the HEARTS framework is formally adopted by Canada, this will be very helpful.”

Regarding specific recommendations, he said, “The guideline has suggested that the preferred initial combination therapy will be irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, including splitting the pill, which strays off-label. This might be off-putting to some Canadians who don't realize that almost all of our antihypertensives are now generic and are fairly inexpensive.”

Furthermore, he said, “I was disappointed that the issue of drug shortages, which have greatly impacted blood pressure management in Canada recently, was not mentioned in more detail. There does not seem to be any focus by policymakers on a sustainable supply for these lifesaving medications.”

The funding for this initiative was provided by Hypertension Canada.

Goupil reported receiving research grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Kidney Foundation of Canada, Fonds de recherche du Québec — Santé, and Université de Montréal, as well as holding unpaid positions as a board member of the Canadian Society of Nephrology and vice president of the Société québécoise d'hypertension artérielle.

Hundemer reported receiving research grants from the CIHR, the Kidney Foundation of Canada, and The Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, and is the Lorna Jocelyn Wood Chair for Kidney Research at The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.

Tobe reported receiving honoraria for lectures and payments to support accredited continuing medical education programs from AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, CHEP+, Eisai, GSK, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, KMH, Novo Nordisk, and Otsuka. He also reported participation in a living kidney donor safety study sponsored by the CIHR, serving as a volunteer board member for the American Hypertension Specialist Certification Program, a volunteer co-chair for C-Change, and serving as physician organization chair of the implementation arm of C-Change for CHEP+.

Pfizer was taken to task at a recent meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) for attempting to expand the use of its prostate cancer drug talazoparib (Talzenna) to men lacking a key biomarker without providing sufficient evidence of benefit.

“It's tantamount to somebody shooting an arrow on the wall and then painting a target around it,” and that the attempt “is not consistent with a large pharmaceutical company presentation to an advisory committee,” said Richard Pazdur, MD, head of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, during the May 21 meeting.

The FDA approved the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in June 2023 in combination with enzalutamide for men with homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutated metastatic castration–resistant prostate cancer based on a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit vs placebo in the TALAPRO-2 trial.

The application for a mutation-agnostic indication was filed in December 2024 after the company reported better overall survival (OS) not only in men who had the mutation but also in 805 individuals whose HRR mutation status wasn't known at baseline.

In an exploratory analysis, the company found a trend toward better OS among the men in the group who didn't have the mutation.

Pfizer is seeking an “all comers” approval based on the results; if granted, the indication for talazoparib would effectively be expanded to include the 70% of patients with metastatic castration–resistant prostate cancer who are HRR mutation free.

Among FDA's concerns, is that agency analysts found no OS benefit among nonmutated men when they used a different HRR status measurement than Pfizer (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67-1.47).

They also noted that adding talazoparib to enzalutamide markedly increases toxicity; approximately 40% of men on the combination, for instance, require blood transfusions for anemia.

The risks mean that the benefit of treatment must be shown to be substantial.

However, the FDA's main concern with Pfizer's efforts is that TALAPRO-2 wasn't specifically designed and powered to show that talazoparib works in men who don't have an HRR mutation.

There was no prespecified alpha-controlled testing plan, meaning that “the favorable trend in [radiographic] PFS and OS in this subgroup can be a random false positive,” the agency said in a meeting document.

“To put the elephant in the room,” Pazdur explained, Pfizer's attempt to gain a mutation-agnostic indication based on TALAPRO-2 “is like somebody coming to us with a randomized study, having it completed, and saying ‘oops, I forgot to do a statistical analysis plan.' We do not have confidence” in the results.

“This is not just a pin-headed issue of statistics,” he continued. “It's really where the rubber meets the road. As a federal agency, we have to protect the patient's rights,” and “people have a right to know” how well a treatment is expected to work for them.

FDA presenters noted instances of studies with promising subgroup findings like TALAPRO-2 that fell apart in later randomized trials.

That's why to expand an indication to include “a huge” number of new patients, “you need robust proof,” Pazdur said.

Pfizer argued during the meeting that the efficacy and safety of talazoparib support the indication expansion.

ODAC was convinced by the FDA's arguments. The eight panellists voted unanimously that TALAPR0-2 is not sufficient to conclude a favorable benefit-risk profile for talazoparib in patients with prostate cancer who aren't HRR mutated.

They also agreed with FDA's broader assertion that cancer drug “efficacy should be formally evaluated in a biomarker-negative population when the biomarker is predictive of response and the prevalence of the biomarker-negative group is high.”

“This is such an important question across all oncology,” said Panellist Neil Vasan, MD, PhD, a medical breast oncologist at New York University, New York City.

“We need to commit to formally evaluating whether targeted therapies benefit patients without the biomarker and not try to ascertain this in some sort of ad hoc way,” he said.

As for the benefit of talazoparib in men who don't have an HRR mutation, “we just don't know from this dataset,” said Heidi McKean, MD, a community oncologist in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

FDA usually follows ODAC's advice.

Nanomedicines, especially those based on nanoparticles, are revolutionizing healthcare in terms of both diagnostics and therapeutics. These particles, often containing metals like iron or gold, can serve as contrast agents in medical imaging, act as nutritional supplements, and even function as carriers for drug delivery. Thanks to their unique properties plus careful engineering, nanomedicines can reach and accumulate in places within the body that conventional medicines cannot, making them promising for cancer detection and treatment. However, the same characteristics that make nanomedicines valuable also present challenges in ensuring their safety and quality.

Current pharmaceutical guidelines, including those from the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), have a significant blind spot: they evaluate only the total amount of elements present in a medication without distinguishing between their different forms, such as ions or differently sized particles. This distinction is crucial because these different forms can have different effects on the body, including varying toxicity profiles.

Against this backdrop, a research team led by Assistant Professor Yu-ki Tanaka from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Japan, has developed a new analytical method to address the existing regulatory gap. Their study, which was made available online in the journal Talanta on April 8, 2025, introduces a technique to separately quantify ions, nanoparticles, and aggregated particles in nanomedicines. Co-authored by Yasumitsu Ogra and Sana Hasegawa, also from Chiba University, the study showcases how this method can improve quality control for these advanced pharmaceutical products. ""By incorporating a novel evaluation method that addresses a previously overlooked issue in current evaluation guidelines, we can ensure the safe use of metal-based nanomedicines such as Resovist® and Ferinject®"" explains Dr. Tanaka.

The researchers combined two existing technologies-asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). They used the AF4 method in a novel way, taking advantage of its initial 'focus step.' During this step, particles are held inside the AF4 channel by two opposing flows. Using a special permeable membrane, cross-flows filter out the tiniest dissolved particles (ions), enabling quantification based on the differences in ICP-MS signals between samples with and without ion removal−namely, with and without the focus step. Once the ions are separated, the system then uses AF4's standard separation process to sort the retained nanoparticles by size. Finally, the ICP-MS device attached to the output can determine the approximate number of nanoparticles of each size. This combination enabled the team to distinguish between free metal ions, small hydroxide colloids, and nanoparticles of various sizes, all containing the same metal element.

They tested their approach on Resovist®, a nanomedicine used as a contrast agent in liver magnetic resonance imaging scans. The analysis revealed that only 0.022% of the iron in Resovist® was present in ionic form. At approximately 6.3 micrograms per milliliter, this negligible amount falls well below levels of concern. Additionally, the team confirmed that the active nanoparticles were smaller than 30 nanometers in diameter, with some aggregates around 50 nanometers. Importantly, no large aggregates were detected, which could reduce the effectiveness of the contrast agent. These results confirm both the safety and stability of Resovist® as a nanomedicine.

The proposed technique is particularly relevant for emerging cancer treatments that use gold nanoparticles as drug delivery systems or metallic particles for photothermal therapy. These advanced treatments rely on the 'enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,' by which nanoparticles leak from blood vessels around tumors and accumulate in cancerous tissue. ""Since many novel nanomedicines consist of metal-based nanoparticles as their active ingredients, providing reliable methods for evaluating their safety and quality control will promote their development and clinical use,"" notes Dr. Tanaka.

Additionally, this novel analytical approach extends beyond pharmaceuticals. It can also assess the safety of metal nanoparticles in food additives, cosmetics, and environmental samples-helping to ensure public health across multiple sectors. The researchers showcased its versatility by successfully analyzing both negatively charged ions (silicon) and positively charged ions (iron), indicating its potential for a wide range of nanomaterials.

Overall, by offering a more comprehensive assessment of the composition, quality, and stability of nanoparticles, this research paves the way for safer and more effective nanomedicines and nanoparticle-based technologies.

Considered the natural ""hunger hormone"", Ghrelin could be the key to preventing debilitating chronic constipation experienced by people living with Parkinson's disease, University of Queensland researchers have found.

Associate Professor Sebastian Furness from the UQ School of Biomedical Sciences said the team discovered the body's receptor for Ghrelin had a critical role in the normal function of the spinal defecation centre – an area of the body in the lower spinal cord that controls bowel movements.

The 'reward molecule' dopamine is a neurotransmitter and chemical messenger responsible for controlling bowel movements, but we've shown that to work properly in this setting it needs a partner, and that partner is the receptor for Ghrelin.

We're translating this knowledge about normal physiology into a major step towards improving the quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes chronic constipation in up to 90 per cent of patients.

Chronic constipation is debilitating and is one of the biggest factors for reduction in the quality of life for people with Parkinson's because it is poorly managed by current approaches.""

Dr. Sebastian Furness, Associate Professor, UQ School of Biomedical Sciences

Dr. Furness said Parkinson's disease can cause changes in the spinal control pathway for defecation, which is why constipation is a common problem for patients.

""While Parkinson's affects dopamine-carrying neurons in the brain, the dopamine-carrying neurons responsible for defecation are not, and our research suggests targeting the Ghrelin receptor could overcome the changes in the spinal defecation control pathway,"" Dr Furness said.

""We will now explore how medicines targeting the Ghrelin receptor may help coordinate voluntary defecation and alleviate chronic constipation for people with Parkinson's disease.

""This discovery might allow us to substantially improve the lives for people living with Parkinson's Disease.

""Our work has led to a new explanation for chronic constipation in Parkinson's that is viewed as so important the U.S. Department of Defense has awarded us $3 million to pursue the idea.""

The study was funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Ideas grant and carried out in collaboration with the Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, and Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.

The research is published in Molecular Cell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study highlights barriers to Alzheimer's care in rural Georgia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250528/Study-highlights-barriers-to-Alzheimere28099s-care-in-rural-Georgia.aspx","Thu, 29 May 2025 01:08:00 GMT","

Rural Georgians may find it difficult to access medication that could slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study from the University of Georgia.

That's especially concerning because rural counties experience a significantly higher burden of the disease.

The researchers analyzed the availability of facilities that offered the IV medication lecanemab and the accessibility of PET scans, which are used to diagnose Alzheimer's, in all of Georgia's 159 counties.

The study found that none of Georgia's rural counties had a PET scan facility. Only one had an infusion center.

Georgians in rural counties faced drive times of over an hour to reach a facility that provided PET scans. Drive times to lecanemab infusion sites were even longer, sometimes more than three hours.

It's hard for people to find a trained, capable physician in Alzheimer's disease to be able to make a diagnosis.""

Niying Li, lead author of the study and assistant professor in the UGA College of Pharmacy

""Once you get that diagnosis and are ready to start the drug, you need to be connected to an infusion center. And once you're connected to the center, you will need to have a family caregiver go with you for infusions every two weeks because you cannot drive yourself due to potential side effects of the medication.""

For many rural Georgians, those barriers put care out of reach.

More than 188,000 Georgians are living with Alzheimer's disease. Hundreds of thousands more are providing unpaid care to loved ones with the condition, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

The researchers found most of the state's 28 lecanemab infusion centers are clustered around the Atlanta area. Only one is located in a rural county.

Of the six Memory Assessment Clinics that offer or refer patients out for PET scans, none are located in rural counties.

People with early Alzheimer's disease can become agitated when taken out of their normal routines. The long drive to reach the facility coupled with sitting for over an hour to receive an infusion and then making the long trip back home is not just a hassle for these patients and their caregivers.

It's often impossible, Li said.

""I think that this study really points out that rural patients with Alzheimer's disease are lacking resources,"" Li said. ""They are lacking support.""

But it's not just long drive times that prevent Alzheimer's patients from accessing care.

""We also have a shortage of health professionals who are able to make you a diagnosis that will make you potentially eligible for the drug,"" Li said. ""And we have a shortage of health care professionals who are familiar with the use of this drug.""

Eighteen Georgia counties lack a family medicine doctor. And those counties are almost exclusively rural.

For Georgians in these areas, just getting an Alzheimer's diagnosis requires access to reliable transportation and to someone who can take time off work to get patients to their appointment.

While the drug does have its drawbacks - it's exorbitantly expensive and requires extensive follow-up imaging due to potentially life-threatening side effects - lecanemab is one of few breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

For many years, Alzheimer's treatments focused only on easing symptoms. Over the past few years, the Food and Drug Administration approved only three medications to delay the progression of the disease. And one of them was pulled off the market last year.

The remaining two drugs have the potential to transform care for early Alzheimer's disease patients, the researchers said. But only if patients can access them.

Published in Alzheimer's and Dementia, the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, the study was co-authored by Samruddhi Borate and Mohammed Zuber of UGA's College of Pharmacy, Darshan Chudasama of UGA's College of Public Health, and Stephen Correia and Lisa Renzi-Hammond of UGA's Institute of Gerontology. Other co-authors include Kai Zhang and Yiran Han.

In a new study of college undergraduates in Japan, the students' self-perception of their own athletic ability was linked with several internal and external factors, such as personality traits, family characteristics, leisure activities, and others' perceptions. Sho Ito of Nanzan University, Japan, and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS One on May 28, 2025.

Self-perception of one's own athletic ability could influence one's motivation to engage in physical activity. For young people, the sense of one's own athleticism may affect their participation in sports and other physical activities, which could, in turn, have implications for health and academic achievement.

However, while people often refer to others' ""athletic ability,"" this term's definition is vague. Furthermore, research on the underlying factors associated with self-perception of one's own athletic ability has been limited. To help clarify, Ito and colleagues investigated self-perception of athletic ability among 406 undergraduate students, who each completed a questionnaire evaluating their sense of their own physical capability across 11 different sports disciplines, such as soccer, volleyball, and basketball. The students also completed assessments of personality, family background, and history of physical activity.

Statistical analysis of the responses revealed that students who perceived themselves as having higher overall athletic ability tended to also score higher for the personality traits of grit, resilience, and a growth mindset. These students were also more likely to be youngest siblings, to be frequently called ""athletic"" by others, to have first walked at an earlier age, and to have more prior sports experience, athletic parents, and a higher parental household income. Meanwhile, they were less likely to engage in certain leisure activities, such as games and music.

These findings could help lead to a deeper understanding of factors influencing athletic ability, which could also help establish a more precise definition of the term. However, this study does not confirm any cause-effect relationships, and the authors note that additional research is needed to clarify how the factors identified in this study are related to development of self-perception of athletic ability.

The authors add: ""Our study shows that subjective perceptions of athletic ability are shaped not only by personality traits and sports experience, but also by early childhood environments and family background. We were particularly surprised to find that the youngest siblings reported higher perceived athletic ability-perhaps because they often imitate older siblings.""

After a mild stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), people who spend more time in bed sleeping or trying to sleep may be more likely to have lower scores on tests of thinking and memory skills and changes in their brains that can lead to dementia or second strokes, according to a study published on May 28, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Spending longer in bed-when some of that time can be not sleeping due to difficulty falling asleep, fragmented sleep, poor quality sleep or other problems-can be a sign of a sleep disorder. The study found that both people with longer in-bed times and with longer sleep durations were more likely to have these brain changes.

The study does not prove that these sleep issues cause these brain changes and thinking problems; it only shows an association.

These results show that disturbed sleep may be a marker of adverse brain health, even for people with mild strokes or TIAs. While many people know that a lack of sleep can lead to health issues, less is known about the effects of sleeping longer at night or spending a long time in bed trying to make up for having trouble sleeping-whether people are doing this consciously or not.""

Joanna M. Wardlaw, MD, study author, University of Edinburgh, UK

The study involved 422 people from Edinburgh and Hong Kong with an average age of 66 who had a mild stroke or a TIA, which is also called a ""mini stroke."" Within one to three months after the stroke, all participants had brain scans, filled out sleep questionnaires and took cognitive tests.

The participants had an average score of one point on a test where scores of one to four indicate a mild stroke.

People who spent a longer time in bed were more likely to have signs of damage to small blood vessels in the brain, including a greater volume of white matter hyperintensities, or areas in the white matter of the brain where brain tissue has been damaged. They were also more likely to have slightly lower scores on the test of thinking and memory skills.

People who had longer sleep duration were more likely to have small areas of microhemorrhages, or microbleeds, in the brain.

""More research is needed to confirm these findings and also to look at whether prolonged sleep has negative effects on people who have never had a stroke or TIA,"" Wardlaw said. ""Of course, research is also needed on whether improving people's sleep patterns after stroke could ward off some of these possible detrimental effects.""

The study was a snapshot in time-it did not follow participants to see changes over time, and researchers did not look at participants' sleep quality before they had strokes.

The study was supported by the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh.

How does where you live, by the ocean or an inland lake, shape your lifespan? Discover why coastal living adds years and why blue spaces don't always mean better health.

Study: Unveiling Complexity in Blue Spaces and Life Expectancy. Image Credit: De Visu / Shutterstock

In a first-of-its-kind study published in the journal Environmental Research, researchers investigated the impact of proximity to coastal and inland water bodies on life expectancy in both urban and rural communities across the United States (US).

Did you know that where you live, especially how close you are to water, might impact how long you live? Life expectancy, a key indicator of overall well-being, is influenced by factors such as income, healthcare, and environmental conditions. While the benefits of green spaces are well-known, “blue spaces” like oceans, lakes, and rivers are gaining attention for their effects on both mental and physical health. Coastal areas often offer cooler temperatures, better air quality, and recreational benefits, while inland waters show mixed effects. Direct research on how these spaces affect life expectancy has been absent globally—a gap this pioneering study addresses.

Researchers studied 66,263 census tracts across the contiguous United States, using life expectancy data from 2010 to 2015 provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project. Blue space exposure was measured in two ways: proximity to coastal waters (within 0, 20, or 50 kilometers) and the presence of large inland water bodies (at least 10 or 20 square kilometers). Environmental data, including air pollution (PM₂.₅ and wildfire smoke), terrain features, temperature extremes, and drought susceptibility (as measured by the Standardized Precipitation Index), were collected from national sources. Socioeconomic data, including income and population demographics, were obtained from the American Community Survey.

Analytical approaches included multiple linear regression, multi-level models (to account for state-level variations), and spatial regression (addressing geographic clustering). A mutual information model was applied to identify key factors differentiating coastal and inland water-proximate tracts. Sensitivity analyses tested alternative definitions of blue space exposure. All analyses utilized specialized statistical software, with a particular focus on urban-rural differences.

Life expectancy in the US averaged 78.3 years across census tracts. Multi-level regression revealed that proximity to coastal waters (within 50 km) significantly increased life expectancy (β=0.32), while proximity to inland water bodies (≥20 km²) reduced it overall (β=-0.14). Critically, inland waters showed divergent effects: urban exposure decreased longevity (β=-0.39), but rural exposure increased it (β=0.22).

Mutual information analysis identified the most influential differences between coastal and inland tracts: coastal tracts had far fewer hot days (2.2 vs. 21.0 days annually), lower maximum temperatures (34.3°C vs. 37.7°C), higher barren land coverage (0.65% vs. 0.13%), and better air quality (annual smoke PM₂.₅: 0.52 µg/m³ vs. 0.78 µg/m³).

Coastal advantages included milder temperatures, fewer smoke days (30.6 vs. 40.3 annually), flatter terrain (road TRI count: 633.6 vs. 1,759.7), reduced drought susceptibility, and significantly higher incomes ($91,075 vs. $67,775). Urban-rural disparities emerged in other factors: Population density increased urban longevity (β=0.49) but decreased rural (β=-9.73), while elevation benefited only rural residents (β=0.62).

This groundbreaking research confirms that the impact of blue space on longevity is not universal. Living near coastal waters extends life expectancy through milder climates, cleaner air, recreational access, transportation advantages, and higher incomes. Meanwhile, inland waters exhibit location-dependent effects: they are harmful in urban areas due to pollution and flood risks, but beneficial in rural settings. These insights call for context-sensitive integration of blue spaces into public health planning. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the study's cross-sectional design and the lack of data on water quality and recreational use. Urban planners and policymakers can leverage these findings to design health-equitable communities and address spatial health disparities nationwide.

How do we think, feel, remember, or move? These processes involve synaptic transmission, in which chemical signals are transmitted between nerve cells using molecular containers called vesicles. Now, researchers have successfully modeled the vesicle cycle in unprecedented detail, revealing new information about the way our brain functions.

A joint study, published in Science Advances, between researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, and the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), Germany, has applied a unique computational modeling system, which considers the complicated interplay of vesicles, their cellular environments, activities and interactions, to create a realistic picture of how vesicles support synaptic transmission. Their model predicts parameters of synaptic function that could not be tested experimentally in the past, opening new avenues in neuroscience investigations.

Recent technological advances have enabled experimental scientists to capture increasing amounts of data. The challenge now lies in integrating and interpreting all the different types of data, to understand the complexities of the brain. Our model provides better molecular and spatial detail of the vesicle cycle, and much faster, than any other systems before. And it's transferable to different cells and scenarios too. It's a significant leap forward towards scientific aspirations of full cell and full tissue simulation.""

Professor Erik De Schutter, head of the OIST Computational Neuroscience Unit and co-author on this study

""We have been working on synapses for over 20 years, but some functional steps were difficult to test experimentally. After several years of fine-tuning experimental and computational work with our Japanese colleagues, we now have a model for testing new hypotheses, especially in the context of neurological diseases"", added Professor Silvio Rizzoli, director of the Department for Neuro- and Sensory Physiology at the UMG and also co-author on the study.

The vesicle cycle describes the steps through which neurotransmitters (chemical signals) are released at a synapse (a junction between nerve cells), to transfer information between cells. Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move and dock at the membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents, before being recycled. The process is prompted by electrical stimulation within the brain and is driven by a complex signaling cascade.

Depending on the situation, different amounts of neurotransmitters need to be released over different time periods. To enable controlled and sustained synaptic transmission, only 10-20% of vesicles are readily available to dock at any given time (these are known as the recycling pool). Most vesicles are instead in a reserve pool, immobilized in a cluster.

Many details of this process, including how vesicles move between the reserve and recycling pool, were poorly known.

In their publication, the researchers shed new light on the vesicle recycling process in hippocampal synapses. With their model, they aimed to both confirm the behavior of vesicles at experimentally-observed firing frequencies, and explore behavior at higher frequencies.

They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature. They were also able to pinpoint some of the reasons behind this robust cycle, identifying the roles of key proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 in regulating vesicle release from the clustered reserve pool.

The researchers noted that the efficiency of the vesicle cycle relied on molecular tethering. By physically connecting some vesicles to the membrane with tethers, a close supply of vesicles could be made available for rapid docking and neurotransmitter release.

These important findings enable deeper understanding of vesicle recycling, a process involved in many different diseases. ""For example, the release of neurotransmitters is hampered in botulism or some myasthenic syndromes. Treatments for depression and other major neurological diseases also often focus on synaptic transmission,"" explained Prof. De Schutter. ""As we expand our models, the potential applications are vast, both in developing new therapeutics, and in deepening our fundamental understanding of how the brain works.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Interactive robots should act more like therapy horses in emotional healing","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250529/Interactive-robots-should-act-more-like-therapy-horses-in-emotional-healing.aspx","Thu, 29 May 2025 04:47:00 GMT","

Interactive robots should not just be passive companions, but active partners–like therapy horses who respond to human emotion–say University of Bristol researchers.

Equine-assisted interventions (EAIs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional talking therapies for patients with PTSD, trauma and autism, who struggle to express and regulate emotions through words alone.

The study, presented at the CHI '25: Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems held in Yokohama, recommends that therapeutic robots should also exhibit a level of autonomy, rather than one-dimensional displays of friendship and compliance.

Most social robots today are designed to be obedient and predictable - following commands and prioritizing user comfort.

Our research challenges this assumption.""

Ellen Weir, Lead Author from Bristol's Faculty of Science and Engineering 

In EAIs, individuals communicate with horses through body language and emotional energy. If someone is tense or unregulated, the horse resists their cues. When the individual becomes calm, clear, and confident, the horse responds positively. This 'living mirror' effect helps participants recognise and adjust their emotional states, improving both internal well-being and social interactions.

However, EAIs require highly trained horses and facilitators, making them expensive and inaccessible.

Ellen continued: ""We found that therapeutic robots should not be passive companions but active co-workers, like EAI horses.

""Just as horses respond only when a person is calm and emotionally regulated, therapeutic robots should resist engagement when users are stressed or unsettled. By requiring emotional regulation before responding, these robots could mirror the therapeutic effect of EAIs, rather than simply providing comfort.""

This approach has the potential to transform robotic therapy, helping users develop self-awareness and regulation skills, just as horses do in EAIs.

Beyond therapy, this concept could influence human-robot interaction in other fields, such as training robots for social skills development, emotional coaching, or even stress management in workplaces.

A key question is whether robots can truly replicate - or at least complement - the emotional depth of human-animal interactions. Future research must explore how robotic behaviour can foster trust, empathy, and fine tuning, ensuring these machines support emotional well-being in a meaningful way.

Ellen added: ""The next challenge is designing robots that can interpret human emotions and respond dynamically-just as horses do. This requires advances in emotional sensing, movement dynamics, and machine learning.

""We must also consider the ethical implications of replacing sentient animals with machines. Could a robot ever offer the same therapeutic value as a living horse? And if so, how do we ensure these interactions remain ethical, effective, and emotionally authentic?""

Researchers have proposed transforming the narrative on ultraprocessed foods by mirroring the strategies that have successfully reshaped public perceptions of tobacco. 

By spotlighting the aggressive tactics of food companies, advocates aim to reduce young adults' consumption of these addictive products.

The new study unveiled that young adults, aged 18 to 25, develop significantly negative attitudes toward the food industry when exposed to messages that highlight its engineering and aggressive marketing of addictive, ultraprocessed foods. This approach takes inspiration from the acclaimed anti-tobacco “truth” campaigns, which have effectively held cigarette manufacturers accountable without blaming consumers.

We found that by focusing on industry tactics rather than individual choices, we could change public perceptions without exacerbating weight stigma.”

Ashley Gearhardt, University of Michigan psychologist, study author

Conducted in collaboration with Kathleen Good of Brown University, Lindsey Parnarouskis of Drexel University and Jenna Cummings of the University of Liverpool, the study involved an inventive experimental design. 

Participants were exposed to different presentations, each underscoring varying aspects of food consumption and industry practices. The results revealed that even a brief, one-minute presentation could significantly shift perceptions.

Significantly, the study indicates that emphasizing the addictive nature of products and the food industry's manipulative strategies can potentially transform young adults' attitudes without stigmatizing individual weight issues. The researchers said this framing approach may cultivate greater accountability for public health harms wrought by corporate practices.

“The implications of this study are vast,” Gearhardt said. “It opens the door to high-impact, expertly crafted public health campaigns aimed at the food industry, similar to those we've seen with tobacco.”

Published in the journal Obesity, the research holds promise for meaningful change and underscores the need for further investigation into message framing that could bolster support for impactful obesity-related policies, Gearhardt says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study identifies C5aR1 as a key marker of metastasis in skin cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250529/Study-identifies-C5aR1-as-a-key-marker-of-metastasis-in-skin-cancer.aspx","Thu, 29 May 2025 16:26:00 GMT","

Researchers have identified C5aR1 as a novel biomarker for metastasis risk and poor prognosis in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the most common type of metastatic skin cancer. The new study's findings in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, found that C5aR1 promotes the invasion of cSCC tumor cells. Its elevated presence suggests that C5aR1 might serve as a useful prognostic marker for metastatic disease and, potentially, a target for future therapies in advanced cSCC.

The incidence of cSCC is increasing. Exposure to solar UV radiation is the predominant risk factor for cSCC. Approximately 3% to 5% of primary cSCCs metastasize, and the prognosis for patients with metastatic cSCC is poor. Although most cases are curable by excision of the primary tumor, a subset of patients develop aggressive and metastatic disease with few treatment options. It is estimated that cSCC accounts for nearly 25% of annual skin cancer deaths.

Lead investigator Veli-Matti Kähäri, MD, PhD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, explains, ""Currently, there are no established molecular markers in clinical practice for predicting the metastasis risk of primary cSCCs. There is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers for the prognosis of cSCC and for new therapeutic targets for metastatic cSCC.""

Studies in multiple cancers have indicated that the complement system, which is a part of the human innate immune system and is a tumor-suppressing cytolytic mechanism, can also contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by inducing inflammation or causing immunosuppression. This prompted researchers conducting the current study to investigate the interaction between C5a (which acts as a signaling molecule in cancer) and its protein receptor C5aR1 (which is found on the surface of cells) in cSCC.

Investigators noted that when C5a binds to C5aR1, it activates signaling pathways within the cell, leading to changes in cell behavior. They examined C5aR1 in the context of cSCC progression and metastasis by combining in vitro 3D spheroid co-culture of cSCC cells and skin fibroblasts, human cSCC xenograft tumors grown in SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) mice, and a large panel of patient-derived tumor samples of non-metastatic cSCC, metastatic cSCCs and cSCC metastases.

First author Lauri Heiskanen, MD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, elaborates, ""We observed that fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment induced C5aR1 expression in cSCC cells. Exposure to recombinant C5a further increased the invasiveness of cSCC cells. In patient-derived cSCC samples, high C5aR1 expression — both in tumor cells and in stromal fibroblasts — was linked to metastasis risk and poor survival.""

Researchers were surprised to find that fibroblasts influenced C5aR1 expression in cancer cells, and that the C5aR1 expression in stromal fibroblasts also had a role in metastasis and poor prognosis in cSCC. They also had not anticipated that C5aR1 expression would correlate with patient outcomes across a large clinical sample set.

Co-investigators Pilvi Riihilä, MD, PhD, and Liisa Nissinen, PhD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, conclude, ""What is particularly interesting in the results of our study is how the tumor microenvironment — especially fibroblasts in this study — affects progression of cSCC through C5aR1. It emphasizes the idea that the interplay between tumor cells and stromal cells plays an important role in cancer progression. Our findings suggest that C5aR1 is a potential metastatic risk marker, a novel prognostic biomarker, and promising therapeutic target for cSCC.""

Parkinson's disease is best known for its effects on the central nervous system. In addition, recent scientific advances generally emphasize the role of the immune system in the presence and development of the disease.

In a study published today in Brain, researchers led by Université de Montréal associate professor of neuroscience Martine Tétreault show that some cell types in the immune system are activated more in patients who have Parkinson's.

""Thanks to a new technology called single-cell RNA-seq, we can differentiate the cellular subtypes and observe gene expression at the cellular level for each cell,"" explained Tétreault, a research scientist at the CRCHUM, Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre.

""We found that in Parkinson's patients, immune cells in the blood were activated and overexpressed genes associated with stress responses,"" she said. ""Together, these biomarkers form the signature of the disease.""

Tétreault conducted the study with three co-first authors: Gaël Moquin-Beaubry, a former postdoctoral fellow in her lab, and current PhD candidates Lovatiana Andriamboavonjy and Sébastien Audet.

Noting the current lack of clinical biomarkers needed to diagnose Parkinson's, the researchers believe that knowing the disease's unique signature could help clinical teams diagnose it early on, from a blood sample.

The set of biomarkers could also make it easier to distinguish the disease from other similar rare diseases, especially Parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

In their study, the research team analyzed blood samples from 14 CHUM patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Parkinson's and six patients presenting with Parkinsonian syndromes, comparing them with a control group of 10 healthy people.

In our study, the gene signature of the disease allowed us to distinguish between patients with Parkinson's disease and those with Parkinsonian syndromes. These biomarkers could improve diagnostic reliability or facilitate participant selection for clinical trials testing the efficacy of a drug for this disease.""

Martine Tétreault, research scientist, CRCHUM

Her research team is now making available to other scientists a complete atlas of immune system cellular subtypes found in healthy individuals and people with Parkinson's.

In 2024, approximately 110,000 Canadians were living with Parkinson's disease. By 2034, that number is expected to grow to around 150,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gender blind spots undermine tobacco control research","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250528/Gender-blind-spots-undermine-tobacco-control-research.aspx","Thu, 29 May 2025 02:09:00 GMT","

Ahead of World No Tobacco Day on May 31, York University researchers with Global Strategy Lab (GSL) have published a paper that finds a lack of gender analysis in tobacco control research. The researchers say this means that we could be missing out on important strategies accounting for gendered behaviors that could help smokers quit. The paper, published today in BMJ Tobacco Control, is the first in a series of papers coming out of York University and GSL on gender and smoking. 

In the tobacco control research community, we're not looking at gender, and even though we all know that gender is a hugely important determinant of tobacco use and how effective tobacco control policies are. This lack of a gender lens limits our understanding of the effectiveness of tobacco control policy interventions and fails to address gendered smoking behaviors."" 

Mathieu Poirier, Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Health, York Research Chair in Global Health Equity and Director of Global Strategy Lab

The researchers, including Poirier, GSL Investigator and York University researcher Tina Nanyangwe-Moyo and GSL research assistant and York researcher Laura R Pereira, examined 43 peer-reviewed studies on tobacco control and found that while some studies looked at basic comparisons between men and women, only five evaluated the gender-specific impacts of tobacco control policies. 

""The incorporation of gender in the peer-reviewed research is lackluster,"" says Nanyangwe-Moyo. ""We hope our contributions will show the importance of looking at the differences in smoking behaviors of men and women around the world in creating effective policy and smoking cessation programs."" 

While this study is the first to examine the intersection of tobacco-control and gender-based policy, it builds on existing research from the Global Strategy Lab on smoking and global policy. 

In Canada, while smoking rates are on the decline, 14.8 per cent of men and 10.2 per cent of women smoke. Globally, more than a fifth of the world's population uses tobacco, with the World Health Organization reporting 36.7 per cent of men and 7.8 of women using tobacco products in 2020. 

Poirier says they chose to focus on cigarette smoking in their research rather than vaping as it is the most common form of tobacco use and because of its level of harm.

""There are harms associated with vaping itself, but when we look at the number one preventable cause of premature mortality and morbidity, it's combustible tobacco use,"" he says. 

GSL is hosting a discussion of how to strengthen tobacco controls globally on Thursday May 29 at 10 a.m. EDT.

A new material developed at Cornell University could significantly improve the delivery and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by replacing a commonly used ingredient that may trigger unwanted immune responses in some people.

Thanks to their ability to train cells to produce virus-killing proteins, mRNA vaccines have gained popularity over the last five years for their success in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection. One method for delivering the mRNA to cells is by packaging it inside fatty spheres, called lipid nanoparticles, that protect it from being degraded. However, a common component of lipid nanoparticles called poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) can provoke immune responses in some individuals, leading researchers to search for more biocompatible materials.

Shaoyi Jiang, professor of biomedical engineering, is working to replace the PEG component of lipid nanoparticles with a more adaptable and stealthy option. The research is under embargo until 5am EST on May 29, 2025 in the journal Nature Materials.

The delivery vehicle for an mRNA vaccine needs to strike a Goldilocks balance – stable enough to protect the mRNA, yet labile enough to release it inside cells, and shielded enough to evade immune surveillance, but not so hidden that it hinders cellular uptake. PEG does the job but presents some unintended side effects in a small subset of individuals.

The human body is mostly water, so if you insert something with exposed hydrophobic moieties, like PEG, into our blood stream, our immune surveillance system says, 'Hey, that's a foreign material,' and will generate an antibody to destroy it.""

Shaoyi Jiang, professor of biomedical engineering

This environment makes adverse responses to a vaccine more likely and thus makes it harder for the vaccine to do its job.

Most people's immune systems are already primed to fight PEG. Prior research shows that a majority of people have anti-PEG antibodies ""from people being exposed to PEG in so many commercial products like shampoo and toothpaste,"" said Jiang, adding that this widespread exposure may explain why the body is so quick to flag PEG as a threat.

To solve this, Jiang has developed lipid nanoparticles that use a zwitterionic polymer, a crucial alternative to PEG, enhancing the performance and biocompatibility of the system. Due to the super-hydrophilic, or water-loving, nature of zwitterions, this material is able to blend into the body and deliver the mRNA more easily. This specific naturally derived material, called poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB), has perfect balance of stealth and stability. In his recent paper, Jiang found that replacing PEG with PCB in lipid nanoparticle results in highly effective mRNA vaccines that do not adversely trigger the body's immune system.

Jiang is working with Weill Cornell Medicine, Houston Methodist Cancer Center, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and the National Cancer Institute to move this discovery toward clinical applications, specifically in the development of mRNA-based cancer vaccines. The zwitterionic nanoparticles help sneak the vaccines past the body's immune surveillance so that it induces antigen-specific immune responses while minimizing undesired immune activation.

""With a virus like COVID-19, you only need a tiny vaccine dose, and our immune system will respond. But for a cancer vaccine, the tumor environment suppresses the immune system, so you need a much higher dose to be effective,"" said Jiang. ""If a patient has a minor problem because of the PEG, the issue will be amplified with a higher dose.

The research was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Cancer Institute, both part of the National Institutes of Health.

Jack: I'm Jack, one of the co-founders of Unicorn Biotechnologies. My background is in chemistry, and I've worked across academia, industry, and startups. I really enjoy working at the intersection of science and engineering—turning lab-based science into real-world solutions. Adam and I met during the pandemic on Zoom, and we actually started the company before ever meeting in person.

Adam: I did my PhD in cancer research over 15 years ago, then moved into stem cell research and tissue engineering. After a stint in big industry, I realized innovation thrives more in startups. I got into hardware engineering because I couldn't believe how much of cell culture was still manual. That's where Unicorn came in—we're trying to automate those laborious processes and bring reproducibility to cell culture, which has been a challenge for decades.

Adam: There are two true stories. First, unicorn companies are startups valued over a billion dollars, so it's a cheeky goal. Second, we had 15 minutes to register a company name and found Unicorn Biotechnologies was available. Also, the unicorn is the national animal of Scotland, where I'm from, and my son—who helped with our early lab work during lockdown—loved the name. He still calls it “Daddy's company” every time he sees a unicorn in a store.

Jack: Automating cell culture isn't a new idea, but previous systems have three major drawbacks—they're huge, expensive, and not always reproducible. Some are the size of multiple Volkswagens and cost seven figures. They're also typically built from repurposed lab automation hardware, which leads to variability. With Emmet, we built a purpose-designed system that integrates everything into a compact benchtop device. It's more reproducible, more affordable, and more accessible for everyday labs.

Adam: Our software is designed with scientists in mind. Many companies bolt on software at the end, but for us, the software and hardware were co-designed. Users can input their standard operating procedures—like seeding, passaging, or differentiating cells—and customize fluid flow, rocking frequency, and other parameters. Setup is super intuitive, like using a capsule-based espresso machine. In the future, we want Emmet to incorporate feedback loops and real-time decision-making, removing the variability of human input altogether.

Jack: Emmet is modular and flexible both internally and externally. Internally, users can change hardware and software settings quickly. For example, switching from six to twelve T-flasks can be done in minutes. Externally, the system fits on any standard lab bench. To scale, labs can simply add more Emmet units without having to reengineer their process, making tech transfer and scaling much simpler.

Adam: We prioritize quality control and reproducibility. We use onboard imaging and sensing systems for pH, glucose, and lactate. We're also developing biochemical fingerprinting tools. Instead of subjective decisions like “it looks 80% confluent,” we generate real data to guide actions. This standardizes processes and reduces the artisan-like variability that still exists in many labs.

Jack: All of the above. Most labs, even high-tech ones, still do cell culture manually. We validated Emmet with sensitive pluripotent stem cells, and if it can handle those, it can handle almost any mammalian cell line—from iPSCs to cancer cell lines to HEK cells for viral vector production.

Adam: Absolutely. We already use imaging and machine learning to monitor confluence and identify cell types. The next step is predictive analytics—giving Emmet a target outcome and letting it figure out the protocol. We're experimenting with LLMs like ChatGPT to design experiments automatically. It's like building a discovery engine.

Jack: (laughs) Just to clarify—we're not in a partnership with OpenAI… but we'd love to be!

Jack: It was amazing. From the moment the exhibition opened to the minute it closed, we had constant interest. Most of it was organic—people saw our talk or were drawn in by our stuffed unicorns—and we had deep, meaningful conversations with folks who really need what we're offering.

Jack: Yes, we had great conversations with people in our ideal customer profile—scientists dealing with manual cell culture issues who want a better solution. They see real business value in Emmet—less FTE time, better consistency, and fewer delays due to human scheduling.

Jack: The best part? Definitely the stuffed unicorns! But seriously, in-person conversations are invaluable. We learned more and had more productive commercial interactions in two days at SLAS than we would from months of email outreach. It's that spontaneous hallway magic—you can't beat it.

Jack: We're scaling up deployments—already in the UK, with US and EU expansions coming soon. Beyond Emmet, we have other R&D products in the pipeline, including GMP-ready versions and smaller-scale systems for early discovery.

Adam: We want Emmet systems to be as common as PCR machines—helping researchers across cancer, stem cells, vaccines, and beyond. It's about creating an outsized impact across all of science.

Imagine cells navigating through a complex maze, guided by chemical signals and the physical landscape of their environment. A team of researchers at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) has contributed an important discovery about how cells move, or migrate, through this maze of bodily tissues, using the fruit fly egg chamber as a model system. Potential implications include better understanding of diseases like cancer and advancing medical treatments. 

Published in iScience, the team's study combines biological experiments and mathematics to reveal new insights into cell migration. By integrating mathematical modeling with advanced imaging, the team discovered that the physical shape of the egg chamber, combined with chemical signals called chemoattractants, significantly influences how cells move. 

This paper takes an interdisciplinary focus with tight collaboration between a mathematical framework and experimental design. The results promote the idea that complex distribution of chemical attractants can explain specific variations in migratory movement.""

Brad Peercy, UMBC mathematician and co-author 

Peercy's enthusiasm highlights the study's innovative approach, which merges precise mathematical models with real-world biological experiments to uncover patterns that were previously invisible.

The team's work focuses on border cells, a type of cell in fruit fly egg chambers, which are a model system for studying cell migration because of their similarities to processes in human development and disease. The team found that the border cells' movement wasn't only driven by continuously increasing chemical concentrations from one end of the egg chamber to the other, as earlier models suggested. Instead, the physical structure of the tissue-narrow tubes alternating with wider gaps-played a critical role. 

""This was the first time that we characterized that there were these patterns of migration behavior that ended up correlating to aspects of the tissue geometry,"" explains biologist Alex George, a co-author who completed his Ph.D. at UMBC in 2024 and will begin a postdoctoral fellowship at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in a few weeks. He likens the migration process to Hansel and Gretel following breadcrumbs through a forest: On a flat plain, the trail is clear, but in a landscape with ravines and valleys, the breadcrumbs pool in unexpected ways, complicating the path.

To understand this, co-author Naghmeh Akhavan, who completed her Ph.D. in mathematics at UMBC this spring, developed mathematical models that simulate how cells respond to both chemical signals and tissue geometry together. ""Alex's experiments showed that the speed is not exactly the way previous models showed it,"" she says. Her models revealed that cells speed up in narrow tubes and slow down in larger gaps, a pattern confirmed by George's imaging. 

Both approaches-wet-lab experiments and modeling-bring unique strengths to the work. Putting them together ""is like unveiling the invisible from two different perspectives,"" George says. ""My experiments would refine her model, and her model would refine my experiments.""

And then, ""When our model shows exactly what Alex found in his experiments, we love that,"" Akhavan adds.

The study's broader impact lies in its potential to inform fields beyond developmental biology. Cell migration is critical in processes like wound healing, immune responses, and cancer metastasis. 

""Most research on how cells navigate the world has focused only on chemical signals or only on structural ones, so this is one of the first studies to consider how those two things impact each other, which is likely to be relevant in many cases,"" explains UMBC biologist and co-author Michelle Starz-Gaiano. By showing how tissue geometry and chemical signals interact, the research could guide new strategies for controlling cell movement via medical treatments.

The team's work continues to evolve, including recent experiments at the Advanced Imaging Center at the Janelia Research Campus in Virginia, where George used specialized microscopes to capture previously unseen dynamics of the relevant chemoattractants. These findings will further refine the team's models, opening new avenues for research. 

""We are developing new experimental strategies both on the biology and the math side of things,"" Starz-Gaiano says, ""so it will be exciting to see where this will take us next.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","No Morgan, no Rapinoe: The USWNT doesn't have a face of the team now. Is that OK?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45306354/uswnt-alex-morgan-trinity-rodman-megan-rapinoe-naomi-girma-star-leader","Thu, 29 May 2025 13:15:00 GMT","

Gotham FC's Jaelin Howell talks about the impact of playing alongside USWNT veteran Emily Sonnett. (1:08)

The U.S. women's national team has always had an abundance of strong leaders and recognizable stars throughout its 40-year history. Many iconic players competed across multiple generations, with 14 of them accumulating 200 caps or more, and three eclipsing the 300 mark. Today's USWNT, however, is marked by youthful inexperience, as head coach Emma Hayes experiments to decide who will join her on the path to the 2027 World Cup.

Hayes started the youngest USWNT lineup in 24 years against Brazil last month. She has doled out 23 first-time call-ups since being hired in November 2023. Fifteen players on the current roster have 10 camps or fewer, and the three goalkeepers have a combined four caps.

All of which underscores this changeover in generations as a jarring moment in USWNT history: For the first time in a long time, there is no obvious face of the team or spokesperson for the larger group.

Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, and Becky Sauerbrunn prominently filled those roles over the past decade, leading the USWNT to back-to-back World Cup titles and standing on the front lines of the fight for equal pay off the field. All three have retired in the past 18 months.

Transitioning generations is natural and necessary for any team, so is it even that big of a deal? Well, yes, it is, considering the uniquely high standards of a USWNT program that has won four World Cups and five Olympic gold medals -- world records in both. It is not the first time that a new generation has had to pick up where its predecessors left off, but the player turnover happening in this cycle is arguably unprecedented.

""Sometimes we just assume that everybody knows what the demands or the standards are for a U.S. women's national team player,"" Hayes said recently. ""But as I've mentioned, we've got a lot of new players that lack a lot of experience. We have to transfer that, and we have to transfer it in the right way.""

Last year provided clear evidence that the changing of the guard for the USWNT was going smoothly. Hayes officially took over the job in late May, and by mid-August, the team won the Olympic gold medal. Hayes said then that she couldn't worry about the lack of time she had -- her focus was short-term on the Olympics. Only during the past eight months has she had time to plot out her long-term vision for success.

During February's SheBelieves Cup, Hayes sat down with Lindsey Heaps, Crystal Dunn, Emily Sonnett, Lynn Biyendolo, Tierna Davidson and Sam Coffey to discuss whether they see themselves as leaders -- and how that might not matter, she said, because their teammates view them as leaders anyway. What followed was weeks of conversation among players and staff around how to transfer the ""non-negotiables"" of work ethic and effort -- and what she frequently calls ""the American DNA"" -- to a new group of players trying to establish its own identity.

""Their insights are invaluable, and I lean on learnings from them to help this process,"" Hayes said of her more experienced players. ""It's going to be a little bit unfamiliar at this moment in time, but I think we'll go to the next place. I'm certain of that.""

Kansas City captain Lo'eau LaBonta reacts to her first ever senior call-up to the USWNT at 32 years old.

Heaps is the USWNT's captain and most experienced player with 165 caps. She is a passionate, often unheralded leader who organizes the team behind the scenes, as Hayes pointed out after the team's Olympic triumph in August.

Heaps is one of the few remaining (or, at least, healthy) bridges to the past generation of players. She came onto the scene ahead of the 2016 Olympics and was part of the 2019 World Cup-winning team. Only two other players from that 2019 squad are on the current roster: Heaps and Dunn.

Hayes confirmed last week that Naomi Girma is the vice-captain. Both Girma and Heaps have had to grow into more vocal roles.

""I think it just takes time,"" Sauerbrunn told ESPN. ""If you look at some of the personalities on the team that have retired, that took us a while to get into that after Abby Wambach retired and Shannon Boxx retired [after the 2015 World Cup].

""You just kind of learn a little bit from the people ahead of you and then you have to go and learn on your own as you figure out what you're comfortable with. Some people want to be the spokesperson, and some people are behind there in the weeds.""

The USWNT doesn't live in the weeds, however. It is the most famous women's sports team on the planet, and the most successful women's soccer team in history.

Ali Krieger, Cristina Alexander and Jeff Kassouf debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights from women's soccer in the Americas. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

Sauerbrunn's generation had to publicly fight the U.S. Soccer Federation and U.S. President Donald Trump as part of its years-long quest for equal pay, which increased attention and scrutiny on the USWNT. Sauerbrunn said she hopes the next generation doesn't have to shoulder as much of a burden off the field -- but she also said it isn't really a choice.

""It's not even if they want to [take on those things], because I think they have a responsibility with this platform,"" Sauerbrunn said. ""But it's what they're comfortable doing within that platform.""

Coffey, who has 33 caps, is the captain of the Portland Thorns and one of the USWNT's several emerging leaders. She said her leadership looks different each day based on the USWNT's needs, but she told ESPN ""we're in trouble when we're quiet,"" which means she is constantly a vocal source of positive reinforcement.

Coffey barely played alongside the past generation of stars, but she still regularly seeks advice from Sauerbrunn, her former Thorns teammate, who she calls ""the gold standard of what it means to be a leader.""

Sauerbrunn was the USWNT's captain at multiple points over the past two World Cup cycles. Rapinoe and Morgan were the faces of the team who became global superstars. Wambach previously filled that spokesperson and star role, and Mia Hamm -- among others -- before that.

At 24 years old and already the vice-captain, Girma is clearly next in line as leader after Heaps. Girma has already taken on some of those duties, but there has been a void of experience around the team for simple reasons: injuries and other absences.

Girma, who became the first player to fetch a $1 million transfer in January, effectively missed the last three USWNT camps due to injury. Davidson tore her ACL in March, days before the camp began for the Brazil games. Biyendolo missed the April games due to injury. Dunn was absent from club and country last fall for personal reasons. And Rose Lavelle has been sidelined all year.

All three forwards who led the USWNT to the Olympic gold medal -- Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson (nee Smith) -- have been missing from the team since the gold-medal game, save for a goal-scoring cameo from Rodman in April. Wilson and Swanson are on maternity leave, and Rodman is sidelined again due to a chronic back injury.

Rodman, 23, is emerging as a star who transcends sports into pop culture and is someone Sauerbrunn says could reach the star status of Rapinoe. ""And with that, I think she's going to develop the responsibility of being a spokesperson for the team when you are also the face of the team,"" Sauerbrunn said.



With iconic stories, hit Originals and live sports, there's something for everyone on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Get all three for a price you'll love.

Rodman is electric when she is on the field, and the media attention she has attracted suggests she is already becoming The Next Big Thing™ for the USWNT. Staying healthy is her biggest challenge right now. She said earlier this year that she didn't think her back would ever be 100% healthy.

There is an argument that Hayes is the biggest personality on the team, which further reflects the volatile nature of the player pool. She won the first Ballon d'Or women's coaching award last year, and she instantly commands attention, whether she's in a locker room, boardroom or packed convention hall.

Hayes has appeared to use her platform to absorb and deflect the external pressures placed on a team full of young, talented players like Rodman, Jaedyn Shaw, and 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes. She has preached patience as the group discovers its identity.

""I think you're seeing that this less experienced team are growing up,"" Hayes said after the team's 2-1 win over Brazil on April 5.

Who among them will take on the vaunted role as one of the next faces of the USWNT? The lack of an immediate answer is an unfamiliar, uncomfortable position for a team so accustomed to having one, but it isn't necessarily something that needs fixing. It's a natural step in the transfer process.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The 19-year-old defender will not be replaced on the roster.

Gisele Thompson left the USWNT due to a minor hip injury and will not be replaced on the roster, the team announced Thursday morning. The 19-year-old Angel City FC defender has three caps for the national team.

Thompson, who usually plays as an outside back, was listed as a forward for this camp. 

Gisele and sister Alyssa Thompson have made waves as a dynamic sister duo, playing together for both ACFC and the national team. Their third sister, Zoe, was recently called up for a USYNT U-14 talent ID camp.

Gisele Thompson received her first call up and cap during the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, where she and Alyssa became the second pair of sisters to start a USWNT game together. She was then called into the April training camp after defender Tierna Davidson sustained an injury.

“I thought Gisele showed a tenacity and a good aggression in her individual duels,” said Emma Hayes in February. “I think we can add some value in the defensive department for her, but I think she showed some really good intent going forward, some good link-up [play] with Alyssa. You can see they naturally want to give the ball to each other, and I think that actually settled them both being on the same side. And I think it was a really, really good debut, considering she's playing probably one of the best wingers in the world.”

Gisele Thompson has departed U.S. women's national team camp due to a minor hip injury, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday.

The Angel City FC defender will not be replaced on the roster, which now stands at 23 players.

The USWNT will face China on Saturday at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. before heading to Energizer Park in St. Louis to face Jamaica on Tuesday.

Thompson is normally an outside back, but was named to the current roster as a forward.

""Gisele is an attacking fullback,"" head coach Emma Hayes said after the roster was released. ""There's no question she's been playing as a right back for her club, but I'd like to see her as a wide forward.

""One, because it's natural for her to go forward. And two, I think there are players ahead of her in the fullback position, at least Emily Fox. So it feels like a win-win with a lack of wide options for this camp.""

Thompson made her senior debut for the USWNT at the SheBelieves Cup in February. On her second cap, she and older sister Alyssa became just the second pair of sisters to start a USWNT game together.

The younger Thompson was then called in as an injury replacement for the USWNT's two friendlies against Brazil in April. She started the team's second match, a 2-1 defeat in San Jose, Calif.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

One of the original rivalries is renewed.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

With zero global or regional competitions this year, the United States Women's National Team is in a holding pattern and playing series of friendlies in order to build chemistry and grow as a group. Following April's split decisions against Brazil (2-0, 1-2), China is next on the docket, contesting a single fixture after originally scheduling two. The programs enjoy a long history that dates all the way back to the Asian side's first international fixture in 1986. The match is set for Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota, a 19,400-seat soccer-specific stadium with a GrassMax Systems hybrid stitch system surface.

This is the 61st meeting between the two programs, with the USWNT holding a 38-9-13 advantage and claiming the most recent results in December 2023 friendlies (3-0, 2-1). Ranked 17th internationally by FIFA, China is attempting to relive the glory years but had a group stage exit at the 2023 World Cup and failed to qualify for the 2024 Olympics. Kēngqiāng Méiguī (Steel Roses) opened the year with a third-place finish at the Pinatar Cup, drawing Canada (1-1), blanking Chinese Taipei (4-0), and falling to Mexico (0-2), followed by claiming the title at the Yongchuan International Tournament with victories against Uzbekistan (5-0) in the semifinal and Thailand (5-1) in the final.

Replacing Shui Qingxia after the Olympic qualifying failure, Ante Milicic was appointed to lead the program in May of 2024 with the aim of “introducing a modern playing style, improving the world ranking, and emphasizing the importance of mutual understanding and communications between the players and the coaching staff.” Following a lengthy playing career, the 51-year-old Australian worked with various youth sides before managing his nation's senior women's side from 2019 through 2020, reaching the Round of 16 at the 2019 World Cup. His most recent stint was at A-League side Macarthur FC, departing at the end of the 2021/22 season due to “family reasons.”

A post shared by 中国国家足球队   (@chinafootballassociation)

Milicic named a 24-player roster for the friendly that includes most of the regulars. The domestic Chinese Women's Super League is home to 21 of the call-ups (with Jiangsu Wuxi, Shanghai, and Wuhan Jiangda providing most of the talent), while three compete abroad. Notable figures such as Zhang Linyan, Wu Chengshu, and Yang Lina are absent.

***

GOALKEEPERS (3): Xu Huan (Jiangsu Wuxi), Zhu Yu (Shanghai), Pan Hongyan (Beijing)

DEFENDERS (7): Dou Jiaxing (Jiangsu Wuxi), Qiao Ruiqi (Jiangsu Wuxi), Zhai Qingwei (Jiangsu Wuxi), Wang Linlin (Shanghai), Wu Haiyan (Wuhan Jiangda), Li Mengwen (West Ham United), Chen Qiaozhu (Guangdong)

MIDFIELDERS (9): Huo Yuexin (Jiangsu Wuxi), Ou Yiyao (Jiangsu Wuxi), Zhang Xin (Shanghai), Yao Wei (Wuhan Jiangda), Wang Aifang (Liaoning Shenbei Hefeng), Liu Jing (Changchun Dazhong Zhuoyue), Jie Zhi (Zhejiang Hangzhou), Wang Yanwen (Dijon), Shen Mengyu (London City Lionesses)

FORWARDS (5): Shao Ziqin (Jiangsu Wuxi), Jin Kun (Jiangsu Wuxi), Tang Jiali (Shanghai), Wang Shuang (Wuhan Jiangda), Yao Mengjia (Beijing)

***

Milicic prefers a 4-3-3 formation (but will deploy a 4-4-2) and a high level of “tactical discipline,” swarming opponents with overloads and triggering constant offside traps, which can sometimes leave the defensive third exposed. He “encourages players to express themselves on the field and form a positive state,” attempting to instill more “forward thinking” while increasing the possession numbers, defensive work on set pieces, and “overall speed.” In recent matches, China has displayed “strong pressure,” but the manager has been willing to test the waters and make “bold attempts and arrangements in personnel rotation.” 

With little challenge to her position, Xu Huan remains the number one for China with a stable and calm style that sees her handle opportunities with ease. The 26-year-old Jiangsu goalkeeper mainly sticks to her line and focuses on shot-stopping instead of controlling the box, often opting to parry away chances. At five-foot-eleven, she has little issue reaching crosses or covering the breadth and height of the frame and uses a long stride to beat opponents on rare ventures out of the area. Her passing is composed and almost casual when under pressure, sliding the ball to teammates despite the presence of an opponent a mere yard or two from the lane. 

One of the program's doyennes, Wu Haiyan continues to hold a spot on the back line and has been a member of three World Cup and two Olympic rosters, providing discipline and veteran leadership. The 32-year-old Wuhan Jiangda centre-back has “first-class defensive ability, is active in running, is good at long passes, can quickly get into the game, and is a hardworking player.” Jiangsu's Dou Jiaxing stands at five-foot-eight and is a dominant figure in the air, rising above the crowd in order to control the box, but also serves as an important asset during the build-up with long-range distribution. After regaining possession, she will take the available space and push forward, seeking to enter the attacking phase and occasionally utilizing her aerial prowess on set pieces. Wang Linlin of Shanghai Shengli could also make an impact, adding another tall presence and serving as a “defensive general” after dealing with several injuries and returning to match fitness. Her two-way performance sees her making crucial clearances and interventions and also knocking in the occasional finish, with the former Under-20 captain ready to assume a great role as the older generation ages out of contention. 

Guangdong's Chen Qiaozhu boasts “the strength, vision, and pace [that are] necessary to initiate rapid transitions,” capable of lining up on the inside or the outside of the line with excellent athleticism. She is comfortable moving into the available space and possesses above-average control on the ball, handling herself when under pressure by focusing on clearances instead of perfect distribution. Dynamic “football artist” Li Mengwen provides “a constant source of danger down the right flank,” boasting “the strong ability to withstand blows” along with “a deep understanding of the game” and “technical ability.” The 30-year-old fullback recently finished up the season on loan at West Ham United, featuring in 15 matches with solid enough defensive statistics but failing to make a massive impact in her third European campaign.

Wang Yanwen of Dijon FCO boasts an excellent shot from long distance with either foot and looks to charge at goal with a full head of steam, operating the transition with long runs or incisive distribution from the center of the field. She glides around the attacking third and manages to avoid contact, identifying open pockets of space in which to receive the ball before finding teammates with accurate passes. Yao Wei is an “all-rounder” and highly skilled at forcing turnovers, bringing a highly defensive presence along with a “calm and reliable nature” that has made her a fixture of the program. The 27-year-old Wuhan Jiangda midfielder “runs quickly” with “physical strength and strong comprehension,” winning her duels and chipping in the occasional finish when the team has control. There is also Shen Mengyu, who recently moved from Celtic to London City Lionesses and “demonstrates the ability to win the ball and move forward at speed” whether deployed centrally or on the wing. Her quick turns, even quicker decision-making, and key interventions can disrupt the opponents, with intelligent actions that force turnovers or break down a crowded final third. Changchun Dazhong Zhuoyue's Liu Jing has become a regular for the national team over the past year and started three matches during the Pinatar Cup after being included on the roster for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Her big return to the stage included a goal against Uzbekistan in the 5-0 victory at the Yongchuan International Tournament, slotting home a penalty attempt in the 88th minute.

Zhang Xin continues to be a regular contributor to the scoreline, displaying a poacher's instincts when latching onto loose balls in the box and also possessing the speed that enables her to blow past opponents. The 33-year-old Shanghai Shengli attacker excels in transition, dips and darts around the final third, and pings quick passing combinations with teammates in order to break down crowded areas. Jiangsu's Ziqin Shao could be ready for a bigger role in the squad after a strong showing at the Pinatar Cup, utilizing a big frame to handle the physical battles with defenders. She is very comfortable charging into the final third and takes on multiple players off of the dribble, carrying over strong productivity at the youth international level. Tang Jiali embarked on a series of European loans with Tottenham, Madrid CFF, and Levante before returning to the domestic league in better physical shape, adding good pace, strong link-up play, and the occasional acrobatic goal. Also capable of lining up at striker, her ability to fight for possession and claim long balls make her an asset when matches turn into Route One affairs with back-and-forth chaos or fewer opportunities. 

The prolific Wang Shanshan seems to be slowly stepping away from the program, with Jin Kun the leading candidate to step into the striker role with multiple starts and a few goals in recent fixtures. The “dynamic” 25-year-old has long been considered a future star with regular youth call-ups and a “dazzling” array of “creative displays and goalscoring talents” alongside “exceptional pace and excellent skills.” Observers praise her “speed and incisive running,” enabling her to get behind opposing back lines in a flash, whether breaking into transition or entering during sustained possession. She is also capable of getting onto crosses and poaching, doing the dirty work of grinding out opportunities in the box or seizing on errors and squeezing out conversions against the run of play. 

This is far from the China that enjoyed a first-rate run in the 1990s and formed one of the first true international rivalries on the women's side of the game. However, the program has qualified for every edition of the World Cup and could leap back into the upper echelon with a few good years and further development of the player pool. Emma Hayes will likely rotate the squad and give playing time to the full roster, which could reduce the gap between the two sides and lead to a more competitive scoreline. 

The match is scheduled for Saturday, May 31st at 5:30 p.m. Eastern, 2:30 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TBS, Universo, Max, Peacock, and Fubo TV (free trial).

The United States Men's National Team prepares to play in the Concacaf Gold Cup, but Christian Pulisic's absence has everyone talking. We discuss his decision to opt out of this summer's matches on Episode 154.

Christian Pulisic has decided that after a long season for AC Milan, he wants to sit the summer out. That decision has taken American soccer by storm and it has prompted a lot of critical feedback. We offer our own thoughts on his decision and what it means for him and the USMNT. With other absences, this means the A roster that fans were promised for the Gold Cup is left with some newcomers who have a huge opportunity ahead of them.

We also get into the new 2025 US Soccer jerseys that were released a couple of weeks ago. While we're still Team Waldos as the permanent home identity, we're excited about these really cool looking jerseys for this summer.

Our soccer expert breaks down the Club World Cup winner odds, with Man City, Real Madrid, Chelsea & Inter Miami challenging this June 2025.  

Will it be quality, or timing that decides this year's Club World Cup champion? The super-sized CWC 2025 gala is considered to be a 2026 World Cup ""rehearsal,"" set to kick off on June 14 and conclude on July 13 while reaching a dozen cities in the United States.

Speculators will pick from iconic clubs like Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, and Man City. Don't forget the tournament's wild card, in the form Inter Miami, and a potential Messi moment.

All odds are courtesy of BetMGM, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.







This is the first edition of the Club World Cup in its new format, so there's a lot of unpredictability around the event. A total of 32 teams from across the globe will compete in a group stage followed by knockout rounds to determine the champion.

Manchester City and Chelsea are in the mix, and with a fairly unsuccessful domestic league display, both hope to add a trophy to what has been a disappointing season.

More European heavyweights are part of the competition, including Spanish giants Real Madrid. After being knocked out of the UEFA Champions League, they hope to obtain yet another major trophy.

Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich are also in the mix. Having dominated domestically, the German club have the chance to win the Club World Cup for the third time.

Real Madrid are the favourites to win the competition with most bookies. Given the new format is similar to the previous Champions League setup, Los Blancos know how to succeed this way. Having won the European Cup 15 times, they've beaten Europe's best on many occasions.

Under Carlo Ancelotti, the team boast talent everywhere across the field. With the imminent acquisition of Trent Alexander-Arnold to add to the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr., the starting 11 may be the best in the competition.

Real face Al Hilal, Salzburg and Mexican team Pachuca in their group. On paper, Ancelotti's team should top their group with ease, which would mean they play second place in Group G.

The first round of the knockout stages could provide Real with a bout against either Juventus or Man City. However, Real dispatched Pep Guardiola's side earlier in the UCL this season.

Real have already beaten the likes of Atletico Madrid, Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund - teams who are also in the Club World Cup.

Clearly capable of defeating some of the world's best and with arguably the best squad, backing Real to win the competition seems like a smart choice.

Man City were knocked out in the play-offs in the Champions League and have been nowhere near their usual standard in the Premier League.

Manchester City face Juventus in their group. This will be a tough bout, given that the Italian side have already beaten Guardiola's team 2-0 in the Champions League this season. Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca and Al-Ain from the United Arab Emirates are also in Group G.

Qualifying for the next stage would mean Man City play first or second from Group H. Their potential opponents could be Real Madrid, which would be a massive fixture between the two outright favourites of the competition.

Real Madrid have already beaten City twice in the Champions League this season, so recent history suggests Guardiola's team have a tough task ahead. PSG and Inter are also in the competition, both of whom City failed to beat in the UCL.

Given their performances against some of the world's best this season, it may be best to avoid backing Manchester City.

Bayern Munich's return to the top of German football has made them one of the strong contenders heading into the tournament.

Bayern have a favourable group they could top with ease. They play Auckland City FC from New Zealand, Argentinian giants Boca Juniors, and Benfica.

Topping the group means that Kompany's side will face second place from Group D. Their potential opponents could be Chelsea, Esperance, Flamengo or Leon. Apart from Chelsea, the remaining sides are unlikely to trouble Bayern.

However, as the knockout stages approach, the best teams start to match up, so the games become more challenging. Bayern have already played some of the teams in the Champions League this season, including PSG, Benfica and Inter.

Bayern fell short to Inter in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Whilst Kompany's team may have had priorities elsewhere, such as winning the Bundesliga, they have yet to prove themselves in knockout competition this season.

Most bookies are offering generous odds for Bayern to win the Club World Cup. However, Bayern may not be worth backing given their earlier exit in Europe this season.

Cole Palmer is a youngster who wouldn't mind summer appearances at the Rose Bowl, and yet Blues are least likely of all English teams to escape fatigue in late spring. City's immense depth gives Sky Blues short futures odds at all times, but Chelsea looks destined for a prohibitively draining May.

Chelsea F.C. also has the Conference League to worry about, putting further wear and tear on Blues while other Club World Cup favorites tackle thinner schedules.

Is Serie A's defense a moot point for the Club World Cup? Inter's clean sheets against teams like Monterrey are all-but-assured if the titan plays a strong lineup. But meanwhile, Europe's opposition will be piling up more goals and grabbing better seeds.

Inter doesn't own any goal-scoring kings of the continent. Marcus Thuram's 14 goals in 31 league appearances were tops on the squad as of mid-April. Thuram, a rising commodity, is more likely than Mbappé to play in the tournament. However, he was injured late this season.

Now comes the fun part - guessing why Inter Miami's odds are beaten by teams from the Americas. With FIFA's calendar discouraging its superstars, are young legs more critical than gold medals?

Palmeiras is an it-brand in South American soccer. The team's lineups include Facundo Torres, an intriguing young forward from Uruguay, and the Chelsea prospect Estêvão.

However, there's a downside to Palmeiras' generous betting price to win this July. The team's Group Stage draw of F.C. Porto, Inter Miami, and Al Ahly of Egypt is among the hardest in the tourney.

Flamengo's success is fueled by a symbiotic relationship with Europe. Flamengo's best prospects are lured away to the UK or elsewhere while the club gets cut-in on their transfer sums. The ""Vulture"" takes that money and invests in aging Premier League veterans looking to escape the grind. If Flamengo's model sounds a lot like the model of top MLS clubs now, well, that's no accident.

A good team's long odds reflect 2025's draw again. Flamengo is booked to face Chelsea on June 20.

Boca Juniors has another harsh draw for a South American club, or any club in the FIFA event. The team debuts against Benfica of Portugal, before facing Bayern Munich, both kickoffs set for Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

That's called being between a rock, and a hard place. Still, captain Edinson Cavani's squad is drawing better odds to lift summer's hardware than Inter Miami.

River Plate's matches are vibing those of the Colombia Men's National Team, with the bonus of an actual goal once in a while. Forward Miguel Borja's goal in the waning moments of River Plate's bout against Club Atlético Talleres on April 13 was a treat for supporters. It also drew the match even at 1-1, for River Plate's fourth draw in five dates. That form won't cut it in Group C with Inter Milan.

Fluminense appears on its way to a better season, matching Flamengo and Palmeiras at three wins apiece in Brazil's fresh cycle. Great defender Thiago Silva has returned to the club in earnest after arriving to help Tricolor escape relegation to the second tier in 2023-24.

Fluminense boasts a favorable draw in Group F, but must begin play against Dortmund.

The ""Fire"" of Botafogo is burning dim, with a 1-2-2 mark in mid-April. That's no way to mount a title defense in either league known as ""Serie A."" Modest campaigns may make the teams from stronger federations effective wagers to win summer gold. A diminished squad from Brazil's ranks makes a tougher pick. Botafogo is in Group B against PSG, Atlético Madrid, and the Seattle Sounders.

Picking Messi's team over a field of reserve lineups feels simple enough, especially at (+6600) odds. But it's simple bracket math that's got Miami's odds tanking compared to other talented sides.

Players like Messi and Luis Suárez probably won't appear with Inter Miami in the Club World Cup unless Herons are lucky enough to reach the quarter-finals, if then. By that time, Inter Miami will have been seeded second-at-best from Group A, not enough to avoid facing Man City or another powerhouse from Europe in the Round of 16.

It's a depth issue, not the starters' form, holding Miami's futures odds back. That's one consolation for the Major League Soccer fans gazing toward FIFA and CONCACAF's futures.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has vowed that Pep Guardiola should have a new-look squad in time for the Club World Cup.

City fly to the United States on June 12 ahead of the tournament, with a temporary transfer window opening this Sunday and shutting two days before they jet off.

Al Mubarak admitted that City were not aggressive enough in reshaping the team on the back of sealing a fourth consecutive Premier League title last summer and insisted the same mistakes will not be repeated.

Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that City want to wrap up a move north of £55million for AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders before America.

Morgan Gibbs-White has been a primary target in midfield, with City hopeful of signing at least one full back. Wolves left back Rayan Ait-Nouri has interest, with the club looking at two right back options.

Lyon's mercurial talent Rayan Cherki has admirers from across Europe as City pulled out of the race to land Florian Wirtz, citing the finances involved in signing the Bayer Leverkusen playmaker. Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa is an option were either Ederson or Stefan Ortega to depart.

‘Four players (arrived) in January and that gives you an idea of what's coming this summer because we will continue this summer with this, serving the needs of the club,' Al Mubarak said. 

‘We'll go about our business and it will be very clear, very swift. Our objective is to try to be ready with the new squad for the Club World Cup.

‘I think when I look back, last summer, we probably should have been more aggressive in some of the changes we needed to do. We didn't do that and that ended up costing us this year.'

It therefore promises to be a hectic fortnight at the Etihad Stadium before the summer jaunt, which starts with a short training camp in Boca Raton, an hour north of Miami.

City face Wydad AC on June 18 but should have a plethora of new faces both on and off the pitch before then. Guardiola's backroom staff has been cut by three, with Juanma Lillo, Inigo Dominguez and Carlos Vicens all leaving in the coming weeks.

During an interview recorded in Abu Dhabi on Monday, Al Mubarak revealed that the hierarchy are working tirelessly to sort business early. 

Guardiola's messages about squad size have been mixed in recent weeks, first claiming he requires more numbers owing to an increasing amount of games before stating last week that the existing bunch needed streamlining.

‘All the players, everyone I saw after the Fulham game, they're excited about coming back,' Al Mubarak added. 

‘Nobody feels good about how we finished the season. They want to come back, and they want to come back hungry.

‘And I can see the hunger and these players, they want to come back to pre-season. Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time.' 

City clinched third spot in the Premier League - and qualification for next season's Champions League - by beating Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage on the final day.  

Al Mubarak said: ‘Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, “we're coming back”. I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. 

'Erling (Haaland) didn't want to go on vacation. He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season.

‘That's the attitude you want and that's exactly why you see me so positive. We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity.

‘I just got off the phone right now with Ferran (Soriano). He spent the day with Txiki (Begiristain), Pep and Hugo (Viana) today, this morning. 

'We finished yesterday evening, our last game. And today, we're working. Nobody's going on vacation yet.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","City chief wants to finish transfer business by CWC","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45372400/man-city-aim-complete-transfer-business-club-world-cup-club-chief","Thu, 29 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Pep Guardiola was not impressed when a journalist kept asking about Jack Grealish's omission from Manchester City's match day squad vs. Fulham. (2:22)

Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has said the club's transfer business will be ""very swift"" and they intend to be ""ready with the new squad for the Club World Cup.""

The revamped Club World Cup, held in the United States, is set to get under way on June 15, with City beginning their campaign against Moroccan side Al Wydad.

The Club World Cup represents City's final chance to end the season with silverware. A mid-season collapse saw City drop out of the Premier League title race and Pep Guardiola's team were made to battle for a place in next season's Champions League.

City signed four players in the January window in an attempt to rectify their poor results, with Nico Gonzalez, Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis all coming into the squad. Despite losing the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, City eventually finished third thanks to a late run of good form.

In a wide-ranging interview with City's club media channels, Al Mubarak laid out the club's plans for the summer window.

""We feel very good about these players,"" Al Mubarak said. ""That's four players in January. And that gives you an idea of what's coming this summer because we will continue this summer with this, serving the needs of the club.

""And I can tell you today, that's, I would say, day one of the new season, we have clearly identified who exactly are the targets, in what positions, and we have our clear No. 1 option, our clear No. 2 option. And we'll go about our business, and it will be very clear, very swift. And our objective is to try to be ready with the new squad for the Club World Cup.""

Al Mubarak has been City's chairman since Emirati royal and politician Sheikh Mansour completed his purchase of the club in September 2008.

Under Al Mubarak's stewardship, City have become the dominant force in English football -- winning the Premier League eight times. They lifted their first Champions League title in 2023 as part of the club's treble-winning campaign.

But City's difficult 2024-25 season has seen Guardiola's team lose 16 games in all competitions -- the worst record of the manager's career.

Asked about his message to supporters after the difficult year, Al Mubarak said some of City's star players -- such as Erling Haaland and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri are keen to put things right next season.

""I think all the players, everyone I saw yesterday after the Fulham game, all the players, they're excited, they're excited about coming back. Nobody feels good about how we finished the season,"" the City chairman said.

They want to come back, and they want to come back hungry. And I can see the hunger and these players, they want to come back to pre-season. Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time etc. Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me: 'we're coming back. We're ready to come back in three weeks' time.'

""I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. Erling didn't want to go on vacation. He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. That's the attitude you want and that's exactly why you see me so positive.

We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity. I just got off the phone right now with Ferran [Sorriano, City's chief executive]. He spent the day with Txiki [Begiristain, City's ougoing director of football], Pep and Hugo [Viana, City's incoming director of football] today, this morning.

""We finished yesterday evening, our last game. And today, we're working. Nobody's going on vacation yet.""

Al Mubarak was also full of praise for Kevin De Bruyne as he prepares to leave the club upon the expiry of his contract on June 30.

Sources have told ESPN that De Bruyne has opened talks with Napoli over a free agent move to the newly crowned Serie A champions.

""Kevin has been just extraordinary,"" Al Mubarak said. ""Listen, I mean, obviously I have a subjective view. And my view is from the lens I see from the football I've lived over these years, obviously as chair, but also as a fan of this club. And Kev, what Kevin has given to this club, in my view, he is the greatest player to play for this club.

""I think his accomplishments speak for themselves. His accomplishments for the club in terms of trophies. In terms of that tally, number of Premier Leagues, the Champions League, FA Cups, Community Shields, Carabao Cups. I mean, it's an unbelievable tally, the highest of any player that's ever played for this club.

""His personal achievements, twice PFA Player of the Year. He's been a captain. He's been a leader. He's been a teammate. He's been everything you'd hope from your most important player.""

City will face Al Wydad, Emirati club Al Ain and Juventus in the group stage of the Club World Cup.

Are you ready for some football? Or perhaps more appropriately, fútbol?

Saturday in Los Angeles, locals LAFC of MLS will face Liga MX giants Club América in the FIFA Club World Cup play-in match. The winner will earn a berth in the tournament that starts in the U.S. a couple of weeks later.

This one-leg playoff has been billed as the most expensive game in North American soccer history after FIFA, the sport's global governing body, announced that each participating Concacaf team would receive $9.55 million for taking part in the tournament. So Saturday's winner will leave BMO Stadium with a hefty check as well as a chance to play for the $125 million prize that will go to the tournament's eventual champion.

Short of dropping the prize money from a helicopter or having the teams walk out onto the field while “Living in America” blares from the stadium's loudspeakers, FIFA's ongoing fascination with U.S. sports culture will be center-stage Saturday night. The play-in concept is one FIFA has adopted from the North American sports landscape and one that is becoming more prevalent in soccer leagues around the world.

The NBA's Play-In Tournament, created during the 2020-2021 season, is the most well-known use of the format in sports, despite its short history. Before that season, eight teams each from the Eastern and Western conferences qualified for the playoffs to decide the NBA's champion. Now, up to 10 per conference are eligible, with the winner of the seventh vs. eighth seed matchup earning a playoff berth, and the loser of that game having the safety net of playing the winner of the ninth vs. 10th game to get in.

There are also rumblings that college football's recently debuted 12-team playoff will grow to include up to 16 teams, with the lowest seeds playing their way into the final bracket in the future.

FIFA's Club World Cup play-in game in 2025 is much more straightforward.

However, with expansion the new norm at FIFA, and considering South American federation Conmebol's hope that the 2030 World Cup finals will include 64 teams, one can't rule out that the Club World Cup will eventually include a four-team play-in tournament. More games mean more revenue, especially for matches with an all-or-nothing carrot — qualification, or elimination.

This inaugural 32-team Club World Cup, which is an expanded, four-yearly version of the annual version of the tournament, will be followed next year by a 48-team men's World Cup finals, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But Saturday night's win-and-you're-in match might actually never be played again.

FIFA only created the play-in game in a rush after Mexican side Club León was expelled from the tournament in March. León's appeal for reinstatement with the Court of Arbitration for Sport was then unsuccessful. LAFC had lost to León in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final. So, as that competition's runner-up, LAFC was given a lifeline. Club América qualified as the top-ranked Concacaf club not already in the tournament, per the FIFA Club World Cup confederation ratings.

The result is an MLS vs. Liga MX match with the highest of stakes.

Now, there have been recent meetings between MLS teams and Mexican ones in the Concacaf Champions Cup when a regional trophy was on the line. In fact, less than 24 hours after the Club World Cup play-in game, the Vancouver Whitecaps will face Cruz Azul in Mexico City in that Concacaf competition's 2025 final. Yet, the winner of their match earns $5 million versus the nearly $10 million award FIFA will hand out in Los Angeles this weekend.

That follows the recent trend by tournament organizers to increase the prize money up for grabs, thus further incentivizing participating teams.

In March, U.S. Soccer announced the total prize money for the U.S. Open Cup would be raised to $1 million. That's a significant increase from the 2024 total purse of $475,000. This year's Open Cup winner will receive a $600,000 prize. Meanwhile, MLS has over $2.5 million in its postseason award budget. The winner of the MLS Cup final earns $300,000. Conmebol made a big splash in 2024 when it announced a $23 million reward for the winner of the Copa Libertadores.

The UEFA Champions League winner will earn about $27 million. This season's European final, between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, will be played on the day of the Club World Cup play-in game, a few hours earlier in Munich, Germany.

Is that a problem for FIFA? And why is LAFC allowed to host the play-in game at its home stadium? Is that home-field advantage? Let's answer those questions.

LAFC will enjoy the comfort of its home stadium, but with a sizable contingent of Club América fans in Los Angeles, and throughout the United States, expect the Mexican side's famed yellow strip to be well represented in the stands. LAFC announced Tuesday that the match has sold out the 22,000-capacity arena.

FIFA's Club World Cup tournament director Manolo Zubiria told reporters recently that an effort was made to stage the game at a neutral site. Zubiria cited several challenges that led tournament organizers to opt for BMO Stadium. He said that because of Club León's late appeal process, FIFA had to plan ahead in the event a play-in game would be the next alternative.

A congested events calendar in the U.S. limited the available stadiums, Zubiria said. The goal, he added, was to play the match in one of the 12 cities hosting Club World Cup games this summer. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., for example, will be the venue for six matches during the tournament.

“We came across multiple challenges, as you can appreciate, trying to put together a football match like this in such a short period of time,” Zubiria told reporters May 16. “We had no certainty to commit to a stadium that may have had to move other existing events, which was the case across all venues that we spoke to. But also, one of the major challenges we had was the lead-in time or the time that we had to access a building to set up for a soccer match.

“I'm not just talking about the field of play. I'm talking about everything else that we require for a FIFA competition, especially on the technology side, to have to set up VAR and goal-line technology and semiautomated offside.”

LAFC co-president and general manager John Thorrington's response was as expected.

“Obviously, we respect the decision. I guess we would say I do know that there's been a number of conversations about the venue and various details about the game that we have stayed completely out of,” Thorrington said. “And what I would say is, if you go back to our preseason match against América (a 2-1 LAFC win at BMO Stadium in February), it didn't quite feel like a home game in the normal sense for us, given the affinity that and the fan base that they do have locally here in L.A.”

Club América president of operations Héctor Gonzalez Iñárritu remained diplomatic about the chosen venue but acknowledged the decision was not optimal.

“We know the efforts that FIFA made to find a neutral stadium,” he said. “We play a lot of games in the U.S. and understand that finding a stadium is not easy. This isn't ideal, but we have to take advantage of the opportunity. Obviously, it would have been best to play at a neutral site. But we know this stadium. We know the people. We know that there will be many more América fans there, plus Mexican fans who will surely root for América.”

Inter Milan against PSG will kick off seven hours before the Club World Cup play-in game. In that sense, LAFC and Club América will have a prime-time slot for U.S. viewers, albeit a late one. The Champions League final will start at 3 p.m. ET, and the play-in match will follow at 10:30 p.m. (That start time conversely means the game will be played in the middle of the night for Europeans, which will surely limit interest in it there). However, the Champions League final is a fixture second only to the men's World Cup final in terms of prestige. It's the most important match of the annual soccer calendar across the globe, hands down.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has invited fans to be part of history when the Club World Cup begins. He also claimed the trophy will be the “most coveted” by clubs and players. That's all scripted speak from Infantino, but there is a brewing feud between FIFA and UEFA, its European equivalent, one that took a significant turn earlier this month during the FIFA Congress in Paraguay.

UEFA officials, including the confederation's president Aleksander Ceferin, walked out of the congress after they alleged that Infantino, who was several hours late arriving at the event, had prioritized a trip to the Middle East to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders. The two sides have since calmed the waters, but it is another layer to what has become a controversial tournament.

“It was a challenge to find a date that worked for both teams,” Zubiria said. “We were also very considerate of everything that was happening. There is a Concacaf Champions Cup final the next day. There's a UEFA Champions League final the same day. But if you look at it the other way, it's also exciting because it gives an opportunity that so much football is happening on the same weekend, and one event will help lead into the other.”

The Club World Cup has conjured all sorts of emotions from players, club officials and fans alike. It's set to be played every four years, so this summer's inaugural edition won't be a one-and-done deal. For LAFC and Club América, a golden ticket is at stake.

They couldn't care less about all the noise.

2026 FIFA WORLD CUP TEAMS: WHO HAS QUALIFIED FOR THE WORLD CUP?

It is the first time Valvoline Global will be partnered with an event of this magnitude, but the company's foray into international soccer is not exactly new.

Valvoline Global was a founding partner of the inaugural Concacaf W Gold Cup in 2023. Valvoline served as the official marketing partner of the Concacaf Gold Cup in 2023 and 2019.

To mark the occasion, Valvoline hosted the FIFA World Cup Trophy in a suite at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday during New York City FC's match against the Houston Dynamo.

The Dynamo pulled out the win 3-0 in a wet and rainy match.

The 2026 World Cup will take place across three countries – the United States, Canada and Mexico, beginning on June 11 and running through July 19 of that year. It will be the first time 48 nations will compete for the championship.

The final will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. All matches will be broadcast in English on FOX networks.

The Red Devils are selling their most exciting prospect in a decade on the whim of the coach - but what if the Portuguese proves to be the wrong man?

The last time Manchester United achieved their worst Premier League points total, supporters looked to the club's youth academy for hope. They found it in Alejandro Garnacho, who fired the young Red Devils to FA Youth Cup glory with seven goals, including two in the final against Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. Two years later, Garnacho did it again, but this time in the senior FA Cup, scoring alongside his old academy team-mate Kobbie Mainoo to sink Manchester City at Wembley.

Garnacho and Mainoo had been the only positive stories of another wretched campaign in 2023-24, when United registered their worst league finish in 34 years, though Garnacho took more of the limelight thanks to his show-stopping moments, which included braces against West Ham Chelsea and Aston Villa as well as his sensational bicycle kick at Everton, which won the Premier League's Goal of the Season award.

But after another dismal season for United where they earned their lowest points total in Premier League history and posted their worst league finish since being relegated in 1974, Garnacho is no longer a source of hope. He has instead become the scapegoat for the team's problems and is being hounded out by Ruben Amorim.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Australian ninth seed had reached the quarter-finals at each of the past four Grand Slams but he ran out of steam against Bublik, who rallied to win 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.

""Obviously not a good day at the office,"" lamented De Minaur.

""One of those matches that kind of just slipped away without a whole lot of meaning.""

De Minaur fell victim to the mercurial Kazakh's exceptional shotmaking as his clay-court season ended in disappointment and with the 26-year-old needing to recharge.

""Look, I'm just tired. I'm tired mentally. I'm a little bit burnt out, if anything. A lot of tennis being played,"" he said.

""I think I lost that one. Looking back at my Grand Slam career, I can't think of another match where I felt this way and I ended up losing a match that I probably by all means shouldn't have.

""Look, not to take credit away from Bublik, he's extremely dangerous, but saying that, I was also two sets to love up. This is a match that, yeah, I win 99.9% of the time.""

De Minaur echoed the view of Casper Ruud, the two-time French Open runner-up who blasted the ATP's ranking system after he lost in the second round on Wednesday.

World number eight Ruud compared it to ""a rat race"" which forces players to compete with injuries, as he was hindered by a knee issue in his to loss Nuno Borges.

De Minaur missed three Masters 1000 events in the second half of last year due to injury and took just two days off after the Davis Cup in November before starting preparations for the new season.

""It's just never ending,"" he said of the schedule.

""No one's got a solution. But the solution is simple: you shorten the schedule, right?

""Because what's going to happen is players' careers are going to get shorter and shorter because they're just going to burn out mentally. There's just too much tennis.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

We've reached day five of the French Open, and it's another big day in store for British tennis. Jack Draper, Katie Boulter, Cam Norrie and Jacob Fearnley are all in action and looking to make it intl the third round.

It's all over for Emma Raducanu, though. She was blown away in straight sets by Iga Swiatek yesterday, although the 2021 US Open champion vowed to keep striving to compete with the world's best despite now going five matches against the Pole without claiming a set.

Elsewhere, Novak Djokovic and world No.1 Jannik Sinner will continue their bids after Carlos Alcaraz got through yesterday. Rain has disrupted play on the outside courts so far, but the weather is set fair today.

After ending his career with a three-set defeat to Jannik Sinner on Court Philippe-Chatrier, former world No. 7 Richard Gasquet said it was a great way to bow out of the game.

""I couldn't have dreamt of a better end, because, you know, you never know what could happen on your last tournament. It's not always easy everywhere, every day,"" he said.

""So to finish today on Chatrier against the No. 1 in the world, it's a wonderful end for me. So I'm very happy with what I was able to do for this tournament.""

There's another British defeat on Court Philippe-Chatrier. After Emma Raducanu's 6-1 6-2 loss to Iga Swiatek, Katie Boulter also failed to score a win on the main showcourt.

The British No. 1 suffered a 6-1 6-3 defeat to seventh seed Madison Keys.

But it's good news for Cameron Norrie, who beat lucky loser Federico Gomez 7-6 6-2 6-1.

Madison Keys isn't hanging around today. She took the first set 6-1 and is on course for the second.

To Court Suzanne-Lenglen, where Novak Djokovic takes on eccentric Frenchman Corentin Moutet.

It's the first time Djokovic has played a French Open match on the second court here in two years and the crowd are already going wild.

They burst out into chants of ""Moutet"" when he stepped out a moment ago. But three-time champion Djokovic also drew a massive cheer.

The atmosphere could be wild for this one.

It took a lengthy tiebreak, but Cameron Norrie took a one-set lead in his match against Federico Agustin Gomez.

Madison Keys and Katie Boulter will go head-to-head at the French Open shortly, but Laura Robson, who is good friends with both, refused to be drawn in on who she'd rather win.

Speaking on TNT Sports, she said: ""I am Switzerland,"" a nod to her neutrality.

Blink and you miss Jannik Sinner's victory over Richard Gasquet.

Sinner took the win by virtue of a straight-sets victory over the Frenchman.

Jannik Sinner is heading towards a three-set win over Richard Gasquet.

He raced through to take the first two sets 6-3 6-0. The third set is on serve, though, with the Italian having just made it 3-3.



On a day of upsets at the French Open, home favourite Arthur Fils made sure he wouldn't be one of the top players going out.

De Minaur and Mensik had already lost from two sets up and the 14th seed also blew a two-set lead against Jaume Munar and seemed to be struggling with a back issue, taking painkillers.

But from 1-3 down in the decider he won three games in a row before being pulled into a marathon battle at 4-4, saving multiple break points to pull ahead.

He broke in the final game to seal a 7-6(3) 7-6(4) 2-6 0-6 6-4 victory, taking his shirt off and roaring in celebration.



Britain's Sonay Kartal suffered a 6-1 6-4 defeat to Marie Bouzkova in the second round on Thursday, bringing her French Open singles debut to an end.

Depending on other results, Kartal could now make her top 50 debut at the end of the tournament. And she's still taking the positives from her loss as she eyes what to work on next.

""Obviously super disappointed with the result, but I'll look back at that match, and I'll think that it was a super good level. I did a lot of things that I've been needing to do,"" the British No. 3 said.

""I did it in the match and I think that towards the end, I kind of had a few chances, struggled with the serve, but I think in that second set, we were were neck and neck, and it was just a matter of just one or two points that I played a little bit loosely.

""I think it's just the constant treating every point like it's one of the biggest points of the match. I think just consistently staying with it and not dipping off, I think, is for me, probably the most noticeable thing and the hardest thing.

""So, yeah, I think it's just mentally, just making sure I'm present, you know, every single point. I think that's probably the biggest thing that I'm taking away from today's match.""

Alexander Zverev made a six-figure bet with Caroline Wozniacki on live TV after his first-round match at the French Open.

Ahead of his meeting with Jesper De Jong, Zverev appeared on TNT Sports and showed off his £275k watch.

To the surprise of the studio, he offered to put his luxury watch on the line in a game of roulette. Wozniacki guessed a number, but luckily for Zverev, who currently leads Jesper De Jong 4-3 in the third set (one set all), she didn't guess right.

Alex de Minaur suffered a horrible collapse against the dangerous Alexander Bublik, blowing a two-set lead to lose 2-6 2-6 6-4 6-3 6-2.

And Miami Open champion Jakub Mensik has also suffered a collapse from two sets up. The 19th seed lost 2-6 1-6 6-4 6-3 6-3 to qualifier Henrique Rocha, who is ranked down at No. 200 in the world.

Jordan Thompson ripped into the ATP schedule after losing in the first round of the French Open.

After a straight sets defeat by Jiri Lehecka, he said: ""Unfortunately, with the ATP schedule and how s*** it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money.

""You just feel like you're missing out. I can't stand the schedule. I hate the two-week events and I think it's even tougher for Aussies.

""I mean, you are there for an eternity. It feels like a couple of times I've made the doubles final and I've been in the same city for over 17 days, and we're at one tournament.""

Coash Mark Petchey has warned Emma Raducanu that the sport is different from when she won the 2021 US Open.

After her loss to Iga Swiatek, Petchey said: ""It was clearly going to be the ultimate test for Emma yesterday.

“It's tough on Emma as I still feel everyone is living in 2021. The games have changed massively, the balls are four times heavier now and Emma isn't the biggest hitter out there.

“On hard courts and grass is a lot closer compared to where Emma was in Australia against Iga, but against Iga and Coco, she knows what she has to do and it will take a long time. My mantra to her has been ‘you are starting your career now. Everyone is judging you on what happened in 2021 but the reality is, I want to see you building a career here where people judge you in two years'.”



There was a record six British players in the second round of the French Open, but now just four remain.

Sonay Kartal gets a break of serve in the second set but can't capitalise as Marie Bouzkova fights back to win 6-1 6-4.

Sonay Kartal is up against it in her second-round match against Marie Bouzkova. She was blown away 6-1 in the first set.

She has settled at the start of the second, holding serve for 1-1.



Carlos Alcaraz remains the favourite with the bookies at Roland Garros after winning through to a third round match with Damir Dzumhur.

According to Grosvenor Sport, he's now 10/11 to prevail in Paris. Jack Draper is fifth favourite at 30/1.

Grosvenor Sport: French Open winner odds: Carlos Alcaraz 10/11; Jannik Sinner 12/5; Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev 11/1; Lorenzo Musetti 20/1; Jack Draper 30/1.



Tim Henman has said Emma Raducanu must learn from her 6-1 602 defeat to Iga Siwatek.

""Swiatek is a four-time champion here,"" he said on TNT Sports. ""She is one of the greatest clay court players of all time. There is the bar Raducanu and the rest have to get to.

“Emma has a great game, but it is almost as if Swiatek has an extra gear. She has extra power on both wings, her movement in and out of corners is a bit better. That's a lesson she learned. Emma is the kind of person who will embrace the challenge in front of her and try and find the solutions.""

Fans on social media are blasting the decision not to have Novak Djokovic on the main court today.

The Serbian is targeting an unprecedented 25th major title. However, he'll play the talented Corentin Moutet on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.

The match is scheduled for around 3pm.

Casper Ruud has blamed the ATP Tour for playing through injury in his shock against Nuno Borges yesterday.

After the seventh seed lost in four sets, he ranted: ""I decided to kind of push through it doing some anti-inflammatory pills and painkillers, which helped to a certain degree but not enough.

""I will have some more time now to let it heal and rest for a long time. It's kind of like a rat race when it comes to the rankings as well. You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events.""

Emma Raducanu's post-match actions after losing to Iga Swiatek were noted with interest by Annabel Croft.

The former WTA Tour star said: ""That was quite a cold handshake. There was no warmth there between the two players. It was quite dismissive, almost just a handshake and then a walk off. Once Iga Swiatek got a breakthrough in this match, she just stamped her authority on it.""

Seventh seed Ruud crashed out of the French Open on Wednesday after losing to unseeded Nuno Borges in the second round, with the Norwegian saying he had been struggling with knee pain that restricted his movement.

Asked if the busy tennis calendar made it difficult to take time off and fully heal an injury, the 26-year-old told reporters that players' rankings would take a hit if they skipped mandatory events.

""Well, it's kind of like a rat race when it comes to the rankings, as well,"" he said.

""You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events.

""You feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play... the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't.""

The ATP did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.

Ruud also said a player's year-end bonus was cut by 25% if they missed a mandatory event.

""I'm not sure if you're aware, but if you don't play a mandatory event, they cut 25% of your year-end bonus. You're kind of forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that is not what I think is very fair,"" he added.

Ruud said he was looking forward to taking some weeks off to heal his injury before returning to court.

""I'm just looking forward to not being on painkillers for some days now. Let it really heal and rest and see where I'm at in a few weeks,"" he added.

Women's second seed and former Roland Garros finalist Coco Gauff also targets a place in the fourth round, along with 18-year-old contender Mirra Andreeva.

World number one Sinner faces his second French opponent in a row at Roland Garros and is expecting a memorable encounter against the 38-year-old Gasquet, playing at the tournament for the 22nd and final time.

""I know you're going to support him (Gasquet), it's OK, I know that,"" Sinner told the crowd after his first-round win over home hope Arthur Rinderknech.

""I'm just happy to share a court with him.""

The 23-year-old Italian showed some signs of rustiness against Rinderknech in just his seventh match back since returning from a three-month doping suspension.

Sinner made his comeback at the Italian Open earlier in May, reaching the final before losing in straight sets to reigning Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic, fresh off his 100th ATP title last weekend, got his tilt at a fourth French Open title off to a solid start on Tuesday.

The Serbian sixth seed will need to be on his guard against crafty Frenchman Corentin Moutet.

""I don't know how many more Grand Slams I've got left in my body,"" Djokovic said after the opening round.

""I spent quite a bit of time making sure that every step of the way in preparation and prevention is respected in order for me to still be able to play on this level.""

Third-ranked Alexander Zverev meets Jesper de Jong for a place in round three, with Alex de Minaur, Jakub Mensik, Arthur Fils and Joao Fonseca all returning to the court as well on Thursday.

Gael Monfils looks to pull off an upset over British fifth seed Jack Draper in the night session after fighting back from two sets down under the lights on Court Philippe Chatrier in his opener.

Gauff laughed off an amusing lapse that led to her arriving on court without any racquets ahead of her first-round win.

The American said it actually helped her relax as she targets a first title since last year's WTA Finals, having come up just short in Madrid and Rome.

""I think as the rounds go, I think it's just with every tournament you feel more comfortable out there on the court,"" said Gauff, who plays Czech qualifier Tereza Valentova in her second match.

""You have a match under your belt and know how to deal with certain situations. I think the first round is the most nervous I get. After that, you just feel like it's a little bit smoother sailing.""

Sixth seed Andreeva, who had an impressive run to the semi-finals at Roland Garros last year, plays American Ashlyn Krueger.

Andreeva is playing her first Grand Slam as a top-10 seed after capturing WTA 1000 series titles in Dubai and Indian Wells.

Third seed Jessica Pegula plays fellow American Ann Li, while Australian Open champion Madison Keys takes on Britain's Katie Boulter.

Other past and present Grand Slam champions Marketa Vondrousova, Victoria Azarenka, Sofia Kenin and Barbora Krejcikova are also on Thursday's schedule.

Jordan Thompson has ripped into the demanding ATP schedule after crashing out of the French Open in the first round. He was beaten in straight sets by Jiri Lehecka, a result which brought his campaign to an early end. The reigning US Open doubles champion only managed to win six games en route to a 6-4 6-2 6-1 defeat.

After the match, Thompson questioned the motivation behind extending the previous model of ATP and WTA 1000 events. They were previously concluded in under two weeks but they now take up more time on the calendar. Thompson believes the length of the warm-up events make it difficult for players to prepare for the big tournaments.

He also dismissed the idea of simply not taking part in such events, which would lead to players missing out on valuable prize money.

""Unfortunately, with the ATP schedule and how s*** it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money,"" fumed Thompson.

""You just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity. I can't stand the schedule. I hate the two-week events and I think it's even tougher for Aussies.

""The last few years I've been away, after every Aussie Open, I've come back at probably the start of December because I've got to wait until the Davis Cup [is over].

""I know there are opportunities to go home throughout the year, but it is so far to get back to Australia and I don't see the benefit of going there for less than 10 days.

""By the time you acclimatise there, on an island in the middle of nowhere that is a completely different time zone, you've just got to come back and compete again. So I just don't see how that's beneficial for any tennis player.

""I haven't spoken to a player who likes the two-week events. I mean, you are there for an eternity. It feels like a couple of times I've made the doubles final and I've been in the same city for over 17 days, and we're at one tournament.

""Why is one tournament taking that long to finish? I mean, why do we need a day off for playing? They are three set matches. It should just be like the Paris Masters, a one-week event.

""Why do we need to turn that into a two-week event? It's just a waste of time in my opinion and I know a lot of other players feel the same.""

Thompson is now a veteran on the ATP Tour, having been involved in the professional circuit since 2013. It remains to be seen if the body will tweak the length of non-Grand Slam events in line with his demands and those of his fellow players.

Joao Fonseca sealed his spot in the third round at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in his fledgling career Thursday at Roland Garros, where he earned a hard-fought straight-sets win.

The 18-year-old Brazilian battled through a pendulum-swinging contest, in which he overturned a break deficit in the opening two sets, to defeat wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert 7-6(4), 7-6(4), 6-4. Fonseca channeled the energy from a lively crowd on Court 14, and dug deep in pressure points to secure a two-hour, 54-minute victory.

FEEL THE FONSECA FIRE 🔥He storms through to the next round with a 7-6(4) 7-6(4) 6-4 win over Herbert… ⚡️#fonseca #rolandgarros #tennis pic.twitter.com/ut3IwUf3cz

Fonseca is this week up 11 spots to a career-high No. 54 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He has enjoyed a breakout start to the season, highlighted by winning his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and recording his maiden Top 10 win against Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open.

By defeating 30th seed Hubert Hurkacz in his Roland Garros debut on Tuesday, Fonseca became the youngest Brazilian to win a match at the clay-court major since Thomaz Koch in 1963. He will next continue his campaign in the French capital against fifth seed Jack Draper or Gael Monfils.

The evenly matched support from the Court 14 crowd reflected Fonseca's meteoric rise this year. The passionate cheers provided by the French fans were often drowned out by the hundreds of travelling Brazilians, who formed a sea of yellow in the stands and simultaneously rose when the 18-year-old slammed down an ace to seal the opening set.



Despite the increasing energy, replete with a mixture of chants from each set of fans, Herbert continued to remain cool. He saved three set points on serve at 4-5 in the second set, and led 3/0 in the tie-break, but Fonseca kept coming back with a series of trademark groundstrokes.

Aiming to unsettle Fonseca with the use of variety in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash, Herbert played with intent throughout the encounter, in which he tallied 49 winners to the Brazilian's 34. Yet Fonseca displayed standout resilience and fighting spirit in key moments, including an ultimately decisive break for 4-3 in the third set.

Herbert is a two-time doubles champion at Roland Garros with Nicolas Mahut, with whom he will team on Thursday against fourth seeds and last year's finalists Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori.

PARIS -- Coco Gauff kept getting herself in trouble with shaky serving in the French Open's second round, and she kept putting herself back in position to win by breaking right back Thursday.

The second-seeded Gauff, pursuing her first title at Roland Garros, eliminated 172nd-ranked qualifier Tereza Valentova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-4 in 75 minutes on a partly cloudy, warm afternoon on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.

Amid a soundtrack of sirens from nearby streets and roars from nearby courts, 2023 US Open champion Gauff managed to produce only 11 winners, five fewer than her far-less-experienced opponent. Gauff finished with 23 unforced errors, a total that included a half-dozen double faults.

Against Valentova -- an 18-year-old who won the junior title at the French Open last year and was competing in the main draw at a major tournament for the first time -- Gauff got broken five times. Four of those came in the second set, and each time, the 21-year-old Floridian managed to rebound immediately to claim Valentova's next service game.

""There is a sense of urgency after getting broken, for sure. You don't want to get too far behind. You don't want to get two breaks down. You can live with one break. But she's definitely got to serve better and do a better job of holding as the tournament progresses,"" said Gauff's father, Corey. ""She's probably been one of the best returners of serve on the tour the last two to three months. But that's not what you want. You want to hold first, for sure. It's not really a break until you hold.""

On Saturday, 2022 runner-up Gauff will face another Czech player, Marie Bouzkova, as she tries to reach the fourth round in Paris for the fifth consecutive appearance.

Other winners in the women's bracket Thursday included No. 3 Jessica Pegula, who was the runner-up at last year's US Open, 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, who reached the 2019 final at Roland Garros.

Vondrousova, who is unseeded this year, eliminated No. 25 Magdalena Frech 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 on Court 6 and then sat in the stands at Lenglen to watch Gauff vs. Valentova.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Amid the many highs at Roland Garros, there have been a fair few lows for Coco Gauff.

As the world No.3 bids to win her first title on the famous clay-courts that are currently hosting the French Open , one moment Gauff will never want to relive is her third round loss at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Gauff was her nation's co flag-bearer at the 2024 Opening Ceremony alongside NBA legend LeBron James in what was her first ever Olympics for Team USA.

The stakes had never been higher, and this time the 21-year-old was representing more than just herself.

However, the 2023 US Open champion's run at the Summer Games ended in bitter disappointment after she was eliminated by Croatia's Donna Vekic 7-6, 6-2 in a third round upset.

It was a game overshadowed by a controversial line call in the second set amid a potential Gauff comeback.

The American hit a serve before Vekic's return landed near the baseline.

A line judge called Vekic's shot out, and Gauff did not keep the play alive, meaning the point was hers initially.

However, umpire Jaume Campistol felt the Croatian's shot was in and awarded her the point instead, believing the line judge's call did not hinder Gauff.

That gave Vekic a crucial break and a 4-2 lead, causing an incensed Gauff to walk over and confront the official as play was delayed for several minutes.

“I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball,” Gauff said to Campistol before she began to tear up.

“It's not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.”

It's no surprise Gauff became emotional. After all, she was a strong favourite to go deep in the tournament and had already blown away her previous two opponents, dropping just five games.

“I feel like I'm getting cheated on constantly in this game,” she added when speaking to tournament supervisor Clare Wood.

The umpire's call was one that never had to be made.

The rule states: ""If a chair umpire or line umpire calls ‘Out' and then corrects the call to good, what is the correct decision?

“Decision: The chair umpire must decide if the original ‘Out' call was a hindrance to either player. If it was a hindrance, the point shall be replayed. If it was not a hindrance, the player who hit the ball wins the point.”

The umpire ultimately decided that the line judge who called Gauff's point out did not hinder the American.

Despite the fact, in almost all cases, a line judge shouting out as the receiving player hits the ball would undoubtedly hinder them.

“I felt that he called it before I hit, and I don't think the ref disagreed,” she said. 

“I think he just thought it didn't affect my swing, which I felt like it did.”

Controversies such as these are easily avoidable, which is why Gauff herself demanded a rule change, in the form of video replays, following her elimination.

An almost identical dispute happened to her in the 2024 French Open semifinals just a few weeks earlier, during a defeat against Iga Swiatek where she also began to tear up.

""I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person,"" Gauff said.

""Also, there are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it's like, what does that give you in that moment?

""In situations you can call for the supervisor, but there's not much they can do from that standpoint. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.""

This year's French Open will use line judges, but luckily for Gauff it will be the last edition of the event where such officials will exist.

It's a tournament of emerging US prodigies, including Gauff's friend Robin Montgomery and Coco's former roommate Hailey Baptiste.

From now on, every Grand Slam, including Wimbledon, will have the automatic line calling system and will not have line judges for the 2026 season.

Gauff has started this year's French Open in impressive fashion after a convincing win against Olivia Gadecki in the first round.

The American spent just one hour and 11 minutes on court as she secured a 6-2, 6-2 win against her Australian opponent.

It was a contest overshadowed by Gauff's hilarious tennis racket blunder, which she responded to on social media.

She faced Tereza Valentova in the second round of the tournament on Thursday.

Gauff cruised to a 6-2, 6-4 victory to march into the third round in Paris.

On a day with nine American women in action, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula lived up to their seedings, each advancing with straight-set wins.

It was Throwback Thursday for the American women at Roland Garros.

With No. 2 Coco Gauff and No. 3 Jessica Pegula, it's the first time in 15 years that the United States has two of the Top 3 French Open seeds. The last time, as discerning tennis fans no doubt know, it was Venus and Serena Williams.

In fact, there were nine American women in action across the 16 second-round matches from the bottom half of the draw. With No. 7 Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, the U.S. had three Top 10s in play.

Gauff and Pegula both eased into the third round with straight-set wins. Pegula got things started on Court Philippe Chatrier, defeating fellow American Ann Li 6-3, 7-6 (3). Gauff followed up on Court Suzanne Lenglen with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Czech Republic qualifier Tereza Valentova.

Later, Keys was a 6-1, 6-3 winner over Katie Boulter. She's now won all of her nine Grand Slam matches this year.

In a typically smooth, consistent performance, Pegula broke Li's serve three times, while saving six of seven break points against her.

“It was a really tough match today,” Pegula said afterward. “Ann has been playing some really good tennis this year and had a lot of close matches with good players. It was tricky with the wind. She was slicing a lot, kind of making me earn a lot of points.

“I felt like it was a pretty physical match, a lot of long points and long games. But happy I was able to kind of hold on to that second set there definitely.”

🔥🔥🔥 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/cEevSNXQmE

This was Pegula's 30th match-win of the year -- only World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka (36) has won more. Pegula is 10-5 at Roland Garros, but nine of those wins have come against unseeded opponents. She's 9-0 in those matches. 

Next up for the 31-year-old Pegula: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, a three-set winner over No. 25 Magdalena Frech, in a third-round match on Saturday. Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, reached the Roland Garros final in 2019.

This was their first meeting at the WTA level, but Li won their only previous match seven years ago in an ITF semifinal in Lexington. Li, 24 and ranked No. 55, was looking to equal her best career result at a Grand Slam.

After spotting Li a 2-0 lead in the first set, Pegula went on to win six of the last seven games. The second set was a far different story.

There were still no breaks when Pegula served at 4-all, but the persistent Li forged two break opportunities. Pegula answered them both -- with a gorgeous running forehand down the line and a booming serve that led to another winner.

The tiebreak was textbook Pegula. She scored the first mini-break when a Li backhand sailed wide and consolidated it with some nice serving. A deep backhand that Li couldn't pick up at net gave her the match.

Match win number 22 in Paris 👊@CocoGauff | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/moibnu61QG

The meeting of Gauff and Valentova was a collision of the 2018 and 2024 French Open junior champions. Not surprisingly, age and experience eventually won out over a player in her first WTA Tour-level main draw.

At 21, Gauff is three years older and used her speed to induce Valentova to try and end long rallies by overhitting. Gauff won the first set with three service breaks, the last coming on her fourth set point.

The second set featured an astounding 10 service breaks. Gauff managed to hold once -- and it was enough.

In the end, Valentova won only one of her nine service games.

Gauff has won 12 of her13 career meetings against younger opponents, losing to only Diana Shnaider in Toronto last season. She's also 9-2 against qualifiers at the Grand Slams. Her 22 main-draw match-wins at Roland Garros are the most at any single tournament.

Gauff will play Marie Bouzkova, a 6-1, 6-4 winner over Sonay Kartal, on Saturday.

Keys was dominant against the No. 38 player in the PIF WTA rankings, breaking Boulter's serve five times, while getting broken only once herself. Keys doubled up Boulter, hitting 20 winners to 10.

At 30, Keys is the oldest woman to win nine consecutive Grand Slam matches since Angelique Kerber did it seven years ago. Keys will meet the winner of the later match between Sofia Kenin and Victoria Azarenka on Saturday.

Jannik Sinner pulled the curtain shut on Richard Gasquet's career Thursday at Roland Garros, where he soared past the Frenchman 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 to reach the third round.

Making his 22nd appearance at the clay-court major in Paris, the 38-year-old Gasquet was unable to produce a response to Sinner's heavy ball-striking and pinpoint accuracy throughout the one-hour, 58-minute clash. With his victory, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings extended his Grand Slam winning streak to 16 matches, becoming the first man born in 1990 or later to do so.

“We have a good relationship off the court. We are different generations, but it's your moment,” Sinner said to Gasquet, who recorded his sole win over a World No. 1 in Monte-Carlo in 2005, when he defeated Roger Federer. “Congrats to your family, to your team. Without great people around each player, it's impossible to make such an incredible career. You played in such an incredible era of tennis and everyone will recognise you, even after your retirement.”

In many ways, it's fitting that Gasquet, who spent the majority of his 23-year career competing against the best players in the world, finished against the current World No. 1. A 16-time tour-level champion, Gasquet reached a career-high World No. 7 and holds the record for the most wins (610) among Frenchmen in the Open Era.

The reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, Sinner set a third-round meeting with Jiri Lehcka, whom he leads 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Lehecka overcame Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 to advance to the third round at Roland Garros for the first time in his career.

After recording straight-sets wins against Arthur Rinderknech in the first round and Gasquet in the second, Sinner improved to 18-5 at Roland Garros, where he notably reached last year's semi-final before falling to rival Carlos Alcaraz in a physical five-set tussle. The 23-year-old is aiming to become the first Italian men's singles champion in the Open Era after Adriano Panatta in 1976.

“It's obviously a very special place for me to play,” added Sinner, who also beat Gasquet in Paris last year. “Against Richard, we already played last year here, it's always very tough. I'm generally very happy to be in the third round. Thank you guys for making it fair.”

There were moments of magic from Gasquet, who used his vintage one-handed backhand to carve out three break points when Sinner served out the first set at 5-3, sparking raucous cheers from the French fans on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Yet Sinner saved all three, according to Infosys Stats, and did not face another en route to a commanding victory.

Stefanos Tsitsipas suffered another shocking Grand Slam defeat at the 2025 French Open.

The Greek star began the year with a tough defeat in Melbourne, when Tsitsipas lost to Alex Michelsen in the first round of the Australian Open.

He would no doubt have expected a far better showing in Paris for the second Grand Slam of 2025, having reached the final of the French Open just four years ago.

Things started well, as Tsitsipas beat Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry in his opening match, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.

Taking on qualifier Matteo Gigante in his second-round match, Tsitsipas was stunned in four sets, 4-6, 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, suffering his earliest exit in the French capital since 2018.

After such a tough defeat, it was clear Tsitsipas had some big decisions to make, and it looks like he hasn't wasted any time in doing so.

It has now been reported that the 26-year-old will be hiring a former Wimbledon champion to his coaching team, as he looks to surge back up the rankings.

Greek media outlet SDNA has reported that Tsitsipas is set to bring in 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic as his coach.

Ivanisevic is expected to act as Tsitsipas' head coach and will begin working with the world number 20 next week.

Their collaboration will initially begin as a trial, with their first tournament together set to be the Halle Open, which begins on June 16.

Ivanisevic has real pedigree as a coach, leading both Marin Cilic and Novak Djokovic to Grand Slam success.

Winning his first Major title as a coach, Ivanisevic worked with his fellow Croat, Cilic, at the 2014 US Open, where he took down Roger Federer and Kei Nishikori en route to the title.

Splitting with Cilic in 2016, Ivanisevic enjoyed short stints with Tomas Berdych and Milos Raonic before joining Djokovic's team in 2019.

Working together, Ivanisevic and Djokovic won nine Grand Slam titles before parting ways in March 2024.

The 53-year-old then briefly ventured into coaching on the WTA Tour alongside Elena Rybakina, joining her team ahead of the 2025 season.

Their partnership was short-lived, however, as Ivanisevic departed Rybakina's team shortly after the Australian Open.

Returning to coaching with Tsitsipas, Ivanisevic will be determined to help steady the ship, as the Greek star continues to tumble down the rankings.

Tsitsipas began 2025 with ambitions of returning to the top of the men's game, competing for the sport's biggest titles.

Winning just two of his first five matches this year, things weren't looking good for the former world number three before he made a bold move ahead of the Dubai Tennis Championships.

Tsitsipas changed his racket ahead of the tournament, a decision that quickly paid off as he won the first ATP 500 title of his career.

Many expected the win would propel Tsitsipas to great things, but he soon began to struggle for form once more.

Barring a solid showing in Monte-Carlo, where Tsitsipas lost to Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals, he failed to make a real impact on the clay.

Holding a 3-3 record across his three latest tournaments, the Madrid Open, Italian Open, and French Open, Tsitsipas is set to fall well outside of the world's top 20 when the next set of rankings are released.

With that in mind, it was clearly time for a change, as fans of the Greek now wait to see whether the wisdom of Ivanisevic can guide Tsitsipas back to the top ten.

Tennis

Two-time Grand Slam finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas has hired former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanišević as his new coach.

Ivanišević, 53, will join Tsitsipas' team from the start of the Halle Open in Germany, for a trial period. Tsitsipas' father, Apostolos, who has been in his coaching box at recent events, will not be part of his coaching team at least initially, according to a report in Greek outlet SDNA. A representative for Ivanišević confirmed this element of the partnership to The Athletic, and said that Ivanišević will work full-time with Tsitsipas for a substantial number of weeks per year. Ivanišević believes Tsitsipas should be in the world's top 10 and has always got on well with him when their paths have crossed on tour.

Tsitsipas later confirmed the “new coaching partnership” on social media.

Tsitsipas, who will leave the the world's top 20 for the first time since August 2018 when the rankings update a week on Monday, has had a difficult couple of years and has brought on Novak Djokovic's former coach to try and arrest the slide. He most recently exited the French Open in the second round, losing to Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante Wednesday.

Afterward, Tsitsipas spoke about how he is struggling to keep up with the demands of the tour, and how he has suffered physically in the aftermath of picking up injuries over the last few years. “It's a constant puzzle,” he said in a news conference.

“Things have definitely changed over the last couple of years, and I know that I find myself in a completely different position now. ”

Tsitsipas, 26, has spent much of the last year trying to rediscover the form and love for tennis that made him look like a potential Grand Slam champion when he burst onto the scene seven years ago. In August 2024, he took the radical step of removing his father from his coaching team after a surprise defeat to Japan's Kei Nishikori, then the world No. 576, in Montreal.

Tsitsipas said he was “disappointed” in his father's work in a news conference after that loss.

“I need and I deserve a coach that listens to me and hears my feedback as a player. My father hasn't been very smart or very good at handling those situations,” he said.

Tsitsipas has since worked with Greece's Davis Cup captain, Dimitris Chatzinikolaou. He also switched rackets in search of a winning formula, but could not say what the new one was for contractual reasons. The profile — and an uncovered logo seen on a stringing machine in Dubai — suggested a Babolat Pure Aero 98 model. But at the French Open, he returned to the Wilson frame, after experiencing back pain using the newer racket on the clay.

His 2025 results have largely remained underwhelming — save for winning February's Dubai Tennis Championships in the United Arab Emirates — as he seeks a return to the early days of his career, when he thrilled the tennis world with his flair and shotmaking ability.

When he returned to clay, which is his preferred surface, Tsitsipas suffered a disappointing quarterfinal loss to Lorenzo Musetti at the Monte Carlo Masters in Monaco. Tsitsipas was defending champion and had won the event three times in four years; the lost ranking points attached to the defeat saw Tsitsipas tumble to his lowest position for almost seven years. He then lost to Musetti again at the Madrid Open, before losing to Arthur Fils at the Italian Open in Rome.

As a coach, 2001 Wimbledon champion Ivanišević is best known for the six seasons he spent with Novak Djokovic, in which the Serb won 12 Grand Slam titles. They split in March 2024. Ivanišević then briefly worked with fellow Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina at the start of 2025, but they parted following her fourth-round exit at the Australian Open.

The split came after it became clear that Rybakina was still working with her previous coach, Stefano Vukov. Vukov has since been given a one-year ban by the WTA for breaching its code of conduct with his behavior, which chief executive Portia Archer described as amounting to “engaging in abuse of authority and abusive conduct.”

It's felt as though Tsitsipas has been searching for his tennis identity ever since Carlos Alcaraz thrashed him at the 2022 French Open.

“I do need a bit more of that Tsitsipas in my game. I'm trying to reinvent myself with that fearlessness,” he told The Athletic a month after being beaten 6-2, 6-1, 7-6(5) by a 19-year-old Alcaraz, referring to the early part of his career.

Being pummelled by the next big thing in men's tennis, having held and then lost that title himself, hurt Tsitsipas. It was the first of several visceral reminders that the Greek, who lost his two major finals to Djokovic, has been stalled not just by the ‘Big Three' of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, but also the ascendant Alcaraz and now Jannik Sinner. Tsitsipas has found himself confined to an awkward spot somewhere just below the very top, along with fellow “sandwich generation” members like Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev — though Medvedev has claimed the major title that has eluded the other two.

As he approaches his 27th birthday in August, it makes sense for Tsitsipas to try something different. He's worked with Australian Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis before, but bringing on a coach of Ivanišević's stature feels like a significant shakeup. Ivanišević too will relish this opportunity, after a difficult period working with Rybakina and the end of what was a very successful but at times volatile partnership with Djokovic.

Like Tsitsipas, Ivanišević lost his first two Grand Slam finals. He then lost a third, but finally won at the fourth time of asking by claiming the 2001 Wimbledon title. Tsistipas has not reached the semifinals of a major since he lost to Djokovic in Melbourne just over two years ago.

Ivanišević also has pedigree as a coach in guiding someone from outside the top echelons of the rankings to a major title, doing so in 2014 with Marin Čilić, who was the No. 14 seed when he won the U.S. Open, beating Federer en route to the final against Nishikori.

Tsitsipas will be desperate for a similar uptick in his fortunes. He has the talent to climb back into the world's top 10 — he was ranked as high as No. 3 in 2021 — but his backhand has long hamstrung him away from clay, particularly when returning serve. Ivanišević is also one of the best servers in the history of the sport, especially on grass, and he'll hope to lift Tsitsipas in that area too.

If Ivanišević can tighten some of the aspects where Tsitsipas has been struggling, and help with the mental side of how to go from nearly man to champion, then men's tennis could have one of its most exciting players back on song.

Emma Raducanu faced a tough defeat against Iga Swiatek, highlighting the areas she needs to work on to elevate her game. Despite the setback, Raducanu remains determined and far from demotivated.

The British No 2 expressed the challenges of playing on Court Philippe-Chatrier for the first time, emphasizing her discomfort in the unfamiliar surroundings. However, Raducanu sees this experience as a valuable lesson for future matches on the prestigious court.

Looking ahead, Raducanu is focused on the upcoming grass-court season, with tournaments lined up at Queen's Club and Berlin before Wimbledon. Despite the recent defeat, she remains optimistic and motivated to continue her progress on the court.

Raducanu's journey in the tennis world continues to unfold, with fans eagerly anticipating her next moves as she strives for success in the sport.

PARIS − Mirra Andreeva underlined her claycourt credentials again at the French Open when the Russian teenager methodically took apart Ashlyn Krueger, and third seed Jessica Pegula also moved into the third round on Thursday.

Andreeva, a surprise Roland Garros semi-finalist in 2024, confirmed her calibre on the sport's slowest surface with runs to the Madrid and Rome quarter-finals this season, and she had to be at her inventive best to beat the powerful Krueger 6-3, 6-4.

The 18-year-old sixth seed found herself an early break down on Court Simonne Mathieu but fought back to secure the first set, before mixing up her game with exquisite sliced forehands in the next to see off her American opponent.

""This match wasn't easy, I'd lost to her at the U.S. Open,"" Andreeva said, reflecting on her second-round defeat by Krueger in New York last August.

""She's a powerful and aggressive player. I knew I had to play well ... I suffered and struggled with my serve, but I'm happy I found a way to stay calm.

""I pushed myself to fight until the end.""

Pegula, Krueger's frequent doubles partner this season and French Open third seed, had to battle hard against fellow American Ann Li but found her best level when it mattered to prevail 6-3, 7-6(3) in windy conditions.

Up next for the 2024 U.S. Open runner-up is former Paris finalist Marketa Vondrousova, after the Czech sent 25th seed Magdalena Frech packing 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.

On the men's side, Vondrousova's compatriot Jiri Lehecka took out Spanish 26th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 while Kazakh Alexander Bublik upset Australian ninth seed Alex De Minaur 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.

Three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic continues his bid for more history and a record 25th Grand Slam trophy when he plays Frenchman Corentin Moutet later on Thursday.

Top seed Jannik Sinner resumes his hunt for a maiden title on Parisian clay when he meets another local favourite in Richard Gasquet, who will retire when his campaign at his home Grand Slam comes to an end.

Mark Petchey believes that tennis has ‘changed massively' in the last four years

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Emma Raducanu's coach Mark Petchey has warned her that tennis has moved on since she won the US Open four years ago.

British No 2 Raducanu was dismantled 6-1 6-2 by reigning champion Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday.

It was a slight improvement on her 6-1 6-0 thrashing by Swiatek at the Australian Open, but the 22-year-old has won just one of her nine career matches against top-five players and was also trounced 6-1 6-2 by world No 2 Coco Gauff in Rome earlier this month.

Petchey, who is also working as a pundit for TNT Sports' coverage of Roland Garros, has told Raducanu – currently ranked 41 – that she cannot afford to live in the past if she wants to climb back into the top 20.

“Since I started helping Emma, I said she needs to start closing the gap between the best players,” said Petchey, who started working with Raducanu on an informal basis in March.

“She doesn't need me to sit between 20-50 in the world and, if I'm not the best choice, she needs to find the best choice.

“On this court Iga has 23 straight wins – you don't put those streaks together at a major if your game isn't so difficult to play against. It was clearly going to be the ultimate test for Emma yesterday.

“From my point of view, it's tough on Emma as I still feel everyone is living in 2021. The games have changed massively, the balls are four times heavier than back in 2021 and Emma isn't the biggest hitter out there.

“If you can't put the ball through the court on a windy, heavy clay court day against someone like Iga, you're going to get into all sorts of trouble.

“On hard courts and grass is a lot closer compared to where Emma was in Australia against Iga, but against Iga and Coco, she knows what she has to do and it will take a long time.

“My mantra to her has been ‘you are starting your career now. Everyone is judging you on what happened in 2021 but the reality is, I want to see you building a career here where people judge you in two years'.”

Raducanu arrived in Paris with more concerns about her fitness, but Petchey has hit back at those who doubt her work ethic.

“I'm a little tired of hearing people say that she doesn't work hard, but I spent 10 months with her in 2020 and I've spent every day that I can with her since Miami, and not once has she not put in a full day shift,” he added.

“(Maybe) there are areas that, together, we can help her crystallise more gains in fitness, or tennis, or whatever, but in terms of turning up every day and putting in a good shift, she's done it every single time. So, I'd like to bury that myth where it belongs.”

Robin Montgomery is not leaving Paris early.

The 20-year-old American, who is appearing in her first-ever French Open main draw, secured her place in the second round by sending home-hero Diane Parry home with a 6-2, 6-1 win on Monday.

Montgomery dominated during the contest, winning five of her seven break points, dropping just three games and serving down five aces in her win.

It's a victory she'll hope she can use to elevate her status at Roland Garros as as she continues to climb up the rankings.

Up next for her is Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who recently dismantled World No.9 and fellow American Emma Navarro.

They are set to face off on Court 12 on Thursday at around 11:10am BST (6:10am ET).

The US sensation is ranked 115 in the world and made her debut five years ago as a 15-year-old at the US Open. Since then she's amassed over a million dollars in prize money.

Montgomery is well known within the American tennis scene, catching the eye when she won the US Open junior singles title in 2021.

She followed that victory up a few hours later with the junior doubles title when she and partner Ashlyn Krueger defeated Reese Brantmeier and Elvina Kalieva in three sets.

It meant she became the first person to win both titles in New York since Michaëlla Krajicek in 2004.

Montgomery first began to make some noise on the professional tour in 2023.

She was able to qualify for the Austin Open early that year and also earned her first WTA 1000 win when she defeated Ana Bogdan.

In 2024, she faced her toughest challenge yet and one that she still remembers to this day. 

It was Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of the Miami Open.

It took Sabalenka two-and-a-half hours to beat Montgomery, edging her in a 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-4 victory and one that demonstrated to the then-teen where her level was at.

""It was a very close match, and it kind of opened my eyes a little bit of where my level is and what I can actually do,"" Montgomery told Clay Tennis.

""I was pretty p*****!! Knowing that I was that close and it was just a few shots here and there that cost me the match… didn't feel great.""

She even admitted to crying after that loss as she described how devastating it was to come so close to winning.

""I was crying! I called my childhood coach and he was like ‘relax' and I'm like ‘no, screw this'. But yeah, it was a stinger, but it does happen for a reason,"" she added.

""It's gruesome I would say. She hits the ball very big, very hard and you have to always be ready for anything. When you play against her it sometimes feels like you're already on defense even before the point starts. It's very tough, she's a top player. The best nowadays.""

Montgomery is also friends with fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff, saying she grew up with the 2023 US Open winner.

""We are friends! When we see each other at tournaments we talk, we go out to dinner, that's pretty much it, but I'd say we're friends,"" she said.

""We grew up together, both chasing similar goals since young. I've known her since I was 9, we had our first USTA camp together, so we've known each other for a long time.""

Montgomery will be focused on forging her own path in tennis, and this year's French Open gives her that chance.

The added bonus is that it's on a surface she enjoys playing on.

""I do have good results on clay. So I probably enjoy it and play better than most American players on clay."" Montgomery said.

PARIS - Montrea's Gabriel Diallo is out of the French Open following a 7-5, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 6-3 loss to Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands in second-round action Thursday.

Diallo came back from 4-1 down in the second set and had a chance to break and go up 5-4, but Griekspoor held with back-to-back aces and won five straight points in the tiebreak to take a 2-0 lead in the match.

After Diallo dominated the third set, the 35th-ranked Griekspoor broke early in the fourth before serving to love in the final game.

The 23-year-old Diallo, who entered the French Open one spot off his career high at No. 54, won his first-ever match at the clay court Grand Slam when he upset No. 18 Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina in straight sets in the first round.

Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., the last Canadian in the men's singles draw, was scheduled to face Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic later Thursday.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Stefanos Tsitsipas had been struggling for a few years already, but Wednesday he definitely hit rock bottom. While his 2023 (post-Australian Open final loss) and 2024 seasons were pretty rough, he still had strong clay seasons despite struggling elsewhere; he made several deep runs at Masters 1000, winning Monte Carlo even, and only lost to Carlos Alcaraz at the French Open.

This year, however, he started by losing his stranglehold on Monte Carlo against Lorenzo Musetti in what he described as “the second toughest loss of my career” and he has only been spiraling down further since. Even so, no one really though he would lose to a qualifier at Roland Garros, but he got completely outplayed by Matteo Gigante and was absolutely horrible on break points, both for and against him, showing how much he's lacking in confident on the court. With this loss, Tsitsipas, who just two years ago was a match away from becoming World #1, will exit the Top 25 and his career is clearly at a crossroads as it seems that he can't even be a threat on clay anymore.

The only silver lining for Tsitsipas at the moment is that he will be working with Goran Ivanisevic after this tournament; maybe a new coach with a fresh perspective is what Tsitsipas needs to get his career back on track but it remains to be seen whether that will truly materialize. When he won the title in Dubai, it looked like he was back to his level, but the clay season showed it to be a false dawn. At 26 years old, Tsitsipas still had a long time ahead of him to change his fate, but there are also more and more young players who are capable of beating him; if Tsitsipas doesn't make some big changes very soon, his days as a contender for big events might well be numbered.

Top-seeded Jannik Sinner put an end to Richard Gasquet's professional career with a 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 decision on Thursday in the second round of the French Open in Paris.

The 23-year-old Italian dispatched the 38-year-old Frenchman in one hour, 58 minutes at Roland Garros. Sinner also bounced Gasquet from the French Open last year.

""It's obviously a very special place for me to play and against Richard,"" Sinner said. ""We played last year too. It's very tough but I'm happy to be in the third round.""

Sinner's victory was his 16th in a row in a Grand Slam, making him the first man born in 1990 or later to accomplish the feat.

""We have a good relationship off the court. We are different generations, but it's your moment,"" Sinner said to Gasquet. ""Congrats to your family, to your team. Without great people around each player, it's impossible to make such an incredible career. You played in such an incredible era of tennis and everyone will recognize you, even after your retirement.""

Gasquet, a 16-time winner on the ATP Tour, told the L'Equipe newspaper in October that he will bid adieu in front of his home fans at Roland Garros.

Known for his sensational, one-handed backhand, Gasquet reached a career-high ranking of No. 7.

Gasquet never won a Grand Slam singles title, however, going as far as the semifinals twice at Wimbledon (2007, 2015) and once at the U.S. Open (2013). His best showing at the French Open was a quarterfinal appearance in 2016.

While Gasquet's 23-year career comes to a close, Sinner will return to the court to face Jiri Lehecka in the third round. The Czech posted a 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over 26th-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain.

Also on Thursday, third-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany rebounded from a first-set misstep to notch a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 win over Jesper De Jong of the Netherlands. Zverev had 43 winners and broke De Jong's serve seven times to win the match in three hours.

Fourteenth-seeded Frenchman Arthur Fills survived a scare -- as well as a back injury -- by posting a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 victory over Jaume Munar of Spain. The marathon match lasted four hours, 25 minutes.

Ninth-seeded Alex de Minaur of Australia and 19th-seeded Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic weren't as fortunate. Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik fought his way back for a 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory over de Minaur, while Portugal's Henrique Rocha did the same in a 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Mensik.

Bublik and Rocha will square off against each other in the third round.

Tennis photographer Corinne Dubreuil vividly recalls working a junior tournament in Blois in July 1995 for France's Tennis Magazine. The reporter on site with her rushed over with news of an impressive nine-year-old.

“My colleague came to me and said ‘Corinne, Corinne, you have to come to Court 3 and see this little guy',” Dubreuil said. “He's so amazing. He has a one-handed backhand. Crazy, crazy.”

Dubreuil took some photos of the young player and like her colleague was impressed. They spoke of the player to their superiors at the publication, who contacted the boy's family and decided to produce a full report, which turned into a cover story.

The boy's name was Richard Gasquet.

Early in 1996, Dubreuil visited the Frenchman in Sérignan, located in the south of France, to photograph him at home and document him playing tennis and at the beach. She took a famous portrait of Gasquet sitting in his bedroom with posters of the ATP Tour's biggest stars surrounding him. 

Across two walls were legends including Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, as well as Frenchmen Guy Forget, Henri Leconte and Marc Rosset. Little did Gasquet know one day he would become an international star, too.

A post shared by Richard Gasquet (@richardgasquet34)

The February 1996 edition of Tennis Magazine featured a striking cover in which the phenom was winding up to unleash a one-handed backhand. The headline read: “Le champion que la France attend?” In English, that means: “The champion that France is waiting for?”

That was a massive amount of pressure for a nine-year-old. There was no guarantee Gasquet would pursue tennis for a career, let alone become a professional. But over the next three decades he became one of the best players in the history of French tennis. 

Gasquet's backhand turned into one of the most feared shots in the sport and no matter how the Frenchman performs this Roland Garros — after which he will retire — his game will be remembered for generations to come. 

In 1999, Gasquet won the prestigious Les Petits As international junior tournament in France, and three years later he became the No. 1 junior in the world as a 16-year-old. But the first major splash the Frenchman made came earlier that year, when he won his ATP Tour debut at the 2002 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters as a 15-year-old. 

Gasquet defeated former World No. 11 Franco Squillari 7-6(5), 3-6, 7-5 to become the youngest match winner in the history of the Tour (since 1990). Nobody has broken his record since.

Watch Highlights:

Even aged 15, the Frenchman's talent was clear. As was the case for the next 23 years, Gasquet was already crafting jaw-dropping backhands according to Squillari.

“My crosscourt forehand was my best shot and I thought before [the match] I would do my best with his backhand and his backhand was unbelievable,” Squillari told ATPTour.com. “He [did not make] a mistake more than three hours from his backhand. Okay, I [then] played to his forehand and from his forehand he didn't make a mistake, too. He's a very complete player.”

The 16-time ATP Tour titlist became known for his artistic game, creating unthinkable angles with his one-handed backhand and playing aggressively with his forehand when he needed to. The Frenchman was as meticulous with his strategy as he was with his grip, which he redid at nearly every changeover, more than anyone else on the ATP Tour.

Gasquet first broke into the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings on 29 September 2023, shortly after his 17th birthday. From 18 April 2005 through 14 January 2024, he spent nearly 19 consecutive years inside the Top 100.

The 38-year-old has earned 609 tour-level wins, more than any Frenchman on record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Two years ago, after earning his 600th win to join Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray as the fourth active player to reach the milestone (Nadal and Murray have since retired), Gasquet joked, ""Of course I'm the worst by far!"" 

Most Wins By A Frenchman




A three-time major semi-finalist and a three-time ATP Masters 1000 finalist, the only thing that prevented Gasquet from claiming titles at the biggest events was competing against the likes of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer. All six of his losses in those critical matches came against one of those three players. The Frenchman defeated Djokovic and Federer in his career, but lost all 18 of his Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Nadal.

“He was very close in the beginning of his career with Nadal,” Squillari said. “But unfortunately, Nadal was one of the best of four or five players on Tour in history. That was not good news for Richard.” 

When Squillari lost to a 15-year-old Gasquet, it was difficult to take as a former World No. 11. But time has shown that the teen turned into a star, who climbed to a career-high World No. 7.

“He [won] more than 600 matches. I lost against one of the [biggest] players on Tour,” Squillari said. “If you lost in the French Open against [Michael] Chang [when he was] only 16 years, 20 years after you say ‘Okay, it was not too bad'. And I say now, it was not too bad.”



Gasquet recently appeared on the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, named because the four American former professional players who host it never won a major. They joked that Gasquet fit in with them, unless he wins Roland Garros over the coming fortnight.

“Zero chance,” Gasquet said, cracking a laugh. “But if there is a non-major [list] as you do, I think I would be seeded, I would be Top 10.”

The son of a father who ran a local tennis club made history in his first tour-level event and will also do so in his last tournament. By competing in Roland Garros this year, he sets the new Open-Era record for main-draw appearances in the tournament.

“It's the end, maybe the last match of your career. Hard to say,” Gasquet said of his expecations of the moment. “It's special, but I'm happy to do this, I'm happy to play here one last time. I'm practically 39 years old. I never thought I was going to be playing such a long time.

“I'm lucky enough to be able to do it here one last time. I know what that represents, to play in a tournament like this. So I'm going to try to enjoy it from beginning to end and give my all. It's sport. You never know what's going to happen.”

France hoped a nine-year-old Gasquet would turn into a champion, and that he did.

Much has been made of exactly where this year's McLaren is deriving its advantage from – and there's been a lot of focus on how well it controls its rear tyre temperatures and the part the car's brake duct design plays in that.

But an advantage in F1 is very rarely about just one golden feature and is invariably about how well designed and integrated the whole car is.

He played the creepy Chucky character in the 1988 ‘Child's Play' movie and its 1990 sequel.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Ed Gale, best known for playing Chucky, a doll possessed by a serial killer, in Child's Play and other infamous 1980s movie characters, has died. He was 61.


	Gale's niece Kayse Gale on Facebook addressed the passing of her uncle, who was about 3-foot-4, on Tuesday in Los Angeles. She did not specify a cause of death.




	“It is with a heavy heart and a surprisingly light coffin (see what I did there?) that we announce the sudden passing of our uncle, Ed Gale,” she wrote. “Ed Gale has taken his final bow and is now headlining in the afterlife. Ed hitched a ride to California when he was twenty years old, with $41 and a dream, and he never looked back.

	“Over the course of his career he appeared in over 130 movies, TV shows, and commercials. With this wide ranging body of work, he leaves behind legacy full of questionable lighting and amazing one-liners.”

	Besides his star turn in the 1988's original Child's Play movie, Gale also worked in the 1990 sequel. But his big break in Hollywood came with the 1986 Universal comedy adventure film Howard the Duck, where he was cast as a Howard suit performer, while Chip Zien voiced the character.  


	“I was very excited to get the role, but I had no idea who Howard the Duck was or that he was a Marvel comic book character. Yes, I was in the suit every day for nearly 10 months. I was the only actor who played the role of Howard the Duck,” Gale recalled in a 2018 interview with Rediscover the 80s.  

	











	Gale also appeared in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs and Chopper Chicks in Zombietown.


	Born on Aug. 23, 1963 in Plainwell, Michigan, Gale traveled across the country before he landed in Hollywood. After earlier breakout roles, he worked on Mom and Dad Save the World, with Teri Garr, The Little Rascals and Wes Craven's New Nightmare in the 1990s.


	His other credits included Unstrung Heroes, where he appeared opposite Andie MacDowell, the George Clooney crime drama O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Mikeyboy in 2013.

Pete Davidson discovers the  elderly residents and caretakers in a quiet retirement home are keeping chilling secrets that leads to brutal violence in the trailer for Lionsgate's The Home, which dropped on Thursday.


	The Saturday Night Live alum plays Max, a young man sentenced to community service and caring for the elderly in the retirement facility, only to come in contact with the off-limits fourth floor, where residents are in need of “special care.”




	“There's something very wrong with this place,” an elderly woman tells Max at one point in the trailer. Before long, Max is screaming for help and facing a bizarre medical experiment and bloody violence in the nightmarish retirement home.

	Director James DeMonaco in a statement said of the horror thriller: “When I set out to create The Home, I aimed to capture the spine-chilling eeriness of 70's horror, where suspense simmers and ultimately erupts into glorious chaos. Joining me is my Staten Island brother, Pete Davidson, who unveils a darker, dramatic side as his character navigates a bizarre group of residents in an old age home. The growing tension culminates in an epic blood-soaked finale, designed to leave audiences gasping, terrified, and cheering. I can't wait for everyone to visit The Home. Cover your eyes, folks.”

	











	DeMonaco and Adam Canto wrote The Home, with Bill Block and Sebastian K. Lemercier producing.

The actor was sitting courtside at the fourth game of the Knicks vs. Pacers playoffs, alongside Chalamet and Spike Lee.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Ben Stiller didn't think Pat McAfee's comments about him at the Knicks game were all that funny.


	The actor-producer-director, who's also a diehard Knicks fan, was sitting courtside at the fourth game of the Knicks-Pacers Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday, alongside Timothée Chalamet and Spike Lee. At the beginning of the game, The Pat McAfee Show host took the microphone to deliver a message to fellow Pacer fans, calling out some of the “bigwigs from the big city” visiting the Indianapolis, Indiana, arena.




	“Spike Lee is here. Ben Stiller is here. Timothée Chalamet is here,” McAfee told the crowd, as they booed after each name, before he screamed: “Let's send these sons of bitches back to New York with their ears bleeding.”

	After the game, which saw the Pacers beat the Knicks 130-121, Stiller took to X (formerly Twitter) to reply to some videos of McAfee's speech. “Yes. Weird. We were happy to be there and cheer our team and other than that Indy fans were awesome. #KNICKSIN7,” the Zoolander star wrote.

Yes. Weird. We were happy to be there and cheer our team and other than that Indy fans were awesome.👏 #KNICKSIN7


	Stiller added in another reply, “It's ok. He must be playing around – if it's an actual point of view it seems a little anachronistic or cliche? Like we are ‘big city celebs' and we shouldn't be there in the heartland? Again, everyone we met was awesome and incredibly cool.”


	When another X user told him, “Don't be bitter,” the Severance exec producer clarified, “No bitterness at all Indy fans were amazing good win for you guys.”

	Two years ago this month, the Writers Guild of America went on strike for, among other key issues, a set of landmark AI protections to safeguard our writing and our finished work. It took six months of sustained solidarity, picketing and an outpouring of public support — everyone from fellow unions, politicians and yes, even Elon Musk — before the studios finally met our demands. 


	Today, writers, journalists and creatives across every medium are facing a new kind of existential threat to their professions from the interests of Silicon Valley. Tech companies have been openly lobbying the White House to rewrite copyright law to freely train their models on films, television shows, articles, books and beyond without paying so much as a dime to studios, publishers or writers. OpenAI has been referring to this as “the freedom to learn.” In New Jersey, it's just called theft.

	Three weeks ago, Shira Perlmutter, the Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, was fired shortly after publishing a new report on Generative AI Training. The release advocated for preserving current copyright law and signaled a setback for Sam Altman's craven attempt to expand the Fair Use doctrine into a smash and grab campaign on decades of copyrighted material. In other words, tech companies cannot use stolen intellectual property in their models.

	In the meantime, dozens of ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini) and Meta (Llama) making their way through the courts. Without a sympathetic judge willing to distort fair use, these companies could find themselves liable in billions of theft, potentially even more in damages, and in some cases, face total bankruptcy. 

	











	But we've been down this road before with Napster. The company launched as a free file-sharing app in 1999. Almost overnight people around the world could download entire music libraries in seconds. It was a groundbreaking use of technology that, at the time, felt too good to be true. And that's because it was. Napster was quickly sued out of existence for copyright infringement and racketeering.


	Since then, every major media tech platforms — YouTube, Spotify and even OpenAI until recently — have been making deals with studios, publishers and labels to compensate them for using their copyrighted work. While many of these agreements have been deeply flawed and exploitive, the firing of Shira Perlmutter represents a pivot to something much worse. 


	Silicon Valley is now asking the government for permission to steal our copyright in order to escape their pending lawsuits. They are knowingly trying to de-value our professions and countless others in order to freely enrich themselves without caring about the consequences. 


	In the case of screenwriters, copyright of an original script is sold to the studios in exchange for core benefits like health care, pension and residuals. This is one of the bedrock principles that has helped sustain writers during the highs and lows of this business. But if copyright protections were to be stripped away, then so begins the unraveling of the entire value proposition that union members past and present have fought so hard to maintain in the film and television industry.

	











	In April, Sam Altman appeared on stage with Chris Anderson, the head of TED, who pointed out, “At first glance, this (ChatGPT) looks like I.P. theft.” The audience erupted in applause until Sam fired back, “Clap about that all you want. Enjoy.” And then Sam said something far more revealing, “We do need to figure out some new model around the economics for compensating creative output. Exactly what that looks like I'm not sure.” 


	But the copyright system isn't broken. Companies like OpenAI simply don't want to negotiate consent and pay. So, Sam can shrug about “the economics for compensating creative output” all he wants. Enjoy. 


	The solution will always be the same. Stop stealing writers work and follow the law.

With new single ""THUNDER"" and collaborations with Pharrell and Timbaland, the group celebrates a decade together with genre explorations and solo tracks.


													By
												

	Jeff Benjamin



	From captivating Billboard upon their debut as the unexpectedly large 13-member boy band to now setting new Boxscore records for K-pop acts, SEVENTEEN is throwing a party to celebrate their 10th anniversary. The group marks the triumphant milestone with the new album, Happy Burstday, which captures every facet of their decade-long K-pop evolution while initiating a new chapter for the band in its next decade.


	From the explosive rock-infused roar of the opening track “HBD” to the declarative dance-pop single “THUNDER,” the LP makes the bold claim that SEVENTEEN isn't just celebrating the past but charging headfirst like a buffalo into new territory. For the first time, each member delivers a solo spotlight across 13 brand-new tracks — a true testament to their individual strengths — while still coming together for three new group tracks, including the all-English cut “Bad Influence,” produced by Pharrell Williams.


	Along with Pharrell in the mix, Happy Burstday lets the SEVENTEEN members write and produce songs with their longtime creative collaborators such as Bumzu and Shannon Bae, while also welcoming new names like Timbaland, BTS‘ longtime producer PDogg and K-indie singer Ha Hyunsang, among others. Whether delicate piano ballads or gritty club cuts, the solo songs reveal fresh dimensions of S.Coups, Woozi, Hoshi, Jeonghan, Wonwoo, Joshua, DK, Jun, Mingyu, The 8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino‘s talents as individual artists and creators — and further underscore the momentousness of this milestone record.


	As SEVENTEEN celebrate a decade together with these 16 new groups and solo tracks, here are Billboard's rankings of all the songs across Happy Burstday.


	One of the most exciting aspects of a SEVENTEEN album listening experience is the experimentation showcased throughout the records. Making a surprise premiere during January's Louis Vuitton Fall/Winter 2025 runway show, Pharrell Williams debuted the collaboration, which was finally released in its official form five months later. “Bad Influence” is a low-pitched, bass-heavy ode to living without worries as the album's only all-English track.


	It's unusually understated for a group that has some of the most bombastic and impactful singles, not to mention Pharrell's Grammy-winning body of work. While we're all for the Pharrell x SVT linkup — and the song is no doubt a bop and a half — the change up to a subtle sound might have been a little too unexpected and we'd like to hear them all go back into the studio soon.


	One of the most unexpected genre jumps on Happy Burstday, “99.9%” lets rapper Wonwoo try on a throwback jazz concept complete with twinkling piano, crisp percussion, and bold brass horns. The sweet, confessional track reminds us that the rapper is capable of far more music beyond the Hip-Hop Unit's signature sound and that he's got a soft side delivering Korean lyrics that translate to cute lines like: “You'd say, ‘Am I really that special?'/ Smiling while hiding your heart/ But my heart is already at 100%/ So don't worry — I'm sure.” 100% swoon-worthy.


	While the timing of Wonwoo's mandatory military enlistment this year may have prevented him from participating in creating the track (with Woozi writing and help co-compose the song), we're eager to hear Wonwoo's full work on future solo tracks.


	While it's every Carat's dream to go clubbing with Mingyu, his dance-ready rap track is a fun shift for the rapper-singer-model; however, we don't get to hear nearly enough of him throughout, as the production takes over large parts of the song. However, this may have been a deliberate choice, as Mingyu flexes his production skills, credited as a co-composer of “Shake It Off” alongside rising hip-hop producer ioah.


	Still, we want more Mingyu! And as evidenced by global campaigns for brands like Calvin Klein and Innisfree, as well as recent appointments as brand ambassadors for Dior and Snickers, the world does, too.


	As the first member of SEVENTEEN to enlist in his mandatory military service, Jeonghan's voice returning to listeners through such a lovely, gospel-inspired ballad track makes the track all the more special. And it's no “Coincidence” that Jeonghan perfectly embodies this track with his emotional delivery enhancing such a delicate piece.


	Once again, likely due to his military enlistment last year, Jeonghan did not participate in the writing or production of this track, but it makes us all the more eager to hear what he creates when he releases more of his own solo music.


	DK's “Happy Virus” might be the most perfectly titled solo track as the vocalist with the big grin takes this light-rock/pop to deliver lines like, “I'll be there for you…smile, smile, smile” in a song that's sure to infect listeners with the all the fuzzy, warm feelings.


	The subtle country influences on the track make it another unforeseen genre exploration on Happy Burstday, pairing well with DK's messages of wanting to help heal and protect one's smile.


	It's wild to think SEVENTEEN's youngest member Dino, who debuted with the group when he was only 16, is now an adult, whipping out mature songs like “Trigger,” co-crafted by BIGHIT MUSIC producer Pdogg. We get to truly hear his growth as a vocalist through the falsetto-heavy chorus, which feels like a genuine declaration that Dino is no longer a baby.


	“Skyfall” is the first of the SEVENTEEN members' solo tracks in Happy Burstday‘s tracklist with THE 8 kicking the energy back up after the Pharrell Williams–produced “Bad Influence.” Subtle electronica beats surround THE 8's light delivery before booming 808s, hard synthesizers, and bustling breakbeats enter the mix, creating a euphoric blend that represents the singer-dancer-model's hope to let go and drift like a feather.


	In a cool nod to his crossover appeal, “Skyfall” includes lyrics in Korean, English and THE8's native Chinese.


	Beyond the excitement surrounding three new group songs and a solo track from each member, the biggest surprise when SEVENTEEN revealed its Happy Burstday tracklist had to have been the featured guest appearance from Timbaland on Hoshi's track, “Damage.” The track opens with a funky bassline hook that screams classic Timbaland with the Performance Unit leader introducing the track by announcing himself and SEVENTEEN's main producing member with “Hoshi, baby/ Prod. by Woozi and…” before Mr. Mosley drops his signature “Timbo” tag.


	With contributions from Hoshi, Woozi, Timbaland, and some of his go-to collaborators such as Angel “BabeTruth” Lopez and Federico Vindver, “Damage” feels like a balanced mix of the two artists' worlds. We would to see each side push the other into a more experimental place next time, like the best Timbo bangers, but we'll gladly take this smooth solo song for now.


	A cool rush of electro-pop beats punched up by electric guitar riffs star alongside Jun in the infectious “Gemini.” In one of the album's best-written cuts, “Gemini” paints a poignant picture using the celestial twin's zodiac sign to represent aching over a lost love, as if the other half of its soul has been lost.


	With his birthday on June 10, 1996, Jun is a true, multifaceted Gemini, as evidenced by his talents in singing, rapping, dancing, composing, acting, hosting, and modeling, all demonstrated over the past 10 years alongside SEVENTEEN.


	Written and composed by Seungkwan with introspective indie songwriter Ha Hyunsang of the band Hoppipolla, the classic power ballad “Raindrops” recalls the special moments with someone who may be gone but remains in one's heart. The emotional track is bound to stir up intense feelings as Seungkwan details the happiness and pain of his memories, ultimately coming to terms with his feelings and deciding that everything is all right.


	While Seungkwan has not confirmed the meaning of the song, many interpreted “Raindrops” as a tribute to his late friend Moonbin, a member of the K-pop group ASTRO, who tragically passed in 2023. Fans have discovered a past interview with the late singer where he shares a memory of him and Seungkwan walking in the rain together. The sentimental lyrics now tied to this memory make this a poignant tribute track that Seungkwan can be proud to dedicate to his dear friend.


	Vernon has shown his tastemaker music preferences through solo collaborations with the likes of A. G. Cook, Charli XCX, Omega Sapien, Tobi Lou, Drunken Tiger and Rina Sawayama, while shouting out his love for rising stars like 100 gecs and Bladee. With production that recalls William Orbit's spacey pop-rock stylings, “Shining Star” once again showcases his artistic range with a track that employs starry metaphors to remind the listener that they still shine, even when they're feeling burned out.


	Speaking of William Orbit, can we link him, Vernon, Woozi, and the crew together for a special track on the next SEVENTEEN album?


	As the member producing a majority of the songs on SEVENTEEN's albums, Woozi had a hand in two of the group songs and five solo songs for Happy Burstday. But for his solo track, the musical mastermind rather unexpectedly does not have any credits, instead singing a track written by Bumzu (who has been a producer with the group since their debut single “Adore U”), who co-produced the track with Kitae Park (who has credits across several SVT albums including their sophomore record, Boys Be).


	The musical admiration and closeness among the three is crystal clear in “Destiny,” with references to some of Woozi's most famous productions, as the star angelically delivers the introspective lyrics about embracing the inevitable highs and lows in one's unfurling fate.


	S.Coups is intrinsically linked with SEVENTEEN after a decade as the team's leader — which is probably why his solo track “Jungle” sounds as if it could be a track sung by all 13 members. Celebrating the group and their fans' journey together, “Jungle” delves into a hard-hitting, hip-hop sound that S.Coups has consistently embraced throughout his career, dismissing negativity and focusing on the positive. He sings and spits through English and Korean lyrics: “I don't need respect, our lives are different/ I need fans, when I have them, it's perfect/ I need love, even if the world changes, that doesn't.”


	Written entirely by S.Coups, “Jungle” is the final track on Happy Burstday to leave listeners with a lasting reminder that SEVENTEEN is a group from K-pop's “third generation who's been rising for 10 years” and plans to keep on doing so in the years to come.


	Opening with no-frills synth beats that hint at the song being a simple dance track, Joshua delivers one of the most satisfying songs on Happy Birthday with “Fortunate Change.” Soothing synthesizers and warm guitar riffs blend with Joshua's breezy tenor and falsetto deliveries, creating a song that forgoes traditional song structure without a second verse or repeating refrain yet still feels fully whole and encompassing as a standout solo cut.


	The acid jazz influences of “Fortunate Change” are among the most unexpected yet refreshing sounds on the record. Plus, Joshua's joy is palpable through the song as he sings about seeing the world in a new light thanks to love. It's a universal message that SEVENTEEN can dedicate to fans, and fans can share back with them. But one can also dedicate the song to a lover, friend, team, colleague, group, relative, or anyone else you want to say, “Thanks for coming to me.”


	The appropriately titled “HBD” opens Happy Burstday with one of SEVENTEEN's most rock & roll tracks to date. However, as with most SEVENTEEN tracks, there are numerous twists and turns as “HBD” is infused with influences of big-room EDM and breakbeat percussion for a truly explosive listening experience.


	Using birthdays to symbolize rebirth, the band shares their mantras to live as authentically as possible and light up life like the candles on a birthday cake. They chant in Korean and English, “Today, it's my way/ Light a candle, make a wish — it'll all come true/ Happy birthday to you…/ Tonight is my celebration night, I won't stop for anything.”


	As the first of 16 new tracks on Happy Burstday, “HBD” very much settles the listener into the true musical journey of SEVENTEEN's latest album, which marks their most expansive set of genres and styles yet.


	Putting together the song to represent SEVENTEEN after a decade is no easy task (Billboard's Abby Webster somehow pulled off the impossible task of selecting their 10 best songs), but “THUNDER” feels like the kind of track that captures the true electricity surrounding the group at this moment.


	With an undeniable whistle hook incorporated throughout to give it universal Top 40 appeal, “THUNDER” is a booming surge of complex, powerful K-pop that allows each of the 12 members on the record to shine through its various shifts and shakes. (13th member Jeonghan was the first member to serve his mandatory South Korean military service and seemingly enlisted before recording.)


	The lyrics show a more mature SEVENTEEN that's still bursting with rebellious youth as they try out more adult lines like “Now I'm funked up, step on the gas,” but also has SVT's signature sense of knowing one's self (Vernon boasts, “Rumors spread like fire, chatter everywhere/ Now they're crowding around, ah, what a feeling”). Produced by SEVENTEEN's longtime producer Bumzu (who is sometimes referenced as their “14th member” given how many songs he's done with the group) with Woozi and S.Coups helping on the lyrics and composition, “THUNDER” also brings in an offbeat element that only SEVENTEEN can make work, with a chorus mostly made up of the guys trading off the chant, “ALO! ALO! T.H.U.N.D.E.R. ALO! ALO!”


	It's explosive, it's captivating, and it's unlike any song out there. “THUNDER” does a worthy job of serving as the representative single for SEVENTEEN's 10th-anniversary album, indicating that the group will continue its musical greatness for the next decade and beyond.

To celebrate, Fogerty has released three newly recorded versions of CCR classics.

	Jessica Lynch



John Fogerty has announced a new album titled Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years, due out Aug. 22 via Concord. 


	To celebrate, Fogerty has released three newly recorded versions of CCR classics: “Up Around the Bend,” “Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” and “Porterville,” the latter originally released in 1967 under the band's earlier name, The Golliwogs.


	The new recordings are labeled “John's Version,” a nod to Taylor Swift's “Taylor's Version” project, though Fogerty now owns his masters. He won control over his publishing rights in early 2023, ending a legal battle that spanned five decades.

	“For most of my life I did not own the songs I had written,” Fogerty said in a statement. “Getting them back changes everything. Legacy is my way of celebrating that — of playing these songs on my terms, with the people I love.”

	











	The sessions feature Fogerty's sons Shane and Tyler on guitars, with Matt Chamberlain on drums, Bob Malone on keys, Bob Glaub on bass, and Rob Stone on saxophone. Shane Fogerty also co-produced the album with his father, while Julie Fogerty, John's wife, served as executive producer.

	“I knew firsthand how much it meant for John to get his publishing back,” said Julie. “It has been so joyful and beautiful since this happened for him. This is a celebration of his life's work. It is the biggest party for the good guy/artist winning.”

	











Legacy features 20 tracks, including CCR staples like “Proud Mary,” “Bad Moon Rising,” “Fortunate Son,” and “Down on the Corner.” The project arrives as Fogerty celebrates his 80th birthday with a pair of shows at New York's Beacon Theatre, ahead of a European summer tour and a performance at Glastonbury Festival.


	Fogerty co-founded Creedence Clearwater Revival in the late 1960s and went on to write and perform some of the most enduring hits of the era. The band scored nine Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1969 and 1971, including “Proud Mary,” “Bad Moon Rising,” “Green River,” and “Lookin' Out My Back Door.”


Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years is available for pre-order now.

	In its first AI licensing deal, The New York Times Company and giant Amazon have announced a multi-year agreement that will bring Times editorial content to a variety of Amazon customer experiences in a move the partners said broadens the companies' existing relationship.


	The idea is to “bring additional value to Amazon customers and bring Times journalism to wider audiences,” the companies said.


	Under the new deal, Amazon is licensing editorial content from The New York Times, NYT Cooking, and The Athletic “for AI-related uses.” This will include real-time display of summaries and short excerpts of Times content within Amazon products and services, such as Alexa, and training Amazon's proprietary foundation models.

Actor Andrew McCarthy, best known for his role in the 1986 classic “Pretty in Pink” and as a familiar face in Hallmark's Christmas films, offered fans a rare glimpse into his personal life this week by sharing a heartfelt prom night moment with his daughter, Willow.

The 18-year-old Broadway performer attended her senior prom looking radiant in a high-neck, floor-length blue gown, accessorized with a matching shawl and a white corsage. McCarthy, casually dressed in jeans and a gray button-down, proudly posed beside his daughter in the family's kitchen. 

Sharing the image on both his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the actor joked, “My daughter Willow went to her prom tonight. She did not wear pink.” The caption was a playful reference to his beloved 1986 film, where he played the role of popular heartthrob Blane McDonough.

Fans flooded the post with well-wishes and compliments, celebrating both Willow's style and the sweet father-daughter bond. McCarthy later reshared the photo on his Instagram Stories with the caption, “Prom night, no pink,” adding another humorous nod to his iconic movie past.

Andrew McCarthy is a proud father of three: sons Sam and Rowan, and daughter Willow. While Rowan appears to shy away from the spotlight, Sam and Willow have clearly inherited their father's passion for acting.

His oldest son, Sam, 23, is a working actor, best known for playing Charlie in the Netflix series “Dead to Me.” Sam has also appeared in projects like “Goosebumps” and “Condor,” telling Flaunt magazine, “As I got older, I felt like I was drawn to acting, and would talk about being an actor ‘someday.'”

Willow, following in her father's footsteps, has already made a name for herself on Broadway. In 2013, she took on the lead role of Matilda Wormwood in “Matilda: The Musical,” and later performed in productions of “1984” and “The Ferryman.” Most recently, she reunited with fellow former Matildas for a special “Matildapalooza” concert at New York City's 54 Below, where they performed favorite Broadway numbers.

McCarthy shares Willow and Rowan, 11, with his wife, Dolores Rice. His son Sam is from his previous marriage to Carol Schneider. The actor's social media posts are rare windows into his family life, and fans were especially delighted to see the proud father celebrate this milestone moment with Willow.

Throughout Gabby Samone's journey on season 23 of “American Idol,” the powerhouse R&B singer had a bevy of celebrities in her corner and sharing her performances, from Jennifer Hudson to Celine Dion. But that star-studded support hasn't stopped since the Baltimore native's shocking seventh-place finish. 

On May 24, 2025, Samone had a “full circle moment” with season 3 “American Idol” winner Fantasia, who was a guest mentor to her and other finalists during season 23. Samone, 22, performed for a packed crowd at Baltimore's Artscape and then got to later introduce Fantasia, the concert headliner, who paused her concert to give her some powerful guidance in front of thousands.  

A post shared by Gabby Samone (@gabbysamonemusic)

In videos taken by audience members and posted by Samone, Fantasia could be seen in the middle of her concert seeking out Samone, who was standing near the front of the stage, and yelling out to her, “Congratulations, queen, 'cause you did it!” 

At another point, Fantasia walked over to the up-and-coming singer and said, “Gabby, I want to say something to you.” She leaned on a speaker as she shared some powerful wisdom with the up-and-coming singer. 

“In this game of (the) music industry,” the Grammy winner began. “It can sometimes be a gift, and a curse. It's bitter. If you keep your eyes stayed on God, you my dear, you're going to go far.” 

“Do me one favor,” Fantasia continued. “Never get caught up in the game of number ones and how many albums you sell. ‘Cause that is when you will lose sight.” 

With a soft piano playing in the background and audience members shouting words of praise, Fantasia then told Samone that she can rest in the knowing she's already a winner “because God gave you a gift that no one can touch.” 

“So don't worry about how many albums sell, just put the music out,” Fantasia told her. “And don't sign over that gift that you have to no one. Control your own stuff. Because in this industry, it's just a game of prostitution and they will use your gift, and you will go home and you will have nothing.” 

“Please know that I am talking to you from what I've been through,” she concluded, getting emotional. “Keep your eyes stayed on God. He's already made you a winner.” 

When Fantasia mentored the remaining finalists on the April 28 episode, Samone told producers in a pre-recorded segment, “I am a huge fan of Fantasia. She's a superstar.” 

“When Fantasia won, I was only three years old,” she continued. “Seeing a black woman win ‘American Idol,' is important. I saw myself onscreen.” 

Fantasia mentored Samone as she rehearsed her version of Donny Hathaway's “Song For You” and told producers, “Gabby is very shy. But when she opens up her mouth, it's like, ‘Who is this!?'” 

So impressed with Samone's vocals that she didn't have any suggestions for changes, Fantasia told producers, “My prayer for her is that afterwards, she understands that it's okay now for you to come out of your shell and live.”

Royal Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is the daughter of Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, and Princess Camilla, Duchess of Castro. The Italian princess, born in Rome on June 23, 2003, leads a glamorous life and occasionally shares glimpses of it on Instagram, where she has 170,000 followers. However, Maria Carolina's latest post was not about some luxury destination she has visited, her philanthropy, or an important event she has attended; it was a chilling post about how she almost lost her life and a reminder of the importance of wearing safety gear to prevent the risk of injury and death.

A post shared by Princess Maria Carolina di Borbone delle Due Sicilie (@carolinadebourbon)

Princess Maria Carolina shared several photos on Instagram on May 28, including pictures of herself in a hospital bed wearing a neck brace. In the caption, she gave context to what was happening in her photos. ”I'm incredibly lucky to be alive,” she began. “I crashed headfirst into a wall whilst riding a motorcycle and ended up in reanimation in the Intensive Care Unit. Surviving this was nothing short of a miracle.”

She is passionate about riding motorcycles and decided to share her story publicly to raise awareness about just how dangerous they can be. “I wanted to share my own experience as I've realized now more than ever that motorcycles are powerful and thrilling, but also unforgiving. Please ride with care,” she wrote. “Wear full protection, especially a proper helmet. Mine saved my life.”

Princess Maria Carolina ended her message by thanking the medical professionals at Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace. She also acknowledged how the actions of the first responders on the scene helped to save her life and praised them for their “quick and decisive actions in those first moments.”

A post shared by Princess Maria Carolina di Borbone delle Due Sicilie (@carolinadebourbon)

The princess has many people invested in her life and well-being, and fans have reacted to the news of her accident by commenting on her Instagram post.

“Thank God you're ok!!” a message reads. “Sending love and positive thoughts for your full recovery!!” Another person shared their relief that Maria Carolina was recovering. “So glad to read that you are well and safe,” they wrote. Other reactions include, “I'm glad you are ok” and “Take care of yourself princess.”

The princess lives between Paris, Monte Carlo, and Rome, the Camila of Bourbon website reports. The hospital she mentioned, Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace, is in Monaco.

Just over one week after winning “American Idol” season 23, Jamal Roberts has scored his first Top 10 Billboard hit single and the number one Gospel song in the nation. The 27-year-old girl dad will likely never forget his huge feat — not only because it's a huge milestone, but also because he now has a tattoo to remember it by. 

On the eve of the season finale, Roberts' soulful cover of Tom Odell's 2013 song “Heal” was released by the show's record label partner, 19 Recordings. Ten days later — on May 28, 2025 — Billboard delivered the huge news that the song had debuted at number one on the Hot Gospel chart and number two on the Digital Sales chart, across all genres. 

For the week ending on May 22, per Billboard, Roberts' single “Heal” sold 9,000 downloads, based on data from Luminate. That put it on top of the Gospel Digital Song Sales chart. It's not his first time on that chart, though. In early May, while “American Idol” was still airing, curiosity from fans pushed his previously-released song, “He's Preparing Me” from 2020, to number four there, Billboard reported.

Sales of “Heal” also landed the song at number two on the all-genre Digital Songs chart, which means Roberts officially has a Top 10 song in the U.S. While chart rankings are based on song sales, “Heal” also had an impressive 918,000 official U.S. streams during the first few days after its release. 

Roberts isn't the only “American Idol” fan-favorite to hit the Digital Song Sales chart, either. Third-place finisher Breanna Nix landed in the number four spot with 5,000 downloads of her first single, “Higher,” and runner-up John Foster is at number six with 4,000 sales of “Tell That Angel I Love Her.” 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

Roberts originally sang “Heal” during the April 28 episode of “American Idol.” It was a song he'd never heard before, but he told guest mentor Fantasia that the words spoke to him, so he made it his own. The crowd and judges were rendered speechless after his live performance that night. 

Once he made the top 3 on the show, he was able to record the tune as a single with 19 Recordings, adding his own lyrics at the end to incorporate his faith, and he performed it on the finale before being crowned the winner.

The song has been so instrumental in his skyrocketing success, that Roberts revealed to his fans via a Facebook Live session on May 27 that he'd had the word “HEAL” tattooed down his chest the day before, admitting that it was still hurting. Roberts explained that his tattoo artist made the word “HOPE,” which was already across his chest, larger and used the “E” in it to be part of the word “HEAL,” inked vertically in the same font. 

While in Atlanta with his manager and attorney on May 28, Roberts gave fans a glimpse of his new tattoo in a photo he posted, seen above, as he wore his signature look of a suit with no shirt.

Eagle-eyed fans of HGTV's hit competition show “Rock the Block” are asking if that was Chip Gaines they saw making a brief cameo in an episode of season six!

And that even includes at least one HGTV star!

In a scene where winning designer Alison Victoria enthuses to her team about picking “the right side of the street,” giving her bathroom a mountain view, a team member walks through the shot helping carry a countertop. And that team member looks shockingly like “Fixer Upper” star Chip Gaines.

In fact, “100 Day Dream Home” star Brian Kleinschmidt was the first to point out the uncanny resemblance when HGTV posted a clip of the scene to their Instagram account. “Is that @chipgaines twin brother?” he commented on the post.  

Fans were quick to agree. One wrote, “”I'm not the only one who thought the same thing! I was questioning why Chip is working with Alison.”

Another commented, “Sure could at least be Chip Gaines cousin maybe?”

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

“Rock the Block” season six rookies Kamohai and Tristyn Kalama jumped on the bandwagon, replying to Kleinschmidt's comment with laughing emojis.  

The Kalamas got some HGTV love of their own in another post from the “Rock the Block” season finale.

HGTV put up a clip on Instagram of Kamohai's father flying in from Hawaii to bless their “Rock the Block” house in Utah before the final appraisal. 

“Fixer to Fabulous” star Jenny Marrs commented about the touching video, writing “I love this! ❤️”

 While we still don't know the name of the mystery man working on Alison Victoria and Michel Smith Boyd's “Rock the Block” crew, we do know this.

Chip Gaines doesn't have a twin. He doesn't even have a brother. Chip has one sister named Shannon Braun according to Country Living.

We also know that Chip Gaines is in the middle of a busy season of life in Waco, Texas that would likely make it tough for him to sneak away to Salt Lake City, Utah to put in an uncredited cameo on his former network.

18-year-old daughter Ella Rose Gaines just graduated from high school and will soon go off to college, just as older brother Drake Gaines did two-years ago. 

And wife Joanna just debuted her latest series on the Magnolia Network called “Mini Reni.” 

Meanwhile Chip himself has partnered with Bobcat for some charity work, providing heavy equipment to a former solider who is rescuing horses at his “Hoof Haven Sanctuary” in Gatesville, Texas, less than an hour from where Chip and Joanna Gaines live and run their Magnolia Empire.

2025 is a big year for Benicio del Toro to return to working with two of his frequent collaborator auteurs, first with Wes Anderson for “The Phoenician Scheme,” following their 2021 project “The French Dispatch.” He leads Anderson's latest as Zsa-zsa Korda, one of the richest men in Europe and father to Mia Threapleton's character, Sister Liesl.

As for who's next? Del Toro will be reuniting with “Inherent Vice” director Paul Thomas Anderson with “One Battle After Another,” coming to theaters September 26. “I haven't seen the final project, the final cut of the film,” he told IndieWire at the New York City premiere of Anderson's latest on May 28.

“I saw parts of it. It's PTA at his best and with two of my favorite actors. I'm a fan,” he said. The film will be led by Leonardo DiCaprio. As for what del Toro can say about DiCaprio's performance, he says that “he's fantastic in it, fantastic at it. And so is Sean [Penn]. They're both fantastic and it's a fun ride, you know.”

 










The film stars DiCaprio as a civil rights activist who joins an anti-government group to combat an “alt-right” white supremacist organization. Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall, and Anderson's “Licorice Pizza” alum Alana Haim co-star as DiCaprio's fellow activists; Sean Penn, who also had an iconic supporting role in “Licorice Pizza,” plays a white nationalist leader. Shayna McHale, Wood Harris, and “Presumed Innocent” actress Chase Infiniti, who plays DiCaprio's onscreen daughter, also star.

Anderson wrote the script and produced the film alongside Sara Murphy and the late Adam Somner. The feature, which was shot on 35mm film using VistaVision cameras, is getting an IMAX release from Warner Bros. This is Anderson's first film since his 2021 feature “Licorice Pizza.”

In David Ehrlich's Cannes review of “The Phoenician Scheme,” he writes that it “is free to focus all of its attention on the simple idea that family is the richest inheritance that anyone could ever hope to receive or pass down, even if some people — fathers most of all — usually have to lose everything else before they can learn to appreciate its value. ‘Planning doesn't matter, Zsa-zsa says, ‘what matters is the sincerity of your devotion.' It's a strange thing to hear towards the end of an Anderson film that's been too obsessed with the planning stage to meaningfully devote itself to anything, but [it] is a movie with its heart in the right place, and a souvenir hand grenade within arm's reach just in case it's needed.”

 










“One Battle After Another” premieres in theaters September 26 from Warner Bros. Check out the trailer here.

“There's a dignity to this,” John Mulaney said in the penultimate episode of his talk show, “Everybody's Live,” while preparing to fight three 14-year-olds live on Netflix.

Time will tell if there is dignity to be found in what occurred during the show's teen-themed finale, but for the past month, Mulaney promised the world that he would fight three teenagers, and no one can say that he didn't. Ben, Jacob, and Adarsh (last names withheld for legal reasons) could not have been more serious about the task at hand, and together they achieved something that should strike fear into the hearts of Hollywood.

 










“The worst part of fighting is knowing you gotta fight,” said guest Adam Sandler, and Mulaney quickly agreed, sharing that he was already thinking about the confrontation which would not occur for close to an hour. Indeed, for the rest of the episode, when there was even the slightest breath in conversation, viewers may have glimpsed a darkness in Mulaney's eyes, as if part of him was somewhere else… (announcer Richard Kind's lower third was changed to “soon-to-be murder witness”).

 








Related Stories To Lead ‘Adolescence,' Only a ‘Magician' Like Rising Star Owen Cooper Would Do ‘Adolescence' Breakout Owen Cooper Worried About Learning His Lines — Then He Improvised the Hit Show's Most Talked-About Moment 

Ben, 5'8″, 140 lbs.; thinks beating up John Mulaney would help his self esteem and popularity and said, “Comin' for you, John” with a cool point to camera.

Jacob 5'6,” 226 lbs.; extremely confident and believes he is “simply better” than John.

Adarsh, 5'6″, 109 lbs.; trained in taekwondo, wants to prove his haters wrong.

A week prior to the fight, Mulaney's writers arranged for him to be attacked by three stunt women approximately the size of young boys (but still on average not as big as his opponents). The trio jumped onto his arms and back and eventually dragged him down while shouting abuse like “pussy-ass bitch!” Later, Mulaney claimed to have been emboldened by the simulation, that he felt in control as he went down.

“When you're fighting you're not thinking about a thousand things; you're only thinking about one thing,” he said. Survival.

At the top of the show, Mulaney announced that he would fight three teens “reputationally speaking.” Losing the fight would be a source of mass humiliation for his opponents, dooming their social standing  while Mulaney himself can brush off a loss and continue his career unscathed (starting with the Emmys campaign for “Everybody's Live”).

Stand-up comedy — and performance in general — makes the performer extremely vulnerable, to embarrassment as much as criticism or financial trouble. “I feel like I've been embarrassed enough on a large scale. I'm not that embarrassed by anything like this anymore,” he said.

 










But he had everything to lose, and they had nothing.

“John, I came here to warn you not to fight those three 14-year old boys,” his future self (Peter Gallagher) warned in the May 22 episode, calling it “the biggest mistake of our lives.” “Things get very, very bad for us when that happens.”

No punching, no kicking, no biting, no gauging, no blood. Headlocks were legal only if an arm could lock around the head. If any one boy tapped out, Mulaney would win — a rule that prompted him to look directly into the eyes of his smallest opponent, Adarsh. Mulaney is a full-time performer, so the boys had to steer clear of his face out of respect — and not hit him in the balls out of, well, safety. As he told the audience at an FYC event in Los Angeles recently, this was meant to be a “brawl” — a messy pile-on with probably a lot of pulling at shirts and hair, but maybe not any long-term damage.

Ahead of the fight, we gathered IndieWire's “Everybody's Live” experts to weigh in, who were universally concerned about Mulaney's safety. Senior Writer Proma Khosla agreed that it would be a pile on, while TV Critic Ben Travers postulated that the teens might form an actual attack plan. “They could be savage, brutal combatants who push the agreed-upon rules to their breaking point, or they could be goofballs who come in with one or two good ideas,” he wrote, probably from a plane somewhere. Editorial Director Kate Erbland shared a harrowing anecdote about the “vicious tendencies of pubescent boys” while stating point blank that the trio would best Mulaney, while Craft Editor Sarah Shachat offered this statement as a dignified abstention:

 










“Man, the more time passes, the more I come to believe ‘Sorry To Bother You' wasn't weird enough.”

Onward!

As Travers predicted, the fight itself was not the point of all this: It was the buildup, the debates, the speculation.

Kind gave Mulaney a lukewarm introduction before welcoming “the little fellas you came to see!” Ben, Jacob, and Adarsh entered the studio like rock stars, as the audience stood and cheered, greeted them with posters, and Adam Sandler hyped them up over the mic. Mulaney and the boys removed any jewelry ceremonially before entering the ring. All combatants were barefoot and wearing suits, perhaps as a final tribute to Mulaney's signature stage look (the boys also had on headgear, to protect their developing brains).

Surprisingly, Mulaney's first move was to run directly at Jacob, his largest opponent. This caused confusion, but freed up Adarsh to attack him from behind and Ben to immediately grab one of Mulaney's legs. This is the key flaw in Mulaney's pile-on plan; to control when you go down, you must first be up. He managed to wriggle out of Ben's grasp while still held by the other two as the four of them rotated around the ring. 

There was quite a bit of pushing — given the illegality of most other moves — and a few moments where you can see the boys hold themselves back from hits. Mulaney noted earlier that things happen in the throes of adrenaline, and even with rules in place they were all fighting primal instinct.

 










After consistently going for Mulaney's legs, Ben succeeded — he had a plan! — and the trio was able to bring down their elder-millennial opponent, who spent a few seconds trying to crawl out of this predicament before realizing it was impossible. Mulaney tapped out to raucous applause before a final musical performance by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. 

Congrats, teens!

“Everybody's Live with John Mulaney” is now streaming on Netflix.

On June 5, the IndieWire Honors Spring 2025 ceremony will celebrate the creators and stars responsible for some of the most impressive and engaging work of this TV season. Curated and selected by IndieWire's editorial team, IndieWire Honors is a celebration of the creators, artisans, and performers behind television well worth toasting. We're showcasing their work with new interviews leading up to the Los Angeles event.

Typically, when a reporter logs on to Zoom to interview a subject, the presence of someone sitting right next to said subject might be a tad off-putting. In the case of IndieWire's interview with “Adolescence” star Owen Cooper — the recipient of this spring's IndieWire Honor for Breakthrough Performance for his incredible work on the hit Netflix series — the sight of the young star's father sitting right next to him was a relief. OK, this writer thought, now this is a family that gets it!

If you've watched “Adolescence,” you probably get it too. The four-episode real-time crime drama, released by Netflix in March, follows the unsettling and hugely gripping fallout from a seemingly unthinkable crime. Cooper, in his very first on-screen role, plays 13-year-old Jamie Miller, who has just been arrested for murder (Jesus Christ, murder!) when the series, co-created and co-written by Stephen Graham (who also stars as Jamie's shellshocked dad) and Jack Thorne, opens.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Over the course of the series, it's not just Jamie's crime that is interrogated, but the hows and whys of how he (how we) got here. As IndieWire's Ben Travers wrote earlier this year, the series “is a sly subversion of TV‘s traditional crime dramas. Rather than ask who among us could be capable of such violence, the series examines why so many boys are growing up to be angry, misogynistic men.”

At the center is Cooper's staggering performance, which is enraging, emotional, horrifying, and heartbreaking in equal measure. Along the way, we learn not just about Jamie, but the world that shaped him, including his own family. So, yes, this writer was very pleased to see his smiling father sitting alongside him while we chatted about his work, his process, and what's next. 

When Cooper and his dad, an IT professional, hopped on the Zoom with IndieWire, it was early evening in the UK, just before dinner time. So, what would the 15-year-old actor be doing if he wasn't chatting with us? “I'd probably just be on the Xbox,” Cooper said with a smile. (At the exact same moment, his father said, “Doing homework.” Perfect.)

The Cooper men are more aligned when it comes to entertainment consumption. Asked what sort of movies he grew up watching, the young actor beamed. “I just watched whatever my dad had on, so ‘Terminator' and big action films and stuff like that,” Cooper said. “But the films I like now? I just love everything. Robert De Niro in gangster movies, I love. And my dad's the exact same. My dad let me watch whatever I want.”

 










Wait, wait, “to a limit,” Cooper's dad chimed in. The actor smiled and added, “But, yeah, if I was watching it with him.”

All apologies to De Niro, but Cooper's first real actorly obsession was with Tom Holland. Asked the first time he recognized that an actor was putting on a performance, something he might want to emulate himself, Cooper pointed immediately to his fellow Brit.

“I think it was Tom Holland in ‘The Impossible,' that I thought that he was really good and that I wanted to be like him and I wanted to be doing what he's doing,” he said. “Tom Holland was the first actor I saw and was like, ‘Oh, he's really good.' When I was a kid, I watched actors as characters, I didn't watch them as people.”

(For clarity's sake: When he “was a kid” means when he was about six or eight years old.) Since then, he added, he's seen “The Impossible” about 30 times. Even before he was a student, it seems, Cooper was studying up on his craft. As his interest in acting grew, Cooper started attending weekly classes with The Drama MOB, a Manchester drama school co–created by “Coronation Street” actress Tina O'Brien and Esther Morgan.

“The first thing that came quite quick to me in drama lessons was getting out of the comfort zone,” he said. “That was the thing I was most scared of, because I went to drama lessons with a group full of girls. But since I've got out of it, I'm comfortable doing anything literally, whatever the director says, I'll do it.”

 










That ability proved pivotal to his work in “Adolescence,” Cooper added. The show was “pretty dark, I don't think I would've been able to do [it] at all without the drama lessons and the coaching and stuff like that. … I just think every actor has to do it. Every actor has to do something they don't want to do in a scene. I just thought, I don't want to be the odd one out, and I just want to do it. It doesn't matter if it's embarrassing or it makes you look like an absolute idiot, but I'll just do it and whatever comes off it, comes off it.”

When The Drama MOB got a request for self-tapes for the role of Jamie, Cooper jumped at the chance. “I had a lot of self-tape requests before, but ‘Adolescence' came round, I had no idea who anyone was, because I only got told [who] the director was,” Cooper said. The young actor taped his piece, felt pretty good about it, and sent it off. About a month later, he got a callback for an in-person audition. Now that was scary.

“I was so, so nervous for that. I've never done an in-person audition before,” he said. That one? Ever the cool kid, Cooper said it “wasn't too bad.” Next up? Another in-person audition near Leeds, where the show was set to shoot. Cooper met with Thorne and producer Jo Johnson, and kept rolling through more meetings — “three or four more, because it was taking so long to get the part, [because] so many other good actors [were auditioning] in it.”

 










Then Cooper met Graham. “I did a chemistry session with Stephen, which I think was my favorite one, because I think I did quite well in it,” he said. “I don't know, me and Stephen just clicked, instantly just clicked. It was like an improv-y workshop thing. … As soon as I met him, he looked at me in the eyes and said, ‘From now on, you're my son, and I'm your dad.' I just can't imagine that I'm in that situation, because I've never even been in a police station before. So it was quite difficult, but it just came to me.”

Two more weeks went by, Cooper said, as the production decided between him and another young actor. One day after school, his mom had some news: He got it. He smiled remembering it. “I was so happy,” he said. “I didn't really care about the intensity and the darkness of all it. I just wanted to prove myself, that I was the perfect role for the part. No one's seen me on TV before, so it was my chance to just grab it with both hands.”

His biggest concern? “Learning the lines, because I got told just before I got the part that it was going to be shot in four long takes,” he said. “So when I got told that, I thought it was impossible, I thought I was never going to be able to do it. It's just like theater; you can't really stop in the middle.”

 










Each episode of the series is designed to look and feel like a single-take, one-hour slice of time. Cooper is the driving force of two of those episodes, including the gobsmacking third episode, in which Jamie (now being held in a youth detention facility before his trial) sits down with forensic psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) for an unnerving interview. It marked Cooper's first onscreen performance.

“Episode 3, we did first, so I had two weeks to prepare the lines for that one,” he said. “I was nervous and I think I overdid the script, to be fair. I think I did about four hours a day on the script. I was so nervous to forget it and be the one that was going to make it restart. I didn't want to be that person.”

Rehearsals helped, too: one week just with the actors, then one week with the cameras in place. “The two weeks of rehearsal was the difficult part, I'm not going to lie, because it was so out of the comfort zone, the bits where I have to get in close to Erin and have to get up close and scare her and stuff, I just couldn't do it,” he said. “It took me quite a while to do, and so I just did it.”

By the first day of shooting on Episode 3, Cooper was already, in theater parlance, “off-book,” every line memorized, with a little room for error. “There were bits where I forgot the line, but I just made stuff up, and then we just kept on going,” he said. “[Series director] Phil [Barantini] said, if you get it wrong, just keep on going, because it's natural, and it's what a 13-year-old boy in that place with a psychologist, that's what he's going to do. He's going to mess up, he's going to stutter.”

 










They shot two takes a day, five days straight. By the end of it, Cooper said, he was tired. But then, a little magic? “With the last take, where I yawned, then Erin asked, ‘Am I boring you?,' which is brilliant,” he recalled. “That was on the very last take. Very last take! I think the crew, me, everyone was a bit tired and I lost my voice, but it didn't really sound like I lost my voice on camera.” The result is one of the most staggering moments of the series, and proof of both Cooper's prodigious talent, able to use a very real moment (as Owen) to add more resonance to his performance (as Jamie).

Cooper hasn't watched the finished show, though he did see some early cuts. Already, the young actor knows he doesn't like watching himself on camera. “I really don't like it. I can't stand it,” he said. “Every project I'm in from now on, I'll probably watch it once, maybe half of it, because I don't know, I just find it cringey. I wouldn't mind watching [‘Adolescence'] on my own, but it's with my family and, especially in Episode 3 when I'm talking such dark stuff, it's quite hard.”

He added with a smile, “But, yeah, I don't know, I've got a lot of films to watch, Stephen says!” He's also got films to make. Cooper recently finished shooting Emerald Fennell's much-anticipated “Wuthering Heights” adaptation, in which he plays young Heathcliff (the older role belongs to Jacob Elordi).

 










Cooper said the experience was “a lot different, a lot different to ‘Adolescence,' but it was amazing though. The crew, the cast, everyone was amazing. And filming is obviously a lot different, I just don't like repeating scenes. It's just like a pet peeve of mine. I loved it and it was good.”

So, what's next for this rising star? Mostly, Cooper wants to keep learning and growing, and he already has a strong sense of who might best help with that endeavor. 

“I don't know if [I have] a certain role [in mind], but I would love to work with certain people, like David Fincher, Christopher Nolan — which is a big shout-out — Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino,” he said. “All of those directors, I would love to work with, and the big actors I want to work with too, because I can learn from them. I don't want to work with them because they're massive and famous, I want to learn off of them and work with them.”

All episodes of “Adolescence” are now streaming on Netflix.

Bryan Cranston isn't slowing down any time soon, most recently reuniting with Wes Anderson for “The Phoenician Scheme,” their latest collaboration following “Asteroid City” in 2023 and “Isle of Dogs” in 2018. In Anderson's latest, he plays Reagan, the brother of Tom Hanks' character. We caught up with the actor at the film's New York City premiere on Wednesday, May 28.

Amid his busy schedule, he will soon return to the “Malcolm in the Middle” reboot, reuniting with original cast members Jane Kaczmarek, Frankie Muniz, Christopher Masterson, and Justin Berfield. “Seeing the family was the best part,” he told IndieWire about returning to the series, which ran for 151 episodes across seven seasons from 2000 to 2006.

“It's been 20 years since we said goodbye, and now we're seeing the family again and each person,” he said. “All the boys were around the same age, now, that I was when I started 25 years ago. They've got kids of their own. It's just great to see.”

As for whether it was a challenge returning to the role two decades later, he said, “I'm asked to do physical comedy on that show and I realized, ‘Oh, it's been 20 years since I did that.' I have a few extra restrictions now, so it's like I'm crawling around. I'm, of course, naked again. That's no surprise, no surprise at all.”

 










“Slipping back into that character of Hal for me was so rewarding — I missed him,” Cranston told People in a recent conversation. “It's been almost 20 years since we said goodbye. And he's a sweet, lovable man. He's a lovable guy, and it was fun to see all my whole family back together. It was great.”

Wes Anderson wrote the screenplay for the film himself, but conceived the story for “The Phoenician Scheme” with frequent collaborator Roman Coppola, who's credited on the screenplay of “The Darjeeling Limited” and also contributed to “Isle of Dogs,” “The French Dispatch,” and “Asteroid City.” The last script he fully co-wrote with Anderson was 2012's “Moonrise Kingdom,” which was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. However, not joining Anderson for the first time in the writer/director's career is his loyal cinematographer Robert Yeoman. Instead, “The Phoenician Scheme” was shot by French DP Bruno Delbonnel, whose credits include the recent Apple TV+ limited series from Alfonso Cuarón, “Disclaimer,” as well as “Across the Universe,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” and “Darkest Hour.” Alexandre Desplat, who scored 6 of Anderson's films, was also part of the team.

The film will receive a limited release on May 30, followed by a nationwide rollout on June 6 from Focus Features. Watch the trailer here.

Five months after late auteur David Lynch died at age 78, the filmmaker's personal collections will be put up for auction by his estate. Lynch suddenly passed January 17, 2025.

Now, Lynch fans can purchase part of the late director's holdings with the David Lynch Collection auction through Julien's. The auction begins June 18 at 10 a.m. PST in Los Angeles, with highlights including Lynch's personal props from his past projects, unfinished screenplays, and a personalized director's chair. Bids are already rolling in before the auction actually opens: “Mulholland Drive” prop menus for Winkie's Sunset Blvd, for example, are listed at $2,250, with an annotated script for Lynch's shelved film “Ronnie Rocket: The Absurd Mystery of the Strange Forces of Existence” tracking to go for more than $2,500.

A collection of six signed posters, including one for Lynch's final film “Inland Empire” and three for “Lost Highway,” are also among the auction items. Another coveted listing is no doubt the second draft of the pilot episode script for “Twin Peaks,” originally titled “Northwest Passage.” The script is dated January 23, 1988 and has “Northwest Passage” crossed out on the title page, with “Twin Peaks” written over it. A “Twin Peaks”  crew gift is also for grabs: The flannel-lined denim LL Bean shirt in a men's size medium has the words “Twin Peaks '90” on the chest. 

 










After Lynch's passing, his frequent collaborator Naomi Watts told the Los Angeles Times that she and Laura Dern were ready to collaborate again with Lynch in late November 2024. “We had a beautiful lunch at his house,” Watts said of herself, Lynch, and Dern. “I knew he'd been unwell but he was in great spirits. He wanted to go back to work — Laura and I were like, ‘You can do it! You could work from the trailer.' He was not, in any way, done. I could see the creative spirit alive in him.”

“It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,” his family wrote on an official Facebook page. “There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”

Josh Klinghoffer, the former guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, has accepted a no-jail plea deal after being charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence in September 2024 for allegedly driving over and killing pedestrian Israel Sanchez in Alhambra, California. Klinghoffer originally pleaded not guilty through his lawyer, Blair Bernholz Berk, when the charges were first filed. When reached by Pitchfork, Berk offered no comment on the plea deal.

When appearing in the courtroom on Wednesday (May 28), Klinghoffer pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence. Los Angeles County Judge Rosa Fregoso sentenced the musician to one year of informal probation and 60 days of community labor, as well as requiring him to complete a driver safety class and pay restitution, the amount of which will be determined at a later date.

After Klinghoffer entered the plea, a prosecutor read a statement warning him about distracted driving again in the future: “If you continue to drive while distracted, and as a result of your driving someone is killed, you can be charged with murder.” Klinghoffer said that he understood, reports Rolling Stone.

In July 2024, Sanchez's family sued Klinghoffer for wrongful death and negligence, claiming that the 47-year-old man was struck by the musician's car when he failed to yield at a crosswalk, resulting in Sanchez's death hours later due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The lawsuit claimed that Klinghoffer was on his phone while driving the SUV, and that no arrest was initially made in the incident despite camera footage.

Klinghoffer's attorney in the civil case, Andrew B. Brettler, called it “a tragic accident” in a statement to Pitchfork. “After the car struck the pedestrian, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived. He is fully cooperating with the traffic investigation,” said Brettler.

The Sanchez family's attorney, Nick Rowley, told Variety that “Mr. Klinghoffer should be arrested and prosecuted for homicide.” Rowley continued: “We have a video of him on his cell phone at the time he hit and killed Israel Sanchez, a loving father, in a crosswalk. Israel Sanchez was on his way to the grocery store to make soup for his family and never came home. He did everything right, looking for oncoming traffic and abiding by pedestrian signage, but tragically Mr. Klinghoffer, in a rush and on his phone, hit him fatally from behind with a large SUV. The loss and grief that the Sanchez family now faces is immense. We will not stop until there is accountability and justice for Mr. Sanchez and his family.”

Klinghoffer played guitar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers from 2009 to 2019, when he was replaced by returning member John Frusciante. Klinghoffer was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the band in 2012, making him the youngest inductee ever at the time. Since leaving the band, he performed as a touring member of Jane's Addiction before their abrupt breakup, and remains an active touring guitarist in Pearl Jam.

Florry was named after a character in Betty Smith's novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but listening to their fantastically energetic new album Sounds Like…, you wonder if it must also be some kind of arcane verb. Meaning: to jam out with one's best friends as if the 8:30 p.m. sunlight will never fade. Or: to turn one's own life into a grand country-rock musical, whose songs are filled with jubilant exclamations and pauses for laughter and applause. The band's seven members—who first got together in Philly, but are now all over the place—are so in the pocket on their third album that you have to assume that “Florry” is a directive as much as a band name. Like: Let's florry tonight.

A lot of that exuberance comes courtesy of bandleader Francie Medosch, who has clearly never met a riff she didn't want to play or a trope she couldn't make her own. It wasn't until I read the lyric sheet of Sounds Like… that I even recognized the malaise and discomfort that sits plainly in her songs; her voice is hearty and beseeching, and it often sounds as if she's singing through a massive grin, like she can't quite believe her own band is ripping through these flamboyant barnstormers with such joy and ease. When she exclaims that she'd give a film “five out of five” on opener “First it was a movie, then it was a book” (which was not not inspired by Holly Hunter in Broadcast News) you want to hoot and holler along with her… until you properly parse the full phrase: “If I wasn't feeling so empty, baby, I'd give that movie five out of five!”

These are the parameters of Sounds Like…: Trying to acknowledge life's inherent, everlasting shittiness—I'm depressed; Holly Hunter didn't win an Oscar for Broadcast News—while retaining the positivity that formed the core of 2023's The Holey Bible. Medosch finds her silver linings in parking lots and trips to the movies, in a “barbecue on Valentine's with my best friend Eli” and the realisation that blasting Cher's “If I Could Turn Back Time” on repeat might be the only logical response to wondering “why you hate me so much.” Aiding her is a band, and co-production by Colin Miller, that triangulates virtuosically crunchy groups like Dr. Dog with lifelong Dylan standom and the fuck-you sweetness of the early Olympia scene, finding a central point that's hooky, ramshackle, and boisterous all at once.

Florry's artful looseness is important: Medosch most often sings about ragged feelings, and scenarios with a raw edge. The loping ballad “You Don't Know,” seemingly addressed to someone suffering through a bout of depression, zeroes in on a tiny vision of the future (“One of these days, you're gonna be amazed”) while the terse “Sexy” sandwiches intrusive thoughts about a relationship between a simple affirmation: “Baby's crazy sexy.”

Despite the open-ended nature of many of her songs, Medosch still sees value in a stitched-up, punch-the-air anthem. “Pretty Eyes Lorraine” follows a simple, well-established rock'n'roll format: The protagonist meets an amazing girl who then shows her the ways of the world. Medosch approaches the idea with a typically laissez-faire attitude—the iconic, howlable hook here is simply “My girl's got pretty eyes”—but she takes a lesson from her hero Holly Hunter: It's not about what you're saying, it's about how you say it.

Bruce Springsteen has shared “Adelita,” the latest preview of his Tracks II collection. “Adelita” appears on the lost album Inyo, recorded in the 1990s as a potential follow-up to The Ghost of Tom Joad. Instead, the 10-track LP of songs set at the Californian and Texan borders was shelved until June 27 this year, when it will b e unvaulted alongside six other full-lengths as Tracks II: The Lost Albums. Listen to “Adelita,” Springsteen's mariachi-assisted ode to the Mexican “soldadera” freedom fighters, below.

During the period when he recorded Inyo, “There was constant border reporting in the Los Angeles Times, so it was a big part of your life,” Springsteen said in press materials. “Inyo was a record I wrote in California during long drives along the California aqueduct, up through Inyo County on my way to Yosemite or Death Valley. I was enjoying that kind of writing so much. [On the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour] I would go home to the hotel room at night and continue to write in that style because I thought I was going to follow up The Ghost of Tom Joad with a similar record, but I didn't. That's where Inyo came from. It's one of my favorites.”

Though mostly recorded solo, Inyo features mariachi contributors including Luis Villalobos, Alberto Villalobos, Angel Ramos, Humberto Manuel Flores Gutierrez, David Glukh, Jorge Espinosa, and Miguel Ponce. Springsteen's previous Tracks II singles were the title track from Faithless, the score to a movie that was never made; “Repo Man,” from Somewhere North of Nashville; “Blind Spot,” from the loop-based Streets of Philadelphia Sessions; and “Rain in the River,” from the Perfect World compilation.

							By 

	Stephen Rodrick



	Three weeks ago, I received an email from Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO. She was wondering if I wanted to sit down and talk with her and Nathan Fielder about the new season of The Rehearsal.


	This was something I very much did not want to do. 


	I once had lunch with Gravitt in Los Angeles a dozen years ago after she read my book, The Magical Stranger, that dealt with the death of my Navy pilot father, Commander Peter Rodrick, in a crash off the USS Kitty Hawk. To understand his life and death better, I pulled a Fielder and in 2010 embedded in the lives of Commander Hunter “Tupper” Ware and other naval aviators in VAQ-135, my dad's old squadron, as they flew missions “up the avenue” from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan. I did not cut corners, deploying with the Black Ravens for a month, passing a rigorous swim survival test and eventually getting up for a flight where I flew upside down over Mount Rainier. 


	Before comedy, Gravitt had been a naval officer on the USS Constellation, and both her father and brother had been navy pilots. I remembered her saying she learned more about the pilot life from my book than from her own family.

	Much has changed since then, both happy and unbearably sad. I had a son in 2013 who happened to be born on Nov. 28, the anniversary of my dad's crash. Amy's brother Michael died by suicide in 2023, reeling from mental health issues that had ended his second career as an airline pilot. 


	“This was after he flew commercially throughout the pandemic, an incredibly isolating time,” Gravitt tells me. “And, you have to understand that flying is the only thing I ever remember him wanting to do. Since he was a kid, he wanted to go to the Naval Academy and become a navy pilot. My understanding is that there was a day in the fall of 2022 where he was supposed to go in for a simulation, and he couldn't do it, something he'd done a million times before. But, he didn't feel like he could talk to anyone about it. And my parents called me one day out of the blue, and said Michael's not doing well. And nothing could be more shocking. For a short time, we had some of the closest conversations of our relationship, talking about our childhood, talking about everything. I thought he was doing better. And then, in August of 2023, my mom called and said he was gone.”

	Michael's death happened while Gravitt was overseeing the second season of The Rehearsal, Nathan Fielder's cracked-fun-house mirror of performance art where cringe comedy collides with personal improvement. As it happens, the show's second season centers around Fielder's longtime obsession with plane crashes caused by poor cockpit communication, specifically junior pilots being afraid to speak up when their captain was making questionable decisions and flying their aircraft into fatal peril. (In theory, a junior pilot can take control of the airplane if they think their captain is flying dangerously. In reality, this is fraught with career-killing implications.)


	After Gravitt's email, I watched the show's first episode. Fielder re-creates multiple dysfunctional conversations between pilot and co-pilot before their plane explodes into mountains, trees, and land. He watches the reenactment impassively from outside the cockpit, typing on a laptop strung over his shoulder as if he were a cigarette girl at a 1970s nightclub. I could feel my heart beating faster and my face went flush. I turned it off and went outside for air.


	Years before I started working on my book, an acquaintance in Sen. John McCain's office pushed through the bureaucracy and got me a declassified copy of my dad's accident report. It was 1979 and the hostages had just been taken in Iran, and the Kitty Hawk was steaming toward the Persian Gulf as your standard American show of strength. Fearful of being tracked by Soviet spy trawlers, the carrier's commanding officer instructed all aircraft to turn off their radar altimeter, a device that gives a precise reading of altitude more accurately than the standard barometric altimeter. Being off by 50 or 100 feet isn't a big deal when you're flying at 10,000 feet, but my dad was flying at 200 feet, skimming the ocean at 500 mph. All that was found of his EA-6B Prowler was an oil slick and bits of a white helmet bobbing on a blue sea. The report suggested he caught a wing as he banked into a turn. But that wasn't what changed my world. The report implied that my father was flat-hatting, flying below clearly stated regulations. The fact that he was the squadron commanding officer likely prevented the other three junior officers on the plane from speaking up.

	“There was one officer who wouldn't fly with your dad,” a member of his squadron told me in 2012 as we sat in a Newark Airport Hilton Garden Inn on a rainy day as he enjoyed a day off from his FedEx pilot duties. “The guy knew it would probably kill his career, but he felt something in his bones.” 

	











	The information altered my vision of my father. Before, he was a Naval Academy whiz kid who, legend has it, tutored Navy quarterback Roger Staubach in calculus and was one of the youngest squadron commanders in the Navy. Now, I had to confront the idea that his recklessness had created four widows and five fatherless children.


	I thought I'd said goodbye to all that in my book and had little desire to revisit it. But then I watched more of The Rehearsal. Describing Fielder's sometimes bleak, sometimes hilarious show to the unwatched is like trying to catch water with a net. Let's just say Fielder's re-creation of pilots' struggles includes dozens of actors playing roles from passengers to security personnel in a replica of a terminal at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, three cloned dogs, autistic kids, and Fielder's rebirth as baby Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the pilot who landed a US Airways plane on the Hudson without any loss of life. 


	Fielder's intricate and sometimes inconceivable work reminded me of Brian Wilson's Smile session where the mad genius played his piano in a sandbox. The key difference being Fielder actually finished his masterwork. The chef's kiss in the season finale is the reveal that Fielder spent two years getting his pilot license and was eventually approved to fly a 737. He dodges and ducks a potential autism diagnosis — a much-written theory about Fielder's social interactions that potentially could get him grounded from flying. Eventually, he takes the actors from the show for a two-hour flight. 


	Gravitt thought my background might lead to an interesting conversation, so I met with Fielder and Gravitt in her HBO office, sitting in the chair where Fielder first pitched the Season Two idea back in 2023. Fielder was dressed L.A. casual in a gray crewneck sweater, athletic pants, and running shoes. He was more forthcoming and less inscrutable than his image, with a few notable exceptions. Still, I did make sure to stagger our trips to the HBO washroom in respect to both his and my neuroses. 


	The three of us talked for two hours. Here is an edited version of our conversation.


Tell me how this idea started forming in your head.


Fielder: I've had this weird fascination with commercial aviation disasters for almost 20 years. There was a show in Canada that would talk about crash investigations. The thing that really fascinated me at first is that when a crash happens, how much effort the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] or the investigators in whatever country it happens in put into making sure that whatever caused it does not happen again. I started to notice they're really good at fixing these technical things, but the human stuff seems to keep happening over and over again. For years, I would say to friends of mine if I needed a conversation topic, “Hey, did you know that there's this thing that happens in crashes where one person might understand that there's a problem, the other person sees it differently, and the person that maybe has the better path is afraid to vocalize?”

	










“I've had this weird fascination with commercial aviation disasters for almost 20 years.”


Gravitt: That question became the pitch for this season.


Fielder: When you think about the person flying your plane, you don't want to really think about them. You want to think they're just a perfect person who is fully confident and knows what they're doing in every way.


You don't want to see them at the Hilton bar the night before.


Fielder: Well, you don't want to see them at the Hilton bar, but you also just don't even want to think about the idiosyncrasies they have that aren't even problems, like they make too many jokes. I think the show is about how much of your true self you show and how to compensate for that with other means while having the fear of what others might think of you.


I was intrigued by how enthusiastic the pilots were about participating. In my book, I wrote about Tupper, who was the skipper of my dad's old squadron and how other officers were coming up to him saying, “I can't believe you're letting someone else follow you around. He's going to hold your career in his hands, and you're just going to tell him everything about how lonely you are” and this and that. But I think he felt grateful he had someone he could talk to who was not a licensed therapist, which would go on his permanent record. (The fear of being grounded for a mental health issue is a constant fear of pilots and is explored by Fielder in The Rehearsal.) That seems to be the case with many of the pilots who participate in your show.


Fielder: Going into this, I was like, “Are any pilots going to want to be a part of this, given the tone of the show and what it's like?” But to our surprise, people were so game and really wanted to talk to us. They started texting the producers and sort of being like, “If you want to talk more, I'm around.”


Did you have any interest in learning to fly before?


Fielder: No. Before I even told this idea to Amy, I was like, “How real is this or how prominent is this thing? Is this very rare?” And so, I started learning to fly. I was insecure of the fact that I am just a comedian and no one will think I'm trying to explore this in a real way. And so I wanted to be able to talk to pilots and say, “Hey, I'm a pilot, too.” And I could actually talk and understand their experiences in ways that an outsider couldn't.


	It was so scary for me to do that. But the second I showed up and started interacting with people, I started to see the way communication happens and I'm like, “This is happening all the time.” And you're not always in an emergency scenario, so it doesn't matter. But the things that would be bad in an emergency were there.


Give me a specific example about communications issues from your flying experience.












Fielder: I can get paranoid that people aren't being honest with me. So, if I sense that from someone, I'll be like, “Tell me.” I'll try to create an environment that invites honest feedback. Because that's my biggest fear is if someone's upset or there's something that needs to be talked about and they're not sharing that. [In the series finale, Fielder repeatedly insists his co-pilot tell him everything he is feeling as he flies a 737.]


	Then I had a scenario that was with an instructor I only flew with once, who's not featured in the show. After you get your private pilot's license, there's something called an instrument rating. And that's where you learn to fly in cloud environments. But you have to be on a very specific flight plan to go into clouds. You can't just go into clouds by yourself. You need to be on an instrument flight plan. This flight, we weren't on an instrument flight plan, and we were too close to the clouds. 


	And I was like, “Should we be this close?” And he was like, “Well, that's not really a cloud.” And I was like, “I think it is a cloud.” And he's like, “No, no. I can see through to the other side, so it means that it's not really a cloud.” And I was OK, because he knows more than me and I trusted him.


	And so, we flew into the cloud and we didn't come out and we couldn't see. And I was like, “I think this is a cloud.” And he's like, “We'll pop out soon, don't worry.” And then another 10 seconds passed and we didn't. And I'm looking at the instruments to make sure, because you can spin out and things can happen. And I was panicking because I knew how wrong it was. 


	And these things don't get talked about. And I didn't tell anyone this. But what could I have done? I had my private pilot's license, so I could have said, “I'm uncomfortable with this. I'm taking over the controls,” but I sort of yielded to his authority. And I thought, maybe this guy just made a mistake and he had a bad day. But he didn't acknowledge after that, “Oh, that was wrong. I'm so sorry.” So I was just like, “Ugh.” But I didn't say anything.


	I mean I literally am doing a show on this thing, and I let the guy fly me into a cloud and my life is on the line, and I didn't stop it. Everything was happening that I knew was happening, but the pressure of that moment had me questioning my own —


I had that experience in my book, not just with my dad's crash but with Hunter, the skipper of the squadron I was writing about. The squadron was flying off the USS Nimitz after seven months to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island where they were based. It's a big deal. You do a flyover of the base before you land and your kids and your parents, everyone's there. It was an extra big deal for Hunter because it was his last big flight before he got booted up to a desk job. But he was sick as a dog. He had a 102 fever and was puking before he got on the airplane. He landed safely. Everything was fine, but every junior officer I talked to was like, there is no way in hell he should have been flying. But they just felt like they couldn't speak up.


Gravitt: Nathan, would you speak up now?

	










“I literally am doing a show on this thing, and I let the guy fly me into a cloud and my life is on the line, and I didn't stop it. “


Fielder: I don't know. If I'm still junior to the other pilot, I think I would still defer.


When did you guys have your first conversation about basing the second season around pilots?


Fielder: Amy called me up before Season One had finished airing, and she said, “We're going to announce a second season.” And I was like, “I don't have an idea. Should we wait?” And she said, “You'll figure it out.” For a while, I thought about another thing. Can we go off-the-record? [Fielder tells me of his other idea that may still be in play for a future season. Just the concept is appropriately surreal and astounding.]


Fielder: Months passed because I shot this other show [The Curse with Emma Stone] in between. So my mind was off it for a sec. Then in February of 2023, I came to Amy, and I've been flying for a month and a half at this point. At that point, I couldn't land the plane. I was still just learning how to turn the plane probably. But I'd been recording some of my lessons just because I knew, “Oh, if we do this, this will be interesting.” 


	And I showed her some of the footage of me trying to understand this world. And I thought it was really interesting, because here I am, I'm trying my best, and safety is at stake, and I'm really trying here, and I'm overwhelmed in these circumstances because it wasn't a natural thing for me.


Are you immediately having conversations about how we can do this in a meaningful way, but also funny?


Gravitt: Well, the funny, I don't worry about.


Fielder: You're saying this isn't funny enough right now?


No, absolutely not.


Gravitt: No, on the show.


Fielder: Oh! I thought you were saying let's pause the interview. And I was like, “Yes, you're right. This is not funny enough.” Anyway I said, “Did you know that the number one cause of commercial aviation crashes is this [communications]?” The number one contributing factor — it's not the sole cause, but it's a contributing factor. And Amy was like, “I didn't know that. That's interesting.”


	I told Amy that no one wants to think about what's going on with pilots. And Amy was like, “You know, I'm from a family of pilots.”


Did you know that at the time?


Fielder: I did know, but I sort of forgot.


Gravitt: So my dad was a Navy fighter pilot and he flew F-4s and A-4s, and was commanding officer of a reserve squadron in Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. And my brother then went on to go to the Naval Academy and fly C-2s and C-9s in the Navy. And when it came time for me to go to school, I decided that I wanted to go to Duke and, in order to do that, I applied for an ROTC scholarship and joined Navy ROTC at Duke. And when I graduated, I did not become a Navy pilot, but I joined the Supply Corps and then was stationed on an aircraft carrier at the USS Constellation down in San Diego and was on a deployment with your friend Hunter.


Did your father or later your brother talk about, “Oh, I had a hairy night coming back to the carrier,” or was it not really talked about?


Gravitt: I never heard those stories. 

	











Nathan, I've enjoyed your work, but when I heard what the subject of this season was, I couldn't imagine how it could be funny. 


Fielder: I totally get that. And yeah, the show opens with recreations of real people who died in crashes. And as you put these things together and as you are shaping the story, in the planning stages or in the edit, you sort of think, “OK, this is heavy. There haven't been any jokes.” That is my insecurity. So if I'm watching something for long enough and I'm like, “This isn't that funny,” I feel like I need to say it out loud. [Fielder does this about 10 minutes into the first episode.]


	I don't want to just do a serious thing because that's not really what I do best. But every time you go into a new thing, there's a huge chance it's going to go so badly and that you won't get the tone right. Because the tone always ends up being different than I picture it. You can sort of nudge the tone a little or juxtapose things in a different order, but it sort of feels how it feels, and you have to be like, I guess this is what it is.


Because my dad was a navy pilot, I'm always early to things. Just before we met, I was sitting down in my car in the garage looking at a Reddit about the show and some people were writing, “Listen, he doesn't care about the issue. It's just a launching point for him to do the show.” And the other half were like, “No, no, man, he did all this research.”


Fielder: Can I say something quickly?


Absolutely.


Fielder: Just because this has been in my head that I've been, for just a few minutes, I've been like, “I need to mention this.” But I know I talked about this flight instructor with the cloud. The people who trained me to fly were really good, and all my instructors were very, very, very good. Even though this guy was good in some ways, I'm not going to fly with him again. And that incident doesn't reflect on the people who taught me.


That will be conveyed.


Fielder: OK, so I'm doing the pilot training and I witness these communications in the cockpit, so I'm like, this exists and it exists at every level and it exists in every industry. At the beginning I was like, “Oh, maybe we will look into other industries, too.” But I feel like if you take any two random people and make them talk, it will be the most uncomfortable thing you've ever witnessed. I worked on Canadian Idol and I actually used to do that. I'd pair up two contestants and I'd put a camera on them. I'd be like, “OK, just talk.” They never put it in the show, but to me it was really funny because they just couldn't.


But you wanted people to take you seriously, right? A major thread of the season is just trying to get Congress to hold a hearing on these issues.


Fielder: Well, I want to keep making jokes while being taken somewhat seriously. When we were putting this together, that was an uphill battle, a real problem to overcome for me. And I thought, “Well, this is actually a challenge because of how I'm viewed, so this will be interesting.”

	











The first episode features the recreation by actors of actual communication or lack of communication between the pilot and his junior officer that led to these disasters. I wonder if there was one in particular that really stood out and left you thinking, “Wow, I can see why this happened.”


Fielder: The one where the guy created a dynamic of, “Oh, I want it to have a jokey vibe.” 


	[The captain tells the co-pilot, “You gotta have fun,” and how he can't wait to get a Philly cheesesteak. Visibility drops and the co-pilot says he “can't see shit.” The captain replies, “Because you're a bitch.” The plane crashes seconds later.]


	I've been in conversations with people like that, where I feel like they want to have it more jokey, and I'm intimidated because I can't always be like that. Especially when I was younger, I felt a pressure to not want to be a stick in the mud. All the interactions feel like they aren't specific to cockpits and flying. When someone is like, “Let's do that, let's joke,” they are setting the tone and the tone can be very oppressive to an environment. 


	I was just in Japan, and it's a totally different atmosphere there based on how everyone communicates. And you just sort of adapt to what's around you. I think everyone sort of does it.


Sure.


Fielder: Anyways. I'm not doing good with this interview, am I?


No, you're fine.


Fielder: OK. Am I doing OK?


No, this is good. Obviously the final episode when you disclose you're licensed to fly 737s is quite the shock. 


Fielder: Initially I thought being a pilot was going to be more part of it, not just the end. We have a lot of [footage of] me talking to pilots throughout about my experience as a pilot, and we made a choice in the edit to take those interactions out. And basically we thought, it's going to be better story-wise to leave this for the end.


When did you decide to fly the 737 with passengers as part of the show?


Fielder: I wanted to get to a place with my license where I felt like I understood things. Because if you just take a couple lessons, you just don't know enough. If you get a commercial pilot's license, you can't fly the big planes, but you can fly. I wanted to know enough to be able to understand them, because a lot of these pilots are right after that level.


They're young.












Fielder: They're young, and they have to get a lot of hours. But when you have to build hours to get to the 1,500 hours that you need to fly for an airline, a lot of people are flying alone — if you're in a small plane, you only need one pilot. So a lot of flying has no interaction component.


	You go right from the simulator to flying a plane with passengers and the social aspect becomes so important. It's almost like Covid or something where people forget how to interact.


One of the themes of the show is that pilots are closed off and won't talk about their problems, whether for personal or professional reasons. Amy, you told me your brother had just reached a point psychologically where he couldn't get into the simulator anymore and that he stopped flying. He took his own life in 2023. I can't imagine dealing with this subject right after losing your brother. Did you ever feel like, “I give the show my blessing, but I just can't handle the subject matter?”


Gravitt: I never thought about not doing the show. I do remember when we went to dinner a couple months after he died, we were able to talk about what had happened and how it related to the show, and we agreed that we would take it as it came.


Fielder: When Amy told me about her brother, I remember saying to her, “We don't have to do this season if you don't want to.” And I was a little joking, but not fully joking. 


Gravitt: I feel like not doing this season would have been doubling down on everything we're talking about and the conversations that people aren't having. Do I think that if my brother had seen this season of the show that he would still be alive? No. But it's important.


Tell me what it was like watching Episode Three which will always be remembered for the way that Nathan inhabits Sully Sullenberger's life but is also about pilots shutting down and not dealing with their mental issues.


Gravitt: It was a year and a half after losing Michael, and I watched it and sobbed. I had a lot of the reactions everybody else did to the big set pieces of the Sully story, but it was so grounded in a tragic experience of mine that ultimately, I don't even necessarily think of that as much as I do the therapist's office at the end, and pilots going in. [The episode features a heart-wrenching montage of lonely pilots talking to Fielder's staff about their lives, desperate to communicate their problems as long as it is out of the standard mental health community.]


	I also feel a lot of relief for them when I watch it. It's that simultaneous feeling of relief for the pilots who are able to talk to Nathan, and sadness, because one of the things that I think about when I think about my brother in the end was how alone he felt.


Nathan, when you were reading Sullenberger's book were you struck by how much he dismissed any trouble he was having in his life? 












Fielder: Not right away because at first it was just sort of like, “OK, yes, this is a pilot who did the right thing in terms of trying to open up the channels of communication. This is interesting. What would it look like if you took on his personality?” And so you're reading the book to understand living his life in chronological order. But then we started talking about, well, why is he including these moments? Because some were so odd, like putting rocks in his sister's mouth. I was like, “Why is this in a book?” And he would have a way of talking about a story after it happened, if it was sort of a bad thing, he would try to be like, “Yeah, it was bad, but it really wasn't that bad.” And he'd try to undercut the actual drama of his life in this interesting way.


Gravitt: He's creating order in his brain.


Fielder: It made us look into, well, what is he trying to avoid here? We've talked to these other pilots who are saying this is a big issue with pilots — they can't talk about these things. 


Gravitt: Stephen, it makes sense to me, though, how you were talking about Hunter being willing to talk to you. It's very public, but somehow it's safer than talking to somebody in your inner circle or a peer.


	Nathan, I think this is important because of where the episode ends up. 


OK, on to some of the most remarkable filmmaking that I've ever seen. Did you fear that the breastfeeding scene where the mother is a giant puppet and you're wearing a diaper as Baby Sully might overwhelm everything else?


Fielder: Yeah, I mean everything could have been a huge disaster. With every joke you're like, is this too dumb or is it not? And sometimes it's not dumb enough. You can make that mistake too, where it's too subtle and people don't even understand what you're trying to do or something. And this is impossible to convey and people might not believe me, but when that puppet was holding me, I did feel like a mom was holding me. It was cozy. And you feel a big hand patting you. And these visual illusions for me, being in this set, work better in weird ways than you would think. You're doing these exact recreations, and it does something to the tone of the whole thing that I can't quite explain. There's a point, too, where if you try hard at something, people are like, “Well, this is dumb.” But then if you try even harder, then people are just like, “I can't even judge. I just need to watch because of the effort that's put in.”

“With every joke you're like, is this too dumb or is it not? And sometimes it's not dumb enough. “


The one thing that I want to know just as a viewer, because it seems so real at the moment, was the milk coming out too fast? Is that why you said “Fuck”? I mean, were you literally choking? Or was that a line?


Fielder: No, I didn't know how that was going to go. We had a rig that they showed me how it was going to work. And I was like, “Let's just do it.” And then we just did it, but I didn't think through enough to “OK, I have no control over stopping this breast.” So when I would put my mouth over it, it was coming in faster than I could swallow. So it just came out too fast, but I was like, I don't know, maybe this is what it's like for a baby. But it was oat milk.

	











This season, you play off the fact that people have theorized that you might be autistic. Was that a means to an end, or did you feel comfortable doing that? (In The Rehearsal, Fielder tries to get a congressional hearing on pilot communication. When he realizes a key congressman is on both on the aviation safety committee and a member of the Autism Caucus, Fielder becomes a member of an autism advisory board. Fielder gets a brain MRI but doesn't receive the results until after the 737 flight and, when he does get them, he clicks off a voicemail message before getting any details.)


Fielder: It felt like an interesting way to describe what might be happening as it relates to the acting stuff, the ability to be your true self or not. And that question of sincerity, or how to appear sincere, and how people tend to judge others, and what they judge others based on. And I think pilots are doing that and I think a lot of people are doing that.


	And these things are out of your control. They're not things you can practice for. These are just parts of who you are. You could try to be like, “No, I'm not having that thought. I'm not having that bad thought.” I don't know what the answer is really, but going through that experience and going as far as I did with the pilot stuff, I feel it. I understand it in a way where it's a powerful force. And it seems to be directly related to maybe what pilots are experiencing.


But are you trying to say anything personally about yourself?


Fielder: I'm trying to … I don't know.


OK. That's fine. You've been very forthcoming. If we hit on a stumper, that's OK.


Gravitt: There was a real reaction from the autism community to the first season of the show.


Fielder: The first season of the show, there were all these articles. It's interesting to read that and see that. I sometimes find it amusing. Whenever people tell me about how I am, I think it's interesting. People are evaluating me through a TV show that's edited. And as much as you try to control things about yourself and your image, certain things seep through that you can't control. But you're also trying to control things with how you shape a story and all that.


Amy, what was your reaction when you watched cuts from the show?


Gravitt: When I met Nathan, never in a million years did I think that he would zero in on this subject, and then at the same time, I would lose my brother to suicide based on a lot of the conversations that he's tapping into. I know how important it was to him when I sat in the edit bay and watched them.

	











Fielder: I was so nervous to send the episodes to Amy, especially number three and number six, because I know what she has gone through, and I'm sensitive that this has converged in some way. My biggest fear would've been to violate that trust or let her down. And so it was a big relief when she said, “It's really good, it's really good,” after she watched the final cut.


Gravitt: I was sobbing. To sit and watch that and both be so overwhelmed because there are small moments in it that make me think of my brother, but also being proud of the work that he's done and the years he put in. I don't mean to sound like I'm a parent, but I feel that way in this situation.


Fielder: We're trying to make the person watching a TV screen and probably on their phone at the same time feel something. And if you can do any of that, that feels like a win these days.

	Nobody likes Carl Morck — mostly because he makes it clear early and often how little he likes them. Everything and everyone is an opportunity to complain. He's an English cop stuck working in Scotland because of a marriage that's long over. He's much smarter than everyone else in his department, with the possible exception of his partner Hardy — and even thoughts of Hardy make him angry, because the series opens with both of them being shot by an unknown criminal, leaving Carl with a nasty scar on his neck and Hardy partially paralyzed. 


	When he meets a constable from a small Scottish isle, Carl tries to feign small talk by suggesting the local weather doesn't agree with him. “I've known you for all of two minutes,” the constable says, “and already I get the feeling that there's not much that does agree with you.”  


	So, no, Carl, played by Matthew Goode, is not an easy man to like, let alone love. Yet the show built around him — Dept. Q, a new Netflix series adapted from the Danish noir novels by Jussi Adler-Olsen — turns out to be startlingly likable, and also sad, and funny, and scary, and thrilling. It is, like its central character, awfully good at what it does, but it doesn't share his need to make everyone within earshot miserable. 

	











	This is the third Netflix series from creator Scott Frank. His first was the ambitious (at times overly so) Western Godless, which won three Emmys. The second was the period chess drama The Queen's Gambit, which won 11 Emmys and made a star of Anya Taylor-Joy. Where Frank wrote and directed all the installments of the previous shows, this one is more of a collaboration; the first episode, for instance, was co-written by Chandni Lakhani. It's also much more straightforward than those two, built for the long haul of adapting as many of Adler-Olsen's books as Netflix will pay for. Based on the nine-episode first season, a long run would be a very welcome one. 

	











	The series opens with Carl and Hardy (Jamie Sives) being shot in what seems like a routine crime scene, then jumps ahead a few months to Carl's return to work, where no one feels much sympathy for him because he's such a deliberately abrasive prick. “Do you ever stop and wonder why people hate you?” his boss, Moira (Kate Dickie), asks. “No,” he says with a shrug.

	When Moira is given a large government grant to set up a cold-case squad, largely as a publicity stunt, she sees an opportunity to kill multiple birds with one stone. She assigns Carl to be a one-man squad working out of a basement office that used to be a men's restroom (there are still toilets there), so no one else will have to deal with him, and she embezzles most of the grant money to upgrade the equipment the rest of her department uses. 


	But then Carl somehow finds himself the leader of an entire island of misfit toys who are as broken as he is. Akram (Alexej Manvelov), a refugee who was a cop of some kind — he won't elaborate — in his native Syria, gets hired to be Carl's assistant, and quickly proves to be a cross between Lester Freamon from The Wire (they even both favor sweater vests) and a smaller Jack Reacher. Rose (Leah Byrne), who has been stuck doing clerical work ever since she had a mental breakdown caused by a terrible on-the-job accident, realizes she can do real work again if she transfers to the basement, and proves to be a dogged investigator who just needs to assert herself more. And Carl realizes that a new case is just the thing to pull Hardy out of his spiral of self-pity. They've all been discarded and underestimated, and all of them are capable of much more than the dead-end job to which they've been assigned. 


	It is, in other words, Slow Horses: PD, with a bit more warmth and significantly less flatulence. The first of these books predates the first Slow Horses novel by a few years — many of them have already been turned into films in Denmark — but the themes and tone are similar enough to appeal to anyone who's fallen for Gary Oldman and company on the Apple spy series.

	The first season primarily covers a single case: the disappearance of Merritt Lingard (Chloe Pirrie), a local prosecutor who's just as off-putting in her own way as Carl. (Moira describes them both as blunt instruments.) But in addition to learning a whole lot about Merritt through flashbacks and other means, we also keep up with the investigation into who shot Carl and Hardy, see Carl struggle to connect with the stepson his ex left in his care, and follow Carl's unsurprisingly bumpy attempt to get PTSD counseling from therapist Rachel Irving (Kelly Macdonald). That last subplot is charmingly awkward, as Dr. Irving gradually finds ways to get useful advice through her patient's thick skull, while Carl the workaholic detective starts to figure out that she's a broken toy just like the rest of them.  

	











	The whole cast is terrific, and the actors complement one another well. Goode is an exposed nerve, ready to lash out at anyone around him for the slightest offense, which makes him a good match for Manvelov's understated cool as Akram, who is clearly much more dangerous than his reserved and polite demeanor would suggest. Macdonald continues to be an excellent light comedian when given the chance, and plays Dr. Irving with just enough of an edge to make it clear that we should be very troubled by Carl's behavior, no matter how amusing much of it is. 


	But then, among the best things that Frank and company do is to let the grief and farce peacefully coexist. This is a funny show when it wants to be, a scary one when it wants to be, and a poignant one when it wants to be — which is much more than you might expect at first. But it never feels like whiplash when Dept. Q shifts from one tone to the next, sometimes even within the same scene. There are supporting characters — like Shirley Henderson as Claire, former housekeeper to Merritt, and caretaker for her developmentally disabled brother — who seem like caricatures at first, only to wind up as key pieces of scenes that may have you reaching for a tissue or three. 


	The mystery of where Merritt disappeared to, and why, perhaps doesn't need nine hours. But the pleasure of extra time spent around this group of improbably brilliant, low-fi sleuths — Rose busts out a magnifying glass at one point, while Hardy is fond of quoting 1930s armchair detective hero Nero Wolfe — more than justifies any unnecessary twists to the main story.

	While Rose is using a piece of Hardy's advice to take another go at a reluctant witness, he asks her, “Are you even a real cop?” She admits, “I often ask myself the same question.” By that point, the only question I had was whether Netflix will be able to churn out additional seasons as quickly and reliably as Apple has with Slow Horses.


All nine episodes of Dept. Q are now streaming on Netflix. I've seen the whole season.

Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration was short, but by no means merciful. As the 130 days of Musk's “special employee” status in the White House expire, the world's richest man is leaving the government with shattered public approval, furious investors, and a to-go bag of grift and corruption to ensure the whole ordeal was worth his time.


	On Wednesday night, Musk wrote on X: “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” 


	“The @DOGE  mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” Musk added. 


	The full legacy of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its role in the early days of Trump's second administration will likely take years to articulate in full. As of now, what is clear is that Musk overpromised, under delivered, and executed his mandate to “reduce wasteful spending” in such a manner that the cost of the resulting chaos, backtracking, lawsuits, and downstream damage may end up wiping out any theoretical gains made by the “department.”

	Even harder to pinpoint will be the extent of Musk's personal and corporate opportunism while elbow deep in the viscera of the federal government. Excluding English kings, it's hard to conceive of any figure in the history of American governance who was granted such wide-reaching, unchecked, and unaccountable power to meddle with the mandates of elected representatives. Despite acting as a superseding Cabinet official — to the point where the president was forced to clarify that members of his Cabinet did actually have authority over their agencies — as a Special Government Employee (SGE), Musk was spared the rigors of a confirmation hearing. 

	











	While some SGEs are required to submit public financial disclosures, Musk's was filed confidentially. This despite his known financial relationships with the Trump campaign, his foreign business relationships, and his various disputes with government oversight agencies that interact with his companies.

	When asked how the administration would handle any potential conflicts of interest, the White House claimed that Musk would self-police should any arise. 


	He did not. 


	In 130 days, Musk's team at DOGE fired a slew of employees at federal departments and agencies investigating his companies — including Tesla, Neuralink, and SpaceX — on a variety of issues, including safety violations, employee lawsuits, violations of securities laws, and medical research malpractice. 


	Musk has also worked to intertwine the work of various federal agencies with the products produced by his companies. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that DOGE had been using a customized version of Musk's AI bot “Grok” to analyze government data. In March, the Federal Aviation Administration began approving the use of Starlink on commercial aircraft, and reports emerged claiming the FAA was considering cancelling a $2 billion dollar contract with Verizon in favor of the Musk-owned company. In one of the most unforgettable moments of the new administration, Trump staged an improvised Tesla showroom in front of the White House and vamped like a used car salesman when Musk's government antics began to tank the stock price of his electric vehicle company.

	The billionaire is leaving government not only because the time he can legally spend as a SGE has expired, but because the leadership of his flagship companies — Tesla and SpaceX — have seemingly demanded he stop using his “chainsaw for bureaucracy” to destroy their public image and refocus his attention on their needs. 


	As Musk slithers away from his stint as the effective co-president of the nation, his social media pontification about the need for “transparency” in government rings hollower than ever. The billionaire has installed a web of loyalists throughout the federal government that will continue to work on his behalf even as he attempts to lay low for the sake of his tech empire, and there is still no oversight mechanism to ensure public accountability. It may have only been 130 days, but Musk will likely go down in history as one of the most destructive unelected bureaucrats in American history.

	Andy Greene



John Fogerty could have celebrated his 80th birthday with a quiet family meal at home or a private party with his closest friends. Instead, he gathered nearly 3,000 people in New York's Beacon Theatre, took the stage alongside his longtime band — which includes his sons Shane Fogerty and Tyler Fogerty — and played an explosive set of Creedence classics and solo hits that showcased a level of energy, vocal power, and swagger few of rock's octogenarians outside of Mick Jagger can muster.


	Before the show even started, Fogerty appeared on a large screen and addressed the crowd. “It's been quite a journey to get to this big eight-oh,” he said. “Thank you for coming along on this journey with me. I appreciate each and every one of you, every little dip and turn in the road..It's such an honor to have people know all your words. Thank you for singing these songs all these years. I just really love performing live with my sons in this band, especially as they grow into adulthood and become really good. That sense of joy about making music is really real.”

	











	He proved that by walking out onto a riser stationed between two bright, billowing smoke machines, and kicking into “Proud Mary” as confetti rained down on the audience. He followed it with “Up Around the Bend,” “Green River,” “Born on the Bayou,” “Who'll Stop the Rain,” and “Lookin' Out My Back Door.” Like the vast majority of the Creedence Clearwater Revival catalog, these songs came out in a little sliver of time between 1968 and 1970 when Fogerty somehow wrote a significant chapter of the Great American Songbook entirely by himself.

	This golden period was followed by many dark years where the bitter breakup of the band and a nasty spat with his former label head caused Fogerty to turn away from the Creedence legacy. When he finally launched a solo tour in 1986, he disappointed crowds all across America by refusing to perform even a single CCR song. He wouldn't relent until 1997, a quarter of a century after the band split. By that point, the Creedence rhythm section of Doug Clifford and Stu Cook had recruited a new singer and were touring under the banner Creedence Clearwater Revisited.

	But Clifford and Cook quietly dissolved their band in 2020. Two of their former compatriots, guitarist Kurt Griffey and vocalist Dan McGuinness, have attempted to keep the CCR flag flying by booking shows as Revisiting Creedence, but they are essentially a tribute band to a tribute band. That means Fogerty is now the only authentic member of the band keeping the music alive. He bills many of his shows today as “John Fogerty Celebrates His Songs From Creedence Clearwater Revival,” just so there's no confusion about who created this music.


	But the 80th birthday show at the Beacon wasn't merely a Creedence retrospective. Midway through, he broke out his 1997 solo cut “Joy Of My Life.” It's a tribute to his wife, Julie, who was parked on the side of the stage all night, beaming with joy. “Julie is the one,” he told the crowd. She is the rock in our family. I wouldn't even be standing here if it wasn't for Julie. We recently celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary. Somewhere along the way, I wrote this song for her.”


	Later in the night, he also revisited his Eighties solo hits “Centerfield” and “The Old Man Down the Road.” Vintage baseball cards flashed on the screen during the former, and Fogerty's daughter Kelsy came out for a brief guitar jam with her brothers on the latter. The man set wrapped up with a fiery “Fortunate Son” as fake dollar bills fell down from the rafters.


	Before the encore, Fogerty sat down in a folding chair and told the crowd about his upcoming LP, Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years. (For much more on that, check out David Browne's recent interview with Fogerty.) The crew then wheeled out a birthday cake, but Fogerty had no time to cut a slice for himself or anyone else. He instead wrapped up the show by ripping through “Travelin' Band,” “Bad Moon Rising,” and a quick repose of “Proud Mary,” taking the night full circle.

	The 80th birthday celebration continues Thursday night with an encore show at the Beacon before heading over to Europe in June and July for a run of festival dates, including Glastonbury. The last show on the books is stop at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Quincy, Massachusetts, on August 3rd for a special event commemorating the 400th anniversary of the town.


	But there's every reason to believe Fogerty will keep touring for the foreseeable future. A 90th birthday concert in 2035 may seem like a distant dream, but there's little reason to think it won't happen, considering how oddly vital he remains as he kicks off his eighties.

Keanu Reeves is angel on a mission to make the world a better place. But first, he'll need to find a lost soul. 


	The trailer for Good Fortune, Aziz Ansari‘s feature directorial debut, dropped on Wednesday, opening with Reeves as Gabriel, a hopeful angel looking to be promoted from the unfulfilling roll of saving people from texting-and-driving accidents. His fellow angel Martha, played by the always phenomenal Sandra Oh, recommends he find someone worth saving, which leads to Gabriel standing on a Denny's sign before spotting Ansari's hapless character and declaring “I'm here to save you.”


	Upon learning of his guardian angel's past credentials, Ansari exclaims, “Wait. You're telling me I have a budget guardian angel?!”


	While the trailer doesn't give much away in terms of plot (a rarity these days), Gizmodo previously reported that a Lionsgate presentation at CinemaCon 2024 offered a closer look at the project written, produced, and directed by Ansari. As part of Gabriel's solution to showing Ansari's character that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the Hollywood, the well-meaning angel body-swaps him with an uber-rich jerk, played by Seth Rogen. When Ansari refuses to switch back, chaos naturally ensues. 

	











	The film also stars Keke Palmer, and is produced by Ansari, Anthony Katagas and Alan Yang, with Ansari  Christopher Woodrow, Connor DiGregorio, and Jonathan McCoy executive producing.

	When speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Ansari said he hopes the film will bring back the type of R-rated comedies Rogen became known for in the aughts and 2010s.

	“I feel like people are like, ‘Oh, no one goes to comedies and theaters anymore.' It's like, well, they haven't really been making a lot of them, you know what I mean?” he told the outlet. “So I hope this movie shows that people do want to see comedies at theaters and that it just leads to people making s—ty ripoffs of Good Fortune.“


Good Fortune is slated to hit theaters on Oct. 17.

Travis Roberts is emphasizing the “alt” in alt-country. On his debut album, Rebel Rose, coming Aug. 1 on New West Records, the Amarillo, Texas, songwriter channels the punk sounds of Jimmy Eat World, the power-pop of Gin Blossoms, and the grit of the album that changed his life, Steve Earle's Copperhead Road.


	Roberts announced his album today with the release of the song “Bellmarie,” a hard-charging slice of country-rock.


	“‘Bellmarie' is a song about an old coworker and a dear friend of mine,” Roberts says. “She's super into all the ‘stars determine your fate,' and I could never really get into that. When she started dating this dude and found out his ‘birth sign,' things didn't end out too well. I guess she's happy now. I don't know. I haven't checked in a while, but at least the song is good.”


	Roberts, who's often on the road with his band, the Willing Few, says his music is a mix of jangly rock & roll (“God, I love the Telecaster,” he says) and the emo-leaning punk he was raised on. “My musical influences have changed a bit since we first cut this thing, but there are some that have stuck around that bleed all over the record. I dig a lot of roots rock and nostalgic Americana stuff like Bruce Springsteen, the Byrds, Bob Dylan, and the Dead,” he says, “but I've never been able to kill the emo kid in me that listened to Dropkick Murphys, Jimmy Eat World, the Wonder Years, and the Front Bottoms either. Mix those together and add a bit of West Texas trauma, and you get my record.”

A mysterious sphere fell from the sky in Colombia and nobody knows if it is a UFO or modern art

Some have called it an object of extraterrestrial origin (UFO), and others have considered it an art project, but the only absolute truth is that a sphere has crossed the sky of the city of Buga, in Colombia. Researchers in Colombia are trying to explain the origin of a metallic sphere, without welding marks or having passed through human hands, which flew over the sky of the city before landing. This event, which seems to have a more terrestrial than martian ending, adds to the thousands of sightings that occur in America, surrounded by that uncertainty of whether there will be life beyond our atmosphere.

With some marks that have been defined as unusual, the shell covering this sphere is completely metal. Jose Luis Vazquez, one of the researchers, stated that these marks are what most attracted his attention, along with the lack of “welds and joints” marks. However, the researcher has not provided anything else that could indicate the extraterrestrial origin of this object.

On the other hand, Julia Mossbridge, founder and president of the Institute for Love and Time, also stated “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things we don't understand, but we're investigating them.”

Despite having devoted many years of his life to the research of bodies and objects whose origin remains unknown or difficult to explain, Mossbridge declared that he considers it a great art project and added that, Just as we humans are still learning that there are things that escape our knowledge, coming from our cubs and our seabed, the artist could have been inspired by this very reason for his creation. However, while she claims not to have seen enough evidence to determine that it is an extraterrestrial object, she does feel it is still too early to rule out that it can shed light on the nature of life on our planet.

The interest in UFO sightings is not new or revolutionary, but it is true that the number of people interested has increased. This is reflected in the number of hearings that have been held at the Congress with the purpose of giving an explanation to the sighting of these phenomena.

There have been cases where former members of the state security forces, already inactive, have made public data that had been kept hidden behind this issue. This is the case of a former air force officer who has stated that the United States government has been conducting investigations into such crews for more than 10 years.

The belief that we are not alone in the universe and that there is life beyond our planet Earth is not new. The number of people who are interested in this subject is increasing, so the recordings of sightings have also grown. There are many events that have not been explained and for which science or nature has not had an explanation.However, there is the totally opposite thinking, which mocks this belief and firmly believes that everything has a scientific explanation.The only certainty that can be declared as absolute truth is that many of these sightings have had a scientific or biological explanation.

Rumors that the real-life Annabelle doll has gone missing have been running rampant all-over social media. 

So much so, that it's caused quite a stir. 

It's even safe to say that those who know about the history surrounding the “demonically possessed” Raggedy Ann doll, are afraid in real-life. 

The old doll, which has become a fixture in the horror genre, is rumored to have escaped her casing as she traveled around the country on the Devils on the Run Tour hosted by the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). 

Apparently, in early May, Annabelle, which is typically housed at NESPR's Warren's Occult Museum, founded by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, made a tour stop in New Orleans. 

Somehow, rumors began to circulate online that the demonic doll had somehow gone missing while in Louisiana after some visitors claimed they didn't see the doll during the tour. 

Then, there was a recent fire at the nearby Nottoway Plantation-turned-Nottoway Resort in White Castle which intensified speculation that there was some sort of connection between the doll's supposed disappearance and the fire.

To squash the intensely troubling rumors, museum officials have spoken out about the doll's whereabouts. 

NESPR lead investigator Dan Rivera took to TikTok on Saturday to put an end to the swirling theories that the haunted doll had gone missing. 

“I'm here at the museum right now, and I just wanna show you guys that Annabelle ‘is' in the Warrens' Occult Museum,” Rivera said in a TikTok video. “Let's go inside and let's check.”

In the video, when he enters the museum, he walks over to show the haunted doll sitting in a wooden case. 

“Annabelle is not missing; she's not in Chicago,” he assured fans. He also mentioned to fans that they were, however, going to be at the 2025 Rock Island Roadhouse Esoteric Expo in Rock Island, Illinois, on October 4.

A notice was also posted on NESPR's Facebook account that read: “It's a Rumor... Annabelle has NOT been stolen. The doll is safely in place at the Warren Occult Museum.”

The Annabelle doll was first owned by a student in 1970, who requested help from the Warrens when she claimed Annabelle started “exhibiting malicious and frightening behavior.” 

Upon inspection, the Warrens discovered that the doll was “demonically possessed” by the spirit of a deceased girl.

                    Kajol in ‘Maa'
                                      

A mother's fury and protection stands in the way of demonic powers in the trailer for Maa, a new horror film starring Kajol. Directed by Vishal Furia (Chhorii, Chhorii 2), the film is a fresh chapter in the world of Shaitaan, a hit 2024 horror film starring Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan.

Much like Shaitaan, Maa centres on a family in peril. In the trailer, we meet a mother-daughter pair who take shelter in a forest. Besieged by evil roots and deadly sprites, they uncover the story of the ‘daitya', a demonic spirit from Bengali folkore. The local community, blinded by superstition and ritual sacrifice, compounds the air of threat. According to a synopsis, “MAA is the story of a mother who becomes Kali to end a demonic curse rooted in fear, blood, and betrayal.” 

With Kajol in the lead, the film also features Indraneil Sengupta, Kherin Sharma and Ronit Roy. 

Produced by Jio Studios and Devgn Films, Maa will release in theatres on June 27, 2025.

Check out what's to come with Countdown that has Supernatural vets all heated up. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Jensen Ackles may have spent the better part of two decades playing Dean Winchester on Supernatural, but that hasn't held him back from new shows in the wake of that series' ending. He flexed some very different acting muscles between Big Sky and The Boys, and now he's set to star in Countdown as his own Prime Video series in the 2025 TV schedule. After sharing the very first look back in early May, the star shared the full trailer on social media, and his former Supernatural co-stars hit the comment section with one clear consensus.

Also starring The Flash's Jessica Camacho and Grey's Anatomy's Eric ""McSteamy"" Dane, Countdown follows LAPD Detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) as he's recruited to be part of a secret task force, also comprised of undercover agents from other law enforcement branches. The stakes are sky-high, as one might expect from a project created by Chicago Fire co-creator (and longtime showrunner) Derek Haas! Whether or not you have an Amazon Prime subscription, check out the trailer for yourself:

As a fan of One Chicago – a.k.a. Derek Haas' former haunt on TV – and a survivor of fifteen seasons of Supernatural, I was already on board for Countdown based on the team behind it. The trailer has me more hyped than before, mostly because we get to see some personality from Jessica Camacho's character. She seems set up as Ackles' co-lead or at least secondary lead, so I'm glad to experience a bit of what she'll be bringing to the action.

Jensen Ackles spread the news of Countdown's latest look on Instagram, including the trailer with the message to ""Set your clocks"" for the June 25 premiere and a new poster with a less certain ""Clock's ticking?"" caption. I for one wasn't surprised to see that it didn't take long for some familiar Supernatural names to flood the comment section, but I didn't foresee them almost all having one thing in common. Take a look:

The consensus from Ackles' fellow Supernatural stars is apparently that the Countdown trailer is fire! Kathryn Newton, who played Claire Novak on The CW series, went for a straight compliment, and I just had to include the emojis from Danneel Ackles as well. After all, she did appear in five episodes of Supernatural, so she does count as an alum as well as the leading man's wife!

I think my favorite of the comments is Timothy Omundson's, though, and not just because I frequently get his songs from the short-lived Galavant stuck in my head. He went full caps-locks to show his support for Countdown, in a definite departure from what Cain would have done on Supernatural.

While I'm guessing Countdown won't pack in Supernatural cast members like The Boys has elsewhere on Prime Video under creator Eric Kripke, Ackles has teased that fans of Dean Winchester will find some familiarity in his new character. For now, the wait is on for Countdown's premiere on Wednesday, June 25 on Prime Video. In the meantime, you could always check out Supernatural streaming with a Netflix subscription as well. With 327 episodes over 15 seasons, there's enough to last anybody a while!

We had a listener reach out and share a photo from a UFO they saw over the Northland. Over the years, we've had quite a few people report unusual objects in the sky. I've interviewed quite a few folks who swear what they saw was real and unexplained.

Things that stick out the most are the irrelevant details in the UFO stories. It's the little anecdotal things that witnesses will include in their stories that make it believable. Why else would they mention an irrelevant detail, like I saw it because I was crossing the street to get a soda, and then I looked up and saw this thing in the sky?

I had a woman contact me and tell me her story of a huge, round oscillating UFO on the North Shore. She thought her neighbor was shooting off fireworks. She went to the window to see what was going on when she saw the huge UFO.

The most recent report we've become aware of is a sighting that took place in December. It was sent to me this week, and it shows a bizarre light in the sky. It glows, almost like it's on fire. Most UFO reports across the world deal with glowing orbs. Some describe the surface of the orbs as looking like the rolling flames of the sun.

The witness said the glowing light was in the air for 10 minutes before he took the picture. Once he took the picture, the object disappeared immediately. This may sound like a coincidence, but it is common for these unidentified objects to disappear after they've been seen or recorded.

The 148th Air National Guard is in that vicinity. Could it be a flare? If it were a fighter jet, and it was that close, you would definitely hear the rumble.

There were other reports of UFOs around Duluth in the same time frame. December 18th was an active day with 2 sightings in Duluth and 2 in Minneapolis. All of them were orbs or dots in the sky.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","World-renowned psychics predict apocalyptic end to 2025: ‘The worst is yet to come'","https://nypost.com/2025/05/29/lifestyle/world-renowned-psychics-predict-apocalyptic-end-to-2025/","Thu, 29 May 2025 14:01:00 GMT","

They're the Four Horsemen/-women of the apocalypse.

No need to seek a second opinion for Armageddon. The psychic stars aligned after four different prophets shared the same concerning prediction for an event that will allegedly transpire later this year.

Blind Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga,16th-century French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Athos Salomé and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula all believe that we will see the outbreak of World War III before year's end.

Vanga, who was born in 1911 as Vangeliya Pandeva Gushterova, has become known as the “Nostradamus of the Balkans” for her eerily prescient premonitions, including 9/11, Princess Diana's death and, more recently, climate change-induced earthquakes in 2025 that were similar to the deadly tremors that rocked Myanmar and Thailand last month.

Unfortunately, the doomsday seer also foresaw a war breaking out in Europe this year, which she saw as the start of “humanity's downfall” and a major blow to the global population, the Daily Mail reported.

Her warning was echoed by Nostradamus, better known as the “Prophet of Doom,” who is credited with forecasting calamities from Adolf Hitler's rise to the COVID-19 pandemic in his famed 1555 book “Les Prophéties.”

The French fiasco foreteller believes that this year, the UK will be drawn into the conflict.

“When those from the lands of Europe, see England set up her throne behind,” Nostradamus wrote in the tome. “Her flanks, there will be cruel wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so cruel, foes from within and without will arise.”

He added, “A great pestilence from the past returns, no enemy more deadly under the skies.”

Meanwhile, Brazilian psychic Athos Salomé, 38, who has been known as a living Nostradamus for predicting momentous events like Queen Elizabeth's death, also believes that WWIII is on our doorstep and that “the worst is yet to come.”

This conflict will be perhaps scarier than in years past, as tech and cyber warfare will become the modus operandi for 21st-century combatants.

“This is not just a war of men, but of machines, and in this aspect, what comes next?” lamented Salomé.

He was seemingly echoing techsperts' “Terminator”-esque warnings about the need to regulate artificial intelligence like nuclear weapons if humanity is to survive.

The fourth member of this apocalyptic quartet, London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, 38, believes that war could break out by the middle of this year due to a “lack of compassion in the world.”

Based on his psychic visions, “We will see horrific acts of human evil and violence toward each other in the name of religion and nationalism.”

These ominous warnings come at a particularly volatile time. 

Earlier this month, Pakistan and India launched strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations, prompting US calls for the nuclear-armed neighbors to begin talks and nip the escalating conflict in the bud. 

And while they agreed to a ceasefire, the truce was seemingly shaken just hours later by fighting in the disputed Kashmir region.

Meanwhile, there appears to be no end in sight for the ongoing Russo-Ukraine War, which saw at least seven people killed last week during a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and other regions in the country.

President Trump gave Vladimir Putin a deadline to prove he's serious about ending the Ukraine war — after the Kremlin revealed Thursday the Russian leader has no plans to hash it out with his US counterpart.

Putin had reportedly disclosed a list of demands for ending the conflict, which critics felt were identical to the leader's stance before launching his invasion more than three years ago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Off Kerala coast, a washed-up container from a sunken ship sparks curiosity, conspiracy theories and some chemistry guesses","https://indianexpress.com/article/long-reads/kerala-ship-sink-oil-container-10036538/","Thu, 29 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A lone, battered shipping container that has washed up on the beach in Paravur, a small fishing hamlet between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, is the talk of the town. The reddish-brown container, like many more than have beached all along Kerala's coast following the recent sinking of a Liberia-registered ship, has piqued curiosity and, for now, taken a daily staple off the plates of most households in these parts – fish.

On Sunday, May 25, MSC Elsa 3, an 184-metre-long container ship, sank while it was sailing from Vizhinjam port to Cochin port, triggering alarm in coastal hamlets all the way from Alappuzha in mid-north Kerala to Kollam further south. The ship was carrying an estimated 640 containers, including 13 with “hazardous cargo”, of which 12 are said to have contained calcium carbide. A solid compound, calcium carbide is not flammable by itself, but it reacts vigorously with water and moisture to produce highly flammable acetylene gas, posing a significant fire hazard. The ship also had 84 metric tonnes of diesel and 367 metric tonnes of furnace oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday.

Around Paravur beach, men in khaki have been deployed to guard the container, lest some intrepid local falls prey to curiosity and tries to prise it open. A constable has been deputed to clear traffic as people slow down vehicles on the narrow beach road to check out the container. Taking advantage of the sudden rush of onlookers, an ice cream vendor has strategically shifted closer to this spot on the beach, adding to the problems of the constable who struggles to clear the occasional “block” – the term used for a traffic jam.

There are a bunch of people on the beach shooting reels and shorts with the container in the backdrop, as are children in uniform, who have taken a detour on their way home from school to witness the local spectacle. In this sleepy Kerala town, where the high point of the year are the fireworks at a local temple, the coming of the container is an assured selfie moment.

Valsala Srikumar, though, has a harried look. “I have barely sold anything. The same as Monday,” she says, standing metres away from the ice cream vendor, peddling a full stock of fish on a yard stool by the beach road.

Metres away, the container bobs gently as the waves crash into it. All around the container and further south along the coast, the water is white and foamy – one reason why people are keeping off fish.

Today, Valsala's husband has ventured out “to the cleaner parts” seeking a catch, but it's pointless now. “What is the use if no one is buying,” she says.

Fishing boats are moored along the beach, with little activity at the far end where the fisherfolk stay.

A kilometer away, at Oottupurayil restaurant in Paravur Kombolam, a market with a cluster of shops, waiter Anees says clients are shunning seafood. “This is just a phase,” he hopes.

Back on the beach, there are speculative guesses on the contents of the container. The locals, helped by WhatsApp forwards and their vestigial knowledge of the periodic table, rattle off names of the multiple chemical compounds the containers ostensibly contained – all the way from arsenic to zinc, lead and mercury.

For a populace fed on a steady diet of politics and media, conspiracy theories come easy. “Is Liberia linked to Pakistan… like Turkey?” a person in the crowd asks, a query that's quickly dismissed by someone else who is more well-versed in these matters.

A ship's flag state testifies to the country where it is registered, but much of this is determined by the tonnage tax advantages offered by jurisdictions such as Liberia or Cyprus.

Three days since MSC Elsa 3 sank, the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard are trying to contain any oil spill from the ship. Teams of scientists from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, are collecting water and sediment samples across locations on the Kerala coast. The onset of the monsoon hasn't helped, with the surging tides making the operations difficult. While the containers are being removed from the coastline, one by one, a clean-up of the beach waters could be a long way off.

Until that happens, Valsala's fishing business could be in some trouble. And despite the optimism of the Oottupurayil waiter, this phase could last a while.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino promised Thursday to release new video that finally debunks conspiracy theories that sex predator Jeffrey Epstein could have been murdered — insisting “no one was there but him” at the time of his jail cell suicide.

“There's video clear as day,” Bongino told Fox News' “Fox & Friends” early Thursday.  

“He's the only person in there and the only person coming out. You can see it.”

Bongino, a former conservative talk radio host, stressed the footage didn't show “the actual act” but would prove there was no one around his cell before he was found dead at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2019. 

“There is video and when you look at the video, and we will release it, we're working on cleaning it up to make sure you have an enhanced – and we will give the original so you don't think there are any shenanigans – you will see no one in there but him. There's just nobody there,” Bongino said. 

“I say to people of the time — if you have a tip, let us know — but there is no DNA, there's no audio, there's no fingerprints, there's no suspects, there's no accomplices, there's no tips. There is nothing. If you have it, I'm happy to see it.”

Epstein's death was ruled a suicide at the time, but the pedophile financier's abrupt demise has long been dogged by rampant theories. 

Among them is that the billionaire, who was awaiting trial on child sex-trafficking charges, could have been killed by some of the rich and famous who engaged with him — or were privy to his crimes — over the years.

“I'm just telling you what we see in the file,” he said Thursday when asked about the case.

“I just want to be crystal clear on this. I am not asking anyone to believe me. I'm telling you what's there and what isn't.”

“There's going to be a disclosure on this coming shortly,” he added as he teased the video.

Bongino's revelation about the unseen footage comes after he faced backlash from MAGA fans when he and FBI Director Kash Patel emphatically declared earlier this month that the notorious sex predator's death was a suicide.

“I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There's no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise,” he wrote on X at the time.

Patel, too, made clear that he believed Epstein's death was a suicide and nothing more.

“As someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor, who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,” he told Fox News in an earlier interview.

Epstein had bedsheets wrapped around his neck when he was found dead in his jail cell on Aug. 10, 2019 — just over a month after his arrest.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

TV/Streaming

“For relief you can trust, trust Tylenol. Hospitals do.” — From a 1981 TV commercial for Tylenol.

In the second episode of the three-part Netflix true crime documentary series “Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders,” James Lewis fiddles with a box of Extra Strength Tylenol some four decades after he became the prime suspect in the case, and says to the off-camera filmmakers, “You think I'm going to open this and get my fingerprints all over?”

His face masked in a kind of semi-rictus grin, Lewis struggles with the foil seal on the bottle, noting, “It's pretty well sealed…Everyone opens a bottle and swears my name.” It's a creepy and chilling moment in the last interview conducted with Lewis before he died in July 2023—but he wasn't wrong about people cursing his name. 

For those of us who remember the Tylenol murders of 1982, particularly those of us who lived in the Chicago area, it's virtually impossible not to think of that horrific chapter in our history every time we struggle a bit with a shrink band on a beverage bottle, induction seals on personal care products or the glued-shut outer box, plastic cap seal or foil seal under the cap on Tylenol and other over the counter medications. There were some types of tamper-resistant packaging available before the Tylenol murders, such as blister packaging for certain kinds of tablets and capsules. Still, it was the shocking killings of seven innocent people who took Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide that brought about the era of widespread and regulated Tamper Resistant Packaging.

“Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders” is the second documentary series to revisit the case in recent years, on the heels of the five-part Paramount+ project titled “Painkiller: The Tylenol Murders” in 2023. (I gave that series three stars at the time.) Much of the latter series focused on the efforts of then 13-year-old Isabel Janus and her efforts to find answers to the tragedy that took the lives of her aunt and two great uncles, as well as reporter Brad Edwards' efforts to track down Lewis, finally encountering him face to face at Lewis' apartment building, with Lewis refusing to engage. 

The Netflix series has higher production values and benefits from having that sit-down interview with Lewis. It does a solid job of chronicling the case through the requisite use of recollections from investigators, reporters, and friends of the deceased, combined with instructive graphics mixed with archival news footage—but if you know the particulars of the case, there are no groundbreaking revelations to be found in either series. Many of the law enforcement personnel who were part of the investigation remain convinced that Lewis was the killer; others maintain that Lewis, who served 12 years in prison for sending an extortion note to Johnson & Johnson, couldn't possibly have committed the crimes.

In addition to the two documentary series about this case, Chicago Tribune investigative reporters Christy Gutowski and Stacy St. Clair hosted a solidly sourced podcast titled “Unsealed: The Tylenol Murders” in 2022—but we've never seen a big, splashy, theatrically released drama or streaming series, ala “Zodiac,” “Summer of Sam,” “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” “Mindhunter,” “American Crime Story: The Assassination of Giana Versace,”, the Netflix film “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” about Ted Bundy, et al. Given the dramatic richness of the material (said with no disrespect to the victims and their families), that comes as something of a surprise.

There are so many twists and turns, so many stunning coincidences, so many indelible images, so many moments of heartbreaking fate in this story. Stanley and Teresa Janus joining a family gathering to mourn the death of Stanley's brother Adam, only for Stanley and Teresa to take Tylenol at the house and succumb as well. Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne called a live television press conference at midnight to announce a citywide ban on the sale of all Tylenol products. Police cars going up and down the street to give warnings, and police officers knocking on doors. Warnings broadcast via a news crawl during football games. (Getting information to the masses was such a different thing in the pre-Internet, pre-Social Media days.) James Lewis penning a Zodiac-esque extortion letter to Johnson & Johnson, writing, “Gentlemen: As you can see, it is easy to place cyanide, both potassium and sodium, into capsules sitting on store shelves.” The bizarre and tragic episode involving Roger Arnold, who became a suspect (but was exonerated), blamed a local bar owner for turning him over to the police, went to the bar intending to kill the owner, but mistakenly shot and killed a 46-year-old father of six who resembled his intended target. Not to mention the case of the woman in Westchester County, NY, who died from cyanide poisoning after ingesting Tylenol capsules in 1986—some four years after the Chicago-area deaths, and while James Lewis was in prison.

In the final episode of the Netflix series, FBI Special Agent Grey Steed notes, “I think that all of us that were actively involved in the case, believe that James Lewis not only wrote the letter, but planted the cyanide leading to the deaths of seven people,” while former Chicago Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek says, “James Lewis is an a******, but he is not the Tylenol killer.”

After more than four decades, here we are. We might see more true-crime documentaries or podcasts, maybe even a theatrical release or streaming dramatic series someday. But it's likely the Tylenol murders will never be solved. We'll never know for certain the identity of the bogeyman who didn't crawl through an open window or hide under a bed, but terrorized a community through the placement of random boxes of pain on local store shelves.","{'href': 'https://www.rogerebert.com', 'title': 'Roger Ebert'}","other"

Higher global temperatures mean the intertropical convergence zone could shift south — throwing off precipitation trends for a major swath of humanity, according to new research.

Nearly 2 billion people could face wild disruptions in water availability if the planet continues to warm — and the change could be irreversible, new research suggests.

Earth's average surface temperature is already about 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) higher than pre-industrial levels, and with 2024 the hottest year on record, the future forecast is not promising.

The new study, published May 14 in the journal Earth's Future, looked at what would happen should global temperatures swell to 2.7 F (1.5 C), even for just a few decades.

Such an increase in global temperature could have a permanent impact on the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a region near the equator where trade winds from the northern and southern hemispheres meet, the study found.

""These impacts that we quantify here will be there for the long term,"" said lead author Norman Steinert, senior climate researcher at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway.

The ITCZ has a heavy influence on rainfall patterns, and the increase in global temperatures could cause it to shift south, changing the length and intensity of wet and dry seasons, especially in parts of Africa, the Amazon and Southeast Asia. Too much rain in some areas and not enough in others could have dire effects on agriculture, ecosystems and water availability for a major portion of the planet.

Several factors affect this wide band of clouds, including the ocean's largest conveyor belt, a network of currents known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Emerging research suggests this conveyor belt is weakening, largely due to climate change.

The researchers looked at two different scenarios run by eight different Earth System Models — powerful climate simulation tools. One ""idealized"" scenario analyzed how precipitation patterns might change if atmospheric CO2 increased at a rate of 1% per year for 140 years, then decreased at the same rate for another 140 years — it's a ""clean,"" way to assess the impact of a rise and fall in global temperatures, if unrealistic, Steinert said.

The researchers also looked at data showing a potentially more realistic scenario, where emissions increase until the year 2040, which is followed by aggressive mitigation efforts to bring the global temperature back down.

The assumption is ""that we won't be able or won't like to live in a warmer world, and would make actual efforts to bring temperatures down again at some point,"" Steinert told Live Science.

Most of the projections resulted in little or no shift in the intertropical convergence zone. But in one of the idealized scenarios and two of the more realistic scenarios, the zone shifts significantly, causing potentially major upheaval to rain patterns for much of the world.

Based on the number of models predicting different outcomes, the paper describes the ITCZ shift as “unlikely.” But given the already weakened response of the AMOC and a time lag between when the climate warms and when the ocean heats up, the researchers argue a shift in the ITCZ may be more likely than the new study suggests.

Central and West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia could face reduced rainfall, whereas northeast Brazil would be inundated. The timing and intensity of weather patterns could disrupt the lives of billions, as well as complicate agriculture that relies on consistent weather patterns. In total, 23% of the world population and more than 12% of the global land area could be impacted.

The likelihood of this scenario playing out is ""a low probability, but plausible outcome,"" Steinert said, and the models suggest the worst impacts would take decades, at a minimum, to play out. In multiple scenarios, the damage was permanent, at least at human-time scales.

""It's an important study,"" Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading in the U.K., who was not involved in the research, told Live Science.

—Climate change made April's catastrophic floods worse, report finds

—Kids born today are going to grow up in a hellscape, grim climate study finds

—Ghost forests are growing as sea levels rise

Allan pointed out water availability is more complicated than what the study considered, because the simulations don't take into account the amount of water and moisture in the ground or how much water is flowing in the rivers, for example.

Still, ""this storyline could play out in the future,"" Allan said. ""Because it has such big possibilities for regional water availability, this has got to be taken seriously.""

In terms of future research, Steinert says it would be helpful to look at the local, specific outcomes for places that might be impacted by shifting weather patterns due to a warming climate. But the best way to avoid these risks is straightforward.

""I mean, that's very clear,"" Steinert said. ""Cut emissions as soon as possible.""

The CEO of a Dutch weather forecaster recently suggested that Belgian wind farms are inadvertently “stealing” wind from his own country's wind farms in the North Sea.

In an interview with Belgian broadcaster VRT, Remco Verzijlbergh, the CEO of Dutch weather forecasting service Whiffle, claimed that Belgian wind farms in the North Sea have an advantage over Dutch ones because of their placement, adding that they are effectively “stealing” Dutch wind. Verzijlbergh claimed that Belgian wind farms are taking up to 3 % of wind energy from Dutch installations, adding that wind speeds measured behind a wind turbine are measurably lower. He clarified that the phenomenon is purely accidental because of the location of the wind turbines, pleading for better coordination between countries in the near future.

“A wind turbine is designed to extract wind from the air,” Remco Verzijlbergh said. If you measure behind a wind turbine, the wind blows less hard. Behind a wind farm with many wind turbines together, you really see lower wind speeds. They are located southwest of the Dutch parks, and the wind often comes from the southwest, so you often steal some of our wind.”

The Dutch weather forecasting professional warned that this kind of wind theft will become a bigger issue as more wind farms get installed across the North Sea in an international race to become carbon neutral. in order to avoid conflicts on this matter, better planning and coordination is needed.

“The North Sea is slowly being built with wind farms, so there will be more and more of that wind theft,” Verzijlbergh said. “Coordination is needed so that it is not handled unwisely or that no ‘race to the water' is organised, where whoever builds first also gets the most favourable wind.”

The decrease in wind speeds behind a wind turbine is reportedly well-documented and known as ‘wind shadow' or the ‘wake effect'.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","This logistics startup is getting 'buried in inbound' from brands after de minimis ended. It just raised $18 million.","https://www.businessinsider.com/portless-raises-vc-funding-de-minimis-end-drives-logistics-demand-2025-5","Thu, 29 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Portless, a logistics startup that helps brands to offer quick shipping, has raised $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Commerce Ventures.

FJ Labs, eGateway Capital, Red Swan Ventures, and Ground Up Ventures also contributed to the round.

Portless offers Western brands the chance to use a shipping and fulfillment model made popular by Shein.

Shein grew to dominate the fast-fashion world by responding quickly to changing style trends and shipping packages on planes going directly to customers from warehouses in China. Products cross borders in a matter of days rather than months. For years, Shein did this using the de minimis provision, which allows for the duty-free import of packages valued at less than $800.

Portless emulates this model by shipping from its fulfillment center in Shenzhen, China, near where many of its customers manufacture their goods. For a while, it also used the de minimis exemption.

However, on May 2, the Trump administration ended de minimis shipping as part of its tariff program. That meant many companies had to pivot.

Portless' founder and CEO, Izzy Rosenzweig, told Business Insider that the company had been preparing for the end of de minimis since last September. It raised its Series A with the understanding that de minimis would be ending.

Rosenzweig said that with tariffs disrupting global supply chains, Portless' pitch is resonating with many brands. By fulfilling orders outside the US, the company can help brands defer their duty payments until an order crosses the border on its way to a customer. Portless uses an informal entry process called Type 11 to import the goods to the US. It pays duties on behalf of its brand customers, who then pay Portless back later.

""There isn't a company in the US that isn't looking for a new way of doing things,"" Rosenzweig said. ""We're getting buried in inbound.""

Businesses impacted by tariffs and the end of de minimis have also explored other strategies, like storing inventory in bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones, to defer their duty payments and lessen the hit on their balance sheets.

Portless typically works with mid-market brands earning between $5 million and $150 million in annual revenue. Rosenzweig said brands of that size benefit the most from having better access to cash, which Portless helps with by fulfilling small orders by plane instead of tying up large amounts of inventory on shipping containers.

""In our model, it is like a live supply chain,"" he said. ""You're reacting immediately to the demand.""

Its customers include home wellness device brand Canopy, kids' clothing brand Andy & Evan, and apparel brand SA Fishing.

Before creating Portless, Rosenzweig founded an online marketplace called Browze that sourced products directly from factories in China. In his 10 years running the company, he saw firsthand how complicated global supply chains are.

He said Portless plans to use the funding to expand into new markets. It has a new fulfillment center in Vietnam and plans to open another in India by the end of the third quarter.

The company also plans to build more services to help brands improve their supply chain. It plans to introduce the ability to book quality control inspections through its customer portal within the next two months.

""While today Portless is fundamentally changing cash flow with a new supply chain model, we want to simplify supply chain,"" Rosenzweig said. ""A lot of things will change in our model, like small-batch manufacturing, and we'll be rolling out services.""

Commerce Ventures partner Matt Nichols said the firm led Portless' Series A because it believes ""that the 'direct-ship-from-manufacturer' model will be the future for much of retail.""

He said that they invested with the assumption that the de minimis loophole would go away.

""We were able to get comfortable by talking to many of Portless' customers and finding out that the tax advantage was not the reason they decided to choose Portless,"" he said. ""They were all focused on aligning production volumes with actual demand, and this was the best model to facilitate that.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I lost my job to AI, but then used it to supercharge my search for a new role","https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-took-tech-worker-job-2025-5","Thu, 29 May 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Mark Quinn is the senior director of AI operations for Pearl, an AI search platform for professional services. In a prior role at a startup, the arrival of OpenAI's GPT-4 meant artificial intelligence could do the work of a team he was building. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.

In my last job, I was at a startup. Before that, I was leading engineering operations at Waymo. It was a 3,000-person organization, a rocket ship all its own. In other words, my career was fairly well established and going well by most indications. So, when the startup came along, it was about this bigger swing and this even bigger opportunity, potentially, to help this company unlock what they were going after.

My main role in that was to lead what was the primary human-in-the-loop operation responsible for supervising and curating the AI.

When I joined, it was already a 500-person strong organization, and I was hired to ramp it to thousands. By all indications, we were doing the job really well. Then GPT-4 came out. After playing with it for just a couple of months, we realized that the bulk of the operation that I was scaling, really the entirety of it, was no longer needed. The technology had simply outpaced itself and the human in the loop.

I then spent my last few months there ramping that operation down and setting up a couple of other AI-related agents to help with things like quality technical writing. Once that was in place, my skills simply weren't needed there.

It was not a super fun moment, and it was very, very bumpy. We had hundreds of people doing this work globally, so we had to figure out how to ramp down those contracts as gracefully as possible to allow these folks to have time to hopefully get into other roles.

On my team of about 10 people, only one person stayed on.

In my career, I'd gone from a place where companies like Waymo, Apple, and Amazon were coming to hire me to being out of a job and unable to get the attention of any company.

This moment is making it such that these great companies now have way more capability and people than they may need. So, you've got a lot of great people that are now having to find their next play, but the next plays are dramatically changing.

When I was hired at the startup, I spent the next four months with my team working tirelessly on basically solving this case and figuring out the right staffing and management model. Then GPT-4 came out, and when I gave it the case, it was an epiphanal moment. It spit out the exact answer — the perfect answer — in 30 seconds, including what we thought were very clever adaptations that had taken us a week to identify.

It not only gave us the answer but also the methods. I just sat there with my jaw in my hand. That was the moment that I thought to myself, ""Info workers beware.""

After we began to wind down the operation, I started looking around to figure out what my next play would be. I spent about five months conducting my job search the wrong way and getting nowhere.

I remember this moment sitting there, again, with my jaw in my hand, wondering, ""What am I doing wrong?""

It came out of that moment of almost desperation, saying, ""I've asked everybody else. AI, what do you got?"" It came back with more nuance and appreciation than I ever could have imagined. That's when I moved into collaboration mode with AI.

One example was with Google's NotebookLM. When it came out, people had fun with the idea of putting their résumés into it and creating a podcast. I actually found incredible utility in doing that. It's interesting to drop your résumé and your LinkedIn profile into NotebookLM and see what AI makes of your career. What does it call out as the highlights?

When I did this, I realized that there were great things about my background and experiences that I wasn't telling people because I didn't see or appreciate them, but this podcast called them out.

Before using AI, I wrote a nice cover letter, updated my résumé, and started looking around on LinkedIn and applying. I was using my network, casting the line. I wasn't just in a corner quietly hoping something would come to me, but it was the traditional approach of, ""Here's the résumé that I made for every job. Here's a cover letter with a few tweaks."" I was essentially cold applying and trying to hit people up on LinkedIn.

Most people have probably heard that you should tailor your résumé, cover letter, or communications for a role. But that's hard when you're in the grind and just trying to get a job. You've already applied to a bunch, and you're tired and don't want to stare at the same words again and again. This is where AI is extremely helpful.

I also created what I called JobHunt GPT. Now I've turned it into CareerBuddy GPT, but JobHunt GPT was what came out of all this exploration. In my case, it was a custom GPT that understood my background, where I was trying to go, and the history of the jobs I'd applied for. So, I was able to go to it and say, ""Hey, here's a new job. Can you assess my candidacy for this?""

The first thing I get is an objective review of how I mesh up against a role. Then, I can say, ""Alright, pick apart my résumé. What do I need to adjust?"" It can generate the updated résumé, focusing on the things that are important for the role. And it can write the cover letter and identify the key people for me to reach out to. It's essentially like lead analysis and lead development.

My advice to anybody else would be, don't wait five months to figure out the right way to do it. The world has changed. This applies to anything, but especially if you're looking for a job, you have to leverage the most powerful tool available, which is AI.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A Carta exec's resignation letter accused the CEO of sexism. She says she didn't write it.","https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-ceo-accused-sexism-exec-disavows-email","Thu, 29 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Over the past five years, Carta has faced a string of gender discrimination complaints, departures of high-level female employees, and lawsuits with its former CTO Jerry Talton in the Southern District of New York.

Now, a resignation letter from Gurpreet ""Preeti"" Kaur, a former female Carta executive, has been made public in court — and in it, she said CEO Henry Ward spoke to her ""with a disdain he would not show to my male peers"" and has a ""pattern of humiliating certain women.""

Kaur has disavowed the email entirely to Business Insider, with both herself and Carta saying it was written by Talton's lawyers when she was in an ""emotional"" state. Talton, in turn, alleged in court that Carta ""worked hard"" to get Kaur to rescind it.

Kaur, who worked as Carta's vice president of Engineering from 2018 to 2022, sent the letter in October 2022. It was unsealed on May 1 of this year as part of the ongoing legal battle between Carta and Talton, who accused Carta of whistleblower retaliation and defamation.

Kaur emailed the detailed, two-page letter to Carta's CEO, general counsel, chief people officer, and Talton himself. In the letter, Kaur alleged that Ward made her feel ""vulnerable and smaller"" at a dinner with him, ignored a potential promotion, and used the word ""ceremonial"" to describe part of her role.

The October 2022 letter was part of evidence for Talton's claims that Carta had a culture of gender discrimination. Kaur told BI that while the dinner with Ward did happen, she misperceived Ward's comments. She praised Ward's leadership and her time at Carta.

""I just wanted to clarify, I was emotional and there was a lot going on at the company with exec turnover and whatnot,"" Kaur said, adding, ""Misunderstandings happen.""

Carta, which encouraged BI to speak with Kaur, said in a statement, ""Ms. Kaur was initially persuaded by Talton to send the resignation letter during a time she testified was 'emotional and difficult.'""

""Talton's attempt to connect her resignation with his termination to draw conclusions about culture at Carta is a gross distortion of the facts,"" Carta added.

Talton declined to comment.

Carta, a startup that helps companies manage employee equity and shares, has raised more than $1 billion from Silicon Valley VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Over the years, it has faced numerous complaints and lawsuits, many of which focused on CEO Ward and his conduct.

Kaur's letter attributes her resignation to a humiliating dinner with Ward in October 2022, during which he made comments that ""convinced"" her she could no longer stay.

Kaur loved working at Carta and admired Ward, the email says. She wanted to help the company during a turbulent period marked by economic uncertainty, the departure of chief product officer Heidi Johnson, and its CTO, Talton, being placed on leave. A few months later, Carta sued Talton and accused him of secretly recording meetings, sparking the current legal battle.

The email says Ward made Kaur feel ""vulnerable and smaller,"" and he showed no interest in her contributions or ideas and sidestepped a conversation about promoting her to senior vice president. Instead, per the email, Ward called her an already ""ceremonial"" SVP, a comment she found ""shocking"" since someone else at Carta had received that exact promotion.

The email also said Ward asked her whether her coworkers were ""any good"" and repeatedly asked what Talton would say about them, instead of seeking her opinions.

""Talking to me as if I am a poor substitute for a man he has put on leave is not appropriate,"" the email says.

Ward's questions made her ""extremely uncomfortable,"" Kaur says in the email. The dinner became such a ""cross-examination"" that waiters kept returning to check on her because she hadn't touched her food, the email says.

Kaur also said Ward accused Johnson and Talton of being ""disloyal"" and predicted they would bring Carta's internal problems to The New York Times, which had profiled Carta's issues in a 2020 investigation.

In her view, the dinner conversation showed Ward had a ""pattern of humiliating certain women.""

""Now I cannot see a future here any longer, so I must resign,"" the email ends.

In counterclaims in the Southern District of New York court, Talton alleged that Carta pressured Kaur to rescind the email, writing that CEO Ward and Carta's then-Chief People Officer Paige Bailey ""worked hard to get Kaur to rescind it, even going so far as to draft an 'apology' email for her.""

Carta denied that, telling BI in a statement that it has ""already denied that self-serving characterization"" from Talton in court. Carta and Ward also denied Talton's counterclaims in a legal filing in April.

In 2023, BI reported that Kaur was one of three top executives at Carta who had internally filed gender discrimination complaints. At the time, Kaur also denied her departure was due to such issues.

That same year, the company settled a lawsuit brought by former vice president of marketing Emily Kramer alleging gender discrimination and illegal retaliation. Johnson submitted a gender discrimination complaint to Carta's board, and Carta sued her to prevent the release of damaging records in a case that was also settled.

Earlier this year, Carta settled a sexual harassment case filed by a female ex-sales manager against its chief revenue officer Jeff Perry, who strongly denied any wrongdoing.

Just weeks after US President Donald Trump declared a “total reset” with China following a trade truce in Geneva, tensions are rising again between the world's biggest economies.

Trump's administration on Wednesday announced it would start revoking Chinese student visas, while also introducing new restrictions on the sales of chip design software and reportedly some jet engine parts to China. That came shortly after it sought to block Huawei Technologies Co. from selling advanced AI chips anywhere in the world, prompting an angry rebuke from Beijing.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"
