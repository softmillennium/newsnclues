                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chrysalis Records will release UFO's classic 1980 album "No Place To Run", newly remastered from the original production tapes transfers at AIR Mastering and reissued on stunning three-LP tri-fold sleeve 180gm vinyl and two-CD digipak formats, on August 15, 2025. "No Place To Run" was the eighth studio album by UFO and the first with Paul Chapman on guitar, following the departure of Michael Schenker. It was produced by legendary BEATLES producer George Martin and recorded at his newly launched AIR Studios in Montserrat in the Caribbean, a stark difference from the band's usual surroundings. Reflecting on the album 45 years later, UFO singer Phil Mogg said: "The thing that sticks in my mind from recording 'No Place To Run' was the complete mismatch with UFO / George Martin (who was a lovely chap) and nothing summed it up more than when George would say to Geoff (sound engineer): 'Well, Geoff, it's six o'clock, time for a G&T out on the veranda.' How very civilized!" The reissue includes a new and previously unreleased mix of "Live At The Marquee, London, November 16th 1980", mixed by revered engineer Brian Kehew from the original multi-track tapes, giving a powerfully fresh sound. Only three tracks have ever been officially released before ("Lettin' Go", "Mystery Train" and "No Place To Run"). The other 11 tracks from this legendary show have not been available until now. The set will take fans right back to the electric atmosphere of the Marquee, with a band at the very top of their game. Kehew said: "Paul Chapman's guitar sound here is really superb, a thick and singing B.C. "'No Place To Run' is certainly a special time for the band, the peak of their public acceptance. With the music world shifting into new wave and synth-pop around them, they stayed true to their roots and delivered yet another classic album." (Quote taken from liner notes.) Both formats feature new liner notes by Michael Hann, featuring interviews with Mogg and drummer Andy Parker. LP1 / CD1: No Place To Run - 2025 Remaster This Fire Burns Tonight05.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's largest drone "mothership" is getting ready for deployment in June. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nicknamed the "drone mothership," the aircraft promises to provide China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) with more capability to deploy swarms of drones for combat, surveillance, emergency rescue missions, and other purposes. The aircraft was introduced in November at the international Zhuhai Air Show, China's biggest aerospace trade show, and has the potential to launch kamikaze drones (also called loitering munitions) — UAVs that are designed to wait until their target is found, then intercept and crash into them, often while armed with explosives. Kamikaze drones are becoming more common in warfare — Russia has used them extensively in its invasion of Ukraine to target power stations, population centers, and military equipment. Ukraine has combated their use by shooting down the drones before they can strike, setting up advanced air defense systems from allies, and building makeshift cages from chain link fencing and tree branches around likely targets. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. However, questions remain over how practical the Jiu Tian would be in some scenarios, and there isn't a lot of information about the carrier's technical specifications. "China's display of advanced weapons systems can generate hype in ways that can align with deterrent and propaganda objectives, even when the actual capabilities remain unconfirmed," Elsa Kania, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Live Science in an email. Her research centers on China's military strategy, defense innovation, and emerging technologies. —Groundbreaking amplifier could lead to 'super lasers' that make the internet 10 times faster That's when the tortoise seizes its chance': Chinese scientists make nuclear power breakthrough using abandoned US research "For instance, given its size, there are reasons to question the survivability of the Jiutian in highly contested environments, even equipped with electronic warfare capabilities.The Chinese defense industry is also a leading exporter of unmanned systems, which has accelerated the global diffusion of these capabilities. The displaying of and deliberate disclosures about advanced unmanned systems can also serve advertising purposes sometimes in that regard." Jiu Tian's drone swarms also have many applications beyond combat, including resource monitoring, disaster relief, and emergency response operations thanks to its modular payload design. Swarms could make it a lot easier to assess damage from natural disasters, look for survivors, and help rescuers navigate dangerous terrain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino promised Thursday to release new video that finally debunks conspiracy theories that sex predator Jeffrey Epstein could have been murdered — insisting “no one was there but him” at the time of his jail cell suicide. Bongino, a former conservative talk radio host, stressed the footage didn't show “the actual act” but would prove there was no one around his cell before he was found dead at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2019. “There is video and when you look at the video, and we will release it, we're working on cleaning it up to make sure you have an enhanced – and we will give the original so you don't think there are any shenanigans – you will see no one in there but him. Epstein's death was ruled a suicide at the time, but the pedophile financier's abrupt demise has long been dogged by rampant theories. Among them is that the billionaire, who was awaiting trial on child sex-trafficking charges, could have been killed by some of the rich and famous who engaged with him — or were privy to his crimes — over the years. “I'm just telling you what we see in the file,” he said Thursday when asked about the case. “I just want to be crystal clear on this. I am not asking anyone to believe me. “There's going to be a disclosure on this coming shortly,” he added as he teased the video. Bongino's revelation about the unseen footage comes after he faced backlash from MAGA fans when he and FBI Director Kash Patel emphatically declared earlier this month that the notorious sex predator's death was a suicide. There's no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise,” he wrote on X at the time. Patel, too, made clear that he believed Epstein's death was a suicide and nothing more. “As someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor, who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,” he told Fox News in an earlier interview.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His face masked in a kind of semi-rictus grin, Lewis struggles with the foil seal on the bottle, noting, “It's pretty well sealed…Everyone opens a bottle and swears my name.” It's a creepy and chilling moment in the last interview conducted with Lewis before he died in July 2023—but he wasn't wrong about people cursing his name. For those of us who remember the Tylenol murders of 1982, particularly those of us who lived in the Chicago area, it's virtually impossible not to think of that horrific chapter in our history every time we struggle a bit with a shrink band on a beverage bottle, induction seals on personal care products or the glued-shut outer box, plastic cap seal or foil seal under the cap on Tylenol and other over the counter medications. There were some types of tamper-resistant packaging available before the Tylenol murders, such as blister packaging for certain kinds of tablets and capsules. Still, it was the shocking killings of seven innocent people who took Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide that brought about the era of widespread and regulated Tamper Resistant Packaging. (I gave that series three stars at the time.) Much of the latter series focused on the efforts of then 13-year-old Isabel Janus and her efforts to find answers to the tragedy that took the lives of her aunt and two great uncles, as well as reporter Brad Edwards' efforts to track down Lewis, finally encountering him face to face at Lewis' apartment building, with Lewis refusing to engage. The Netflix series has higher production values and benefits from having that sit-down interview with Lewis. In addition to the two documentary series about this case, Chicago Tribune investigative reporters Christy Gutowski and Stacy St. Clair hosted a solidly sourced podcast titled “Unsealed: The Tylenol Murders” in 2022—but we've never seen a big, splashy, theatrically released drama or streaming series, ala “Zodiac,” “Summer of Sam,” “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” “Mindhunter,” “American Crime Story: The Assassination of Giana Versace,”, the Netflix film “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” about Ted Bundy, et al. Stanley and Teresa Janus joining a family gathering to mourn the death of Stanley's brother Adam, only for Stanley and Teresa to take Tylenol at the house and succumb as well. Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne called a live television press conference at midnight to announce a citywide ban on the sale of all Tylenol products. Warnings broadcast via a news crawl during football games. James Lewis penning a Zodiac-esque extortion letter to Johnson & Johnson, writing, “Gentlemen: As you can see, it is easy to place cyanide, both potassium and sodium, into capsules sitting on store shelves.” The bizarre and tragic episode involving Roger Arnold, who became a suspect (but was exonerated), blamed a local bar owner for turning him over to the police, went to the bar intending to kill the owner, but mistakenly shot and killed a 46-year-old father of six who resembled his intended target. Not to mention the case of the woman in Westchester County, NY, who died from cyanide poisoning after ingesting Tylenol capsules in 1986—some four years after the Chicago-area deaths, and while James Lewis was in prison. After more than four decades, here we are. But it's likely the Tylenol murders will never be solved. We'll never know for certain the identity of the bogeyman who didn't crawl through an open window or hide under a bed, but terrorized a community through the placement of random boxes of pain on local store shelves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some have called it an object of extraterrestrial origin (UFO), and others have considered it an art project, but the only absolute truth is that a sphere has crossed the sky of the city of Buga, in Colombia. This event, which seems to have a more terrestrial than martian ending, adds to the thousands of sightings that occur in America, surrounded by that uncertainty of whether there will be life beyond our atmosphere. With some marks that have been defined as unusual, the shell covering this sphere is completely metal. Jose Luis Vazquez, one of the researchers, stated that these marks are what most attracted his attention, along with the lack of “welds and joints” marks. On the other hand, Julia Mossbridge, founder and president of the Institute for Love and Time, also stated “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things we don't understand, but we're investigating them.” Despite having devoted many years of his life to the research of bodies and objects whose origin remains unknown or difficult to explain, Mossbridge declared that he considers it a great art project and added that, Just as we humans are still learning that there are things that escape our knowledge, coming from our cubs and our seabed, the artist could have been inspired by this very reason for his creation. However, while she claims not to have seen enough evidence to determine that it is an extraterrestrial object, she does feel it is still too early to rule out that it can shed light on the nature of life on our planet. There have been cases where former members of the state security forces, already inactive, have made public data that had been kept hidden behind this issue. This is the case of a former air force officer who has stated that the United States government has been conducting investigations into such crews for more than 10 years. There are many events that have not been explained and for which science or nature has not had an explanation.However, there is the totally opposite thinking, which mocks this belief and firmly believes that everything has a scientific explanation.The only certainty that can be declared as absolute truth is that many of these sightings have had a scientific or biological explanation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lone, battered shipping container that has washed up on the beach in Paravur, a small fishing hamlet between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, is the talk of the town. The reddish-brown container, like many more than have beached all along Kerala's coast following the recent sinking of a Liberia-registered ship, has piqued curiosity and, for now, taken a daily staple off the plates of most households in these parts – fish. On Sunday, May 25, MSC Elsa 3, an 184-metre-long container ship, sank while it was sailing from Vizhinjam port to Cochin port, triggering alarm in coastal hamlets all the way from Alappuzha in mid-north Kerala to Kollam further south. The ship was carrying an estimated 640 containers, including 13 with “hazardous cargo”, of which 12 are said to have contained calcium carbide. A solid compound, calcium carbide is not flammable by itself, but it reacts vigorously with water and moisture to produce highly flammable acetylene gas, posing a significant fire hazard. The ship also had 84 metric tonnes of diesel and 367 metric tonnes of furnace oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday. Around Paravur beach, men in khaki have been deployed to guard the container, lest some intrepid local falls prey to curiosity and tries to prise it open. A constable has been deputed to clear traffic as people slow down vehicles on the narrow beach road to check out the container. There are a bunch of people on the beach shooting reels and shorts with the container in the backdrop, as are children in uniform, who have taken a detour on their way home from school to witness the local spectacle. Valsala Srikumar, though, has a harried look. The same as Monday,” she says, standing metres away from the ice cream vendor, peddling a full stock of fish on a yard stool by the beach road. Today, Valsala's husband has ventured out “to the cleaner parts” seeking a catch, but it's pointless now. “This is just a phase,” he hopes. For a populace fed on a steady diet of politics and media, conspiracy theories come easy. “Is Liberia linked to Pakistan… like Turkey?” a person in the crowd asks, a query that's quickly dismissed by someone else who is more well-versed in these matters. A ship's flag state testifies to the country where it is registered, but much of this is determined by the tonnage tax advantages offered by jurisdictions such as Liberia or Cyprus. Teams of scientists from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, are collecting water and sediment samples across locations on the Kerala coast.

Directed by Vishal Furia (Chhorii, Chhorii 2), the film is a fresh chapter in the world of Shaitaan, a hit 2024 horror film starring Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan. Much like Shaitaan, Maa centres on a family in peril. Besieged by evil roots and deadly sprites, they uncover the story of the ‘daitya', a demonic spirit from Bengali folkore. With Kajol in the lead, the film also features Indraneil Sengupta, Kherin Sharma and Ronit Roy. Produced by Jio Studios and Devgn Films, Maa will release in theatres on June 27, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are currently rumors that the real Annabelle doll has gone missing. Editor's note: Welcome to the world of “Paranormal PA,” a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Rumors that the real-life Annabelle doll has gone missing have been running rampant all-over social media. It's even safe to say that those who know about the history surrounding the “demonically possessed” Raggedy Ann doll, are afraid in real-life. Apparently, in early May, Annabelle, which is typically housed at NESPR's Warren's Occult Museum, founded by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, made a tour stop in New Orleans. Somehow, rumors began to circulate online that the demonic doll had somehow gone missing while in Louisiana after some visitors claimed they didn't see the doll during the tour. Then, there was a recent fire at the nearby Nottoway Plantation-turned-Nottoway Resort in White Castle which intensified speculation that there was some sort of connection between the doll's supposed disappearance and the fire. To squash the intensely troubling rumors, museum officials have spoken out about the doll's whereabouts. NESPR lead investigator Dan Rivera took to TikTok on Saturday to put an end to the swirling theories that the haunted doll had gone missing. “I'm here at the museum right now, and I just wanna show you guys that Annabelle ‘is' in the Warrens' Occult Museum,” Rivera said in a TikTok video. He also mentioned to fans that they were, however, going to be at the 2025 Rock Island Roadhouse Esoteric Expo in Rock Island, Illinois, on October 4. A notice was also posted on NESPR's Facebook account that read: “It's a Rumor... Annabelle has NOT been stolen. The Annabelle doll was first owned by a student in 1970, who requested help from the Warrens when she claimed Annabelle started “exhibiting malicious and frightening behavior.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out what's to come with Countdown that has Supernatural vets all heated up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Jensen Ackles may have spent the better part of two decades playing Dean Winchester on Supernatural, but that hasn't held him back from new shows in the wake of that series' ending. He flexed some very different acting muscles between Big Sky and The Boys, and now he's set to star in Countdown as his own Prime Video series in the 2025 TV schedule. Also starring The Flash's Jessica Camacho and Grey's Anatomy's Eric "McSteamy" Dane, Countdown follows LAPD Detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) as he's recruited to be part of a secret task force, also comprised of undercover agents from other law enforcement branches. The stakes are sky-high, as one might expect from a project created by Chicago Fire co-creator (and longtime showrunner) Derek Haas! Whether or not you have an Amazon Prime subscription, check out the trailer for yourself: The trailer has me more hyped than before, mostly because we get to see some personality from Jessica Camacho's character. She seems set up as Ackles' co-lead or at least secondary lead, so I'm glad to experience a bit of what she'll be bringing to the action. I for one wasn't surprised to see that it didn't take long for some familiar Supernatural names to flood the comment section, but I didn't foresee them almost all having one thing in common. Kathryn Newton, who played Claire Novak on The CW series, went for a straight compliment, and I just had to include the emojis from Danneel Ackles as well. I think my favorite of the comments is Timothy Omundson's, though, and not just because I frequently get his songs from the short-lived Galavant stuck in my head. He went full caps-locks to show his support for Countdown, in a definite departure from what Cain would have done on Supernatural. While I'm guessing Countdown won't pack in Supernatural cast members like The Boys has elsewhere on Prime Video under creator Eric Kripke, Ackles has teased that fans of Dean Winchester will find some familiarity in his new character. In the meantime, you could always check out Supernatural streaming with a Netflix subscription as well. With 327 episodes over 15 seasons, there's enough to last anybody a while!
