                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most professional sportspeople are long retired by the age of 40, but Cristiano Ronaldo is weighing up his next challenge as a whirlwind spell with Al Nassr comes to an end. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar has scored 99 goals in 111 games across all competitions for the Saudi Pro League club and earned €200 million ($225.8 million) each year. But he has frustratingly fallen short of winning anything more than 2023's regional Arab Club Champions Cup—Ronaldo hasn't lifted a league title, domestic cup or major continental trophy since Juventus triumphed in the Coppa Italia in 2020–21. Al Nassr maintain that they haven't given up hope of agreeing a new contract. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has teased “discussion with some clubs” that could see Ronaldo appear at the upcoming Club World Cup. Whether that could take the form of a short-term deal for the tournament or a slightly more permanent contract remains to be seen, but it would certainly be a in FIFA's interest to have one of football's biggest names at the inaugural competition in its fastest growing market. If Ronaldo is looking for more than just a short-term contract, there are few clubs that could afford to pay him anything close to what Al Nassr have been. Some might view a short deal as an unmissable marketing opportunity, both in terms of furthering their reach and increasing their chances of prevailing at the Club World Cup with watching eyes from all around the world. Joining a new team before the Club World Cup is possible due to FIFA opening a mini-transfer window at the start of June, to allow squad changes. For success in Saudi Arabia, with all the same financial benefits he has become used to, Ronaldo could make the short hop to domestic rivals Al Hilal. They have been the Saudi side most expected to pursue Vinícius Júnior, who remains in contract talks with Real Madrid, but also haven't yet replaced Neymar. Club World Cup group stage opponents: Real Madrid, Pachuca, Red Bull Salzburg. For similar riches, but across the border in the United Arab Emirates, Al Ain could be another option, where UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan serves as club chief. Club World Cup group stage opponents: Manchester City, Wydad AC, Juventus. The romantic move would be joining a club from Brazil. There are four of them in the Club World Cup, genuine heavyweights at that—Fluminense, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Botafogo. It is the latter that has been specifically linked with an ambitious approach. Botafogo, once home of Brazilian icons Garrincha and Jairzinho—and more recently Clarence Seedorf, are controlled by Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor. Club World Cup group stage opponents: Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid, Seattle Sounders. Mexico is one of world football's biggest markets and Monterrey could be a plausible destination. Former teammate Sergio Ramos has been with Monterrey since February and reuniting two of the key forces behind Real Madrid's UEFA Champions League three-peat would be a huge coup for the Mexican club, even if only for a matter of weeks. Club World Cup group stage opponents: River Plate, Inter, Urawa Red Diamonds. Ronaldo has already been back to Manchester United and could yet take in a second spell at first club Sporting CP before calling it a day. The only drawback is that Real Madrid have already had trouble accommodating all of the club's elite attacking talent this season as it—leaving Rodrygo feeling snubbed and Endrick struggling for minutes. Ronaldo couldn't command a starring role, even with ex-colleague Xabi Alonso now in charge, and that alone might be enough to kill the possibility. Club World Cup group stage opponents: Al Hilal, Pachuca, Red Bull Salzburg. This is one to watch, though, because LAFC will only participate at the Club World Cup this summer if they beat Mexico's Club América in a late qualifying play-off on May 31. Club World Cup group stage opponents: Flamengo, Espérance de Tunis, Chelsea. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year, 10 Washington Spirit players have been called up to their respective home countries' national teams to compete in international friendlies through July. Defender Tara McKeown will compete for the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT). Bernal and her teammates will face Uruguay in friendly matches. Across the pond in Europe's Nations League Tournament, England's Esme Morgan and Scotland's Sandy MacIver were called up to their respective squads in mid-May. Morgan, a standout defender, will compete in England's two friendlies against Portugal and Spain. Washington Spirit defender Gabby Carle will compete with Canada. According to the Spirit, she has appeared in 55 international matches (27 starts) for Canada, scoring one goal and adding four assists. Midfielder Narumi Miura will travel to Sao Paulo for friendlies against Brazil after being called up to the Japan Women's National Team. Forward Chloe Ricketts was called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team, and Makenna Morris to the Under-23 Women's National Team. Just days ago, defender Kysha Sylla was called up to France's Under-23 Women's National Team. The NWSL will have a break from June 23rd to July 27th for international tournaments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emily Fox recently became the latest U.S. Women's National Team star to win the coveted UEFA Women's Champions League, following Arsenal's stunning 1-0 win against Barcelona. Joining the likes of Ali Krieger, Alex Morgan, and Lindsey Heaps, Fox played the full 90 minutes in Lisbon as they took down the reigning six-time Liga F champions thanks to a 74th-minute close-range strike from Swedish international Stina Blackstenius. “I looked at the clock a lot,” Fox told reporters on Wednesday. “There was one, I think it was a minute before she blew the whistle, she blew a foul, and I think some people already started celebrating, thinking she had blown the whistle. “But yeah, there was a lot of clock checking after the goal. But before that, I try to avoid it at all costs. The Gunners' second-ever Women's Champions League win, with their first having come back in 2007, the landmark victory was celebrated in London outside the Emirates Stadium, with thousands of fans in attendance. Now back on U.S. soil, having been called up by Emma Hayes for the USWNT's upcoming friendlies against China and Jamaica, Fox was quizzed on whether or not she would recommend her teammates also make the move to Europe, should the opportunity arise. “For me personally, this has always been something I've wanted to do,” she explained. But for me, as soon as I had the opportunity and had some restricted free agency in the NWSL, Arsenal and going to Europe was right on my mind.” Fox added that she “had heard amazing things about the fans” and knew of Arsenal's desire to help “grow the women's game.” “It was a no brainer and I'm very grateful it's worked out, in the sense of two days ago and even this whole experience.” Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

The victor will join Group D in the competition, where they will compete against the likes of Flamengo, Esperance De Tunis, and Premier League side Chelsea FC. The match, which kicks off at 10:30 p.m. ET at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles, California, will be streamed live on DAZN and will be available on TNT and Univision in the USA as well. The winner will replace Liga MX side Club Leon in the competition, who were expelled as a result of breaching competition guidelines earlier this spring. The two North American powerhouses last met in 2020, where LAFC won 3-1 in the semifinals of the Champions Cup, but this time around, a blistering affair awaits. The Black and Gold ended the 2024 MLS regular season as Western Conference champions, and heading into Saturday night's match, sit sixth in the West - but are just four points out of second place with a game in hand. Club America, meanwhile, are coming off of a Clausura final appearance where they fell just short to Toluca and are looking to immediately bounce back by clinching a berth in this summer's tournament. GOAL's MLS correspondent Jacob Schneider and Liga MX writer Alejandro Orellano detail the match ahead, offering insight into why each respective team might come out on top.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gisele Thompson left the USWNT due to a minor hip injury and will not be replaced on the roster, the team announced Thursday morning. Thompson, who usually plays as an outside back, was listed as a forward for this camp. Gisele and sister Alyssa Thompson have made waves as a dynamic sister duo, playing together for both ACFC and the national team. Their third sister, Zoe, was recently called up for a USYNT U-14 talent ID camp. Gisele Thompson received her first call up and cap during the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, where she and Alyssa became the second pair of sisters to start a USWNT game together. She was then called into the April training camp after defender Tierna Davidson sustained an injury. “I thought Gisele showed a tenacity and a good aggression in her individual duels,” said Emma Hayes in February. “I think we can add some value in the defensive department for her, but I think she showed some really good intent going forward, some good link-up [play] with Alyssa. You can see they naturally want to give the ball to each other, and I think that actually settled them both being on the same side. And I think it was a really, really good debut, considering she's playing probably one of the best wingers in the world.” 21+ (18+ D.C.) and present in select states (for KS, in affiliation with Kansas Star Casino).</p>

We discuss his decision to opt out of this summer's matches on Episode 154. Christian Pulisic has decided that after a long season for AC Milan, he wants to sit the summer out. That decision has taken American soccer by storm and it has prompted a lot of critical feedback. We offer our own thoughts on his decision and what it means for him and the USMNT. With other absences, this means the A roster that fans were promised for the Gold Cup is left with some newcomers who have a huge opportunity ahead of them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gotham FC's Jaelin Howell talks about the impact of playing alongside USWNT veteran Emily Sonnett. The U.S. women's national team has always had an abundance of strong leaders and recognizable stars throughout its 40-year history. Many iconic players competed across multiple generations, with 14 of them accumulating 200 caps or more, and three eclipsing the 300 mark. Today's USWNT, however, is marked by youthful inexperience, as head coach Emma Hayes experiments to decide who will join her on the path to the 2027 World Cup. Hayes started the youngest USWNT lineup in 24 years against Brazil last month. She has doled out 23 first-time call-ups since being hired in November 2023. Fifteen players on the current roster have 10 camps or fewer, and the three goalkeepers have a combined four caps. All of which underscores this changeover in generations as a jarring moment in USWNT history: For the first time in a long time, there is no obvious face of the team or spokesperson for the larger group. All three have retired in the past 18 months. Well, yes, it is, considering the uniquely high standards of a USWNT program that has won four World Cups and five Olympic gold medals -- world records in both. It is not the first time that a new generation has had to pick up where its predecessors left off, but the player turnover happening in this cycle is arguably unprecedented. "Sometimes we just assume that everybody knows what the demands or the standards are for a U.S. women's national team player," Hayes said recently. Hayes said then that she couldn't worry about the lack of time she had -- her focus was short-term on the Olympics. Only during the past eight months has she had time to plot out her long-term vision for success. During February's SheBelieves Cup, Hayes sat down with Lindsey Heaps, Crystal Dunn, Emily Sonnett, Lynn Biyendolo, Tierna Davidson and Sam Coffey to discuss whether they see themselves as leaders -- and how that might not matter, she said, because their teammates view them as leaders anyway. What followed was weeks of conversation among players and staff around how to transfer the "non-negotiables" of work ethic and effort -- and what she frequently calls "the American DNA" -- to a new group of players trying to establish its own identity. "Their insights are invaluable, and I lean on learnings from them to help this process," Hayes said of her more experienced players. "It's going to be a little bit unfamiliar at this moment in time, but I think we'll go to the next place. Heaps is the USWNT's captain and most experienced player with 165 caps. Only two other players from that 2019 squad are on the current roster: Heaps and Dunn. Hayes confirmed last week that Naomi Girma is the vice-captain. Both Girma and Heaps have had to grow into more vocal roles. "I think it just takes time," Sauerbrunn told ESPN. "If you look at some of the personalities on the team that have retired, that took us a while to get into that after Abby Wambach retired and Shannon Boxx retired [after the 2015 World Cup]. Sauerbrunn's generation had to publicly fight the U.S. Soccer Federation and U.S. President Donald Trump as part of its years-long quest for equal pay, which increased attention and scrutiny on the USWNT. Sauerbrunn said she hopes the next generation doesn't have to shoulder as much of a burden off the field -- but she also said it isn't really a choice. "It's not even if they want to [take on those things], because I think they have a responsibility with this platform," Sauerbrunn said. "But it's what they're comfortable doing within that platform." She said her leadership looks different each day based on the USWNT's needs, but she told ESPN "we're in trouble when we're quiet," which means she is constantly a vocal source of positive reinforcement. Coffey barely played alongside the past generation of stars, but she still regularly seeks advice from Sauerbrunn, her former Thorns teammate, who she calls "the gold standard of what it means to be a leader." At 24 years old and already the vice-captain, Girma is clearly next in line as leader after Heaps. Girma has already taken on some of those duties, but there has been a void of experience around the team for simple reasons: injuries and other absences. Girma, who became the first player to fetch a $1 million transfer in January, effectively missed the last three USWNT camps due to injury. Biyendolo missed the April games due to injury. Dunn was absent from club and country last fall for personal reasons. And Rose Lavelle has been sidelined all year. Rodman, 23, is emerging as a star who transcends sports into pop culture and is someone Sauerbrunn says could reach the star status of Rapinoe. Get all three for a price you'll love. Staying healthy is her biggest challenge right now. Hayes has appeared to use her platform to absorb and deflect the external pressures placed on a team full of young, talented players like Rodman, Jaedyn Shaw, and 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes. She has preached patience as the group discovers its identity. "I think you're seeing that this less experienced team are growing up," Hayes said after the team's 2-1 win over Brazil on April 5. The lack of an immediate answer is an unfamiliar, uncomfortable position for a team so accustomed to having one, but it isn't necessarily something that needs fixing. It's a natural step in the transfer process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>City suffered with injuries throughout the 2024-25 campaign and after a strong start, faded in a disastrous three month spell that saw him fall away in the Premier League and exit the Carabao Cup and Champions league. Pep Guardiola's side recovered somewhat to piece together an unbeaten 11-game run to finish the top flight season and secure a third place finish and Champions League football. But despite that hectic nature, the Blues players are raring to go. Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak gave an insight into the mindset of the squad during his annual club interview, which was conducted on Monday in Abu Dhabi. "All the players, they're excited," he told club media. Nobody feels good about how we finished the season. "Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time etc. Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, we're coming back. We're ready to come back in three weeks' time. "I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. Guardiola too has questioned the need for so many games. The 2025-26 Premier League season starts on the weekend of August 16-17 with one fixture set to take place on Friday, August 15. Al Mubarak continued: "What we are focusing on is the future, always. But then the page flips and there's a new page to write, and the future is about what we can do together. "How many more leagues we can keep winning, how many more Champions Leagues we can go on and win. Manchester City have released their home kit for next season - featuring the reimagining of the sash running through their shirt. For the first time ever, the famous City blue will have a white sash through it as Puma put a new twist on an old favourite.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has vowed that Pep Guardiola should have a new-look squad in time for the Club World Cup. City fly to the United States on June 12 ahead of the tournament, with a temporary transfer window opening this Sunday and shutting two days before they jet off. Al Mubarak admitted that City were not aggressive enough in reshaping the team on the back of sealing a fourth consecutive Premier League title last summer and insisted the same mistakes will not be repeated. Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that City want to wrap up a move north of £55million for AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders before America. Morgan Gibbs-White has been a primary target in midfield, with City hopeful of signing at least one full back. Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa is an option were either Ederson or Stefan Ortega to depart. ‘I think when I look back, last summer, we probably should have been more aggressive in some of the changes we needed to do. It therefore promises to be a hectic fortnight at the Etihad Stadium before the summer jaunt, which starts with a short training camp in Boca Raton, an hour north of Miami. City face Wydad AC on June 18 but should have a plethora of new faces both on and off the pitch before then. Guardiola's backroom staff has been cut by three, with Juanma Lillo, Inigo Dominguez and Carlos Vicens all leaving in the coming weeks. During an interview recorded in Abu Dhabi on Monday, Al Mubarak revealed that the hierarchy are working tirelessly to sort business early. Guardiola's messages about squad size have been mixed in recent weeks, first claiming he requires more numbers owing to an increasing amount of games before stating last week that the existing bunch needed streamlining. ‘Nobody feels good about how we finished the season. Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time.' City clinched third spot in the Premier League - and qualification for next season's Champions League - by beating Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage on the final day. Al Mubarak said: ‘Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, “we're coming back”. I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity. ‘I just got off the phone right now with Ferran (Soriano). He spent the day with Txiki (Begiristain), Pep and Hugo (Viana) today, this morning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday in Los Angeles, locals LAFC of MLS will face Liga MX giants Club América in the FIFA Club World Cup play-in match. This one-leg playoff has been billed as the most expensive game in North American soccer history after FIFA, the sport's global governing body, announced that each participating Concacaf team would receive $9.55 million for taking part in the tournament. So Saturday's winner will leave BMO Stadium with a hefty check as well as a chance to play for the $125 million prize that will go to the tournament's eventual champion. There are also rumblings that college football's recently debuted 12-team playoff will grow to include up to 16 teams, with the lowest seeds playing their way into the final bracket in the future. FIFA's Club World Cup play-in game in 2025 is much more straightforward. However, with expansion the new norm at FIFA, and considering South American federation Conmebol's hope that the 2030 World Cup finals will include 64 teams, one can't rule out that the Club World Cup will eventually include a four-team play-in tournament. This inaugural 32-team Club World Cup, which is an expanded, four-yearly version of the annual version of the tournament, will be followed next year by a 48-team men's World Cup finals, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But Saturday night's win-and-you're-in match might actually never be played again. FIFA only created the play-in game in a rush after Mexican side Club León was expelled from the tournament in March. LAFC had lost to León in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final. So, as that competition's runner-up, LAFC was given a lifeline. Now, there have been recent meetings between MLS teams and Mexican ones in the Concacaf Champions Cup when a regional trophy was on the line. Yet, the winner of their match earns $5 million versus the nearly $10 million award FIFA will hand out in Los Angeles this weekend. That follows the recent trend by tournament organizers to increase the prize money up for grabs, thus further incentivizing participating teams. That's a significant increase from the 2024 total purse of $475,000. This year's Open Cup winner will receive a $600,000 prize. Meanwhile, MLS has over $2.5 million in its postseason award budget. Conmebol made a big splash in 2024 when it announced a $23 million reward for the winner of the Copa Libertadores. The UEFA Champions League winner will earn about $27 million. This season's European final, between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, will be played on the day of the Club World Cup play-in game, a few hours earlier in Munich, Germany. And why is LAFC allowed to host the play-in game at its home stadium? FIFA's Club World Cup tournament director Manolo Zubiria told reporters recently that an effort was made to stage the game at a neutral site. Zubiria cited several challenges that led tournament organizers to opt for BMO Stadium. He said that because of Club León's late appeal process, FIFA had to plan ahead in the event a play-in game would be the next alternative. “We came across multiple challenges, as you can appreciate, trying to put together a football match like this in such a short period of time,” Zubiria told reporters May 16. But also, one of the major challenges we had was the lead-in time or the time that we had to access a building to set up for a soccer match. “I'm not just talking about the field of play. I'm talking about everything else that we require for a FIFA competition, especially on the technology side, to have to set up VAR and goal-line technology and semiautomated offside.” LAFC co-president and general manager John Thorrington's response was as expected. I guess we would say I do know that there's been a number of conversations about the venue and various details about the game that we have stayed completely out of,” Thorrington said. “And what I would say is, if you go back to our preseason match against América (a 2-1 LAFC win at BMO Stadium in February), it didn't quite feel like a home game in the normal sense for us, given the affinity that and the fan base that they do have locally here in L.A.” Club América president of operations Héctor Gonzalez Iñárritu remained diplomatic about the chosen venue but acknowledged the decision was not optimal. “We know the efforts that FIFA made to find a neutral stadium,” he said. This isn't ideal, but we have to take advantage of the opportunity. Obviously, it would have been best to play at a neutral site. We know that there will be many more América fans there, plus Mexican fans who will surely root for América.” Inter Milan against PSG will kick off seven hours before the Club World Cup play-in game. However, the Champions League final is a fixture second only to the men's World Cup final in terms of prestige. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has invited fans to be part of history when the Club World Cup begins. That's all scripted speak from Infantino, but there is a brewing feud between FIFA and UEFA, its European equivalent, one that took a significant turn earlier this month during the FIFA Congress in Paraguay. UEFA officials, including the confederation's president Aleksander Ceferin, walked out of the congress after they alleged that Infantino, who was several hours late arriving at the event, had prioritized a trip to the Middle East to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders. The two sides have since calmed the waters, but it is another layer to what has become a controversial tournament. “We were also very considerate of everything that was happening. There is a Concacaf Champions Cup final the next day. There's a UEFA Champions League final the same day. But if you look at it the other way, it's also exciting because it gives an opportunity that so much football is happening on the same weekend, and one event will help lead into the other.” For LAFC and Club América, a golden ticket is at stake. They couldn't care less about all the noise. (Top photo: Thomas Coex / Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)</p>
