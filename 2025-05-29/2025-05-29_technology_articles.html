                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In September 2024, at least one American affiliated with the “Active Club” movement—a transnational alliance of far-right fight clubs that closely overlap with skinhead gangs and neo-fascist political movements—appears to have traveled to Borås, Sweden, to participate in a mixed-martial-arts tournament with members of other affiliated fight clubs from across Europe. Social media posts from Tvåsaxe and GYM XIV, the Swedish skinhead organizations that hosted Holmgang 2024, claim that at least one member from the Southern California Active Club was in attendance. Media 2 Rise was created by Active Club founder Robert Rundo in collaboration with an pseudonymous individual named "Lucca Corgiat," whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has identified as Montana neo-Nazi Allen Michael Goff. Media 2 Rise did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. When SPLC contacted Media 2 Rise on its publicly posted contact email address in an attempt to seek comment from Goff, it received no response. Two individuals whose photos have frequently been posted to the group's Telegram channel, Grady Mayfield and Robert Wheldon, testified last spring at Rundo's bail hearing during a convoluted legal saga that ended in him pleading guilty to federal Anti-Riot Act charges first filed in 2018. According to Swedish and American researchers, Tvåsaxe is aligned with the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM), a pan-Scandinavian neo-Nazi group that was designated as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group” by the American State Department in summer 2024. Counterterrorism sanctions bar Americans from associating with or providing support to listed groups; ban members from banking, owning property, or conducting business with American financial institutions; and expose anyone found associating with or supporting the sanctioned entity to possible criminal charges. Jason Blazakis, an extremism researcher at Middlebury College who ran the State Department component that makes FTO designations from 2008 through 2018, says that any level of tangible support to a listed terrorist group, be it sharing an event invitation or buying an item of clothing, could be the basis for a support-of-terrorism charge. “Folks could be looking at possibly 10 to 15 years if convicted, seizure of assets,” he says. “There are very real consequences for violating these sanctions.” These types of terrorist group designations are determined by the State or Treasury departments, and along with Foreign Terrorist Organizations are included on a formal sanctions list published and maintained by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which imposes financial sanctions and freezes assets. The DOJ has used the statute in a broad range of cases over the years, from charging French industrial giant Lafarge and its subsidiary for cutting business deals with the Islamic State in Northern Syria over a decade ago to six Bosnian-Americans accused and later convicted of providing material support to ISIS fighters. The statute often comes under criticism for its overbroad provisions, exemplified by a 2010 series of FBI raids on activists in Chicago and Minneapolis seeking evidence of ties to designated FTOs in Palestine and Colombia. NRM, which seeks to create a fascist ethnostate through violent revolution, dates back several decades and is considered one of the most violent neo-Nazi groups in Scandinavia. In 2017, three NRM-linked men were sentenced to prison for attempting to bomb one asylum center, and successfully bombing another as well as a left-wing bookstore. A current State Department staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, also believes American participation in the September tournament could represent a potential case of support for NRM. Rundo, a self-professed longtime fan of NRM, seems to have modeled Active Clubs and the Rise Above Movement (RAM), which he also founded, on Europe's extreme right-wing scene. Since 2021, Rundo has appeared at least twice on an NRM podcast, including an April 2023 episode devoted to Rundo's labyrinthine federal case for Anti-Riot Act violations. NRM also conducted banner drops over freeways and held demonstrations protesting his detention outside the American and Romanian embassies the same month following Rundo's arrest on an American warrant in Romania. The 2024 Swedish tournament mirrors similar extreme right-wing martial arts tournaments hosted elsewhere in Europe for years. There are dozens of the fight clubs throughout Europe, including more than 50 in France and several in the United Kingdom, where they came under new scrutiny following a February 2025 ITV documentary connecting members to terrorism and violence. The European Active Clubs are also networking increasingly across national boundaries—Swedish Active Club members were present alongside their Dutch and French comrades at a May 10 fascist march in Paris, and engaged in an outdoor training in the Jardin du Luxembourg with Active Club members from Germany and French far-right extremists. Though a number of the Swedish Active Club participants are older veterans of other extremist groups, they have had notable success in recruiting younger participants, some as young as 15. Per research from Expo.se, Engels set up a fight club in 2020 that closely imitated Sweden's burgeoning soccer hooligan subculture, where violence and criminality occasionally crosses over with neo-Nazism, particularly in the support base of Stockholm's main clubs of AIK, Djurgården, and Hammarby. Recently, American Active Clubs have combined with other far-right extremists like Patriot Front and the Hammerskins to hold their own mixed-martial arts-tournaments in Southern California, Texas, and elsewhere. “The Nordic Resistance Movement, relative to Active Clubs, are far more organized than your typical ACs and have a high level of criminality that is quite reminiscent of the Rise Above Movement,” Blazakis alleges. Prior to being listed as a terrorist organization by the Biden administration, Leman says, NRM had far cooler relations with rival far-right groups in Sweden. “You'd think that the Swedish scene would be reluctant to have anything to do with NRM, but in a way, it's them calling the Americans' bluff.” “I know that this is high on the radar for security services—[they're] much more concerned with these types of activities than they are traditional skinhead groups.” “You're already providing material support and making key connections.” (This was included in WIRED's request for comment sent to Media 2 Rise, which did not respond.) “The question is, are there financial transactions taking place?” It is currently unclear how the US authorities will handle cases involving far-right extremists who violate federal law, particularly in light of reports that the State Department is minimizing its use of terms related to far-right violence. “The question is, will there be true enforcement of associations with a far-right [terrorist group]?” Blazakis says, pointing to the presence of Darren Beattie as the State Department's acting under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs. In 2018, Beattie was fired from his position as a Donald Trump speechwriter after it was reported that he attended a white nationalist conference; CNN has similarly reported on his social media presence, which often espouses white supremacist beliefs. Beattie's office plays a major role in shaping the State Department's messaging on counterterrrorism and violent extremism. (The White House did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey is quoted as saying in the post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” IVAS was a massive military contract, with a total $22 billion budget, originally awarded to Microsoft in 2018 intended to develop HoloLens-like AR glasses for soldiers. But after endless problems, in February the Army stripped management of the program from Microsoft and awarded it to Anduril, with Microsoft staying on as a cloud provider. The intent is to eventually have multiple suppliers of mixed reality glasses for soldiers. All of this meant that if Luckey's former employer, Meta, wanted to tap into the potentially lucrative world of military VR/AR/XR headsets, it would need to go through Anduril. The idea is to provide soldiers with a heads-up display of battlefield intelligence in real time. An Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the product family Meta and Anduril are building is even called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices. EagleEye is what Luckey named Anduril's first imagined headset in Anduril's pitch deck draft, before his investors convinced him to focus on building software first. “All of them had worked with me for years via Oculus VR, and when they saw the EagleEye headset in our first Anduril pitch deck draft, they pointed out that it seemed like I was sequencing things irrationally. They believed, correctly, that I was too focused on winning a pissing contest over the future of AR/VR, on proving that I was right and the people who fired me were wrong,” Luckey tweeted in February after winning the IVAS contract.

LEGO does not only tell stories of well-known franchises such as Star Wars or Harry Potter, even though those licenses certainly helped propel LEGO in the minds of consumers globally. LEGO strives to bring global culture and history to life with its Architecture series featuring many wonderful landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Westminster Bridge, and Statue of Liberty. Over 1,000 units have sold in the last month and it is an Amazon's Choice item, so it is a steal for all builders and avid collectors of LEGO. What is incredible about the Statue of Liberty model is how much detail LEGO included in this set and how many builders were blown away. Lady Liberty's flowing robe is beautifully depicted, the pedestal with the shield is incredibly detailed with brick details and columns, broken shackles represent freedom, a 7-ray crown is iconic and the tablet and upraised arm with the golden torch is equally representation of freedom. With more than 1,600 pieces, standing 44 cm tall, this statue certainly captures your focus and can be a great statement piece anywhere at home or in the office. Based on reviews, the alternative designs and materials of this set are top quality at it's current promotional price, that makes it a great dal for a LEGO fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's hard to stand out in the phone world. Outside of foldable screens like the Flip and Fold pioneered by Samsung, most phones nowadays wind up looking suspiciously iPhone-esque—a rectangular glass slab with small variations in chassis that equate to flat or less-flat edges. First and foremost, the phones have a “transparent design,” which basically just means a slightly see-through backplate that showcases some internal components. Perhaps even more defining than that semi-transparent design aesthetic, however, is the Glyph Interface—an array of LEDs that light up the phone's backside to show notifications, timers, etc. “We killed the Glyph Interface” doesn't leave much to the imagination, especially with Nothing CEO Carl Pei chiming in underneath the seemingly straightforward update to say, “RIP.” So, that's it, right? Nothing just unceremoniously killed its phones' defining feature—maybe one that's even more defining than the design ethos they're kind of known for. Rumors indicate that though the Glyph Interface as we know it may be done for, there's a new luminous sheriff in town, and it may give Nothing phones a whole new look. While these are firmly rumors, Nothing fans have been speculating about a new kind of Glyph Interface—the dot matrix—and not all of the speculation is unfounded. Last week, Nothing tweeted out a teaser for its upcoming Phone 3, which is set to be unveiled in July, that gave a pretty big hint at a future dot-style design choice. “New dots” isn't much to go off of and could easily just be an update to its existing dot matrix aesthetic in NothingOS, but at the same time, the fact that Nothing bothered to issue a full-on teaser says a lot. And if I'm to put on my LED-clad tin foil hat for a moment, it would seem to me that a company as obsessed with its design and image as Nothing wouldn't so confidently announce that its next phone is about to get a lot more boring if it didn't have some other trick up its sleeve. One thing is for sure: There's a big change a-comin' and the Glyph Interface is at the center of that. However you feel about the Glyph Interface, it makes sense from a pure economics perspective to switch things up. LEDs are expensive and actually limiting when you break them down. They might be good for timer bars because of the granularity, but they can't show text and other word-based information. Either way, we'll find out soon enough, because Nothing is set to release its next phone this summer, and we'll more than likely have a device to test and show off when they finally roll around.

The best way to improve your home audio for watching movies, football games, and big budget TV shows without breaking your own budget is with a soundbar. You'll find a soundbar to be a significant enhancement to what the built-in speakers you TV is working with which usually sound tinny and weak in comparison. You deserve to immerse yourself fully in your media. Take for instance this LG 5.1.1 channel soundbar surround sound system. It's going for 40% off which brings the price down from $500 to just $300. This is all thanks to the rear speaker kit and a slew of supported features of the sound bar. Bring a new dimension of sound that will make your feel like you're in the movie or game with the rich sound. The soundbar utilizes a series of up-firing channels designed to bounce off your ceiling and fill the room with moving audio that flows around you. Plus is has support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. The rear speaker and subwoofer are all wireless so you don't need to worry about hiding cables when setting up your living room home theater. And the soundbar supports HDMI passthrough with support for 120Hz so you don't need to sacrifice visuals for great sound, especially while gaming. Well dialogue is primarily set to come through that center channel so this can be a game changer when watching a poorly mixed movie or show where the dialogue all feels silent against loud, room-shaking action moments. Even it out to what's best for the room you're viewing in. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

Intel's upcoming LGA1954 socket for next-generation Nova Lake CPUs is rumored to match its predecessor's size and may retain cooler compatibility. Ruby_Rapids on X highlighted NBD shipping manifests detailing the socket dimensions of LGA1954. At 45mm x 37.5mm, the size remains largely unchanged, despite offering roughly 100 more pins than LGA1851. Though there are whispers of a potential Arrow Lake Refresh up in the air, it is expected to mirror Raptor Lake Refresh with improved silicon, higher clock speeds, and potentially more cache. In essence, the next major desktop release from Intel should be Nova Lake, which has officially been slated for a 2026 launch. That being said, you may be able to keep your current cooler. Another Socket V series member:The package size of FCLGA1954 is 45×37.5, too.Today‘s coolers are mechanically compatible with Nova Lake-S. pic.twitter.com/BYJIwg0ANuMay 29, 2025 Here, with identical socket dimensions, we can infer a similar cooler mounting pattern. This was previously seen with LGA1156 (Nehalem/Westmere) all the way up to LGA1200 (Comet Lake/Rocket Lake), which could share the same CPU cooler due to a consistent mounting pattern (75mm x 75mm holes) throughout. Naturally, you'd need to confirm if your CPU cooler can dissipate the heat Nova Lake produces, though we don't expect it to exceed Arrow Lake in this regard. For example, both core types were arranged in distinct blocks with Meteor Lake. However, Intel shifted to an interspersed layout with Arrow Lake, which directly affects thermal hotspots. All things considered, we'll need to wait for official confirmation from Intel. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Elegoo has confirmed that full color printing is coming to the Centauri Series of FDM 3D printers by the third quarter of 2025. However, each system can only read its own RFID tag and is encrypted to prevent third-party access. This system of convenience has misguided many new Bambu Lab users into believing their printers can only operate with proprietary filament. An open-source system would encourage users to step outside their walled garden to explore the vast world of filament created by other manufacturers. Elegoo's RFID tags will embed information about the type, color, brand, and remaining weight of the spools with a rewritable storage tag. The data structure has been posted to GitHub, and Elegoo has invited the community at large to freely create or modify compatible filament products. To refine the system, Elegoo is actively seeking feedback on tag structure and development directions through GitHub issues and social media comments. The company emphasizes that community input will be key to building a flexible, intelligent, and open RFID ecosystem. “Together, we can unlock new possibilities for the future of 3D printing.” Prusa Research also uses RFID tags in their spools, but only for internal quality control tracking. A QR code lasered onto each spool of Prusament allows customers to track their spool to a website and discover the filament's production date, manufacturing location, tolerance specs, weight, length, and best print settings. This has led to speculation on the internet that Prusa Research could easily implement its own tagging system for the MMU3 and tool-swapping Prusa XL. Joseph Prusa is widely known as a supporter of Open Source. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Universally tagged spools – or the ability to add tags to spools you already own – would make slicing multicolor prints much easier. I often need to load filament and then take a photo of it in the AMS – or my Prusa XL's spool holders – then refer to the photo to configure the slicer.

This is simply the best air cooler on the market, exceeding my expectations for what air cooling can offer. You won't find better performance without using liquid cooling. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. In ancient Rome, the term Pretor (more commonly spelled Praetor) was given to magistrates and commanders of armies – and boy, does the title fit Thermalrights' latest flagship air cooler, the Royal Pretor 130. The performance of this latest product is ferocious, blurring the lines between what you should expect from air and liquid coolers. Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler, then we'll go over thermal performance with both Intel and AMD CPUs, as well as noise levels. Opening it reveals the parts, protected by molded foam, cardboard, and plastic coverings. The heatsink has two silver towers, with a black etched metal top showcasing Thermalright's brand name and logo. Thermalright includes its TF7 thermal compound with the cooler, which offers good performance, only a couple of degrees away from the best pastes you can buy. There's more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans have a significant impact on cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case. This cooler arrives with two different types of fans. My results may differ from others because I emphasize results that are comparable to real-world use. This means that I test CPU coolers inside of a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which makes weak coolers appear stronger than they are. Some publications have also used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions. I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions a CPU cooler is used in. My previous reviews have tested Intel's latest platform, using the Core Ultra 9 285K Arrow Lake CPU. But we're retiring this from our testing suite. Between BIOS changes and Windows updates, Arrow Lake's thermal characteristics have changed in some scenarios, rendering much of our previous testing data useless. With today's review, we're also testing AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is a beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market. It can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking. The installation of this cooler is simple for both Intel and AMD CPUs. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism. Next, you'll set the rubber standoffs on both Intel and AMD systems. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU.

Thousands of Asus routers have been compromised due to a newly discovered botnet called ‘AyySSHush.' The stealth attack was detected in March 2025 by cybersecurity firm GreyNoise, which reportedly exploits authentication and makes use of the router features to maintain long-term access. Notably, the backdoor does not make use of any malware, and the unauthorized access cannot be removed using firmware updates. The attack begins with threat actors targeting the routers through brute-force login attempts and exploiting authentication bypass techniques, some of which remain undocumented without assigned CVEs. Once inside, they target and exploit CVE-2023-39780, a known command injection vulnerability, to execute arbitrary system-level commands. The attackers use official Asus router features to gain persistent access. They also gain the ability to enable SSH on a non-standard port (TCP 53282) and install their own public SSH key, enabling remote administrative control. Since the backdoor is written to the router's non-volatile memory (NVRAM), it can survive both firmware updates and device reboots. Additionally, by disabling system logging and the router's AiProtection security features, the attackers ensure that they cannot be detected. Over 9,000 Asus routers have been confirmed as compromised, according to data from Censys, a platform that monitors and maps internet-facing devices globally. Censys identifies devices that are exposed to the internet, while GreyNoise detects which of those devices are being actively targeted or exploited. It flagged just three HTTP POST requests targeting Asus router endpoints for deeper inspection, which were then observed using emulated Asus profiles running factory firmware. However, the update is more or less a preventive measure. This is because the malicious configuration changes are stored in non-volatile memory and are not overwritten during standard firmware upgrades. To ensure routers are fully secured, users are advised to take additional manual steps, including checking for active SSH access on TCP port 53282, reviewing the authorized_keys file for unfamiliar entries, and blocking the known malicious IP addresses that may be associated with the campaign. If a device is suspected to be compromised, it is best to perform a full factory reset and then reconfigure the router from the beginning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House says it will launch an appeal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled that President Trump's sweeping tariffs, levied on nations including China, were unlawful, in a move that could significantly reshape the ongoing trade war and impact the price of technology. The court declared that all of President Trump's measures are "invalid as contrary to law" because the emergency law used to pass them does not give the President unilateral authority to impose such sweeping measures. Regarding Trafficking Tariffs, the court says these fail "because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders." In a statement reported by the BBC, the administration said, "It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency." Continuing, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, "President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness." Considering previous reports, tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70%. Legal suspension of tariffs levied on countries, including China, could be an enormous relief to suppliers of hardware, including the semiconductor industry, as well as component parts, notably GPUs. Earlier this month, it was reported that Nvidia has raised prices by 10-15% to combat rising manufacturing costs and tariffs, while TSMC recently called on Washington to drop tariffs on semiconductors made outside the U.S..
