                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbase, Texas, has notified some residents that they might "lose the right to continue using" their property as they do today, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. The town, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, is considering a new zoning ordinance and city-wide map. The notice, sent to property owners in a proposed "Mixed Use District," would allow for "residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses." Starbase plans to host a public hearing on Monday, June 23, 2025, about the proposed new zoning and map for the town. The notice was signed by Kent Myers, a city administrator for Starbase and radiation test specialist at SpaceX according to his LinkedIn profile. A "type-C municipal corporation," Starbase was officially formed earlier this month after Musk's aerospace and defense contractor prevailed in a local election. As of early this year, the population of Starbase stood around 500 people, with around 260 directly employed by SpaceX, the Texas Tribune reported. The company town includes the launch facility where SpaceX conducts test flights of its massive Starship rocket, and company-owned land covering a 1.6 square-mile area. Starbase is holding its first city commission meeting on Thursday, two days after SpaceX conducted its ninth test flight of the massive Starship rocket from the Texas coast facility. Following the incident, Musk, who also leads Tesla, focused on data and lessons to be learned from the explosions. The FAA said there had been "no reports of public injury or damage to public property" on Wednesday. Establishing Starbase as a company town helps SpaceX attain nearly unfettered permission to build, test or launch from its industrial complex on the Texas Gulf Coast. Notice is hereby given that the City Commission for the City of Starbase will conduct a Public Hearing on Monday, June 23, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., at the City of Starbase temporary city hall located at 39046 LBJ Boulevard, Brownsville, TX 78521, to hear public comments, consider and act upon the adoption of a Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance and city wide Zoning Map. Our goal is to ensure that the zoning plan reflects the City's vision for balanced growth, protecting critical economic drivers, ensuring public safety, and preserving green spaces. You are receiving this notice because you own the above listed property that will be located in the "Mixed Use District" and will be impacted if the zoning ordinance is approved. The Mixed Use District allows for a blend of residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. A proposed zoning map is enclosed with this notice. The City is required by Texas law to notify you of the following: THE CITY OF STARBASE IS HOLDING A HEARING THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE USING YOUR PROPERTY FOR ITS CURRENT USE, PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY. The foregoing notice is required by Texas Local Government Code section 211.006(a-1). The proposed zoning ordinance is based on current and existing uses. Please contact City Administrator Kent Myers [email address redacted] with any questions or written comments. Your written comments must be submitted by 3:00 pm on June 22, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TUNE IN: The 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list will be revealed Tuesday, June 10 at 6am ET Meta and Anduril, the defense-tech startup founded by Palmer Luckey, announced Thursday that they've formed a partnership to create virtual and augmented reality devices intended for use by the U.S. army. The partnership represents a major step by Meta to supply cutting-edge technology to the government in addition to working once again with Luckey, who sold his Oculus VR startup to the social media company for $2 billion in 2014. Luckey and Meta had an acrimonious split, with the Anduril founder telling CNBC in 2019 that he "got fired" from the company formerly known as Facebook "for no reason at all," suggesting that a $10,000 donation to a pro-Donald Trump group ahead of the 2016 U.S. election could have contributed to the decision. With Trump winning the U.S. presidency in November for the second time, Zuckerberg and other tech executives have since courted favor with the White House by making sweeping policy changes like relaxing content-moderation guidelines. Meta has also been pitching its open-source Llama family of AI models to government agencies and in November said it would make the those tools available to government units "working on defense and national security applications, and private sector partners supporting their work." "Meta has spent the last decade building AI and AR to enable the computing platform of the future," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. Meta and Anduril have placed a joint bid on an Army contract for VR devices that is worth up to $100 million, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The two companies are working on EagleEye, a system that carries sensors that enhance soldiers' hearing and vision, according to the report. Meta and Anduril will move forward on their partnership whether or not they win the Army contract, per the Journal. The two companies pitched their partnership as helping the U.S. maintain a "technical edge" while aiding national security and saving the military "billions of dollars by utilizing high-performance components and technology originally built for commercial use." "I am glad to be working with Meta once again." "Of all the areas where dual-use technology can make a difference for America, this is the one I am most excited about." Anduril also announced in December that it partnered with OpenAI on an artificial-intelligence initiative related to "national security missions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's devices unit has a new team tasked with inventing "breakthrough" consumer products that's being led by a former Microsoft executive who helped create the Xbox. The ZeroOne team is spread across Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California, and is focused on both hardware and software projects, according to job postings from the past month. Amazon has a checkered history in hardware, with hits including the Kindle e-reader, Echo smart speaker and Fire streaming sticks, as well as flops like the Fire Phone, Halo fitness tracker and Glow kids teleconferencing device. Many of the products emerged from Lab126, Amazon's hardware research and development unit, which is based in Silicon Valley. The new group is being led by J Allard, who spent 19 years at Microsoft, most recently as technology chief of consumer products, a role he left in 2010, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was a key architect of the Xbox game console, as well as the Zune, a failed iPod competitor. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed Allard oversees ZeroOne but declined to comment further on the group's work. The job postings provide few specific details about what ZeroOne is building, though one listing references working on "conceiving, designing, and bringing to market computer vision techniques for a new smart-home product." Another post for a senior customer insights manager in San Francisco says the job entails owning "the methodology and execution of concept testing and early feedback for ZeroOne programs." "You'll be part of a team that embraces design thinking, rapid experimentation, and building to learn," the description says. "If you're excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk to you." Amazon has pulled in staffers from other business units that have experience developing innovative technologies, including its Alexa voice assistant, Luna cloud gaming service and Halo sleep tracker, according to Linkedin profiles of ZeroOne employees. While Amazon is expanding this particular corner of its devices group, the company is scaling back other areas of the sprawling devices and services division. Earlier this month, Amazon laid off about 100 of the group's employees. The job cuts included staffers working on Alexa and Amazon Kids, which develops services for children, as well as Lab126, according to public filings and people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. More than 50 employees were laid off at Amazon's Lab126 facilities in Sunnyvale, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings in California.

The ruling would reduce the effective US tariff rate to below 6% from a high of almost 27% last month.

President Donald Trump's appetite for new tariffs remains undeterred, even after a pair of court decisions hit his signature duties with their most devastating blow yet. 

White House officials quickly signaled Thursday that Trump will aggressively pursue legal challenges and, if they fail, move forward with many of the same levies through other authorities.</p>

Michael Cembalest has been an investment analyst for almost 40 years and his research notes have drawn a cult following on Wall Street. He's known for going super deep into a wide range of topics, like energy and healthcare. And lately he's been writing a lot about AI, with a particular interest in figuring out whether all the investment in data centers and compute will translate into actual profits. On this episode, we talk to the chair of market and investment strategy for JPMorgan Asset Management about why AI is the market "bet of the century," why the dominance of US big tech can't be overstated, and why he's pessimistic about the outlook for small modular nuclear reactors.Odd Lots Live is returning to New York City on June 26.

A train enters the United States over a rail bridge on the US-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas.

Senior White House officials on Thursday downplayed the implications of a court ruling that blocked a swath of President Donald Trump's tariff measures, and expressed confidence about an appeal.

âIf anybody thinks this caught the administration by surprise, think again,â Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Bloomberg Television. âNothing's really changed.â</p>

Just weeks after US President Donald Trump declared a âtotal resetâ with China following a trade truce in Geneva, tensions are rising again between the world's biggest economies.

Trump's administration on Wednesday announced it would start revoking Chinese student visas, while also introducing new restrictions on the sales of chip design software and reportedly some jet engine parts to China.

Clearlake Capital Group is testing just how far it can go to prevent opportunistic investors from scooping up the debt of a troubled portfolio company.

The private equity firm has expanded the so-called disqualified lender list for container manufacturer Pretium Packaging to almost 100 names in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Typically such lists, which allow borrowers to block certain parties from purchasing their loans, range from a handful of shops to a few dozen, market watchers say.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said China has stopped selling drones to Kyiv and other European nations while continuing shipments to Russia.

âChinese Mavic is open for Russians but is closed for Ukrainians,â Zelenskiy told a group of reporters on Tuesday. âThere are production lines on Russian territory where there are Chinese representatives,â he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kaur has disavowed the email entirely to Business Insider, with both herself and Carta saying it was written by Talton's lawyers when she was in an "emotional" state. Kaur, who worked as Carta's vice president of Engineering from 2018 to 2022, sent the letter in October 2022. Kaur emailed the detailed, two-page letter to Carta's CEO, general counsel, chief people officer, and Talton himself. In the letter, Kaur alleged that Ward made her feel "vulnerable and smaller" at a dinner with him, ignored a potential promotion, and used the word "ceremonial" to describe part of her role. She praised Ward's leadership and her time at Carta. "I just wanted to clarify, I was emotional and there was a lot going on at the company with exec turnover and whatnot," Kaur said, adding, "Misunderstandings happen." Carta, which encouraged BI to speak with Kaur, said in a statement, "Ms. Kaur was initially persuaded by Talton to send the resignation letter during a time she testified was 'emotional and difficult.'" "Talton's attempt to connect her resignation with his termination to draw conclusions about culture at Carta is a gross distortion of the facts," Carta added. Carta, a startup that helps companies manage employee equity and shares, has raised more than $1 billion from Silicon Valley VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Kaur's letter attributes her resignation to a humiliating dinner with Ward in October 2022, during which he made comments that "convinced" her she could no longer stay. Kaur loved working at Carta and admired Ward, the email says. She wanted to help the company during a turbulent period marked by economic uncertainty, the departure of chief product officer Heidi Johnson, and its CTO, Talton, being placed on leave. A few months later, Carta sued Talton and accused him of secretly recording meetings, sparking the current legal battle. Instead, per the email, Ward called her an already "ceremonial" SVP, a comment she found "shocking" since someone else at Carta had received that exact promotion. "Talking to me as if I am a poor substitute for a man he has put on leave is not appropriate," the email says. Ward's questions made her "extremely uncomfortable," Kaur says in the email. The dinner became such a "cross-examination" that waiters kept returning to check on her because she hadn't touched her food, the email says. Kaur also said Ward accused Johnson and Talton of being "disloyal" and predicted they would bring Carta's internal problems to The New York Times, which had profiled Carta's issues in a 2020 investigation. In her view, the dinner conversation showed Ward had a "pattern of humiliating certain women." In counterclaims in the Southern District of New York court, Talton alleged that Carta pressured Kaur to rescind the email, writing that CEO Ward and Carta's then-Chief People Officer Paige Bailey "worked hard to get Kaur to rescind it, even going so far as to draft an 'apology' email for her." In 2023, BI reported that Kaur was one of three top executives at Carta who had internally filed gender discrimination complaints. At the time, Kaur also denied her departure was due to such issues. That same year, the company settled a lawsuit brought by former vice president of marketing Emily Kramer alleging gender discrimination and illegal retaliation. Johnson submitted a gender discrimination complaint to Carta's board, and Carta sued her to prevent the release of damaging records in a case that was also settled. Earlier this year, Carta settled a sexual harassment case filed by a female ex-sales manager against its chief revenue officer Jeff Perry, who strongly denied any wrongdoing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portless offers Western brands the chance to use a shipping and fulfillment model made popular by Shein. Shein grew to dominate the fast-fashion world by responding quickly to changing style trends and shipping packages on planes going directly to customers from warehouses in China. Products cross borders in a matter of days rather than months. For years, Shein did this using the de minimis provision, which allows for the duty-free import of packages valued at less than $800. Portless emulates this model by shipping from its fulfillment center in Shenzhen, China, near where many of its customers manufacture their goods. For a while, it also used the de minimis exemption. However, on May 2, the Trump administration ended de minimis shipping as part of its tariff program. That meant many companies had to pivot. Portless' founder and CEO, Izzy Rosenzweig, told Business Insider that the company had been preparing for the end of de minimis since last September. It raised its Series A with the understanding that de minimis would be ending. By fulfilling orders outside the US, the company can help brands defer their duty payments until an order crosses the border on its way to a customer. It pays duties on behalf of its brand customers, who then pay Portless back later. "There isn't a company in the US that isn't looking for a new way of doing things," Rosenzweig said. Businesses impacted by tariffs and the end of de minimis have also explored other strategies, like storing inventory in bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones, to defer their duty payments and lessen the hit on their balance sheets. Rosenzweig said brands of that size benefit the most from having better access to cash, which Portless helps with by fulfilling small orders by plane instead of tying up large amounts of inventory on shipping containers. "In our model, it is like a live supply chain," he said. Before creating Portless, Rosenzweig founded an online marketplace called Browze that sourced products directly from factories in China. In his 10 years running the company, he saw firsthand how complicated global supply chains are. It has a new fulfillment center in Vietnam and plans to open another in India by the end of the third quarter. It plans to introduce the ability to book quality control inspections through its customer portal within the next two months. "While today Portless is fundamentally changing cash flow with a new supply chain model, we want to simplify supply chain," Rosenzweig said. "A lot of things will change in our model, like small-batch manufacturing, and we'll be rolling out services." "We were able to get comfortable by talking to many of Portless' customers and finding out that the tax advantage was not the reason they decided to choose Portless," he said. "They were all focused on aligning production volumes with actual demand, and this was the best model to facilitate that."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Quinn is the senior director of AI operations for Pearl, an AI search platform for professional services. In a prior role at a startup, the arrival of OpenAI's GPT-4 meant artificial intelligence could do the work of a team he was building. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity. In my last job, I was at a startup. Before that, I was leading engineering operations at Waymo. So, when the startup came along, it was about this bigger swing and this even bigger opportunity, potentially, to help this company unlock what they were going after. My main role in that was to lead what was the primary human-in-the-loop operation responsible for supervising and curating the AI. When I joined, it was already a 500-person strong organization, and I was hired to ramp it to thousands. By all indications, we were doing the job really well. After playing with it for just a couple of months, we realized that the bulk of the operation that I was scaling, really the entirety of it, was no longer needed. I then spent my last few months there ramping that operation down and setting up a couple of other AI-related agents to help with things like quality technical writing. Once that was in place, my skills simply weren't needed there. In my career, I'd gone from a place where companies like Waymo, Apple, and Amazon were coming to hire me to being out of a job and unable to get the attention of any company. This moment is making it such that these great companies now have way more capability and people than they may need. So, you've got a lot of great people that are now having to find their next play, but the next plays are dramatically changing. When I was hired at the startup, I spent the next four months with my team working tirelessly on basically solving this case and figuring out the right staffing and management model. It spit out the exact answer â the perfect answer â in 30 seconds, including what we thought were very clever adaptations that had taken us a week to identify. After we began to wind down the operation, I started looking around to figure out what my next play would be. I spent about five months conducting my job search the wrong way and getting nowhere. I remember this moment sitting there, again, with my jaw in my hand, wondering, "What am I doing wrong?" It came back with more nuance and appreciation than I ever could have imagined. That's when I moved into collaboration mode with AI. When it came out, people had fun with the idea of putting their rÃ©sumÃ©s into it and creating a podcast. I actually found incredible utility in doing that. What does it call out as the highlights? When I did this, I realized that there were great things about my background and experiences that I wasn't telling people because I didn't see or appreciate them, but this podcast called them out. Before using AI, I wrote a nice cover letter, updated my rÃ©sumÃ©, and started looking around on LinkedIn and applying. I was using my network, casting the line. I wasn't just in a corner quietly hoping something would come to me, but it was the traditional approach of, "Here's the rÃ©sumÃ© that I made for every job. I was essentially cold applying and trying to hit people up on LinkedIn. Most people have probably heard that you should tailor your rÃ©sumÃ©, cover letter, or communications for a role. But that's hard when you're in the grind and just trying to get a job. Now I've turned it into CareerBuddy GPT, but JobHunt GPT was what came out of all this exploration. In my case, it was a custom GPT that understood my background, where I was trying to go, and the history of the jobs I'd applied for. Can you assess my candidacy for this?" The first thing I get is an objective review of how I mesh up against a role. Then, I can say, "Alright, pick apart my rÃ©sumÃ©. And it can write the cover letter and identify the key people for me to reach out to. This applies to anything, but especially if you're looking for a job, you have to leverage the most powerful tool available, which is AI. Do you have a story to share about your job hunt?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending," Musk wrote in a post on X on Wednesday. "The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government." A White House official confirmed that Musk's offboarding was beginning. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO previously said he would be stepping back from his government work in May. Federal law stipulates that those with this title cannot serve for more than 130 days in a 365-day period. The tech titan had been closely involved in the White House DOGE office's efforts to cut government spending and eliminate fraud and waste. Musk has also recently said he spent "too much time" on politics this year and that he plans to cut back his political spending. Musk said in an X post on Saturday that he was back to "spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms," to the relief of Tesla investors. Tesla's share price has been on the rise since his announcement in April that he'd be stepping back from his White House work. The company had been targeted by boycotts and protests over its CEO's work with the White House DOGE office.</p>
