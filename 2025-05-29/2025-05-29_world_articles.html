                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Diplomas and a court decision: Harvard University held its 2025 commencement ceremony today as a federal district judge –– in a Boston courtroom 6 miles away –– said she will order the Trump administration not to make any changes to Harvard's student visa program indefinitely. Harvard also is suing the government over its freeze of $2.2 billion in federal money after the Ivy League school refused to take steps including eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, banning masks at protests and enacting merit-based hiring and admissions changes. President Donald Trump has suggested Harvard enroll no more than “around 15%” of scholars from overseas. Some foreign students worried “immigration-related action” would unfold at graduation. “We were recruited here because American medical schools simply don't graduate sufficient numbers of physicians to fill the country's needs,” said Dr. Abraham Verghese, a physician and bestselling author. He said many other foreign-born medical workers are filling critical gaps in the US. “More than a quarter of the physicians are foreign medical graduates, and many of those foreign physicians ultimately settle in places that others might not find as desirable,” Verghese said. Dr. Abraham Verghese spoke about moving to a small town in Tennessee amid the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the mid 1980s, highlighting his pleasant surprise to find his dying patients well-received by their families, “given the prevailing sentiments against gay people.” “They were cared for lovingly, to the end,” Verghese said. “These brave men taught me so much about quiet and about manhood, not the caricature of manliness, the posturing that has become so fashionable lately,” he continued. “They found that meaning, …  at the end of a shortened life, did not reside in fame, power, reputation, acquisitions, good looks,” Verghese said. Dr. Abraham Verghese said he grew up in Ethiopia reading books by American authors such as Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway. Verghese said he was inspired to pursue a career in medicine after reading the novel “Of Human Bondage,” by W. Somerset Maugham. “The idea that now in America, a book that might speak to a young reader, reveal his or her calling, could be banned from their library by a school board or government decree is beyond tragic,” he said. “I know we will find our way back to displaying those attributes of America I've admired from afar,” Verghese said to applause, “the America that I've known and loved from over four decades of being here, and it depends on all of you.” “When legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country, including so many of your international students, worry about being wrongly detained and even deported, perhaps it's fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me,” he continued. “Part of what makes America great, if I may use that phrase, is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom,” Verghese said, nodding to President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan. Dr. Abraham Verghese – the bestselling author, Stanford University professor and infectious disease expert – began his commencement address by acknowledging Harvard is facing “unprecedented” times. “In this institution's almost four-century existence, there has probably not been more attention focused on you than in these last few months,” Verghese told the graduates assembled. “In coming to your campus, I feel very much like a medieval messenger who had to sneak through the encircling forces and slip into your besieged community.” Verghese offered his congratulations to graduates and told them “no recent events can diminish what each of you has accomplished here.” “The outrage so many feel also must surely lead us to a new appreciation – appreciation for the rule of law and due process,” he said, to a burst of applause. Groundbreaking Latina actor and singer Rita Moreno, 93, broke down in tears as she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree. Moreno, who first performed on Broadway as a teenager and noted she was able to find work without a degree, was awarded the degree by Harvard provost John Manning “with hopes that the parchment we now present her will not damage her future prospects.” Moreno was then serenaded by Harvard student Carolyn Hao with “Somewhere,” the showstopping number from “West Side Story,” a film for which Moreno won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1962. Moreno drew a standing ovation, joining with harmony on the final note. US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs says she will order the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to not make any changes to Harvard's student visa program indefinitely. While the Trump administration has tried to defuse the situation heading into a crucial court hearing for Harvard University's international student population, the judge is moving forward with putting in place a firm court order – a preliminary injunction – after previously stepping in on an emergency basis last week to stop the Trump administration's revocation of Harvard's student visa program. “It doesn't need to be draconian, but I want to make sure it's worded in such a way that nothing changes,” she said. Harvard's lead lawyer Ian Gershengorn said he wants to make sure there are no “shenanigans” once the court order is in place. The judge also has expressed concern that potential Harvard students abroad have been unable to get visas from some US embassies abroad since last week, according to Harvard's sworn statements. After the Trump administration announced plans to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas, Yurong “Luanna” Jiang, a graduate of the class of 2025 from China, received a standing ovation after delivering a commencement speech that urged graduates to remember their “shared humanity.” Harvard's school of international development was founded on a vision, Jiang said, that “humanity rises and falls as one.” “If we still believe in a shared future, let us not forget those who were labeled as enemies, they too are human,” she said. “In the end, we do not rise by proving each other wrong. We rise by refusing to let one another go.” The Trump administration in court is trying to put off being under any court orders in its fight with Harvard University over student visas. “I don't know whether to take that as an acknowledgment procedural steps were not taken,” Judge Allison Burroughs of the District of Massachusetts said. Less than 6 miles away from Harvard's graduation celebrations today, US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs has gaveled in a hearing that could decide the future for Harvard's international students. Across the river overlooking Boston Harbor, more than 50 lawyers, media and onlookers are awaiting the Harvard vs. Trump administration clash in court over student visas. Harvard University has assembled a top-notch legal team that has arrived, expected to be led on Thursday by Ian Gershengorn, a well-established Supreme Court litigator and former acting US Solicitor General in the Obama administration, indicating the seriousness and likely substance of the hearing today on the student visa program. Gershengorn is also notable for the firm he comes from, Jenner & Block, which was the subject of a severely limiting executive order from the Trump White House in recent weeks that was borne out of Trump's personal animus toward some lawyers. Three courts so far have determined the restrictions Trump is placing on law firms he dislikes are unlawful, and the Trump administration's actions toward law firms and universities like Harvard are perceived as part of a similar campaign to punish powerful intellectual institutions in America that have championed diversity, globalization and the rule of law. “We leave a much different campus than the one we entered, with Harvard at the center of a national battle over higher education in America,” said Thor Reimann.

Harvard President Alan Garber received warm applause from the faculty and graduating class at today's commencement celebration. “Harvard is doing it's best and I'm doing my best to make it a day of joy and satisfaction, pride – especially to the families of the students who worked so hard for four years, families who made sacrifices to send their kids here,” Pinker told CNN's Kate Bolduan. “There is no reason to put a wall around the United States. Sometimes the best science is done in some other country and we want to bring them here and find out what they are doing,” he said. Beaming graduating seniors were decked out in caps and gowns as family members in suits and spring dresses swarmed to celebrate their loves ones. Basketball legend and social activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came out in strong defense of Harvard University and its leadership during a speech Wednesday on campus. “After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians, and other universities bend their knees to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,” said Abdul-Jabbar. The Trump administration has thrown the lives of the university's 7,000 international students into distress and disarray, with some afraid of attending commencement this week, Harvard's director of immigration services spelled out yesterday in a new court filing. Some US students are even reconsidering enrolling this fall because of the Trump administration's actions, Maureen Martin wrote in her sworn statement. Harvard's faculty and administration are being “inundated with questions” from concerned students, and international students are so distressed their mental health has been affected, she wrote. “Some are afraid to attend their own graduation ceremonies this week out of fear that some immigration-related action will be taken against them,” Martin wrote. “Some have cancelled upcoming international travel plans to conduct academic research or see their families in light of the risk that they might not be admitted back into the United States.” International students set to come to Harvard for future semesters are reconsidering, including at least one medical school and one law student, Martin added, as are at least three US students who want to study where international students also can be. Others have had trouble getting student visas to the US at embassies abroad in recent days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The billionaire's term as a “special government employee” is set to end, but his outsized influence remains. Billionaire Elon Musk announced late Wednesday that he is leaving the Trump administration after spearheading a monthslong, lawless rampage through the government that hollowed out entire agencies, hurled critical functions such as the distribution of Social Security benefits into chaos, and installed many unqualified lackeys whose work will continue in the coming months and years. Musk's announcement came just ahead of the official May 30 deadline for his departure as a special government employee. While Musk came nowhere close to his initially stated goal of slashing $2 trillion in federal spending, his team's infiltration and efforts to gut federal agencies inflicted lasting damage, progressive lawmakers and watchdog groups said in response to news of his departure. “This is a legacy of carnage and corruption that will haunt us for many years to come.” Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called Musk's exit a win for “the anti-corruption, anti-billionaire movement in American politics” but warned that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's “likely goal is to continue exercising corrupt influence — just from behind a curtain, as billionaires too often do.” “We will have to keep up the pressure, scrutiny, and eventually formal oversight until we finally take back our government from Musk and the entire billionaire class,” Casar said. Politico reported that the package “will target NPR and PBS, as well as foreign aid agencies that have already been gutted by the Trump administration.” Reuters highlighted one example last week, reporting that “Head Start preschool programs for low-income U.S. children are scrambling to cope with funding cuts and delays, as they feel the squeeze of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting drive.” The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defence argues photos taken by police inside Patterson's home appear to show computers and a phone that were not seized during search Who are Erin Patterson and the other key figures in Australia's mushroom murders trial? Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to poisoning her four lunch guests – relatives of her estranged husband, Simon Patterson – with a beef wellington served at her house in Leongatha, Victoria on 29 July 2023. Lawyers for Patterson say the death cap mushroom poisoning was a tragic and terrible accident. Under cross-examination from Colin Mandy SC, for Patterson, Eppingstall was asked to expand on several pieces of evidence already shown to the jury, including message exchanges between Patterson and Don and Gail, the exchanges Patterson shared with her friends on Facebook, CCTV purportedly showing Patterson's son attending Subway in the hours after the lunch, and images taken during the police search of her property on 5 August. Eppingstall was shown photos taken by police inside Patterson's home which Mandy said appeared to show laptop computers and a phone that he said were not seized by police. Mandy said a USB at the home was also not seized. Mandy also had messages shown to the court between Patterson and her Facebook friends that he said provided context to other messages sent by Patterson that were already in evidence about her relationship with Simon and his parents. The messages shown to the court on Thursday revealed the Facebook friends making comments like “what morons”, “it's pathetic”, “you are human”, “so sorry Erin it's so fucking hard” and “I went through similar with my ex in-laws, she was wonderful until we split up”. “This was a chat where a number of the participants were talking like this, that is venting to each other about various issues in their lives,” Mandy asked Eppingstall. Mandy said the chat was also used for “random conversation” about pets, children, and other issues in their lives, referring to a discussion “about the fact that Kirstie Alley was dead”. I don't think so, but that's a matter for you, sir.” Eppingstall's evidence is set to continue for a fourth day on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) acolytes readily admit, U.S. public health continues to deteriorate. Five years into the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. life expectancy is at best stalled while those of other industrial countries have rebounded back onto their historical trends upward. The solution Trump administration officials are offering is to replace 125 years of — albeit underfunded — public health infrastructure with a eugenics-framed program wrapped in natural health packaging. Like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Oz signaled his plans to focus on chronic disease in the U.S., saying it was “the patriotic duty of all Americans to take care of themselves.” “Because it's important for serving in the military, but it's also important because healthy people don't consume health care resources,” he added. “The best way to reduce drug spending is to use less drugs, because you don't need them, because you're healthy, and it feels a lot better.” The message: Take care of yourselves — because we won't. Never mind the trillions of dollars Americans pay into a largely privatized — and very profitable — health care system, far outspending other industrial countries only to suffer worse health outcomes. It's cutting billions to state programs tracking disease, repealing emissions and drinking water regulations, revoking hundreds of millions in funding for life-saving research, canceling local food programs for schools and food banks, rolling back vaccinations, and shutting down the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. In these programs' stead, MAHA aims to place responsibility for health problems on the individual. Americans must now “do their own research” on complex medical matters beyond the due diligence that can reasonably be expected of any adult — as if each of us can serve as our own CDC. Democratic Party politicos, largely state officials outside Washington, D.C., have objected to these rollbacks both in the press and in the courts. Wasn't it only three years ago that President Biden's CDC Director Rochelle Walensky took a eugenics position on the pandemic, claiming it was good news that it was largely people with underlying health conditions who were dying from COVID? Who botched the latest bird flu response to begin with? What administration did nearly nothing around the toxic derailment in East Palestine, Ohio? Who green-lighted over a year of Palestinian genocide, with, we recently learned, even Israeli officials surprised President Joe Biden never pressed for a ceasefire and with Secretary of State Antony Blinken approving bombing Gaza aid convoys? There's a shared path across administrations leading to this public health moment — with whole populations at home and abroad increasingly abandoned. Any opposition movement must understand that these patterns began long before Donald Trump if it aims to fight back effectively. The problem here is a structural crisis of capitalism and requires more than an electoral solution. The public commons no longer holds space within existing relations of private property and production. Under whichever political party, public health, by definition, can never be conducted as an individualist enterprise. Yes, each of us has choices to make and responsibilities to attend to during a pandemic or other emergency, but — as the CDC missed even before Trump — effective public health isn't merely an emergent property of many millions of individual choices. It requires action at scale — from the neighborhood level to global cooperation. Making sure we can mutually protect ourselves requires us to arrive at decisions together. Modern employers — from the classical liberal era to neoliberalism and the now-accelerating turn toward a fascistic reorganization of government — have consistently opposed such an objective. Elsewhere, employers and their proxies demand that funding for social services be redirected to industrial subsidies or tax cuts for the rich. Sick or dead employees can just be replaced from the reserve army of labor — the unemployed surviving on society's margins — or, increasingly, by AI. Countries differ in how they approach public health programming. National programs differed in their response to COVID and bird flu. So no corporation, individual, or market can defeat a pandemic. We cannot shop our way out of problems in population health, which represent far more than the mere “externalities” corporations park off their balance sheets or the influencer marketing MAHA is attempting to turn into policy. The connections between the structure of a society and its public health practices speak directly to bedrock notions of social justice and fairness. The notion that workers and residents could govern themselves from the bottom-up seems to many commentators beyond our increasingly top-down society. For instance, Maroon communities were self-governing safe havens for self-liberated formerly enslaved people, often joining with Indigenous people throughout the southern hemisphere. Historian Mike Davis describes the origins of Chambers of Commerce as a desperate employer effort to counter Chambers of Labor, another example, which fought for worker well-being from the factory floor to the neighborhood block. With only Chambers of Commerce left today, the top-down version is now presented and operationalized as the natural order of things. We cannot consume our way out of a pandemic, however, even with the best respirators or hand sanitizers on the market. Most union members working on workplace safety instantly recognize and dismiss this “blame the worker” (and the worker alone) approach. We could all benefit from learning to assimilate that recognition as a social gut instinct. Such a pivot would also suit U.S. public health practitioners. Many public health models accept — and operationalize — the political premises of the institutions funding them, with significant impacts on our health interventions. Each “slice” of an intervention has its uses and problems. Layering the different kinds of interventions covers each slice's functional holes. What masking misses, handwashing, eye protection and social distancing can likely catch. Hospital epidemiologist Saskia Popescu presents a broader version, showing what individuals can do — wear masks, get vaccinated — and what “we” can do collectively: “We,” “our,” and “shared” must always be explicitly identified. It's the boss's responsibility to provide clean air and personal protective equipment (PPE) at work, though perhaps the model is technically right in that without unions demanding clean air through bargaining or legislation, the intervention might not ever take place. The abrupt end to federal pandemic protections guaranteed companies would stop providing paid COVID sick leave and other precautions (now including vaccination) on their own. Some employers chose a different path, if only in passing fashion. Which health model institutions use shapes what they see as the nature of the emergency and what they choose to do about it. As Oz's press conference demonstrated, the soft eugenics of early COVID is now being increasingly deployed in more explicit language. The Swiss cheese model provides an excellent, accessible tool for grasping multilayered problems and their solutions. We now need to keep track when modelers and policy makers leave out whole blocks of slices that make the critical epidemiological difference. Horizon Risk Consultancy, the consultant that adapted the NIOSH HoC for COVID here, does not, however, recommend air filters, HVAC upgrades or paid sick leave. Here's a more comprehensive version of the COVID HoC model from Doctors in Unite, the British medical union, including changes in ergonomics, working outside or from home and wage protections: The full array of possible COVID-specific interventions inside the body and out are gathered in one graphic, including vaccination, face masks, distancing, ventilation, remote work, and, if necessary, furlough. In a prevention framework that extends beyond the individual, these are our true first responders. The important work that firefighters, nurses, doctors and EMTs conduct should be embraced, of course, but also understood as the second and third lines of public defense. Public health ecologists Deborah Wallace and Rodrick Wallace argue the modeling of emergencies, however necessary, often misses when and where the emergency begins. Structural causes — including expropriation, patriarchy and white supremacy — are as much part of the emergency, a bigger picture public health movements should assimilate in the face of the present administration's efforts to censor such understanding. This framework of prevention also puts engineers, architects, sheet metal workers and other trades in a position to design and construct buildings that inhibit the spread of airborne diseases. Preventing hospital visits saves both lives and money, but in ways that — contrary to the policies of Kennedy and Oz — place responsibility on those with the power to intervene at scale. The entire design and construction professions, beyond essential public health measures like redesigning meat processing plants and following the new LEED certification that includes indoor air quality standards, should collaborate with unions in redesigning every workplace and all public spaces to better public health. While the diagrams show individuals, the government and even corporations, they do not show any organization of workers themselves — from unions to broader communities and how we choose to organize our society. Other parts of the bigger picture are still missing. Ultimately, preventing most zoonotic pathogens from emerging in the first place will better position us to bring the “age of pandemics” to an end. We can protect nature from the doomsday extractivism driving disease emergence by deploying regenerative agriculture, agroecology, conservation, regional planning, land back movements, and cooperative agro-economies. We can return the locus of control around what to grow to farmers and farming communities while also integrating Indigenous knowledge. It seems to be aiming to convince people that public health itself is the danger and removing it is a societal advance. The FDA had also just closed out an unpublicized investigation of a 15-state E. coli outbreak. Oz's swearing-in ended in a similar if more allegorical fashion: A reporter was about to ask a question when the incident occurred, and Trump looked over at what was happening. Trump then went over to see what happened, and could be heard saying, “She's OK.” This piece was adapted from Pandemic Research for the People Dispatch #10 on collective choice and public health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Russia's Migalovo Air Base in Tver Oblast came under attack by drones overnight on May 25, the Russian independent news channel Astra reported. Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya confirmed that air defense units had intercepted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the area. Rudenya claimed that five UAVs were shot down but reported no damage or casualties. Later in the night he said that three more drones were shot down in the area and that air defense was active over Tver. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports. Ukraine has previously targeted Russian air bases in drone attacks, aiming to undermine Moscow's ability to carry out large-scary aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities. Kyiv has also launched several strikes against targets in Tver Oblast. Previous targets have included ammunition depots and missile arsenals. The latest reported attack on Tver Oblast came as Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. For the second night in a row, Moscow barraged Kyiv with drones and missiles, injuring civilians. As Russia intensifies aerial attacks on Ukraine and the civilian death toll climbs, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory. The recent surge in drone strikes aims to disrupt airport operations, overwhelm air defenses, and mount pressure against the Russian population. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ruling says Trump exceeded authority in imposing sweeping tariffs. Don't already get First Thing in your inbox? A federal trade court has ruled Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs regime illegal, a dramatic twist that could block the president's controversial global trade policy. The ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump's strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to US shores and shrink a $1.2tn goods trade deficit. Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress but Trump has so far bypassed that requirement by claiming that the country's trade deficits amounted to a national emergency. The court's ruling said Trump's tariff orders “exceed any authority granted to the president … to regulate importation by means of tariffs”. The Trump administration has already filed to appeal. White House officials attacked the court, calling it “unelected”. Four people were killed as thousands of starving Palestinians burst into a UN warehouse in Gaza, tearing away sections of the building's metal walls in a desperate attempt to find food. Two people were fatally crushed and two others died of gunshot wounds after people crowded into a World Food Programme warehouse in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday, health officials said. It was not immediately clear if Israeli forces, private contractors or others had opened fire. Earlier, at least one civilian was killed and 48 wounded when Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, after the US-backed food logistics group chosen by Israel to ship food into Gaza, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), lost control of its distribution center, health officials reported. What is the humanitarian situation after Israel's aid blockade since 2 March? Elon Musk has announced he is leaving his role in the Trump administration, a departure the White House confirmed on Wednesday evening. It followed Musk publicly criticizing Donald Trump's tax bill, saying the plan undermined cost-cutting efforts, in comments likely to widen a rift between the two men. Extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations; ending Joe Biden's clean energy incentives; construction of a wall along the Mexican border; about $1tn in cuts to benefits, including Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps. Donald Trump's plane from the government of Qatar, which he said would be turned into the new Air Force One, has arrived – but the president says it's too big to use as his personal aircraft. A former French surgeon was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of patients, mostly aged under 15, after the biggest child abuse trial in French history. Argentina is being used as a “testing ground” for stripping back abortion rights around the world, Amnesty International has warned. China sent 277,398 students in the 2023-24 academic year, and international students are one of the largest sources of revenue for US colleges. “For the first time in my life, a notional concept of global Black solidarity became concrete,” writes Nesrine Malik. “The biggest lesson is that we don't get to choose how revolutions unfold” but also that “BLM opened up the issue of racial justice in ways that can never again be closed”. André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, has said he believes countering this new type of denialism will be his biggest job as director of this year's UN climate summit. Hitting a strong updraft during a test of his new equipment, Peng Yujiang was sent soaring from 3,000 meters to above 8,000 meters, nearly the height of Mount Everest. He managed to survive despite losing consciousness and enduring temperatures of -31F (-35C), eventually landing 30km from the launch site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Students cheer during Harvard University's commencement ceremonies, in Cambridge, Mass., on May 29.Charles Krupa/The Associated Press Harvard's battles with Trump over funding and restrictions on teaching and admissions presented another challenge for the thousands of graduates who had already endured their share since arriving on campus four years ago. Other schools face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don't agree to the Trump administration's shifting demands. The government already cancelled more than $2.6-billion in federal research grants, moved to cut off Harvard's enrolment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status. Visa interviews for international students admitted to schools nationwide were halted on Tuesday, and Trump said Wednesday that Harvard should reduce its international enrolment from 25 per cent to about 15 per cent. Sustained by a $53-billion endowment, the nation's wealthiest university is testing whether it can be a bulwark against Trump's efforts to limit what his administration calls antisemitic activism on campus, which Harvard sees as an affront to the freedom to teach and learn nationwide. The Trump administration has demanded that Harvard make broad leadership changes, revise its admissions policies and audit its faculty and student body to ensure the campus is home to many viewpoints. But he did get a rousing applause when he referenced the university's global reach, noting that it is “just as it should be.” Students walk to attend the 374th commencement exercises at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass., on May 29.Brian Snyder/Reuters Speaking in Latin, salutatorian Aidan Robert Scully delivered a speech laced with references to Trump policies. Neither powers nor princes can change the truth and deny that diversity is our strength,” Scully said. “We're starting to believe those who think differently, vote differently or pray differently, whether they are across the ocean or sitting right next to us, are not just wrong – we mistakenly see them as evil,“ she said. “But it doesn't have to be this way.” Dr. Abraham Verghese, a bestselling author and Stanford University expert on infectious diseases, opened his keynote address by saying he felt like a medieval messenger “slipping into a besieged community,” with more attention focused on the university than perhaps anytime during its history. “After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,” he continued. “We should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies – we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them,” said Garber, who commissioned internal reports last year on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the school. The Trump administration has said it wants “to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.” It cites campus protests against Israel. Like many college students around the country, Harvard students set up tents called on the university to divest from companies supporting Israel's military, which has levelled Gaza in response to attacks by Hamas. Harvard also said some protesters would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates, although it eventually allowed most to get them. This year, the anti-war demonstrations have largely faded from view, but protesters held a silent vigil a few hours before Thursday's ceremony. Holding signs that read “Ceasefire Now” and “Not Another Bomb,” protesters stood silently along the walls of Harvard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain was the first country to reach a deal with the U.S. after it imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of its trading partners.Kevin Coombs/Reuters The British government is trying to understand how its recently signed trade deal with the U.S. will be affected by a court ruling blocking most of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Britain was the first country to reach a deal with Mr. Trump after he announced sweeping tariffs in April on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Canada. The U.K.-U.S. agreement, although limited, was hailed as a model for other countries hoping to win similar relief from Mr. Trump. The U.K. and U.S. also moved to improve market access for beef imports. Prior to April, U.S. duties on British imports were around 3 per cent. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs from going into effect, ruling that the President overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from countries that sell more to the U.S. than they buy. British officials were hoping to speed up implementation of the recently signed trade deal during talks next week between trade officials. The statement added: “We were the first to secure a deal with the U.S. in a move to protect jobs across key sectors, from autos to steel, and we are working to ensure that businesses can benefit from the deal as quickly as possible.” The London Stock Exchange's FTSE 100 stock index opened slightly higher on Thursday but most of the gains were erased by noon British time. “That the gains were measured rather than blockbuster reflects a healthy level of skepticism over whether this can truly rein in the Trump administration, which has already launched an appeal against the judgment,” said Russ Mould, investment director of Manchester-based A.J. The court ruling “clearly adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to what Trump is doing when businesses don't know what tariffs their product would face in the U.S. That can't be good for the economy,” said David Henig, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy a Belgium-based think tank. Those import taxes have been delayed until July, but Wednesday's ruling will complicate negotiations. EU trade negotiator Maros Sefcovic is expected to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Paris next week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. The decision came after the Executive Committee of the International Judo Federation (IJF) confirmed, following an appeal from Kyiv, that Belarusian athletes are allowed to take part in all international competitions under national symbols from June 1, 2025. Since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale war, Ukraine has repeatedly called for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in international competitions, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. Ultimately, these athletes were allowed to compete only as "individual neutral athletes" in individual disciplines without using any national symbols related to their countries. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian committee, the federation said in its response that "the IJF is committed to ensuring that sport serves as a platform for dialogue, unity, and understanding — building bridges, not walls." "We firmly believe that allowing athletes from aggressor countries to compete under national symbols is not only a case of political blindness but also a blatant disregard for the victims of war and international law," the statement read. As of March, 591 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russia in the war, with 22 held captive and 11 missing, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dead animals appear on shores and locals fall unwell as gallons of raw sewage flows across border At California's Imperial Beach there's a reason why nobody, beyond a determined bunch of early-morning surfers, ventures into the sea. Its beaches have been forced to close, its air is being contaminated by pollutants hundreds of times above levels deemed safe, and locals are falling violently unwell. Rising up on a hillside to the south, beyond the border wall, is the Mexican city of Tijuana, which even at a distance of a few miles seems to dwarf Imperial Beach. Tijuana is one of Mexico's fastest-growing cities, exploding in size since the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) came into force in the mid-1990s. But its development was too fast for the antiquated and neglected sewage systems on either side of a border, which were overwhelmed by the demands of a population that now numbers more than 2.3 million and is climbing ever higher. Instead, up to 80 million gallons of its waste is flooding into the Pacific Ocean and the cross-border Tijuana River every day. But these days it is kept flowing by a cocktail of raw sewage and industrial chemicals, bearing viruses, bacteria and parasites into the US. Imperial Beach is bearing the brunt of it, and has become what some locals refer to as “Mexico's toilet”. Dr Csanadi and his wife, Marvel Harrison, thought they had staked out their own share of paradise when they bought an undeveloped plot on the beachfront 10 years ago. Over time, it became a family home for them and their children – along with a pet chicken roaming outdoors called Daphne – and at the back of their minds, they thought they would be there for the rest of their lives. In the years since moving in, Dr Harrison, a psychologist, has developed a condition similar to asthma that has left her with a chronic cough and means she has to use an inhaler. There are some days when she can't walk on the beach because of the strain it puts on her lungs. As for Dr Csanadi, he has developed an E coli infection that is resistant to antibiotics and regularly comes down with sinus issues. Accounts of chronic illness are common throughout Imperial Beach, where residents report cases of migraines, respiratory conditions, stomach problems, fatigue, skin infections and nausea. Authorities say hundreds of Navy Seals, training at the base a short distance up the coast, have developed gastrointestinal issues from contact with contaminated ocean water. A group of bottlenose dolphins found on a beach one summer were killed by sepsis caused by bacteria transmitted via urine or faeces, researchers at State Diego State University found. Warning signs instructing swimmers to stay away are planted in the sand every 20 feet or so. Every night, somewhere between midnight and 2am, the city is enveloped by a strong smell. It can happen during the day as well, albeit less commonly, leaving locals prisoners in their own homes. Nobody can quite agree what the odour is: some compare it to rotten eggs, while others say it has a bitter chemical tang. To TJ Jackson, who lives along the beachfront, it simply “smells like Tijuana”. Typically, hydrogen sulphide levels are below one part per billion (ppb), and California has set a safe limit for children and pregnant women at 7.3ppb. But Mr Rico shared research with The Telegraph showing hydrogen sulphide levels taken from one neighbourhood in Imperial Beach reached up to 4,500ppb. At one pollution hotspot on Saturn Boulevard identified by Mr Rico, the sulphur smell is overpowering. Water pours out of a concrete pipe into an estuary, churning untreated sewage, chemicals and metals. The area was deserted, with the exception of a young boy who cycled past with a T-shirt clamped over his mouth and nose. “And it borderlines on gross negligence that he is actively refusing to help us, despite the overwhelming evidence pointing to the fact that we are really being harmed here. She said the California governor had been a “strong advocate” for Imperial Beach, and last year “secured critical funding and support to address cross-border pollution from the Tijuana River while holding authorities accountable to expedited timelines”. So far, locals are quietly optimistic about Lee Zeldin, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who visited Imperial Beach in April and declared the sewage crisis was “top of mind” for Mr Trump. Mr Trump's administration submitted its plan to Mexico earlier this month, and the two governments are in the midst of thrashing out a deal that is expected to be concluded within weeks to upgrade sewage treatment facilities. “We're literally going line by line on past agreements, and pressure testing everything to see what can be completed faster,” a US government source said. To date, Mexico is said not to have rejected any of Washington's proposals, and negotiations have been spurred along by both Mr Trump and Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, who are “committed to solving this problem”. But the move comes too late for some Imperial Beach residents who have packed up and moved away, worn down by what they feel is years' worth of neglect from the government. Among their number is Serge Dedina, Ms Aguirre's predecessor as mayor, who suffered sinus, ear and stomach infections and whose son required urgent care when he fell violently ill after swimming in the sewage-infested waters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The process of militarizing Europe has begun, but it will require significant financial investment, tough political decisions, and some compromises, according to Prokhor Tebin, director of the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute for World Military Economy and Strategy at the National Research University Higher School of Economics. In an interview with TASS, Tebin emphasized that modernizing Europe's defense-industrial complex and establishing a unified market for defense products will not be easy. "Such efforts will demand difficult and often controversial political choices," he noted, commenting on the EU Council's recent decision to create a 150-billion-euro fund - Security Action for Europe (SAFE) - aimed at enhancing the bloc's military capabilities. Tebin explained that the SAFE mechanism is intended to foster greater coordination in both demand and supply within the European arms market. However, he pointed out that European nations are actively protecting their domestic industries, striving to preserve jobs and technological advancements. Consequently, many European defense firms are compelled to source raw materials, components, and parts from abroad. For instance, Rheinmetall, a leading European ammunition producer, has formed a strategic partnership with India's Reliance Defense to boost its ammunition manufacturing capabilities. Tebin emphasized that overcoming these hurdles requires sustained financial investment and a consistent long-term policy approach. "Without these, the EU's defense industry will remain disjointed and overly reliant on exports, caught in fierce intra-European competition, and unable to fully meet the needs of member states," he warned. Moreover, he cautioned that military spending - whether funded through borrowing, tax hikes, or reductions in other public sectors - will largely continue to be driven by defense contractors from outside Europe, such as those in the United States and South Korea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the practice has also drawn criticism – mainly that it's confusing for hospitals, schools and authorities who don't know how to pronounce them. Now the government is cracking down on these so-called “kirakira” names, which means sparkly or shiny. New rules came into effect on Monday that will limit parents from giving their babies names pronounced in unconventional ways. The news was met with mixed reactions; some social media users argued that kirakira names are an expression of individualism, that they're fairly harmless and don't warrant government regulation. They're children of their parents,” one person wrote on X after the announcement. Many more, however, welcomed the change – lamenting that children with unusual names might face harassment, or at the very least complications in administrative tasks like registrations or banking. It just causes those kids to be bullied,” one X user wrote. Seeing a child's name reveals the intelligence of their parents, which is helpful.” In kirakira names, which became more popular from the 1980s onward, parents often choose a name based on the phonetic sound – wanting their child's name to sound like “Pikachu,” for instance – and pick similar-sounding Kanji characters. The problem is that those characters might not usually be pronounced that way – making it hard, or impossible, for a teacher or nurse to decipher how to properly say a child's name just by looking at its written Kanji form. Some have drawn parallels to how American parents have, increasingly in the past decade, chosen unusual spellings for common names – such as Ashleigh instead of Ashley, or Catelynn instead of Caitlin. The Japanese government's new rules aim to limit this by mandating that only widely accepted pronunciations of kanji characters will be allowed. This is not the first time strict naming rules have sparked debate in Japan. Normally, wives take their husband's name, since same-sex marriages aren't legal in Japan. First names have afforded more room for experimentation – at least, until the latest rules came in. More and more people have been given unusual names in the last 40 years, according to a 2022 study that analyzed baby names published in local newsletters over the last few decades. Related article Japanese people could all be called Sato by 2531, study warns. The trend suggests a shift toward seeking “uniqueness and independence” in Japan, the study said – also seen in changes to other parts of Japanese life during that time like family structures and societal values. Girls in particular saw an increase in kirakira names, it added – perhaps suggesting that parents had a stronger “hope for their daughters to become unique and independent than for their sons.” Japan isn't the only country that has seen an upward trend in unusual baby names. A 2016 study found that American parents picked more unusual names between 2004 and 2015, pointing to the culture's “increasing individualism.” Like in Japan, the study found that Chinese girls were more likely to have unusual names than boys – perhaps reflecting different “parental expectations.” In Germany, authorities may strike down a baby name if they find it offensive or potentially harmful to the child's best interests. Meanwhile New Zealand also maintains strict rules that include bans on references to titles, meaning names like “King” and “Prince” are routinely rejected.</p>
