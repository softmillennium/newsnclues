                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GameStop (GME) shares dropped nearly another 6% on Thursday as investors continued to sell the news of the company's disclosure of its initial bitcoin acquisitons. The company on Wednesday morning said it had acquired 4,710 bitcoin — a long-awaited move tied to its crypto treasury strategy revealed in March. At that time, the company initiated a $1.3 billion capital raise to help fund BTC purchases. The stock plunged shortly after alongside a steep drop in broader markets on the Trump Liberation Day tariff announcements. Shares, though, bottomed along with markets mid-month and rose more than 60% in the weeks leading up to the Wednesday announcement. The decline since — now nearing 20% — could be little more than investors selling the news after the big run higher or could be investor exhaustion with corporate bitcoin treasury strategies, which seemingly have been coming at the rate of one or more per day for several weeks. In addition, GameStop's acquisition of "just" roughly $500 million of bitcoin (the dates and prices of the buys weren't disclosed) could be a disappointment given the company's $1.3 billion capital raise, not to mention several billion dollars in free cash that was already on the balance sheet. With a market cap of $14 billion, the company's bitcoin purchase was relatively modest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A little over two years later, Cardano entered the fray with an “academic-first” approach that promised to fix what Ethereum was still figuring out. In 2025, these two platforms anchor many “Which crypto should I buy?” debates, yet they are built on markedly different blueprints. We'll explore histories, consensus mechanics, token economics, staking and real-world deployments, then explore the technical elements so investors can decide which network, if either, fits their portfolio. Ethereum's white paper was published in late 2013, and the network went live on July 30, 2015. Its founding mission was bold: to become a “world computer” that would let anyone deploy self-executing smart contracts without third-party involvement. Ethereum still dominates smart-contract activity, but the network's popularity may be its curse: base-layer transactions remain comparatively slow and expensive despite a constellation of Layer-2 rollups racing to ease the bottlenecks. A spring-2025 Pectra upgrade has lowered costs and raised the validator cap, yet daily fees still spike during on-chain frenzies. Cardano went live on September 29, 2017, spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and engineering firm IOHK (now Input Output Global). It brands itself as the first peer-reviewed blockchain: every protocol change is vetted through a typically very academic discussion before being implemented. Cardano's core pitch is a secure, scalable backbone for identity, supply-chain and financial applications, especially in emerging markets. Both networks secure themselves with proof-of-stake, but they implement it very differently. Understanding those mechanics is important as consensus shapes energy use, decentralization incentives and long-term economics. Ethereum's Beacon Chain coordinates ~1 million validators who each post 32 ETH (≈$82k at recent prices) as collateral. Validators win block-proposing rights roughly every twelve seconds; correct behaviour earns ETH, while downtime or malicious activity can trigger “slashing” penalties. Average yields hover around 3%-4% annualised, slightly higher if nodes capture maximal extractable value (MEV) via MEV-Boost. Cardano's Ouroboros is the first PoS algorithm with formal security proofs. Rewards adjust over time and currently sit around 1.7% – 2% on major exchanges, though independent pools sometimes top 4%. A rich toolbox including ERC-20 tokens, composable DeFi “money legos,” decentralized autonomous organisations and NFT standards has attracted developers despite high gas fees. Cardano followed later; the Alonzo hard fork (September 2021) introduced Plutus smart contracts written in Haskell-inspired PlutusCore and Marlowe, domain-specific languages for financial agreements. Uptake was slow, hampered by technology gaps, but 2024's Aiken compiler and Hydra scaling heads lowered entry barriers. This design improves determinism and enhances security, but it also limits real-time (synchronous) interactions between decentralized applications, a deliberate trade-off in the platform's architecture. In practice Ethereum still hosts the lion's share of DeFi liquidity, yet Cardano's ecosystem is growing, helped by recently launched stablecoins, on-chain order books like Minswap, and identity-driven dApps targeting African small and medium-sized enterprises. A treasury releases new ADA each epoch, tapering gradually until emissions cease circa 2060, after which on-chain transaction fees will pay for security and governance. The absolute cap mirrors Bitcoin and gives holders a clear dilution schedule. For retail investors, the hurdle of 32 ETH to run an Ethereum validator means most users join validation pools or liquid-staking tokens like stETH, which add smart-contract risk and, in some jurisdictions, securities-law ambiguity. Unstaking is now permissionless but subject to a queue; exits can take hours in calm periods or days when many validators leave simultaneously. Gas fees average $2-5 but spike into double digits when demand is high, such as during the recent meme-coin mania. Cardano, by contrast, lets holders delegate in a few clicks with no lock-ups and zero slashing. The trade-off is lower absolute yield and a younger DeFi stack, which means slower capital gains versus ETH may erode staking rewards. Ethereum has become the default settlement layer for stablecoins ($100 billion+ in circulation), derivatives, lending markets and high-profile NFT collections. Fortune 500 giants, from Visa to Starbucks, pilot loyalty, carbon and supply-chain tokens on Ethereum or its Layer-2 cohorts. Although these projects are smaller in monetary value, they align with Cardano's objective of banking the unbanked, and have the potential to expand if regulators in emerging markets adopt blockchain technology. If you want exposure to the broadest developer mind-share, second-largest crypto market cap and a bet on Layer-2 scaling economics, Ethereum fits. It is, however, more correlated with speculative buzz: fee spikes, regulatory headlines and Layer-2 token dilution can whipsaw returns. Cardano appeals to long-term investors comfortable with slower iteration and emerging-market narratives. Its capped supply and non-custodial staking with instant liquidity reduce some risk, but lower dApp activity means fewer fee burns to prop long-term security once the treasury depletes — an open-ended governance problem. That contrast shows in consensus mechanics, supply curves, fee dynamics and developer cultures. Investors needn't pick a single winner; diversification across ecosystems can hedge regulatory or technical shocks, but understanding how each chain pays validators, processes transactions and drives demand is important before allocating capital. As the crypto market continues to develop, watch whether Ethereum's Layer-2 thesis lowers barriers fast enough to fend off faster base-layers, and whether Cardano can convert academic credentials into mainstream traction beyond Africa. Both are smart-contract blockchains, but Ethereum prioritizes first-mover composability and remains fee-burn, open-ended supply. Cardano emphasizes peer-reviewed upgrades, a 45 billion-coin cap and the Ouroboros PoS algorithm. ETH requires 32 coins for solo validation or participation via pools; ADA can be delegated in any amount with no lock-up, though yields differ. Cardano focuses on identity, supply-chain tracking, and financial inclusion projects in emerging markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why this Bitcoin-Friendly Lawmaker Carries a US Debt Clock in His Pocket He believes that they are also competing against the federal government, which will be forced to print money to limit the impact of ballooning U.S. debt. In an interview with Decrypt, Ammon said that states should be closely tracking the amount of money that the federal government has borrowed to keep Washington humming. On Thursday, that sum totalled roughly $37 trillion, according to the U.S. Debt Clock. Texas could also be on the precipice of establishing its own strategic Bitcoin reserve, yet several states have rejected Bitcoin-related bills since the White House began moving in that direction. Ammon is among lawmakers that increasingly view the U.S. debt levels as unsustainable. Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott recently opposed U.S. President Donalds Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill this week, namely because it does not do enough to reign in massive deficits. Ammon proposed his Bitcoin bill as a way to shield the Granite State from a constant decline in the dollar's purchasing power. Fiscal policy is largely a national issue, but Ammon has seen the impact of poor management firsthand, down to the county level. That doesn't mean New Hampshire is going all in on Bitcoin with its pension plans and trusts. Ammon's bill empowers the state's treasurer, charged with overseeing revenue and finances, to allocate a small percentage of resources to Bitcoin that's constantly rebalanced. Taking on too much risk could affect the state's overall credit rating, he added. “You want to have a little bit of risk, but not so much.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some crypto insiders have mixed feelings about the White House and Treasury embracing digital cash invented to escape government oversight. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March that boosted the spirits of cryptocurrency investors — and created a digital money mystery. Trump directed the treasury secretary to create two national stockpiles of crypto assets, putting digital currencies alongside gold, foreign currencies and other assets in the U.S. reserve. The assets are to include crypto seized by federal agencies in criminal or civil proceedings. But the government has not disclosed how much bitcoin, or which other crypto coins, it holds. New data on what crypto cash the U.S. government has seized may now provide some answers. It suggests the crypto reserves will together hold more than $21 billion in cryptocurrency. It also provided a way to estimate what exactly might go into the two pools before results are released from an official accounting of U.S. crypto holdings that is underway. Because government seizures are disclosed in court documents, news releases and other sources, crypto-tracking firms can use those notices to monitor which digital assets the U.S. government holds. The company estimated how much bitcoin it holds, and the other crypto tokens in its top 20 digital holdings as of May 13, by tracking transactions involving those wallets. The United States' top 20 crypto holdings according to Chainalysis are worth about $20.9 billion as of 3 p.m. Eastern on May 28, with $20.4 billion in bitcoin and about $493 million in other digital assets. It has been scooped up from crimes such as stolen funds, scams and sales on dark net markets. Their value is nearly double the Fed's listing for U.S. gold holdings, although that figure uses outdated pricing and would be over $850 billion at current prices. Before Trump's order established the crypto reserves, the U.S. government had not had a cohesive plan for handling its digital assets, said Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research lead at Chainalysis. It had regularly off-loaded pieces of its digital holdings through asset sales and restitution to crime victims, he said, apparently in part because crypto wasn't an asset it was considered strategic. They include derivatives of bitcoin and ethereum that mirror those cryptocurrencies' prices, several stable coins designed to be pegged in value to the U.S. dollar, and 10 tokens tied to specific companies, including the cryptocurrency exchanges FTX, which imploded in 2022 after defrauding customers, and Binance. Trump's order said creating the reserves would centralize disparate government crypto caches and that “there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.” Economists have warned that national reserves of cryptocurrency are likely to benefit only existing investors in the coins selected for inclusion, who could reap profits if the U.S. government's endorsement causes prices to increase. Lawsuits and investigations into crypto firms by federal regulators have melted away since his return to office. Last week, the president dined with top investors of a meme coin named after him that generates profits for Trump and his family. Nazarov was not aware his company's own crypto token, LINK, appears to have a good shot at landing in the Digital Asset Stockpile until The Washington Post informed him. “The original spirit” of crypto, Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of ethereum, said in a March interview with The Washington Post, “is about counterbalancing power,” including government and corporate power. But the movement becoming too closely associated to “one particular government team or even a particular corporate team,” he said, could violate crypto's original mission of decentralization and openness. Austin Campbell, a professor at New York University's business school and a principal at crypto advisory firm Zero Knowledge, sees hypocrisy in crypto enthusiasts cheering the government's strategic reserves. The bitcoin community in particular “has historically been about freedom from sovereign interference,” he said. Campbell argues the U.S. government could put seized crypto coins — and its gold — to better use, by filling in some of the national debt or reducing spending. New Hampshire and Arizona's governors this month signed bills paving the way for state crypto reserves. Other states — including Florida, Oklahoma and Wyoming — have rejected or postponed similar bills. One common concern has been that cryptocurrencies are more volatile than many conventional financial assets. A 2024 Pew Research Center report found that 17 percent of Americans have invested in, traded or used crypto. Some younger investors even consider highly speculative meme coins to be their generation's best shot at the American Dream. Owning crypto depends on a private cryptographic key a few dozen characters long — making it easy to transfer funds but also to lose them or get scammed. “The government has built better and better processes of managing crypto assets over time, but there have still been some mistakes,” Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview this month. The Department of Justice announced in July 2024 that it had awarded a five-year contract to Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, to provide crypto custody and trading services for its cryptocurrency assets. Levin predicts there will now be “a greater level of sophistication” applied to managing and securing the government's reserves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC price is declining slightly on Thursday, trading above $107,100 at the time of writing. While Bitcoin traders were unimpressed by the recent market updates, Ethereum (ETH) price climbed to its highest level since February 2025 before retreating. Experts believe there is a structural rotation in the current market cycle and Ethereum could rally higher. Traders are watching the psychologically important $3,000 target for ETH. Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas brought together BTC believers, holders, maximalists and some of the biggest names supporting BTC, including US Vice President JD Vance and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Bitcoin traders were visibly unimpressed with the bullish statements and assurances, as headlines have been recycled several times since January 2025 with little action to show for it. While BTC trades less than 5% away from its all-time high at $111,980, technical indicators on the daily timeframe flash mixed signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line, implying an underlying bearish momentum in Bitcoin price trend. Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 62 and is sloping upward, supporting a likelihood of gains in Bitcoin price. “The SBET Ethereum Treasury announcement is a key catalyst. The ETH/BTC reversal signals a shift in dominance—early-stage moves that often precede broader altcoin outperformance. The fact that this strength is happening alongside, not after, BTC price acceleration makes it especially bullish: capital isn't exiting Bitcoin, it's compounding across L1s. This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins.” Derivatives data from Coinglass shows the long/short ratio on derivatives exchanges like Binance and OKX exceeds 1, meaning more traders are taking long positions than short. Derivatives traders are betting on an increase in the Ethereum price. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet: “Whales have accumulated 1.4 million ETH since April, reducing exchange supply and applying upward pressure. Ethereum could target $3,000–$3,400 in the near term after its break above $2,700. The momentum will depend on volume trends, macro conditions, and continued institutional support.​​” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Bitcoin price increases slightly to trade above $108,000 on Thursday after dipping over the last two days. Bitcoin price stabilizes around $111,000 on Friday after reaching a new all-time high of $111,900 this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michigan has become the latest U.S. state to push digital asset regulations, with four new bills landing in the State Senate to promote BTC mining and ban the looming digital dollar. However, it limits investment to assets that have averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the past calendar year. The bill also outlines that the state can only hold digital assets as exchange-traded products issued by registered companies. This stipulation comes at a time when spot ETFs have exploded in the U.S. and now hold over $50 billion in assets. Michigan joins dozens of states racing to implement digital asset reserves in response to a similar push at the federal level by President Donald Trump. In February, two State Senators introduced a bill allowing the Michigan state government to establish a BTC reserve. The earliest opposition came from Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis led anti-CBDC campaigns years before Trump's election. The block reward mining bills come amid a rise in anti-mining campaigns across the U.S. and beyond by local communities. In dozens of ongoing lawsuits, these communities have accused miners of noise pollution, which they say is pushing them away from their homes. Russia pushes miners to the north amid power shortages Meanwhile, in Russia, the Ministry of Energy plans to push BTC miners to the northern regions as it navigates power shortages in the more densely populated eastern and southern regions. Russia's north is the least populated region, with harsh weather—especially its severe winters—mostly to blame. “[The north] is where we can think about something with miners, put them there and consider the possibility of a network tariff. But this is not a benefit as such, but a different principle of tariff formation,” the minister stated. Repurposing unused or excess electricity to mine digital assets is becoming common globally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kazakhstan plans to launch “CryptoCity,” a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services, the country's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said. according to a May 29 announcement on the official website of President . Speaking at the Astana International Forum 2025, Tokayev said the pilot zone will be used to explore cryptocurrency adoption within a regulated sandbox environment. “We are planning to create a pioneering pilot zone called CryptoCity where cryptocurrencies might be used for purchasing goods, services, and even beyond,” he said  in his remarks, a transcript of which was published on the president's official website. Kanysh Tuleushin, the country's first vice minister of digital development, this month said Kazakhstan has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia if regulatory restrictions are eased. In 2024, Kazakhstan launched a pilot project with its central bank digital currency, which reportedly reduced value-added tax refund wait times. A May 29 report by local news outlet Tengri News cited Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development Zhaslan Madiyev saying “the government and regulators are currently working together to determine the most suitable location.” One city is already under serious consideration. Alatau is a settlement relatively close to the south-eastern border of Kazakhstan. Madiyev shed light on how ubiquitous crypto would be in the area: Madiyev expressed his hope that the project would attract developers, programmers and IT specialists to Kazakhstan, thereby boosting local economic growth. While noting that the focus is on working on the regulatory framework, “the city itself is already under development,” he said, noting that “CryptoCity implies free circulation of cryptocurrency, crypto-friendly legislation and crypto as a legitimate means of payment.” “These conditions need to be reflected in the law,“ he added.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently convened a public roundtable, Tokenization – Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet, the fourth in a five-part series hosted by its Crypto Task Force. The May 12 roundtable included representatives from traditional financial institutions, exchanges, asset managers, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and legal and policy experts to examine the current state of asset tokenization and identify potential regulatory, technological, and operational implications of transitioning traditional financial assets onto blockchain-based platforms. The roundtables reflect the Staff's continued interest in understanding how crypto asset technologies interact with existing securities laws and signal growing momentum toward formal rulemaking and interpretive guidance in this area. The panelists broadly agreed that tokenization has the potential to transform capital markets while also underscoring the need for regulatory clarity, technical standards, and appropriate safeguards to ensure market integrity and investor protection. At its core, tokenization refers to placing real-world financial instruments (such as equities, bonds, or fund interests) onto a blockchain, enabling programmable ownership and related transaction features. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins gave the keynote address, highlighting the energy behind moving from traditional “off-chain” databases to blockchain-based “on-chain” ledger systems. Chairman Atkins stated that migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market, enabling new ways of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities, such as using smart contracts for transparent dividend distribution or enhancing capital formation by transforming illiquid assets into liquid investment opportunities. He noted this technology holds promise for novel use cases not currently contemplated by the SEC's legacy rules. Chairman Atkins stated his objective is to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that consists of clear rules for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to deter illegal activity. He outlined the SEC's goals and the challenges it faces with respect to three areas of focus for crypto asset policy: The SEC intends to establish clear and sensible guidelines for distributions of crypto assets that qualify as securities or are subject to an investment contract. Chairman Atkins criticized past approaches, described as “head in the sand” and “regulation through enforcement,” which did not adapt disclosure requirements for this new technology. The SEC is now pursuing a new course, with Staff recently issuing statements on disclosure obligations and clarifying that certain distributions and assets do not implicate federal securities laws. The Staff is considering whether additional guidance, exemptions, and safe harbors are needed to create pathways for crypto asset issuances in the United States. The SEC supports providing registrants with greater optionality in determining how to custody crypto assets. The recent rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 is viewed as removing a significant impediment to the custody of crypto assets, however, further clarity is needed on which types of custodians qualify as “qualified custodians” and on reasonable exceptions for common crypto practices. The “special purpose broker-dealer” framework may need to be repealed and replaced with a more rational regime, and clarity is needed on applying customer protection and net capital rules to crypto custody by broker-dealers. This could include enabling “super apps” or “pairs trading” between securities and non-securities. Staff have been asked to explore modernizing the Alternative Trading System regulatory regime and whether guidance or rulemaking is needed for listing and trading crypto assets on national securities exchanges. In addition to outlining the three areas of focus for the SEC's regulation of crypto assets going forward, Chairman Atkins proposed exploring whether conditional exemptive relief would be appropriate for registrants and nonregistrants bringing new products and services to market that may not currently be compatible with existing rules. She expressed significant doubts about the ability of tokenization to speed up settlement due to issues with scaling, and also suggested that the delay created by the current T+1 settlement cycle is a feature and not a bug, providing for more stable markets in times of stress. She explained that the current system facilitates netting, which drastically reduces the volume requiring final settlement, which is key to handling high trading volumes, market stability, and facilitating liquidity. She called for extreme regulatory caution and reiterated the importance of protecting traditional markets, noting that it is estimated that less than 5% of US households are involved in crypto and therefore any changes to financial market regulations must not be detrimental to the TradFi markets that most Americans depend on. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda noted that the new technologies related to tokenization could benefit investors by enhancing liquidity for otherwise relatively illiquid assets, reducing delays associated with intermediation, and decreasing transactional costs. Tokenization also has the potential to simplify or streamline certain compliance functions through smart contracts for on-chain assets. These potential improvements are tied to key characteristics of blockchain technology such as its transparent ledger and decentralized nature. Commissioner Uyeda stated that when considering the implications of new technologies the Commission should focus on designing a framework that includes critical safeguards rather than trying to address every possible investment permutation and scenario. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce listed the potential benefits that tokenization may have on securities markets, including increased operational efficiency, transactional transparency, liquidity, and accessibility; faster settlement (potentially near-instant and simultaneous on the same network); and greater investor opportunity. Tokenized securities can be used as collateral and a means of settlement for other crypto assets on-chain. She noted several issues that create uncertainty, including whether a crypto network can serve as the master securityholder file for Exchange Act transfer agent rules, confusion regarding a broker-dealer's ability to custody tokenized traditional securities due to the special purpose broker-dealer statement, and a proposed Advisers Act custody rule amendment that could preclude tokenized traditional securities on public, permissionless networks from an exception to the qualified custodian requirement. She concluded that, absent a compelling factual and legal reason, the SEC should treat tokenized securities the same as traditionally issued securities. Tokenization was generally described as a way to de-risk markets by shortening settlement cycles and present a pathway toward 24/7 global capital markets. They emphasized the need for a clear crypto asset taxonomy and, accordingly, to adjust rules and regulations to fit the evolving financial landscape. They discussed how tokenization could ease congestion within the traditional market system and improve collateral management. Regulatory Framework: The panelists advised the SEC to consider a regulatory framework that supports innovation while remaining focused on investor protection. They suggested using exemptive and no-action relief to address market-driven issues and emphasized the importance of a common regulatory framework to facilitate capital formation. Regulatory Innovation Programs: The panel again discussed the use of regulatory sandboxes to test new technologies and better inform legislation, and emphasized the need for a practical sandbox environment that focuses on how test runs can directly inform regulatory rules. The panel concluded with a call for the traditional financial industry to embrace new technologies and for the SEC to adopt regulatory frameworks that support innovation while maintaining investor trust and market acceptance. The panelists identified several key benefits that tokenization could bring to capital markets, centered around operational efficiency, broader market access, and structural innovation: While the technological promise of tokenization was widely acknowledged, the panelists also highlighted several regulatory and legal uncertainties that need to be addressed to foster broader adoption: Some panelists suggested convening a meeting of experts from various fields to collaborate and address these challenges, while others advocated for the SEC to establish its own set of guiding principles. These challenges underscore the need for a flexible and thoughtful approach to regulation that balances innovation with market integrity. As tokenization continues to evolve, market participants should monitor regulator developments and assess the implications for their operations and compliance obligations.

OKX chief commercial officer Lennix Lai says the exchange is focused on building compliant services in the US and Singapore, among other markets

“The entire fintech sector, plus the traditional finance sector, plus the asset management side, including the government, are starting to have some kind of footprint in crypto,” Lai said. “We see a whole different set of industry players starting to build something related to crypto.”

The report, titled “The Future of Blockchain Applications: Reshaping Global Industries”, was released on Thursday. It aims to project how blockchain adoption will evolve over the next 25 years, but also anticipates explosive growth in the next few years in an ecosystem now worth US$2.6 trillion.

For now, finance remains the most practical use case. OKX has sought to expand in traditional finance through partnerships, most notably with Standard Chartered, allowing clients to use cryptocurrencies and tokenised money-market funds as collateral.

The report predicts that eventually “the distinction between ‘crypto banks' or ‘neo banks' versus traditional banks will largely disappear”. But OKX has no plans to encroach on traditional banks' territory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Tron price prediction is heating up as TRX shows signs of renewed momentum. If adoption continues to grow at this pace, TRX may finally break past its long-standing resistance and reach new highs in the coming months. USDT's supply topped $150 billion, and the altcoin now holds nearly half of that at 48.57%, overtaking Ethereum. Analysts view this gradual increase as a sign of growing trust in the network. One of the key factors for Tron's rapid rise is its new partnership with Rumble Cloud. This alliance strengthens the network by moving it away from traditional cloud services and onto a more sovereign, decentralized setup. By using Rumble's cloud tech, Tron adds another layer of resilience to its infrastructure. Tether also recently minted $2 billion worth of USDT on Tron, reinforcing its role in stablecoin transactions. If adoption keeps rising, Tron has a real shot at hitting $1.50 sooner than expected. Fresh figures from Token Terminal show Tron is now handling over $611 billion in monthly USDT transactions and more than 65 million transfers. These numbers point to a platform that's growing fast in the stablecoin market. Meanwhile, Ethereum's hold is slipping after its brief USDT surge, making room for Tron's steady advance. Practical factors, including low fees, high transaction speeds, and a growing user base, are fueling Tron's rise. If growth keeps tracking this way, TRX may head higher than many expect. Whether it's paying bills or sending money abroad, the platform supports over 100 cryptos and more than 30 fiat currencies. An audited wallet system secures the RTX token and offers staking rewards ranging from 4% to 8% annually. That setup appeals to users looking for both utility and long-term value. Remittix stands out by doing what most projects promise but rarely deliver bridging digital assets with everyday financial needs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These projects draw serious attention, whether through real-world asset tokenization, privacy protection, lightning-fast DeFi infrastructure, or scalable Ethereum alternatives. But only one is making waves for offering the kind of asymmetric upside that can redefine a portfolio in weeks, not years. If there's one project capturing the imagination of early investors right now, it's Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas is positioning itself to dominate one of the largest untapped crypto markets: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Tokenizing real-world assets like property, commodities, and art, Rexas enables fractional ownership for sectors once dominated by the super-rich.. This model removes traditional barriers like high capital requirements and illiquidity, making blue-chip assets accessible to anyone. The numbers speak volumes: the RWA sector is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, and Rexas is positioning itself as a major on-ramp to that market. Its growing ecosystem includes tools like the Rexas Token Builder, AI-powered smart contract auditing, and a Launchpad designed to bring tokenized assets to market quickly and securely. For investors looking for a project with real utility, explosive growth potential, and a product already in motion, Rexas Finance stands out as the rare opportunity where both vision and execution are aligned. If demand holds post-launch, analysts believe RXS could climb into double-digit territory, offering the kind of returns early Solana or Avalanche investors enjoyed just a few years ago. While newer projects chase hype and headlines, Monero (XMR) continues to do what it does best: offer ironclad privacy in a digital world trending toward surveillance. With governments increasingly scrutinizing blockchain transactions and centralized exchanges clamping down on withdrawals, Monero's use case has never been more relevant. More than just a “dark web” currency, Monero offers legitimate, secure, and censorship-resistant transactions. It's trusted by privacy advocates, developers, and users who demand true financial sovereignty. Despite lacking flashy marketing campaigns, Monero's consistent demand and loyal community keep it on savvy investors' radar, especially during geopolitical tension or regulatory uncertainty. Designed from the ground up for high-speed decentralized finance, SEI is building a layer-one blockchain where sub-second finality isn't a bonus, it's the baseline. Explicitly optimized for orderbook-based trading and complex financial apps, SEI allows decentralized protocols to match the performance of centralized exchanges. As one of the most established Layer 2 ecosystems, Polygon is leveraging zkEVM technology, expanding enterprise partnerships, and staying tightly integrated with Ethereum development. Polygon's modular structure means developers can create purpose-built blockchains that remain interoperable with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. In May 2025, Polygon sees growing interest from institutional players exploring real-world applications, further validating its staying power as a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. While Monero, SEI, and Polygon each offer powerful value propositions, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands in a league of its own this May.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a reprimand to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) over “serious shortcomings” in its storage and handling of CCTV footage. It comes after the force was “unable to recover” two hours missing CCTV footage while a person was held in custody for 48 hours in February 2021. GMP's Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) later submitted an internal request to retain this information beyond the typical 90-day period. GMP states that, despite all attempts, it is unable to recover the missing two hours of footage. The ICO's investigation found two key failings in GMP's data protection practices: Sally Anne Poole, head of Investigations at the ICO, said: “CCTV footage, particularly of a person at their most vulnerable, can contain highly sensitive personal data and must be properly protected. It is vital that authorities like police forces have the strictest measures in place to protect personal data to maintain public trust. “It is clear in this case that GMP failed its obligation to keep the complainant's personal data safe and demonstrated serious shortcomings in how it handles CCTV footage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Bitcoin remains locked in a tight range around $107,000, consolidating just below resistance. Though momentum feels slow, BTC continues to close above the daily TBO Cloud. Traders eager for an immediate breakout must remember past patterns—patience is often rewarded in extended bullish setups. The weekly RSI is pushing toward 70, an important threshold that would confirm long-term bullish momentum. On a broader timeframe, ETH/BTC remains below the weekly TBO Cloud, keeping it technically in “strong bearish” territory. BTC.D has fallen back into the daily TBO Cloud, signaling a return to bearish consolidation. A second TBO Close Short on the 4-hour chart for OTHERS.D, printed above support, supports a short-term bullish thesis for ALTs—assuming BTC doesn't suddenly steal back market attention. This breakout is significant given its prolonged bearish structure and reinforces Ethereum's leadership role in the current altcoin cycle. The development could mark a longer period of ETH-driven altcoin strength if BTC remains steady. The weekly view is even more encouraging, with price far above the TBO Cloud, RSI above 70, OBV trending higher, and weekly volume approaching its moving average line. While the weekly chart lacks confirmation with a sub-60 RSI and a fight to stay above the weekly TBO Cloud, increasing volume and rising OBV are notable bullish developments. Traders should watch for continued momentum, especially if BTC stays steady. BVOL7D has dropped back into its Bounce Zone, typically signaling reduced volatility. This is generally a good sign for altcoins, which tend to flourish in periods of relative BTC calm. XRP and SOL continue to show weakness on their daily charts, while TON saw a notable pump following a partnership announcement between Telegram and xAI. XMR suffered a -13% drop, likely due to market manipulation, but remains within range. Even with resistance stalling major moves in BTC, the broader crypto market remains strong. SPX6900 has hit a local high and is moving toward historical resistance, another signal of bullish strength.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP's on-chain profitability suggests investor confidence despite recent price dip and SEC case developments. More than 90% of XRP's supply is currently profitable, even though the token's price has remained relatively flat for the past three months. Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals that most of XRP's circulating supply was acquired at lower price points than its current market value. However, XRP trails only Bitcoin, which leads with 98.4% of its circulating supply in the green. Analysts at Santiment explained that this profitability metric is often used to assess investor sentiment. According to them, a higher percentage of profitable wallets can lead to near-term sell pressure as holders take profits. But when most investors are at a loss, markets often show signs of fear or undervaluation, which can attract new buyers and long-term capital. Market analysts suggest developments beyond price charts could catalyze XRP's next growth phase. Ripple's drawn-out case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has essentially resolved, lifting a significant overhang from the token. However, progress on that front recently slowed because Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint motion due to procedural issues. For context, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has revealed plans to establish a $121 million XRP-backed treasury. In addition, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is experiencing rapid expansion within its ecosystem, as evidenced by its adoption by major institutions. At the same time, new stablecoin products have also launched on the network, expanding its utility across fintech and traditional financial institutions. Moreover, the institutional appetite for XRP-related trading products is rising. This is evidenced by the fact that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recently introduced XRP futures products, and the US SEC is currently considering multiple filings for a spot XRP ETF. Together, these developments suggest growing institutional confidence and a broader push toward XRP adoption, which could bolster its price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Korea may be the first battleground in a global struggle between central banks and private stablecoins for control of digital payments, as the Bank of Korea (BOK) governor makes unprecedented visits to major banks to promote CBDC, tokenized deposit alternatives over private stablecoin initiatives. The Korea Times reported that Governor Rhee Chang-yong personally visited the country's six largest banks to discuss wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) projects, in what it described as an “unprecedented move.” The intervention comes as Korea's largest banks announced plans to create a joint stablecoin just weeks after joining a central bank pilot project for tokenized deposits, setting up a potential race between public and private digital currency initiatives. This competition in Korea could serve as a template for similar challenges worldwide, as central banks race to maintain monetary control in an increasingly digital financial landscape. One is that stablecoins are fully backed, resulting in so-called “narrow banking”, which impedes the availability of credit available in the economy compared to fractional reserve banking. In some jurisdictions, despite stablecoins being used for payments, they are not always under the central bank's supervision, potentially impeding their ability to influence monetary policy. Finally, most tokenized deposit projects use permissioned blockchains, whereas stablecoins are on permissionless blockchains which have significant audiences and developer bases and are more open for creating applications. This financial incentive came as the banks – except for Hana Bank – had announced plans for their joint stablecoin just weeks after the Hangang pilot's commencement in April. The central bank is currently involved in two major CBDC-related projects, both involving wholesale CBDC for institutional use. The other is Project Hangang, a domestic project in which wCBDC supports tokenized deposits that consumers can use for blockchain-based payments, with trials involving the major banks plus 100,000 consumers. Stablecoins and deposit tokens were also discussed at the meeting. However, in a separate report by Korea's News1, the central bank appears to be making a strategic accommodation, with Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol saying it was considering allowing deposit tokens on public blockchains. “We are considering a direction in which it (deposit tokens) will coexist within the entire digital currency system in conjunction with stablecoins issued by the private sector,” said Mr Lee, while reiterating monetary sovereignty concerns about global stablecoins. Project Hangang already supports different types of tokenized deposits. There are those backed by bank deposits, with the wCBDC used for interbank settlement. But it also envisages an e-money style deposit token that is fully backed by wCBDC. For tokens used on third-party platforms such as for the settlement of securities transactions, it envisages using a variation of the e-money style tokens. Korea's experience represents more than a domestic policy debate. As other jurisdictions grapple with similar tensions between innovation and control, Korea's approach of combining direct engagement, financial incentives, and strategic accommodation could become a playbook for central banks worldwide seeking to maintain their role in an evolving digital payments landscape.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFTs, those authentic digital assets, no longer shine like they did in 2021. Despite recent peaks in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, enthusiasm has largely faded. Once celebrated by celebrities and collectors, their market is collapsing. Yet, the emergence of real-world assets tokenized (RWA) brings new hope, offering prospects for stabilization and revival for this crypto industry in full transformation. 2025 has not yet brought sufficient catalysts to revive NFT loans. On the rapidly growing GONDI platform, CryptoPunks and art NFTs attract attention. This trend marks a shift towards assets considered more stable and culturally relevant. In short, the crypto community seems to be moving away from speculative models toward a more reasoned approach. These NFTs linked to tangible assets, such as real estate or financial instruments, bring stability and trust. NFTs backed by real assets could unlock more stable and trustworthy collateral sources. These innovations allow overcoming the limits of purely digital NFTs, which are often too volatile. By integrating RWAs, the crypto world can create hybrid financial products offering security and liquidity. This evolution also opens the door for broader adoption by traditional investors. Protocols are beginning to explore these possibilities by developing smart infrastructures. For example, under-collateralized loans, credit scores, and artificial intelligence are being considered to enhance user experience. NFT loans allow holders of unique tokens to obtain liquidity without selling their assets. These loans can be peer-to-peer through NFT platforms or peer-to-protocol directly with smart contracts. Fractionalization of NFTs further enriches this market by making expensive assets accessible to a broader community. Combined with RWAs, this technology offers a new dimension to decentralized finance. This transformation shows the crypto industry is restructuring, seeking more solidity and maturity. NFTs backed by real-world assets (RWA) and NFT bonds open new investment horizons, according to Cointribune. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!
