Bitcoin just notched its worst first quarter in a decade, falling 11.7% as markets struggled to understand the new administration's economic agenda. 

The performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, according to NYDIG Research's data.

The drawdown invites a familiar question in crypto circles: is the cycle over? The last time bitcoin started the year this poorly was in 2015, during a prolonged slump following the 2013 peak and after the collapse of Mt. Gox, according to NYDIG. Back then, prices recovered modestly over the rest of the year before surging in 2016.

In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. In other years with negative Q1 returns—like 2014, 2018 and 2022—bitcoin ended the year down sharply, coinciding with the tail ends of previous bull cycles, the research note said. 

This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn't all bullish.

Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far, what will happen after Monday's opening bell is unclear.

Historically, a weak Q1 doesn't always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG's data shows. The asset has bounced back in half of the years when it started in the red. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds, which could test BTC's role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.”Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?

Franchise owners of restaurant brands Johnny Rockets, Fatburger, Round Table Pizza, Great American Cookies, and other FAT Brands entities can now pay franchisee royalty payments in Bitcoin. 

The publicly traded FAT Brands (Nasdaq: FAT), which boasts 18 different franchise concepts and more than 2,300 locations worldwide, said the move “underscores its commitment to financial and technological innovation.” 

“Over the years, Bitcoin has transformed into a mainstream asset and, as a company, we see great value in expanding our forms of payments for our franchisees,” said FAT Brands COO Thayer Wiederhorn in a statement. He said that international franchisees in particular, which operate over 20% of its restaurants, may especially benefit from the shift.

“We look forward to utilizing Bitcoin as an efficient tool for streamlining and simplifying the payment process,” Wiederhorn added.

Franchisees, or those that own one of FAT Brands' quick-service, casual dining locations, can pay franchise and development fees, as well as their royalty payments by sending Bitcoin to a “crypto wallet business account,” a FAT Brands representative told Decrypt. At that point, FAT Brands can decide whether or not it wishes to sell the Bitcoin for USD, or hold it. 

As for adding other payment options like Ethereum or Solana, it could “possibly” happen “in the future,” a representative for FAT Brands told Decrypt, “but we're starting with Bitcoin.”

What about paying for a Fatburger or milkshake from Johnny Rockets with Bitcoin? 

“Potentially, but not today,” they replied.

The overlap of cryptocurrency and restaurants has grown in recent years. In 2024, on-chain dining rewards platform Blackbird helped bring crypto payments to some of New York's most acclaimed restaurants. Plus, fast food chains McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut have all run collaborations in Web3.

Furthermore, there's a growing trend of publicly traded companies embracing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, popularized by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its outspoken chairman Michael Saylor. His firm now holds some $44 billion worth of Bitcoin, and the firm's model has inspired dozens of followers.

 “In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe told Cointelegraph 

Cryptocurrency markets could be on track for recovery as investor sentiment begins to stabilize following US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement — what some analysts are calling the peak of recent market uncertainty.

Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets. The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.

Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.

“In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. “Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it's out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.”

Van de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. “Tariffs are literally the only way to do that,” he said. “I wouldn't be surprised if they're reversed within the next six to 12 months.”

President Trump's plan imposes a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports from April 5 and a higher “reciprocal tariff” of up to 54% on select countries with larger trade deficits from April 9.

Still, the end of the uncertainty could bring renewed investment into crypto markets, leading to a recovery, Van de Poppe said:

He noted that the economic impact of the tariffs may ultimately lead the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and begin a new round of quantitative easing (QE), a monetary policy that involves the Fed buying bonds to inject liquidity into the economy.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, has predicted Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 if the Fed formally enters a QE cycle.

On the downside, the tariff-related uncertainty may continue pressuring risk asset appetite for weeks, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter.

“We can count on President Trump changing his mind a few times within the first couple of weeks,” Acheson told Cointelegraph. She added:

“For crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,” a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.

Meanwhile, crypto intelligence firm Nansen estimated a 70% probability that the market could bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.

A recent study by Atmos positioned the United States as a worldwide frontrunner among nations for digital asset support and integration. The nation's commitment to blockchain technology sets a precedent for tokenization/digital payment integration of the global financial sector with a progressive regulatory approach, according to a study by BoxBet. 

Indeed, many large US banks such as J.P. Morgan, Citibank and other large banks such as UBS, Société Générale, the Swiss Banking Association, Banque de France, UK Regulated Liability Network, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Barclays, Lloyds, DZ Bank, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Unicredit, SBI Holdings, Hitachi, SHIZUOKA BANK, TIS, NSD, Fujitsu, KDDI, MUFG Bank, Higo Bank, Kagoshima Bank, GMO Financial Holdings have launched digital asset services departments fueling the tokenization trend of the financial sector.

Adopting new digital technologies enables financial institutions to considerably reduce operating costs, enhance transparency, and offer innovative services. Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize, states:

“Tokenized deposits will be the largest unlock for liquidity movement within banks. While stablecoins were the first instance of mass product-market fit for the blockchain ecosystem, stablecoins are not capital efficient. Tokenizing deposits (which could be IOUs or earn interest) allows for more capital-efficient movement. We are already seeing that with SAB 121 being repealed, the desire for banks to hold tokenized assets is increasing. We think the default choice—the safest, most secure blockchain ecosystem to hold tokenized assets—is within the Ethereum economy.”

Tokenized deposits are a token representation of the traditional commercial deposits that have been converted into digital tokens on a blockchain network, where each token is backed by a retail or institutional deposit. It involves the conversion of traditional financial assets such as a certificate of deposit, or a savings account into a digital token that offers investors potential benefits like faster 24/7 round the clock transactions with smart contracts used to automate interest rates, increased liquidity, fractional ownership, transparency—eliminating any possibility of fraud or manipulation.

Instead of holding physical cash or keeping money in a bank account, investors can hold digital tokens representing their certificate of deposit or savings account amount on a secure and decentralized ledger by empowering them to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately leading to cost savings.

For example, a tokenized certificate of deposit is a digital representation of a traditional CD, which is a fixed-term cash investment with a guaranteed interest rate of return, adapted into a token that the investor can freely trade on various digital asset exchanges or platforms similar to other digital assets that are regulated under the same framework as traditional bank deposits, focusing on ensuring the underlying bank's stability and compliance with existing regulations. This gives investors more flexibility and liquidity than a certificate of deposit, which often has an early redemption penalty.

Last year, after running over a dozen proofs of concept, or PoC, with multiple global banks, technology companies, and intergovernmental organizations, UDPN  launched two digital asset management systems for commercial use, designed to reshape the landscape of digital payments and assets in the financial sector:

Operating a digital asset system involves complex lifecycle management. These new digital asset systems—tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system—easily integrate into core banking systems and can be installed in a bank or a stablecoin operator's on-premises or cloud environment to ensure compliance and security in a regulated environment. 

UDPN's solutions efficiently link to legacy systems via APIs, ensuring seamless interoperability with traditional banking infrastructures and other digital asset systems within regulated frameworks, granting institutions full data sovereignty and the flexibility to choose their underlying infrastructure and deploy digital assets and tokens on any public or private blockchain. Both solutions allow the optional ability to interoperate with other regulated digital currency systems through UDPN's infrastructure. This feature promotes seamless collaboration and integration within the digital asset ecosystem.

As Cosmos (ATOM) surges in price, the spotlight is also shining on its staking program and security issues that could pose risks to its future growth. Despite Cosmos (ATOM)'s recent 14% surge, Coldware (COLD) remains positioned as the more innovative option, especially as it continues to showcase its advanced Web3 capabilities. Let's explore how Cosmos (ATOM) is navigating its staking program while Coldware (COLD) shows promising potential with cutting-edge blockchain technology.



In contrast, Coldware (COLD) is leveraging Web3 technology to position itself as a leader in financial inclusion. The Coldware (COLD) platform's ability to offer both decentralized finance and traditional finance solutions gives it an edge over Cosmos (ATOM), whose focus remains on blockchain interoperability. By providing a seamless bridge between these two worlds, Coldware is attracting interest from whales and institutional investors who see its potential to reshape the future of finance.

Cosmos (ATOM) has made significant strides in its staking program, with numerous users locking up their assets in exchange for rewards. However, recent security concerns have brought the effectiveness and sustainability of this program into question. As Cosmos (ATOM) continues to face these challenges, it may struggle to maintain investor confidence in its staking platform. The upcoming months will be crucial for Cosmos (ATOM) as it attempts to address these concerns and reassert its dominance in the blockchain space.



While Cosmos (ATOM) has built a staking program that aims to enhance network security and incentivize long-term commitment, Coldware (COLD) takes a different approach by focusing on Web3 innovations and offering solutions that are more scalable and secure. Coldware's commitment to financial inclusion and accessibility is set to challenge Cosmos (ATOM)'s model, as it tackles not just staking but the entire financial ecosystem.

Despite the bullish trends surrounding Cosmos (ATOM), Coldware (COLD) is building a more sustainable ecosystem that aligns with the increasing demand for secure and scalable blockchain applications. With Coldware's advanced Web3 features, it is setting itself up as a dominant force in the crypto space, one that could easily overtake Cosmos (ATOM) as it continues to innovate and gain investor confidence.



The rise of Coldware (COLD), with its financial inclusion and Web3 focus, could pose a significant challenge to Cosmos (ATOM), which remains tied to a traditional staking and DeFi framework. If Coldware can maintain its momentum and continue to address the need for scalability and security, it is poised to outperform Cosmos (ATOM) in 2025. Investors and whales alike are closely watching Coldware as it accelerates its presale success and looks to dominate the market.



As Cosmos (ATOM) pushes forward with its staking program amidst security concerns, Coldware (COLD) is quietly positioning itself to take the lead in the blockchain space. Coldware's integration of Web3 technology and focus on financial inclusion presents a compelling alternative to the traditional blockchain models employed by Cosmos (ATOM). With growing support from whales and a mission that aligns with the future of decentralized finance, Coldware could soon eclipse Cosmos (ATOM) as the go-to blockchain platform in 2025

Dogecoin could set a new all-time high (ATH) record if it matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum. 

The ongoing bearish trend in the crypto market has negatively impacted DOGE's price action. Recall that DOGE ranked among the early gainers in the post-election relief rally, which saw its price rise to a high of $0.4835 on December 8. 

However, DOGE has lost these gains, as it currently sits around the level it traded at before the election. At the current price of $0.1693, DOGE is down 64.98% from its December 8 peak of $0.4835. 

DOGE is also down 2.86% in the past seven days, 19.3% in 30 days, and 57% in three months. Despite the massive dip, DOGE investors have remained confident about the asset's prospects. 

Consequently, some wonder what would happen if DOGE resumes its post-election rally and potentially matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP). 

Like DOGE, XRP and ETH have experienced massive declines, losing most of their post-election gains. Nonetheless, both coins still rank among the top three non-stablecoin crypto by market cap. 

While ETH sits in the second position with a market cap of $218.63 billion, XRP's valuation of $124.39 billion puts it in the third spot. However, DOGE is far in the ranking, currently ranked as the sixth non-stablecoin crypto in the market. It has a market cap of $25.17 billion. 

Therefore, Dogecoin must soar 394.19% from its current valuation of $25.17 billion to match XRP's market cap of $124.39 billion. Similarly, DOGE requires a greater surge of 768.61% to equal Ethereum's $218.63 billion market cap. 

As mentioned earlier, matching ETH or XRP's market cap requires DOGE to rise 768.61% or 394.19% from its current valuation. 

Notably, if DOGE rises 394.19% and matches XRP's market cap, its price would increase to $0.8366. This estimate assumes Dogecoin's circulating supply remains fairly stable at 148.72 billion tokens. In the same vein, DOGE's price would spike to $1.47 per token if it surges by 768.61% to equal ETH's market cap. 

Both prices–$0.8366 and $1.47–are 13.42% and 99.29% above Dogecoin's all-time high of $0.7376, respectively. Recall that DOGE hit its previous ATH on May 8, 2021. It has remained far from this level ever since. 

DOGE's current price of $0.1693 represents a decline of 77.04% from its previous ATH. However, hitting the $0.8366 or $1.47 targets would potentially mark new ATHs for DOGE. 

Several analysts have predicted Dogecoin's potential surge to the $0.8 and $1.4 price range. However, not everyone attached a timeline for when these predictions would materialize. 

Last month, popular TradingView analyst ‘Cobra Vanguard' identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Dogecoin's chart to predict a potential rally to the $0.8 price mark. In addition, popular chatbot service ChatGPT predicted that DOGE could soar to around $1.4 if it becomes the default payment method across Elon Musk's ecosystem. 

Meanwhile, Changelly set possible timelines for Dogecoin's potential surge to $0.8366 and $1.47, respectively. While the exchange expects DOGE to hit $0.8366 by June 2030, it projects that the $1.47 target would materialize the following year, specifically in August 2031. 

It remains to be seen whether these predictions will play out. Factors such as increased adoption, ETF approval, and celebrity influence could pave the way for a hefty rally to lofty targets like $0.8366 or $1.47.

Macro investor Luke Gromen says that the White House may have caused a massive change in the way that Bitcoin (BTC) trades.

In a new interview with Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, Gromen calls attention to the America First Investment Policy, a memo released by the Trump Administration in February that aims to make the US foreign investment policies more cautious and conscious of national security.

Gromen, the founder of the macroeconomic research firm Forest for the Trees (FFTT), says that the memo essentially directs China to “take your money and go home, we don't want it here anymore.”

With all of the foreign capital invested in US markets, Gromen says the Nasdaq index will likely suffer capital outflows while Bitcoin – as a neutral global asset essentially exempt from tariffs or political agendas – will shine, breaking the correlation between the two assets.

“That, I think will ultimately be a catalyst to the separation of Bitcoin and Nasdaq, and that, I think, is starting to drive Nasdaq down – it has a long way to go because multiples are high – and in the short run, traders control the flows… 

Bitcoin is levered Nasdaq, I get it; it's a high-beta Nasdaq, in the short run. If you back up to a five-year or ten-year chart, you can see very clearly these periods where Bitcoin has massively outperformed Nasdaq, but they still tend to go directionally similarly, when Bitcoin's up Nasdaq's up and vice versa…

The America First Investment Policy memo, I think, will start to break that correlation because I think right now in the short run, that correlation is holding, [but] at some point I think capital flow is going to see Bitcoin for what it is which is a neutral reserve asset linked to energy, uncontrollable by any govenment and I think it'll start siphoning some flows off from Nasdaq as America continues to say, ‘Listen, you want to invest in some factories here? Great, otherwise, get out.' 

And that's a lot of capital that's got to get out, and we're seeing gold benefit already. I think what we're seeing in gold is a precursor to what we'll see in Bitcoin.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $83,233.

The first quarter of 2025 was dominated by talks of the altcoin season, as is usually the case when the bull cycle is ending. In past cycles, capital tends to rotate from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies as investors look for maximum gain before the arrival of the bear market.

However, the story has been very different for the cryptocurrency market so far this year, with most large-cap assets failing to enjoy the same capital rotation seen in past cycles. The latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto market, outperforming all categories of altcoins.

In an April 5 post on the X platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost shared an interesting on-chain insight into the performance of all altcoin categories relative to the world's largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the altcoins are underperforming compared to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization growth.

In their post, Darkfost compared the market cap growth of Bitcoin, large-cap altcoins (the top 20 largest altcoins), and mid-to-small cap altcoins by calculating the difference between their 365-day and the 30-day moving average (MAs). According to the analyst, the variation between the 365-day MA and the 30-day MA serves as an indicator of growth momentum.

Typically, when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), it implies rapid market cap growth. On the flip side, a reduced growth momentum is indicated by a lagging 30-day moving average.



As observed in the chart above, Bitcoin is outpacing the large-cap and mid-to-small-cap altcoins in terms of their market cap growth. Darkfost noted that this difference in the growth ratio has reached a level last seen in October 2023, a period correlated with a brief altcoin rally and subsequently BTC's dominance.

The analyst further highlighted that when this growth ratio turns negative, it often signals that a strong correction has occurred. Historically, a negative ratio might present a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to get into the market.

As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $83,500, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the ETH token is valued at around $1,805, with no change in the past day.

While the premier cryptocurrency dropped by about 15% in the first quarter of 2025, Ethereum lost almost double its value in the same period. This gap in performance underscores how woeful the “king of altcoins” has been in the past few months.

Crypto scams are booming. 

Luckily, there are crypto detectives and blockchain sleuths who track down stolen funds and help those who suspect they've been defrauded. 

The business of these investigators has flourished in recent years, three of them told Business Insider, in part because scams in the crypto sphere are becoming more sophisticated and even harder for even intelligent, computer-savvy people to avoid. 

Cryptocurrency crime has skyrocketed in recent years. Losses stemming from crypto investment frauds, the most common type of crypto scam, ballooned to $3.96 billion in 2023, according to data from the FBI, up 335% in two years. 

Scam activity has grown an average of 24% year-over-year since the pandemic, with bad actors likely pulling in a record $12.4 billion in revenue last year, according to estimates from the analytics firm Chainalysis.

Here are investigators' top tips on how you can protect yourself from crypto scammers. 

First things first: be aware that talking to strangers on the internet isn't exactly safe to begin with.

The vast majority of fraud takes place online — a digital jungle where it's hard, even for intelligent, experienced investors to tell what's a hoax and what's the real deal, according to John Powers, the president of the financial investigations firm Hudson Intelligence.

Powers, who worked as a PI for years prior to doing investigative work on the blockchain, thinks scams are becoming so good they're defining a new era of con-artistry.

"We've moved beyond the Nigerian 419 scams where the prince was contacting you by email," Powers told BI in an interview. "We're in a much different and more subtle and sophisticated place now. And it turns out that chatting online with random strangers is not necessarily a low-risk activity, especially if that seeming casual contact is actually just the tip of the spear."

He recommends people maintain healthy skepticism, particularly when talking to people or making investments online.

The risk is evident in the numbers. Pig butchering scams — one type of fraud where a scammer establishes an online relationship with someone before asking them to invest or send money — have been on the rise, with revenue from this type of fraud soaring 40% in 2024, according to Chainalysis.

Joe Greenfield, the chief forensic examiner at the investigative firm Maryman, strongly urges investors not to take anything at face value. Before sending over any info or money on the blockchain, you should check out everything you can about the situation, like researching the investment, calling the person directly, or even showing the exchange to another person in your life to get another pair of eyes on the situation.

"Assume in today's day and age that everything is a fraud. Everything's a scam until you prove otherwise to yourself," Greenfield said.

There's no such thing as a crypto exchange withholding your funds for tax reasons. There's also no such thing as an exchange requiring you to send in a fee in order to withdraw your money. 

But those are common examples of fraudulent expenses scammers come up with to extort money out of their victims, according to Kyla Curley, a partner at the professional services firm StoneTurn who frequently investigates financial fraud.

Curley says she often sees clients who had been unknowingly defrauded for months, due to a scammer repeatedly making small financial asks.

In pig butchering schemes, victims can also be roped into fake relationships that involve sending payments for months — or sometimes, years —before victims finally realize they've been scammed, Greenfield adds.

"It can drag for some time before people realize, like, oh shoot. They're asking me for more money again. Maybe this isn't right."

One nightmare scenario Greenfield frequently investigates is when investors wake up and realize that their crypto wallets have been emptied overnight.

In many cases, the theft was made possible by cybersecurity weaknesses within the person's crypto storage, such as by using a cloud-based wallet, weak passwords, and setting up SMS authentication instead of an app-based verification method.

For the strongest security, he recommends using a cold storage wallet, using app-based authentication on sensitive accounts when possible, and following best-practices when it comes to picking a password.

"We've seen hundreds of millions of dollars stolen that way," he said of cases stemming from cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Fraud victims, often strung along for months, frequently come to the realization that they've been scammed far too late. Sometimes, they choose to remain silent and not get help due to embarrassment or shame, Powers said.

But it's most useful if people get help right away. 

"The sooner, the better, the faster that we can try to work with the client, try to work with the online provider if they've got one for these online wallets and their legal counsel," Greenfield said.

Curley says scam victims will also need the help of an attorney or law enforcement if they hope to recover some of their funds. Once an investigation finds a wallet on an exchange with the stolen funds, the exchange needs a subpoena order to release private information about who owns the wallet.

Be aware of how costly help could be. It's common for attorney and investigator fees to rack up in the thousands, according Powers. He added that his firm typically does not take on fraud victims who have lost less than $100,000 in crypto, which he said was in clients' financial best interests.

Curley estimates that around 20% of cases she oversees will end with a client getting at least some money back.

Unfortunately, Curley also expects scams to become more sophisticated and damaging over time, due to how rapidly scams evolve.

"It's really, really hard for probably 90% of the population to identify or even be in tune with," she said of the sophistication of some scams out there. "I think, again, with AI, we all know that's just going to get much much worse."

HashKey Group Chairman and CEO Xiao Feng kicked off the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Sunday with a keynote address highlighting blockchain technology's transformative impact on global financial infrastructure.

Speaking to an early morning crowd at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Xiao described blockchain as “a new generation of financial infrastructure” that fundamentally changes how financial transactions are recorded, settled and governed.

“Any industrial revolution must wait for a financial revolution,” Xiao told attendees at the four-day event hosted by his company.

Xiao emphasized historical parallels between technological and financial evolution: banking credit supported the British Industrial Revolution, stock markets enabled the electrical revolution in America, and venture capital fueled Silicon Valley's information revolution.

“Cryptocurrency finance will become the core financial innovation supporting the fourth industrial revolution.”

The executive highlighted key differences between traditional and blockchain-based finance, including the shift from bank accounts to digital wallets and the move from batch settlement systems to instantaneous transaction completion.

Xiao noted the significance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision not to classify dollar-backed stablecoins as securities, suggesting this allows more institutions to participate in monetary creation processes.

He also pointed to major stock exchanges moving toward 23-hour trading cycles, compared to blockchain markets that operate continuously.

“Traditional exchanges will eventually need to adapt to compete with cryptocurrency markets that have operated 24/7 since day one,” Xiao predicted.

The event features several high-profile regulators, including Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Government; Joseph H. L. Chan, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury; Christina Choi, Executive Director of Investment Products at the Securities and Futures Commission; and George Chou, Chief Fintech Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions on cryptocurrencies, analysts view Hong Kong's supportive stance as a strategic testing ground for the technology's potential. This approach effectively creates a regulatory breathing space where blockchain innovations can develop under controlled conditions, potentially informing future policies across the broader Chinese economy.

The Web3 Festival continues through Wednesday with industry panels, demonstrations and networking events, bringing together blockchain developers, investors and technology enthusiasts from around the world.
