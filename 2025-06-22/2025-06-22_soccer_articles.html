Pachuca starting XI (TBC): Moreno, Rodriguez, Pereira, Bauermann, Gonzalez, Pedraza, Montiel, Palavecino, Dominguez, Kenedy, Rondon. This is a must-win game for Los Blancos after the 1-1 draw against Al Hilal, so it will be interesting to see if Xabi Alonso's men show some encouraging signs in this one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yildiz is Juventus' top scorer at the Club World Cup with three goals Kenan Yildiz scored one of the best goals of the Fifa Club World Cup so far as Juventus beat Moroccan side Wydad 4-1. But not to be denied a goal of his own, the Turkish forward doubled Juventus' lead 10 minutes later with a thunderbolt from the edge of the area. The 20-year-old latched onto a bouncing pass from Andrea Cambiaso and unleashed a first-time effort that rifled into the top corner. Thembinkosi Lorch gave the raucous travelling Wydad supporters something to cheer about when he halved the deficit with a delicate dinked effort beyond Michele di Gregorio. The game was interrupted as fans of Widad celebrate their team's first goal with flares There were temperatures of 31C at kick-off at Lincoln Financial Field and they rose further as the game went on, resulting in 35C heat by full time. Prior to the match, local government in Philadelphia issued a press release stating a "Heat Health Emergency" in the city. Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are due to take on Tunisian side ES Tunis in Philadelphia on Wednesday (02:00 BST). Yildiz brought the heat to what was an already scorching Philadelphia on Sunday. Juventus had only three shots on target against Wydad on Sunday but scored four goals thanks to Boutouil's early own-goal. Victory for Juventus means they will be through to the knockout stages should Manchester City win or draw against Al-Ain in the 02:00 BST kick-off The final games in Group G take place on Thursday, 26 June at 20:00 BST. Juventus take on City in what could be a battle for top spot, while Wydad face Al-Ain. The BBC is not responsible for any changes that may be made. Read about our approach to external linking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club attempt to steal march on Pep Guardiola's side with £20m bid for Flamengo right-back Wesley Franca, who impressed in win over Chelsea Brighton and Hove Albion have made a bid in the region of £20 million for Flamengo right-back Wesley França. The 21-year-old has also attracted interest from Manchester City and has been linked to Chelsea, although they are not in for the Brazilian and it is not an area of their team they are looking to change. Instead it is Brighton who have submitted an offer for Wesley, who played in Flamengo's impressive 3-1 win over Chelsea at the Club World Cup in Philadelphia. However, they will not contemplate a sale until after their Club World Cup campaign ends, having targeted the tournament as one that they can win. It remains to be seen whether they will accept Brighton's bid. Brighton are in the market for a right-back, having used midfielder Jack Hinshelwood in that role, firstly, under Roberto De Zerbi and with his successor Fabian Hürzeler. Towards the end of last season Hürzeler used centre-half Adam Webster in that role. City have considered him as a long-term replacement for Kyle Walker with Pep Guardiola having used Matheus Nunes and Rico Lewis in that position. City have also looked at Newcastle United's Tino Livramento and Juventus's Andrea Cambiaso, having accepted that it will be almost impossible to sign Paris St-Germain's Achraf Hakimi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America has all but clinched Group D after wins against Saudi Arabia and Trinidad and Tobago have put it at a plus-6 goal differential. Assuming they don't get routed by a Haiti team that needs a win and some help, the USMNT will enter the knockout stage against the loser of the Mexico-Costa Rica match that happens later Sunday. America leads its group with six points and almost certainly will win Group D regardless of how this match ends. They have not technically clinched that, as a loss to Haiti and a Saudi Arabia win against Trinidad and Tobago would leave the teams tied and the tiebreaker would be goal differential. The US enters this match +6 while Saudi Arabia is level, so barring something extraordinary, America will advance as the Group D winner. That would give them a quarterfinal match likely against the Mexico-Costa Rica loser. This site predicts the US to win 3-2. It writes: "Given they are already through to the last eight, we expect many American starters will get a rest, but even their B team should be more than enough to handle a Haitian side that are not nearly as deep as the Yanks." That should make it a little easier for the U.S. to create scoring chances, which should lead to multiple goals for the USMNT."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City face Al Ain in their second group game Manager also hints that Gündogan could leave the club Pep Guardiola has said he will select 10 new players to face Al Ain in Manchester City's second Club World Cup group game on Sunday night, though Rodri and John Stones are not yet ready to start because of respective injury problems. City face Al Ain at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium at 9pm local time (2am BST) having beaten Wydad 2-0 in their opening Group G match. While goals from Phil Foden and Jérémy Doku beat the Moroccan team, Guardiola revealed only one player from the victory will be in Sunday's XI. “In the next match 10 new players will be lined up to try and win,” said Guardiola, who confirmed that neither Rodri nor Stones will be in the lineup. Rodri suffered a serious knee injury against Arsenal in September that has meant only 37 minutes' game-time since, with the No 6 playing half an hour of this against Wydad. Guardiola said Rodri could not start, adding: “He's getting better. He has been out for a long time. Hopefully one day soon, he can play from the beginning.” Stones is fit again after a latest injury-plagued season that limited the defender to only 13 starts in all competitions, in a total of 1,134 minutes. But the important thing now is at training he feels better. Guardiola also hinted that Ilkay Gündogan, who is a target for Galatasaray, could leave. “I don't know anything, I didn't speak with him, and if he will not be part of our squad he would not be here,” said the 54-year-old. “But at the same time, we have a long squad, too many players, so we cannot go with 26, 27 players this season because there would be more without playing. But right now, Ilkay is absolutely part of my mind and the team.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diego Luna and Malik Tillman have emerged as breakout performers, while striker Haji Wright and veteran center back Chris Richards have anchored the offense and defense. Now, the U.S. will be without Wright for the rest of the tournament and will next face a Haiti side that hasn't backed down from anyone. Despite taking just one point from its first two matches, Haiti has outshot both Saudi Arabia and Trinidad and Tobago, and generated more expected goals in the latter match. Frantzdy Pierrot remains a bruising presence up top, Duckens Nazon continues to create chances out of chaos, and veteran keeper Johny Placide has kept Haiti in every match. If it can convert just one of the chances it's been carving out, Haiti could absolutely punch above its position and spoil someone else's bracket. Sébastien Migné's Haiti, on the other hand, adopts a more direct approach, pressing high and attacking quickly when the ball is regained. A draw might still do the job. A result for Haiti here, win or draw, wouldn't just shift the bracket; it would be a disrupter from the tournament's most resource-strapped team, proving there's more to Haiti than a plucky underdog story. Prediction: The USMNT takes it 2-1, but Haiti refuses to go down without a fight. Streaming and ticketing links in this article are provided by partners of The Athletic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE UNITED STATES MEN'S national team is now in Arlington where they will face Haiti on Sunday to conclude group play at the 2025 Gold Cup. Mauricio Pochettino's team is already through to the knockouts but can seal up first place with a win, draw, or even potentially a narrow loss. Such talk about results and placement is secondary. The real objective is just to play better. The 5-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago was perfectly acceptable. In past Gold Cups where the USMNT won, not every perfomance was very good (and one-goal wins have been common). It is also true that the hallmark of a good team is to find ways to win despite not playing well. Yes, the first two games have given mixed results but also a few clear observations – some positive, some negative. In the first two games of this tournament, Chris Richards raised his level at a time when his team needed someone to step up. It wasn't just the goal in the 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia either, it was his defensive play in the first half where he dove and blocked a very dangerous shot. The USMNT central defense pecking order has been unclear for years and it still is. But the race is on to see who will pair with Richards. Patrick Agyemang earned his opportunity to be on this Gold Cup roster with injuries to some players and scoring goals in January and March. But things have not gone his way this month. He has had some good moments, typically with his hold-up play and ability to run in the open field - but his touch has let him down too often and that might give an opening for Brian White or Damion Downs. Agyemang should feel pressure to be more dangerous in the coming games otherwise he might find call-ups in the fall tough to come by. It has been a problem for the U.S. national team for several years, even before the 2022 World Cup, but this team cannot come close to its potential without Tyler Adams. Pochettino has tried with other combinations and in this camp, he left Tanner Tessmann and Aidan Morris out despite having used them in earlier camps. Tyler Adams made his 2025 Gold Cup debut tonight, subbing on in the second half vs Saudi Arabia ? This month, he tried using Johnny Cardoso in place of Adams and it was a mess. Against weaker teams, the U.S. team can win without Adams. But there doesn't appear to be a solution right now against better teams. Matt Freese has been getting minutes this month in goal for the U.S. team and it puts him into contention to be parts of the team's plans moving forward. While he's always been seen as a distant option, the opportunity he has now is not something many saw coming. The only problem is that his performance has been inconclusive. He hasn't allowed any bad goals, but he also hasn't made any big saves that have changed the course of games. But it is fair to say that he must be training well to be getting into these games. At some point soon, he will be called to make a big save and show that he can contend for a spot on the team. But Freese getting these minutes is a big signal to Matt Turner that he must raise his game. As expected, Alex Freeman continues to play most of the team's minutes this month at right back despite him being in the first season as a starter. He's raw, he makes mistakes (one of which Chris Richards helped bail him out), but his upside/potential is also very visible. Taking Freeman to this tournament was always a long-term play. He doesn't have the experience to justify his place in must-win games now. But in thinking next year or even next cycle, the hope is that these games will help prepare Freeman for the future because they see him being helpful down the road. He might turn out to be an exciting player. For now, he is at least in consideration – which is more than anyone expected of him as recently as the start of the year. First international assist for Sebastian Berhalter in the win vs Saudi Arabia ? Berhalter, 24, is very good on the ball and he passes well. Defensively and in the press, he must improve. It wasn't until Berhalter swung in a free kick that was finished off by Richards that the U.S. team moved ahead. That gap between those games (and in the two friendlies) is very wide. It's also fair to note how the team, under a very different lineup, couldn't create much in March at the Nation's League. Against Saudi Arabia, it wasn't a case of bad finishing but rather they just struggled to create chances. Too often, players are good in one game and then struggle the next. That will be something to follow in the games ahead as to whether some sort of consistency can be developed in creating scoring chances.On anohter note, the team will be without Haji Wright for the rest of the tournament. TEAM NEWS: Haji Wright is dealing with an Achilles issue that will not be resolved in time for him to continue competing in the tournament.He will return to Coventry City for further evaluation and treatment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ARLINGTON, Texas — Sebastian Berhalter stood over the free kick about 40 yards away from Saudi Arabia's goal. He raised his hand, then delivered pinpoint service into the box where Chris Richards was able to get on the end of it and score what ultimately became the winning goal for the U.S. men's national team in its second Gold Cup match at Q2 Stadium in Austin on Thursday. Richards nearly had a goal earlier in that match, but his header off Jack McGlynn's corner went right into the goalkeeper's chest. Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as the USMNT's manager last fall, there's been more emphasis placed on set pieces, both offensively and defensively. "Offensively, I feel like we've always had the ability to be good at them, but we've never been good at them," Tyler Adams told reporters. That's what this team has been hoping would be the case for a while. In fact, former U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter (Sebastian's father) had hired Gianni Vio, an Italian set piece specialist, and saw the benefit in last summer's Copa América opener when Christian Pulisic scored off a corner kick that Vio designed. But outside of a few goals here and there, the U.S. hasn't been proficient enough. Pochettino, however, has placed a greater significance on this aspect of the game. Yes, working on set pieces consistently is important, but he's also introduced the team to a technology called TrackMan, which provides real-time data on ball flight, speed, launch angles, distance and more. "It shows if you put the ball in a certain area, the percentage of scoring or getting a head on it or first contact is going to go up," Adams said. "I think putting the ball into consistent delivery has been important, but we have threats. Even Chris, I think he's finally coming into his own. "The key is to have a player like Chris who is so good at attacking the box and then a player with great delivery like we have in Sebastian or Jack McGlynn, who have a really good touch on the ball," Pochettino said. "But it's not only us who are working in this way to try to improve on set pieces in offensive and defensive situations. Chris Richards scored the United States' game-winning header off of a set piece. Sebastian Berhalter has actually been using TrackMan with his MLS club, the Vancouver Whitecaps, for a while. During the season, he works with assistant coaches Jan Michaelsen and Michael D'Agostino a few times a week so he can keep improving his delivery. "I think my whole career it's something that I wanted to be good at, and slowly it's gotten better," Berhalter said. "I think these last couple years in Vancouver they've emphasized it. I sat down with our assistant coach and he told me that, you know, ‘This year you can be the best in the league at set pieces.'" He's now developed a reputation for it, and given how open things are when it comes to Pochettino's player pool, this particular skill set could help Berhalter's case for a World Cup roster spot next year. "Set pieces are really about repetition," Paxten Aaronson said. "Everybody has the technique, but how many times can you take it? The USMNT has been spending 15-20 minutes on set pieces before every Gold Cup game, "really making sure everyone knows what we're doing," Berhalter said. "Even the day before in training, [Pochettino] said, ‘Take your time, be calm, you know you can deliver a good ball.' As for capitalizing on more of these opportunities going forward, guys like Richards know they can anticipate quality service from Berhalter. He hedged correctly, and the USMNT won its second straight game. She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star.</p>
