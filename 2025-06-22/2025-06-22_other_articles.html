                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American artist, filmmaker and a ‘ufologist celebrity' Jeremy Corbell has been publicly sharing the video that left him stunned over the ‘implications'. He has previously leaked footage from the US forces and shared this latest clip on his social media earlier this week. The clip does appear to show a huge disc weaving in and out of the clouds with co-ordinates indicating it was filmed somewhere over Afghanistan and Pakistan. Corbell claims the video captures unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and that officials have admitted it's a ‘disc'. Corbell claims US officials said the craft ‘displayed abrupt movement and intelligent control', with it seeming to suddenly change directions in footage. It's believed the object is somewhere between 200 and 400 metres in diameter but the exact size is apparently still being debated. There's no heat signature in the video, and nothing you'd expect ‘for a normal aircraft'. And Corbell says it's ‘astonishing' that a UFO with a shape like this could move about without emitting heat signatures. “You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,” he explained. During an episode of their podcast Weaponised, his cohost George Knapp said the source is ‘legit'. “It was not supposed to be made public. The pair say they spent over two years validating the clips with a number of sources – apparently including people who work in official US government UFO programmes. When approached for comment, a spokesperson from the US Department of Defence said to LADbible: “We have nothing to offer on that.” Her main interests include asking everyone in the office what they're having for tea, waiting for a new series of The Traitors and losing her voice at a Beyoncé concert.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, they're returning to Europe for their first multi-city fanmeet tour. In February 2025, PSYCHIC FEVER signed a global label deal with Warner Music Group, in partnership with 10K Projects in the US, a clear sign to their fans (known as forEVERS) that their ambitions aren't limited to Japan. The deal followed a six-city US tour, a showcase appearance at SXSW, and, on June 18th, the release of their new EP, ‘PSYCHIC FILE III'. Their first release under the new label partnership, the EP cuts across R&B, hip-hop, and pop with Y2K-era influences and multilingual lyricism. Ahead of next month's Berlin and London fanmeets and their return to Japan Expo Paris, we spoke with PSYCHIC FEVER about the creative process behind ‘PSYCHIC FILE III', what makes this tour different from past European appearances, and how their perspective has shifted as they continue to perform and record on an international stage. What does this project represent for you at this point in your career, and what did you want to express through these four tracks? WEESA: This album, in a way, was set as a challenge to ourselves on how much we've improved in the past few years and represents a new perspective of ourselves that we would like to share with our fans. RYOGA: We wanted to express how much of our sound has changed. The lead track ‘Reflection' reimagines classic R&B through a modern lens. KOKORO: When creating ‘Reflection', we wanted to experiment upon our current sound, which was already based on R&B and hip-hop. As artists, we also wanted to jump out of our comfort zone and challenge ourselves vocally. Our producers, including JIGG, HIGHERBABY, MI, NVMBRR, and William Segerdahl, helped us refine what we wanted it to sound like. We've worked with JIGG on a number of songs before, but we were able to reinvent upon this strong foundation with the fresh approach of international writers! We were trying hard to bring a new kind of energy that fans had never seen before so we think that was the most difficult challenge. KOKORO: In terms of recording, however, the most challenging track would be ‘Reflection'. Some of us had trouble with embodying the vocal style needed for the song, and some of us had difficulties blending English and Japanese lyrics. RYUSHIN: TikTok has really helped get our music out to our forEVERS, and introduced us to new fans and people who maybe haven't heard of us yet. People can listen to the songs earlier, make fun videos, and tell us what they think about the music before it comes out. We also love seeing all the dance trends and memes people make with our songs. You're heading back to Europe for your first-ever fanmeet tour, with stops in Berlin and London. You've met fans here before, but this will be your first official tour across multiple cities. JIMMY: This tour feels different because it is the first official time we get to meet and interact with forEVERS in Europe. It will be our first time bringing a full fanmeet tour to Europe, so that makes it very special and something we will remember forever. We are most excited for meeting our forEVERs and playing them the new music. The London fanmeet also lines up with your third anniversary. Looking back on the last three years, what are you most proud of, and what's surprised you the most about this journey so far? RYOGA: As an international boy group, we are most proud of connecting with ForEVERs all around the world! REN: Of course, this was also what surprised us– the overwhelming support we get from our fans on every one of our projects. You could say that they are the ones who help us “evolve!”. Has performing internationally influenced the way you write, rehearse, or even think about your music? RYOGA: Traveling the world and performing has definitely changed how we approach music, we now have more experience to pull from and more languages to write in. It's really cool to be able to write lyrics in both Japanese and English, and watching how our forEVERS sing along in both languages. From selling out your first U.S. tour to headlining at SXSW, this year has been full of big moves. As things continue to grow, what does “making it” look like for each of you, and has that dream changed since you debuted? We love what we do and want to keep doing it forever, so we hope to stay true to our words, become more and more popular, travel the world, and meet more of our ForEVERS! For fans attending the Europe fanmeet or discovering ‘PSYCHIC FILE III' for the first time, what message would you like them to take away from this chapter of PSYCHIC FEVER? PSYCHIC FEVER will bring their first official European fanmeet tour to Berlin and London this July, with newly announced dance workshops in Utrecht and London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bollywood actress, Sonakshi Sinha, is returning to the silver screen with her brother Kussh's directorial debut in the paranormal film, Nikita Roy. Ahead of its release, the Heeramandi actress has been busy promoting the movie, and in her recent promotions, Sonakshi surprised everyone by sharing her personal encounter, that too, at her own house. Her real-life brush with what she likes to call a ‘harmless ghost' has allegedly shaken her long-held scepticism about the paranormal. Sonakshi Sinha recounts a brush with the paranormal at her own house when she was sleeping alone During a candid interaction with Bollywood Hungama, Sonakshi Sinha opened up about a personal experience that challenged her disbelief in the supernatural, particularly ghosts or otherworldly entities. The Lootera actress admitted that although she had always been a sceptic when it came to such things, what she encountered that night was difficult to explain, leaving her to wonder whether it was just a vivid dream or perhaps a harmless spirit. But one day, something very weird happened to me in my house. But after that, nothing happened, so I thought, maybe it was a dream? Sonakshi shared that her paranormal encounter took place in the wee hours of the day, around 4 a.m., and it was still dark outside. Despite being alone in the house, Sonakshi was jolted when she felt pressure on her body, almost like someone was trying to wake her up. Suddenly, I felt this pressure, like someone was trying to wake me up. Fortunately for her, the incident didn't repeat itself. “When I came home the next night, it was late again. I peeked in first, then said very loudly: ‘Jo bhi aaya tha kal raat ko, phirse aise mat karo. Agar kuch baat karni hai toh mere sapne mein aana… no face-to-face conversation.' I swear, since then, nothing like that has happened again.” About Sonakshi Sinha's upcoming film, Nikita Roy After Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Netflix series, Heeramandi, Sonakshi is returning with a supernatural thriller film, Nikita Roy, where she plays the titular character. Alongside Sonakshi, the film features a notable cast including Paresh Rawal, Arjun Rampal, and Suhail Nayyar. Nikita Roy is slated to hit theatres on June 27, 2025. advertisement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural is largely at the top of the best CW TV shows of all time, and the show's biggest strength was with its main cast of characters, namely Dean and Sam Winchester, alongside Castiel. However, not all episodes were about Sam and Dean. With how successful Supernatural was for the network for so many years, it seemed like a no-brainer that the show could launch another successful spinoff. While Supernatural is wildly popular, the franchise never really expanded in significant ways, with one alternate-universe prequel and a long-forgotten Supernatural anime adaptation. That didn't stop them from trying, though, as Supernatural had various other spinoffs in development over the years, including Supernatural: Bloodlines, which was introduced in an episode of the main series. It was intended to launch into its own show following the characters' introductions in Supernatural, but that never ended up happening. Supernatural: Bloodlines was created by Andrew Dabb, who served as one of the executive producers for seasons 9-15 of Supernatural, as well as writing a significant number of episodes starting in season 4. Attempting to launch a new show through a backdoor pilot can be tricky to pull off, and "Bloodlines" failed to build any goodwill towards its characters or even the story itself during the episode. In fact, it is largely considered the worst episode of Supernatural ever, sitting at a terrible 5.8 on IMDb, an entire point lower than the next. Supernatural is at its best when focusing heavily on Sam and Dean. "Bloodlines" attempted to focus on everyone else, and it was just hopelessly boring. Supernatural: Bloodlines ended up being scrapped after it was announced to be released in April 2014. It's hard to justify skipping episodes of any TV show, but "Bloodlines" is the perfect example of one that doesn't need to be watched, especially for anyone who is doing a rewatch of Supernatural. There is a lot of discourse around whether filler in shows is worth watching or not, but "Bloodlines" honestly adds nothing to Supernatural at all, especially with Supernatural: Bloodlines never coming to fruition. There is a lot of discourse around whether filler in shows is worth watching or not, but "Bloodlines" honestly adds nothing to Supernatural... It's clear that Supernatural is so successful due to the strength of its characters and the connections fans have with them. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Rod Serling wrote various Twilight Zone episodes during the show's original run, and his best one shows why the series is a timeless masterpiece. I was excited for Ralph Fiennes' Doctor Kelson in 28 Years Later, but the character was my favorite part of the movie for a reason I never expected. After a cameo at the end of "The Lonely Man," General McCallister is given a proper (but confusing) comeback in Resident Alien season 4, episode 3. Marvel's god-strength new Hulk shares the details of their gamma powers, revealing how they gained them and the emotion that makes them stronger. The live-action How To Train Your Dragon Box Office hits a huge new milestone in its second weekend, climbing even higher on the 2025 top 10 list. While Band of Brothers is inarguably a better show overall than The Pacific, it's still a fantastic series with highs that match Band of Brothers'. NCIS season 22 confirmed my worst fears about the CBS procedural, and I'm hoping that the network could fix it before it's no longer possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One hovered, paused within feet, then zipped away with impossible speed. Veteran crews might have expected some strange nocturnal sights from passing planes, satellites or shooting stars. But this was like nothing they'd ever seen before ... Within a few years, a wave of even more vivid and unusual sightings of unidentified objects in the night sky would see the area around the Stirlingshire town of Bonnybridge gain international notoriety as Scotland's UFO capital. Co-authored by veteran UFO researchers Malcolm Robinson and Ron Halliday, Bonnybridge: The Definitive Guide to Scotland's UFO Hotspot is a meticulous compendium of eyewitness accounts, official responses, theories and the persistent mystery that has long hovered – sometimes literally – over the region. UFO investigator Malcolm Robinson has spent years researching the unexplained “It suggests there's been something happening in this area for much longer than we thought.” Among the testimonies is the young woman who was stopped in her tracks by a glowing red light hovering above a house in Denny, not far from Gardrum Moss and just a few miles from Bonnybridge. Squinting a little, she realised the light was emanating from an egg-shaped object, perched at an angle and with a glowing white band of light around its centre. These days she might have reached for her phone to capture what she was seeing, to share across social media and watch her video go viral. But this was October 1980, and all she could do was stare as it lifted straight up into the still dark sky and, in a sudden burst of speed, disappear. A new book explores the mystery of Bonnybridge UFO sightings (Image: Getty) Then there was Janet Middleton from the village of Laurieston on the fringes of Falkirk, who, in 1983, glanced up while walking her dog and saw what she later described as a “huge starship”, with six windows and a metallic enamel sheen, gently descending over the hills before fading away. From glowing orbs to dazzling lights to shimmering metallic craft, the phenomenon extended beyond one-off occurrences into a patchwork of strange and consistent events spanning several decades. What makes many sightings stand out says Halliday, is they come from ‘ordinary' men and women who had no reason to make anything up. “We have had a police officer, people in professional jobs… they don't want to be branded ‘loonies'. The book comes in the wake of rising speculation over UFOs following a NASA panel set up in 2023 to explore unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) which confirmed some defied explanation. US President Donald Trump has also indicated previously locked Pentagon files relating to UFO activity could be released. The new book explores in detail dozens of sightings, among them a spate of early 1990s incidents which led to Bonnybridge becoming Scotland's UFO hotspot leading to film crews descending from as far as Japan, and a host of documentaries, articles and theories. Among the most intriguing was the incident on a March evening in 1992, when Isabelle Sloggett strolled on a quiet back road between Hallglen and Bonnybridge with her daughter Carole and son Steven. Their eyes were drawn to a peculiar circle of blue light in the sky which swooped to the ground and landed first in a nearby field, and then moved on to the road around 60 feet behind them. Bonnybridge Councillor Billy Buchanan led calls for UFO investigations (Image: Gordon Terris) Within a few weeks, other locals came forward to tell of seeing bluish lights in the area, balls of light and odd objects. They included pals Steven Wilson and David Gillespie, both in their early twenties at the time, who were driving on a quiet road close to their home in Maddiston – a few miles south of Bonnybridge. No sound at all could be heard coming from the object.” Witnesses ranged from pensioners living in Falkirk's high rise flats who, used to seeing passing planes, reported odd colours and lights in the sky, to 12-year-old schoolboy, Craig Morrison, who reported watching red lights form patterns above his home in Larbert, around three miles east of Bonnybridge. “As he was walking down the street, he suddenly heard a tremendous ‘whooshing' sound come from above him in the sky," says Robinson. "Looking up, he observed three red lights in a rectangular pattern with a curved structure below them which appeared to be hovering above some nearby rooftops. "Suddenly, the object flew off and was eventually lost to view.” But perhaps the most significant sighting involved a local businessman, James Walker, as he drove on a country road between Falkirk and Bonnybridge. Just ahead of him, hovering above the road, was a glowing star shaped object. This, he later told his friend, local councillor Billy Buchanan, he was sure wasn't due to an obvious source such as an aircraft. From being a quiet town with an industrial heritage of brickmaking, sawmills and foundries tied to its proximity to the Forth and Clyde Canal, cut through by the Antonine Wall and with the remnants of Rough Castle Fort on its fringes, Bonnybridge became a byword for odd activity. “We've always had hotspots that seem to flare up,” says Halliday. “But these older cases suggest there was always something simmering below the surface.” Risking ridicule, he called for the Ministry of Defence to look into the sightings and penned letters to Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair. He became known as the ‘UFO Councillor' and while some locals cringed and scoffed, he'd later go on to receive a public apology from Nick Pope, a former civil servant who once investigated UFOs for the Ministry of Defence at the time, for dismissing claims of 'close encounters' around the village. The book also captures the public's shift in attitude as more people came forward, igniting a growing willingness to share strange sightings that might otherwise never have been mentioned. Emboldened, people who might have kept their sightings to themselves, spoke out. “For every five people who see something, only one might speak up. “But in Bonnybridge, it reached a point where people couldn't stay quiet.” There was the man driving with his sons near Denny when a black, doorless craft hovered beside their car, emitting a tingling, electric sensation through their bodies. “These weren't just lights in the distance,” Robinson adds. “Some were structured objects, seen at low altitude, close to witnesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We wrote earlier that the approval of new social studies standards was the latest caper pulled off by Ryan Walters, who has done a very good job going rogue without much in the way of checks or balances,” writes the Tulsa World Editorial Board. When Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history this school year get to the chapter on conspiracy theories about whether Donald Trump won an election he lost, blame state Superintendent Ryan Walters and the Legislature. In this space when it happened, we wrote that the approval of new social studies standards was the latest caper pulled off by Walters, who has done a very good job of going rogue without much in the way of checks or balances. We know most have written him off, including the governor, who said recently that no one takes the guy seriously. Kevin Stitt even replaced some of the state school board members so someone would start pushing back on the superintendent's monthly mania during meetings. The new version widens that: “Identify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county' trends.” We would have preferred that the supermajority of Republicans in the Senate would have done their jobs. But his fellow Republicans decided to just let it go. After much discussion, there was no will to even take a vote. Reporting from Associated Press reporter Sean Murphy might point to why. Last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty threatened lawmakers who rejected the standards with a primary opponent. “In the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,” Murphy quoted from a letter signed by several conservative groups and GOP activists. “If you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.” They will do their jobs and not mislead, misinform or mistake how to rise above the latest political game they are in with no hand to play — like they have so many times before.
