                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert posted a major alert showing that 129,392 ETH was transferred from an unidentified wallet to Coinbase as the Ethereum price tumbled. On-chain data from Etherscan shows that this particular wallet had not been involved in the transfer of large ETH volumes since November 2022. This sudden reactivation and deposit into a centralized exchange opens up speculation of a looming selloff, especially given the timing of the transfer. Etherscan's tracking of on-chain transactions indicates that the unknown wallet “0xd47b,” which was involved in the transfer, has been relatively inactive since late 2022. Particularly, its last transaction was an inflow of 6,469 ETH from another wallet linked to Coinbase. Since then, the Ethereum price has lost a key support level at $2,450. Its price has fallen notably in the past 48 hours. Exchange inflows of this magnitude are a precursor to liquidation, particularly now that investor sentiment is on edge. Technical analysis of Ethereum's 4-hour chart on the TradingView platform shows a clear bearish breakdown setup after Ethereum broke below a crucial support line at $2,362. That support level has now been breached, and confirmation of the breakdown amplifies a bearish case moving forward. Previous failed attempts to break resistance have left Ethereum in a vulnerable zone, and the recent whale selloff may have delivered the final push needed to trigger this leg down. If the current trajectory continues, Ethereum could be on its way to retesting lows below $2,000. According to the TradingView analysis, potential reversal targets are at $2,151 and $1,954, with a third possible level at $1,750 if the selloff is more than expected. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,290, down by 5.5% and 10% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metallica, led by Ulrich, sued Napster for copyright infringement after a demo of their new song “I Disappear” got leaked and was later shared by the internet on Napster. It wasn't even one of the good Metallica songs! And yet, it created the online piracy debate we have up until today. It was certainly kind of magical and empowering to be able to download songs, movies, TV shows… everything at arm's reach, and for the cost of zero moneys. It can be sort of funny seeing a multi-millionaire like Ulrich complaining about being ripped off. Fast forward to today, and we're still wrestling with that same dilemma: how do artists protect and monetize their work in a digital-first world? They offer artists something Lars never got: a way to prove ownership, reclaim value, and maybe — just maybe — get a little justice for all. If you don't know much about NFTs, take a look at this article first. Having Logan Paul and Jimmy Fallon become the poster boys of this quite amazing technology wasn't the best way to make a good first impression. First, they solve Lars Ulrich's dilemma: “How can you prove ownership of something digital?” These tokens are unique digital certificates stored on the blockchain. Kind of like a cryptocurrency project can “mint” tokens that are unique and never changeable, artists can mint a digital artwork as an NFT, permanently tying that piece to a one-of-a-kind token on the blockchain. Secondly, they create an open marketplace where digital artists can sell their work directly to collectors. For decades, being an emerging artist meant facing a brutal uphill battle just to get noticed. Landing gallery representation, fighting for exhibition slots, trying to fit into a world that seemed to reward “my dad knows someone” more than “my art's actually good.” Suddenly, digital artists didn't have to wait for a gatekeeper's stamp of approval. They could mint their own work as NFTs, list it on a public marketplace, and start building a collector base directly. This shift has democratized art access in unprecedented ways: In 2021, Christie's auctioned Beeple's NFT for $69 million, sparking a wave of experimentation. Brands like Adidas and Gucci are collaborating with crypto-native artists. Even museums are dipping their toes into blockchain for provenance tracking and digital exhibitions. While there are still growing pains (scams, volatility, and hype cycles), the fundamental shift is clear: NFTs are giving power back to creators, and they're dragging the old art world into the future. For the first time, they can sell unique pieces, set their own prices, and earn automatic royalties from resales. Crypto art doesn't just help artists get paid—it gives them control over every part of their creative and commercial process. All of this means less reliance on the traditional art world and more room to build direct relationships with fans and collectors. In a world where digital attention is currency, NFTs give artists the tools to own both their art and their audience. NFTs let artists earn upfront and over time, turning art into a recurring revenue engine. Well, by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, plus decentralized marketplaces, NFTs turn digital art into something provably ownable and sellable.On top of selling art pieces, perhaps the most meaningful innovation NFTs bring to the table is the ability to allow creators to receive automated royalties for their work. Different from traditional art markets, where an artwork is resold, the original creator usually gets nothing for it; NFTs allow artists to generate income for their work with the help of smart contracts on the blockchain. Every time an artwork is sold, the creator can stipulate a reselling clause, allowing them to earn up to 10% on every sale after. The best part is that this clause is not made in a contract — but actually a smart contract — meaning that everything happens automatically after the sale is completed, without the need for lawyers, galleries, or chasing down payments. Digital art on the blockchain means each piece is directly tied to a unique token. Even if that artwork is copied and tampered with, the original work's authenticity is guaranteed through a decentralized network of nodes. This system brings transparency, permanence, and global verifiability—something traditional art can't offer. If artists want control, traceable royalties, and global reach, the blockchain might just be their new canvas. New artists looking for volume and ease: start with OpenSea or Objkt. So you've got the art, now let's get it on-chain. Set Up a Crypto Wallet: You'll need a crypto wallet like MetaMask, Ka.App, or Temple (for Tezos), to register with the marketplace, mint and sell artworks, and so on. This creates a token on the blockchain tied to your piece. Choose between 1/1 originals or editioned series depending on your strategy. Write a Description & Set Royalties: Describe the art, your process, and what makes it special. Don't forget to set your royalty % (most artists go with 5–10%). Use your social media channels (Twitter/X, Instagram, Discord) to build hype ahead of the release. The NFT game is evolving fast, and now in 2025, we are already seeing newer trends emerge. Artists are experimenting with “phygital” drops, where owning an NFT unlocks a real-world item or vice versa. Music, fashion, and even live events are being tokenized, creating NFTs that act as tickets, merch, or backstage passes. The traditional art industry is slowly moving into blockchain technology as well. Galleries and museums are beginning to use it to track provenance, the full ownership history of a piece, through smart contracts. Platforms like Verisart and Artory issue blockchain-based certificates that prove a work's legitimacy and link it directly to the artist. Even insurance providers are using blockchain to verify claims and reduce fraud in the art world. NFTs are changing the art industry by empowering artists and allowing democratic access to creative works all around the world. When Lars Ulrich stood up to Napster in the early 2000s, it wasn't about ownership, but rather about artists losing control and not getting paid for their work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The world's largest cryptocurrency on Sunday dipped below $100,000 for the first time in over a month following U.S. airstrikes on Iran. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, had an even starker decline, shedding almost 10%. In mid-June, a United Nations–backed nuclear watchdog said that Iran wasn't complying with prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!” Trump posted Saturday night on social media in all capital letters. Bitcoin's recent plummet below the psychologically important threshold of $100,000 follows a year of gains for the cryptocurrency. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election in November, it soared. Major stock indices like the S&P 500 also jumped, but Bitcoin and the broader crypto market's gains were especially steep. Once Trump assumed office in January, Bitcoin soon notched all-time highs above $100,000 in February as the 47th president unveiled executive orders designed to help the crypto industry. In April, shortly after Trump unveiled a suite of historically severe tariffs, Bitcoin dipped to almost $75,000, its lowest mark in 2025. Recently, Bitcoin, which usually tracks with tech stocks and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, has rallied. In May, it notched its all-time high as Wall Street investors piled back into the cryptocurrency through U.S. exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technical patterns point to a potential 25% rebound in Ether's price, with whales scooping $263.5 million worth of ETH during the price dip. An Ethereum whale accumulated $39 million in ETH during a sharp market sell-off triggered by US airstrikes on Iran. Ethereum mega-whales added over 116,000 ETH on June 21, signaling strong buy-the-dip sentiment. Technical patterns suggest ETH could rebound 25% toward $2,735 in the short term. The wallet address 0x7355...213 purchased roughly 9,400 ETH (~$39 million) across two major tranches on June 22, boosting its total Ether holdings to $330 million. Its buying occurred even as Ether emerged as one of the worst-performing top cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours. The downside move came as markets digested reports of a direct US military strike on Iran, marking a major escalation in the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict, which began with Israel's “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13. Related: Staked Ether hits record high driven by corporate crypto treasury adoption: Finance Redefined Glassnode's data tracking the broader whale holding patterns suggests a similar upside sentiment. On June 21, these mega-whales scooped up over 116,893 ETH worth $265.30 million, suggesting they viewed the decline as a buying opportunity, not a trigger to exit. Ether is holding above a key ascending trendline that may lead to a strong bounce in the coming days, according to market analyst Sensei.

It's a “big risk to watch out for,” Tracy Jin, the chief operating officer of crypto exchange MEXC, said in emailed comments.</p>

As of June 30, 2025, any entity incorporated in Singapore — whether a company, partnership, or individual — that provides digital token services to overseas clients must either: Any entity falling within the scope of these new rules must comply or shut down cross-border digital asset activity. Even firms for whom foreign clients represent only a small fraction of revenue are affected.

MAS mandates a minimum base capital of SGD 250,000 for DTSP applications (even for partnerships or individuals), which users must maintain as a cash deposit or capital contribution. It encompasses centralized crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms, wallet providers, token issuers and even non-crypto firms if they offer token-related services to clients outside Singapore.This means that a Singapore-based startup running a marketing campaign for a foreign crypto project may still be considered a DTSP, even if they don't touch user funds directly. Even small-scale players, part-time projects or side ventures tied to crypto fall under the mandate. The agency has explicitly warned that it will take enforcement action against any DTSP that has not registered or exited overseas operations by the June deadline.Did you know?

Despite industry lobbying, the MAS has refused all requests for phased implementation.Crypto service providers and industry groups had urged the regulator to allow for a transition window, a temporary exemption process or at least a fast-track licence application. Despite industry lobbying, the MAS has refused all requests for phased implementation. Many argued that the abrupt timeline — less than a month in many cases — gave insufficient time to restructure or unwind services. Also, because MAS is expected to grant licences only sparingly, citing ongoing AML/CFT concerns, many firms may not qualify. Violating the June 30 deadline is a criminal offense under Singapore law. Firms that continue operating as DTSPs for overseas clients without a valid licence will be in breach of Section 137 of the FSM Act and face: Also, because MAS is expected to grant licences only sparingly, citing ongoing AML/CFT concerns, many firms may not qualify. While MAS has not officially suspended licensing, it has made clear that approvals for Digital Token Service Providers (DTSPs) will be extremely rare. In a June 6, 2025 announcement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore stated that licences would only be issued in “extremely limited circumstances,” due to unresolved Anti–Money Laundering (AML) and Counter–Terrorism Financing (CFT) concerns.MAS made its position unambiguous: The bar for licensing is now intentionally high. A spokesperson confirmed that MAS “will generally not issue a licence” given the inherent difficulty of regulating offshore token services and the related crypto legal risks in 2025.This effectively imposes a de facto licensing ban. Unless a crypto company in Singapore has both elite compliance infrastructure and a strong operational justification, it is unlikely to receive regulatory approval.

The project is advancing at a time of growing national support for blockchain technologies and digital assets, bolstered by the Trump administration's recent pro-crypto policy stance. The initiative aims to bring job creation, education, and tech-driven opportunity to a part of the city that has often been overlooked in previous development efforts. Now, with private investment and support from technology partners, the space is being redeveloped to house crypto mining operations, blockchain development labs, fintech training centers, startup co-working areas, and workforce development programs. At full scale, the center is projected to support more than 250 jobs, both directly and indirectly, spanning roles in IT, blockchain coding, operations, and logistics. The project will also offer paid blockchain training programs, Web3 certification courses, internships with crypto startups, and career pathways for local residents interested in the growing digital economy. “If we want to break the cycle of generational poverty, we need to build pipelines into industries that aren't dying—they're growing,” Dr. Ahmed said. “We want Chicago to be part of that conversation, and this project will help put us on the map,” Dr. Ahmed added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has officially lost the $103,600 support level following shocking geopolitical developments. The US military reportedly launched attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, triggering widespread panic and risk-off behavior across financial markets. Bitcoin, which had been holding above key support for weeks, rapidly sold off as fear gripped traders and investors alike. Bulls have lost control of short-term momentum, and the broader market now braces for a potential drop below the critical $100,000 psychological level. With no immediate signs of relief, selling pressure may persist unless strong demand emerges near range lows. Top analyst Carl Runefelt pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has just surpassed its previous high, indicating that while Bitcoin bleeds, altcoins are under even more pressure. This capital concentration in Bitcoin could be interpreted as a flight to relative safety within the crypto ecosystem, but it also highlights growing uncertainty and lack of confidence in higher-risk tokens. Yet, despite the selling pressure, bulls have managed to defend the $100K threshold for now, suggesting it may be forming a new base of support. Rising US Treasury yields continue to tighten liquidity conditions, while the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates adds further uncertainty. Meanwhile, escalating conflicts in the Middle East, including the recent US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, have injected fear across global markets. Bitcoin has historically responded to geopolitical risk with mixed behavior—sometimes acting as a safe haven, other times following broader market risk aversion. Adding to the complexity, Carl Runefelt recently noted that Bitcoin Dominance has just broken above its previous high. This signals that capital is concentrating on Bitcoin, while altcoins suffer heavier losses. The shift reflects growing caution in the market, with investors opting for perceived relative safety over speculative risk. Whether this capital rotation will eventually fuel another leg up for Bitcoin—or mark the start of a broader downtrend—remains to be seen in the coming days. Bitcoin has now been trading above the $100K level since early June, indicating that the price may be attempting to stabilize around this range. The chart shows BTC failing multiple times to break through the $109,300 resistance level, resulting in a gradual decline and increased selling pressure. The $103,600 area—which previously acted as support—has now been lost, confirming weakness in short-term bullish momentum. However, volume has been decreasing as the price consolidates, suggesting hesitation among market participants. The price action suggests that BTC is forming a new local range between $100,000 and $109,000. Market watchers are closely monitoring this level as the battle between bulls and bears intensifies.
