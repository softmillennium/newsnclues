                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday called for China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most important trade routes for crude oil in the world. "I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil," Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic. Iran's foreign minister warned earlier Sunday that the Islamic Republic "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty," after the U.S. bombed three key nuclear sites over the weekend. Iranian state-owned media, meanwhile, reported that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz, citing a senior lawmaker. An attempt to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the global economy. Some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Oil prices could shoot above $100 per barrel if the strait is closed for a prolonged period, according to Goldman Sachs and consulting firm Rapidan Energy. JPMorgan analysts view the risk of Iran closing Hormuz as low because the U.S. would view such a move as a declaration of war. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC, pumping 3.3 million barrels per day. The U.S. retains options to deal with Iran trying to close strait, the U.S. secretary of state said. "It would hurt other countries' economies a lot worse than ours," Rubio said. "It would be, I think, a massive escalation that would merit a response, not just by us, but from others." The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain and tasked with protecting maritime trade in the Persian Gulf. Oil market participants generally believe the U.S. Navy would swiftly vanquish any attempt by Iran to block the Strait of Hormuz. "They could disrupt, in our view, shipping through Hormuz by a lot longer than the market thinks," said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy and former energy advisor to President George W. Bush. Shipping could be interrupted for weeks or months, McNally said, rather than the oil market's view that the U.S. Navy would resolve the situation in hours or days.

Israel-Iran War:

Damage at the Fordow nuclear facility on June 22 after the US strikes.

Source: Maxar

The task of ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon might just have got tougher.

President Donald Trump's decision to order US forces to attack three key Iranian nuclear installations may have sabotaged the Islamic Republic's known atomic capabilities, but it's also created a monumental new challenge to work out what's left and where. 

Trump said heavily fortified sites were “totally obliterated” late Saturday, but independent analysis has yet to verify that claim. Rather than yielding a quick win, the strikes have complicated the task of tracking uranium and ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon, according to three people who follow the country's nuclear program.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's something that Evan Hock, co-founder and COO of MakeMyMove tells CNBC Make It, he wishes more people were aware of. They are more mobile than ever, both through remote work, and if you're a smart person, you can pretty much get a job anywhere, and that gives people options," he says. "They are moving from places like California, New York, Texas and Florida to places that maybe have a better quality of life. Hock says it's something he finds that many people neglect. "The seats are limited, so if you're thinking about making a move, it's free to apply and applying kind of gets your name in the hat, so take the plunge," he adds. To take advantage, you must live in the state for at least two years in one of the designated communities: New River George, Greenbrier Valley, Morgantown, Eastern Panhandle, and Greater Elkins. To be eligible for the Ascend West Virginia program, applicants must work remotely, have the ability to work remotely in a business based outside of West Virginia or be self-employed outside of the state. You must provide proof of employment and income prior to being accepted into the program, have the ability to relocate within six months, be 18 years or older, and be a U.S. citizen or green card holder. How it works: Tulsa launched its program in 2018. Applicants must also have lived outside of the state for one full year before applying. The application process includes a 30-minute virtual interview and if you are selected to proceed, you'll be required to complete a background check and income verification before continuing. Once you're approved, Tulsa Remote will have to verify you've signed a qualifying lease or purchased a qualifying home. Approved applicants will then attend a new member orientation. Once those steps are completed, you will be eligible to receive the grant money. How it works: To receive the incentive, your employer must participate in the GO Topeka employee transfer program and contribute anywhere from $2,500 up to $15,000. The city has two other programs that offer $5,000 to former Topeka residents and $5,000 to those transitioning out of the military. Incentive: $5,000 in down payment and closing cost assistance, 5-year forgivable loan How it works: The program is awarded by lottery 12 business days after the Live Baltimore's Trolley Tour event, which is held three times a year. Homebuyers must attend and complete all requirements of the Trolley Tour event. After that event, applicants have 12 business days to make an offer on a home, have the offer accepted, obtain a contract of sale and submit the required paperwork to be eligible for the lottery drawing. 20 homebuyers will be selected to receive the funds. For remote workers interested, it's important to note that the property must also be used as a primary residence. How it works: From April 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025, the Hamilton Community Foundation is taking applications for what is known as a "reverse scholarship." Recent graduates will receive assistance with student loan debt. To be eligible, applicants must have graduated within the last seven years from a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, or Mathematics) program. Additionally, you can't currently reside in the designated areas of the city of Hamilton, but you must have plans to move there. Those interested must demonstrate employment within Butler County or have a full-time remote position. How it works: Applicants must be at least 18 years old and fully employed. Once you become a resident of Alaska, the state will pay you after a year of living there from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. The program is also offering up to three months of free internet. How it works: The city, located approximately 30 miles from Des Moines, is offering $10,000 in cash to individuals seeking to purchase homes valued at more than $240,000. Part of the "Get to Know Newton Welcome Package" also includes getting gifts from local businesses and attending events. Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

Israel-Iran War:

US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities are sharpening the focus on one option Iran has yet to really deploy in the conflict: disrupting regional oil trade, especially through the critical Strait of Hormuz.

Iran has over the years threatened multiple times to shut the strait — a narrow stretch of water through which a fifth of the world's oil supply flows each day. But in practice, Tehran has numerous less-drastic options at its disposal to calibrate a response that hurts its enemies while limiting the impact on allies like China, its biggest oil buyer. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran and struck three key Iranian nuclear sites, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on Sunday on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help it to come to an end, despite the Iranian Foreign Minister's insistence that the country could not return to diplomacy "while under attack." The broader TA-125 index was trading 1.77% higher on Sunday, while the TA-35, Tel Aviv's blue-chip index, was up 1.5%. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul opened Sunday trading nearly half a percent higher before erasing earlier gains and closing down 0.3%. Bahrain, home to the U.S. Central Command, issued a "work from home mandate" on Sunday, urging citizens to "only use main roads when necessary to maintain public safety." "The Gulf has distanced itself and has been calling for appeasement, supporting a peaceful resolution, and has gone as far as condemning Israeli aggression," Fadi Arbid, founding partner and CIO of Amwal Capital Partners, told CNBC. He explained that such rhetoric "has helped the Gulf isolate itself from conflict" and any significant short-term market impact, adding that the net mid-term is positive. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all released statements in the last 24 hours, the UAE urged an immediate halt to escalation to "avoid serious repercussions" in the region, while Saudi Arabia expressed concern and Qatar said it "deplored deterioration" in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Investors will be watching for swings in the oil market when it opens later this evening, and whether Iran intends to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway through which a quarter of the world's oil supply passes. Tanker Trackers, a website that tracks global oil shipments, said that as of 3:40 p.m. UAE time on Sunday, "tanker traffic is still moving in both directions within the Strait of Hormuz," citing AIS data. "Oil prices are likely to open higher, further increasing the geopolitical risk premium," Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS told CNBC on Sunday, adding that oil will maintain a "risk premium for now," and prices will remain volatile in the near term as it is "unclear how the conflict might evolve." Prices fell 2% on Friday, before U.S. President Donald Trump moved to enter the war between Israel and Iran. Brent futures have jumped 11% since Israel's attack on Iran less than two weeks ago, and both Brent and U.S. crude oil have remained volatile since. "Oil markets are likely to take the U.S. attacks as a substantial escalation of the war and price in elevated security of supply risks." Edward Bell, acting chief economist at Emirates NDB, told CNBC. He added that markets remain bound by headlines, not fundamentals and said to expect "big swings" in the coming days. "While there remains no interruption to flows of oil coming out of the Gulf and oil infrastructure has not come under direct attack, markets will still likely price in an elevated geopolitical premium," Bell said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The Houthi threat against shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has also gone up," said Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, which represents global shipowners. "The Houthis now threaten merchant ships with affiliation to Israel or the U.S., but attacks against merchant ships with other affiliations cannot be ruled out." Alert level is high, though, and things might change by the hour." The $4.2 billion cargo facility at Haifa, owned by Adani Group, has been a target of Iranian missiles but has not suffered any damage. Last week, Jugeshinder "Robbie" Singh, CFO of the Adani, debunked misinformation posted that the port was on fire from a strike on Iranian social media. Bimco's Larsen warned Iran could attempt a wider disruption of commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz through attacks on merchant ships. Antiship missiles or drones of both airborne and surface types could be used in these attacks, he said. "The laying of sea mines would constitute another dangerous development, but Iran's intent to do so is questionable due to the risk to Iran-affiliated commercial ships and the risk of environmental disaster in case a ship is damaged," said Larsen. The inability of oil to traverse through the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays. In 2023, oil flows through the waterway averaged 20.9 million barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, accounting for about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption. "Given the Iranian threat to U.S. military bases in the region, availability of warships for protection of commercial shipping is probably limited, especially for commercial ships with no affiliation to the U.S. or Israel," Larsen said. The majority of cargo volumes from those ports are destined for Dubai, which has become a hub for the movement of freight with feeder services in the Persian Gulf, South Asia, and East Africa. Freight intelligence firm Xeneta said average spot rates have increased 55% month-over-month, through Friday. Rates are now $2,761 per forty-foot equivalent unit (FEU), a standard unit for measuring the capacity of container ships and volume of cargo. On the tanker side, spot rates for very large crude carrier (VLCC) voyages between the Middle East and China were up 154% week-over-week, through Thursday. Rates on the long-range tankers' (LR2) Middle East-Japan trade route are up 148% and Middle East-Japan very large gas carrier (VLGC) rates are up 33%. The reason behind the increase in rates includes the added expenses on security measures, higher bunker fuel prices, and fuel costs as vessels use more fuel due to faster sailing through high-risk areas. Marsh McLennan, the world's largest marine insurance broker, noted hull and machinery insurance rates for vessels transiting the Strait of Hormuz have increased by more than 60%. In light of the latest wave of defense measures, Bimco is encouraging shipowners to review their security risk assessments and carefully consider mitigation measures. "Merchant ships in the area should consider reducing their exposure to threats from Iran, for example, by routing away from the Iranian coast," said Larsen. "We also recommend that ships maintain close contact to naval forces in the area through UK Maritime Trade Operations, maintain strong vigilance and increased lookout, report suspicious sightings and events to UKMTO, and increase the resilience of ships to absorb damage by ensuring watertight integrity and readiness of damage control organization including firefighting capability." "Bimco never directly recommends shipowners to completely stay away from a conflict area. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Vance's remarks come soon after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated," following the Trump administration's strikes on facilities at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Vance, speaking on NBC News' "Meet the Press," said the U.S. is "not at war with Iran." "We're at war with Iran's nuclear program," he continued. When asked by NBC News' Kristen Welker how the U.S. would respond to retaliation by Iran, Vance reiterated: "We do not want war with Iran, we actually want peace, but we want peace in the context of them not having a nuclear weapons program, and that's exactly what the president accomplished last night." Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that Iran reserves all options to defend itself following the U.S. attacks. "I'm not going to get into sensitive intelligence about what we've seen on the ground there in Iran, but we've seen a lot, and I feel very confident that we've substantially delayed their development of a nuclear weapon, and that was the goal of this attack," Vance said.

Israel-Iran War:

Damage at the Fordow nuclear facility on June 22 after the US strikes.

The task of ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon might just have got tougher.

President Donald Trump's decision to order US forces to attack three key Iranian nuclear installations may have sabotaged the Islamic Republic's known atomic capabilities, but it's also created a monumental new challenge to work out what's left and where. 

Trump said heavily fortified sites were “totally obliterated” late Saturday, but independent analysis has yet to verify that claim. Rather than yielding a quick win, the strikes have complicated the task of tracking uranium and ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon, according to three people who follow the country's nuclear program.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gen. Dan Caine, the top US general, said Sunday morning that B-2 stealth bombers struck Iranian nuclear sites with over a dozen powerful bunker-busters in a "high-risk, complex" mission called Operation Midnight Hammer. He said that "the order we received from our commander in chief was focused. And it was clear we devastated the Iranian nuclear program." President Donald Trump said in an address to the nation on Saturday evening that the US military had successfully carried out "massive precision strikes" that "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. The direct attack on Iran marks a major escalation and takes US involvement in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel to a new level. "We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan," Trump said in a Truth Social post earlier Saturday announcing the strikes. "All planes are now outside of Iran air space," he said. The president said a "full payload" of bombs was dropped on Fordow, one of Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities. Fordow is heavily fortified, with its key facilities deep underground in a mountain. The weapon is the US military's largest non-nuclear bomb and is considered best suited for striking Iran's deepest nuclear sites. In addition to bunker-busters, Caine said that Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from US submarines were also used against one of the Iranian sites. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement posted on X, thanked Trump for the "bold decision" to strike Iran, saying "the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history." "His leadership today has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace," Netanyahu said. Caine indicated these aircraft were part of a deception tactic. "All planes are safely on their way home," Trump said in his Saturday social media post on the strikes. There is not another military in the World that could have done this." He added that "NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter." Trump signaled in his address that additional attacks against Iran could follow if "peace does not come quickly." The bombing runs come after several days of speculation about whether the US would join Israel in striking Iran. Earlier this month, Israeli officials announced the start of a new operation aimed at degrading Iran's nuclear program, which has long been a goal of Netanyahu's. Over the past week, Israeli fighter jets have carried out far-reaching airstrikes across Iran, targeting its nuclear program, top scientists, senior commanders, air defenses, missile launchers, bases, and other high-profile military infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a press briefing Sunday morning, Gen. Dan Caine, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said US forces fired around 75 precision-guided weapons in total during the operation, which targeted facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. The GBU-57, designed to penetrate hardened bunkers, particularly those located deep underground, is among the heaviest and most powerful non-nuclear bombs in the US arsenal. Here's what we know about them. It is approximately 20.5 feet long and has a diameter of 31.5 inches. The US Air Force says the bomb is designed to target "weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities" and can penetrate up to 200 feet — or roughly two-thirds the height of the Statue of Liberty — below ground before exploding. Iran's Fordow facility is thought to be a key site for Tehran's nuclear enrichment activities, but its location — buried deep under a mountain — means Israel likely lacks the firepower to take it out on its own, according to Heather Williams, a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Multiple hits by a GBU-57, however, could destroy it, she said. President Donald Trump, who said late Saturday that a "full payload" of bombs had been used to strike Fordow, praised US forces for what he called a "very successful attack." Earlier this month, Israel launched an intense air campaign against Iran aimed at degrading its nuclear capabilities. Tehran, which has said its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, has retaliated against Israel with heavy missile and drone strikes. Trump said earlier this week that he was considering US involvement and indicated he'd take two weeks to mull over decisions to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities. He appears to have determined that less time was necessary. The US armed forces have a substantial force presence in the volatile region that the Department of Defense has said is intended to protect and defend American interests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Paris's balmy thirteenth district, an airy rail depot that's been converted into a startup incubator is now the epicenter of France's tech boom. Walking through Station F, it's hard not to see how the 366,000-square-foot space has been influenced by Silicon Valley, with its amenities like a huge cafeteria and an under-construction yoga studio that are reminiscent of Big Tech campuses. But Station F's director, Roxanne Varza, told Business Insider that it is not trying to become an American incubator. But we're not trying to be Silicon Valley," she said. Now, politics is helping drive international founders here, including Americans, Varza told BI during a recent visit. The election of Donald Trump and Brexit were among the biggest catalysts driving international founders to Station F, Varza told BI. After France, the US and UK are the most represented nationalities on campus, which houses entrepreneurs from 70 nationalities, Varza said. But Paris is catching up to its global counterparts. In 2025, technology research platform Dealroom billed the city as Europe's new tech champion, overtaking London's mantle. From 2017 to 2024, the combined enterprise value of startups based in Paris increased 5.3 times, more than any other European tech hub. Materials discovery startup Entalpic, which launched in 2024, has had a flurry of US applicants vying for jobs at the company since the start of the year, its cofounder, Alexandre Duval, told BI. "We have so many resources here: meeting rooms, onboarding, events, opportunities to meet people. The Station F team accepts around 40 startups every month. In addition to access to the incubator's coworking space, startups get resources and mentorship, including from government officials and Big Tech companies, such as Meta and Microsoft, that have offices at Station F. The result is a hubbub of innovators collaborating and ideating all days of the week — a far cry from how some corners of LinkedIn see Europe's tech ecosystem as the butt of the joke for its supposed lax work culture compared to Silicon Valley. Station F has welcomed everyone from the prime minister of Ethiopia to the CEO of Cisco — and the morning I arrive, the CEO of GitHub is scheduled to speak for a Q&A as part of VivaTech, France's flagship tech event that attracted speakers such as Nvidia's Jensen Huang. Like many of its international counterparts, Station F has doubled down on the AI boom. Government initiatives under France's president Emmanuel Macron, as well as generous financing from the country's national bank, Bpifrance, have galvanized the region's AI startups. In 2023, French AI startups raised $1.9 billion, per PitchBook data. In 2024, this figure rose by more than 50% to $2.98 billion. High-profile investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and Lightspeed Ventures have flocked to back prolific AI startups founded in France, such as Mistral, Dust, and Poolside. Open-source AI company Hugging Face, now valued at $4.5 billion, was once incubated in Station F. Now, Varza said, around 40% of France's AI startups are spinning out of the program. "Station F is one of the biggest AI communities in Europe," Varza says. "It's also an entry point for so many tier one investors coming to Europe — and we're seeing more Series A and B rounds too." Beyond helping AI startups raise financing, Station F also participates in regulatory debates about France's tech ecosystem, Varza added. "Right now, the government is talking about how we can fiscally incentivise AI companies and push creation. It was a reflection of how Station F operates: touting collaboration over competition. "We saw incredible things happen when people were working in close spaces," Varza said. She recalled how one startup in the incubator wanted to pivot and copied a neighbouring company's idea. "It's our only copycat story, but they both ended up being pretty successful," she added. Station F is working on initiatives with Japan and the Gulf region, Varza said — but what excites her most is the opportunity to take what they've built in Paris and "build those bridges" internationally across Europe.</p>
