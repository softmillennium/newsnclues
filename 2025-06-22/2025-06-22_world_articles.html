                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has claimed that he took a nuclear weapon “out of [Iran's] hands” with military strikes against its nuclear facilities on Saturday night. “We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the ‘bomb' right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!) but, as usual, and despite all of the praise and accolades received, this ‘lightweight' Congressman is against what was so brilliantly achieved last night,” Mr Trump wrote. Israeli officials on Sunday said they believe Iran's heavily-fortified nuclear site at Fordow sustained serious damage from the strikes but had not been completely destroyed. Virtually every other Republican to comment publicly has backed Mr Trump's intervention, even though his Make American Great Again movement has a strong isolationist streak and wariness of being dragged into foreign wars. On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, claimed Israel was “close” to wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles. “No one... is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.” At Natanz, a “fuel enrichment plant has been hit, with the US confirming it used ground-penetrating munitions.” Several explosions were heard in the northwestern city of Tabriz around 10 pm local time following an Israeli attack, Iranian state media reported. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has arrived in Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin following a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israel is “close” to destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities and stock of ballistic missiles. He vowed not to be dragged into a “war of attrition with Iran”, saying: “When we achieve our objectives, the fighting will stop.” However, senior members of Donald Trump's administration on Sunday issued a more conservative assessment of the damage inflicted on Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said its capabilities had been “degraded” and “set back” but stopped short of saying they had been outright destroyed. Similarly, JD Vance, the US vice president, said last night's strikes on three Iranian facilities had “substantially delayed” Iran's ability to develop of a nuclear weapon “by many, many years”. He knows diplomacy has failed for the last decades, and should thank the US for bringing stability and bringing peace through power.” “You don't have a radical regime which threatens to destroy member states of the UN,” he said, adding: “Today I think we have historic days.” Danny Danon, speaking shortly before an emergency security council meeting: “[Iran] threatens every capital in the West with its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. He warned Tehran: “Under this, any further attacks against our civilians will be met with overpowering, righteous force, unlike your actions against our civilians” Authorities are preparing for a possible attack after Donald Trump bombed Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday morning local time, with security being increased at places of worship in major cities. Police in Washington, DC, New York and other major American cities said they had increased their presence outside places of worship on Sunday following the US air strikes. Donald Trump has lashed out at a Republican congressman who claimed his bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities was unconstitutional. Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president accused Thomas Massie, a representative for Kentucky”, of “grandstanding” and failing to recognise “what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran”. “He's a simple-minded ‘grandstander' who thinks it's good politics for Iran to have the highest level nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘Death to America' at every change they get,” he said, labelling the Republican “weak” and “ineffective”. “Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First, but he doesn't know how to get there - he doesn't have a clue!”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior Democrats have claimed they were left in the dark about operation Midnight Hammer, the US's highly coordinated strike on Saturday on Iran's nuclear enrichment program. Neither Mark Warner, a US senator of Virginia, nor Jim Himes, a representative of Connecticut, both top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence panels, were briefed before the attack, according to reports. But that came amid claims that Republican counterparts were given advance notice of the operation, which involved 125 aircraft – including seven B-2 bombers carrying 14 bunker busters weighing three tons – and 75 Tomahawk missiles launched from US submarines. The president's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, told a press conference early on Sunday that the strikes “took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the president called”. Top lawmakers are typically informed of military operations in advance. “Cost, duration, risk to our troops, strategy – the basics before we make a decision of this consequence,” said Chris Coons, a senior Democratic member of the Senate foreign relations committee, last week. Arizona senator Mark Kelly told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the White House should have been “right up front” in coming to Congress “and asking for authorization to do this”. Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator who sits on the armed services as well as the foreign relations committees, said Congress needed to be informed ahead of time. “Congress needs to authorize a war against Iran,” he said. Senators are expected to receive a briefing on the strikes next week. Trump's use of force could now deepen the ideological schism. Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told CNN on Sunday that “the destruction of these facilities is a positive in the sense that it will set back Iran's program”. But he warned that Iran could now “sprint for a bomb”. He added that the strikes were “not constitutional” and Congress should be brought in “on an action this substantial that could lead to a major outbreak of war”. Prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations have been notably silent on the 10-day war between Israel and Iran. “The beasts of the Democratic party's constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel's war in Gaza that it's really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.” That came as progressive and isolationist lawmakers on the right found themselves uncomfortably aligned. Khanna had introduced legislation with the Kentucky Republican US House member Thomas Massie that called on Trump to “terminate” the use of US armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. Following the strike, Khanna posted on X: “Trump struck Iran without any authorization of Congress.” He introduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran. He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. On NBC's Meet the Press JD Vance, the US vice-president, maintained that it was untrue to say that Saturday's strikes in Iran exceeded Trump's presidential authority. Schiff, meanwhile, declined to support calls for impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying the failure to brief Democrats ahead of the strike was “another partisan exercise”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities are preparing for a possible attack after Donald Trump bombed Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday morning local time, with security being increased at places of worship in major cities. Police in Washington, DC, New York and other major American cities said they had increased their presence outside places of worship on Sunday following the US air strikes. Hezbollah said the US was seeking through the “criminal aggression to achieve what Israel had failed to accomplish and compensate for its disgraceful failure in achieving its goals against Iran's painful and devastating missiles.” The US secretary of state was asked about reports that Iran had removed stockpiles from the Fordow facility ahead of American air strikes last night. “No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran,” Mr Rubio told CBS' “Face the Nation”. Iran still has a stockpile of enriched uranium despite US strikes last night on its nuclear sites, an adviser to its supreme leader has claimed.z “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn't over, enriched materials, indigenous knowledge, political will remain,” said Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Seven Revolutionary Guard members and two conscript soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes on two military centres in central Yazd province this afternoon, Iranian forces announced. “Seven Revolutionary Guard personnel and two conscript soldiers achieved martyrdom, and several others were wounded, with treatment of these dear ones underway,” the unit said. Iranian air defences are targeting Israeli aircraft over central Isfahan province, state media reported. “Isfahan air defence operations against hostile aircraft began an hour ago,” Tasnim news agency said. “Following the detection, identification and tracking of several hostile Israeli aircraft in Isfahan's airspace, air defences immediately activated and are destroying these targets.” “We are not aware of any specific or credible threat to New Yorkers,” Ms Hochul said in a statement. “However, given New York's distinctive global profile, we are taking this situation extraordinarily seriously.” The Department of Homeland Security has warned the US was facing a “heightened threat environment” and could face attacks or cyberattacks by Iran. “The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilising to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence,” it said on Sunday. Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have urged Iran to return to the negotiating table following US air strikes last night. We affirm our support for the security of Israel.We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security. Earlier today, the United States has conducted targeted military strikes against nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those bombs were widely seen as the best chance of damaging or destroying Fordo, built deep into a mountain and untouched during Israel's week-long offensive. In all, the U.S. hit three nuclear sites and Caine told reporters Sunday that “initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage.” The mission could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program and dragging the U.S. into another Mideast war. “Bunker buster” is a broad term used to describe bombs that are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding. The roughly 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) precision-guided bomb is designed to attack deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels, according to the U.S. Air Force. It's believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast. It was not immediately known how many were used in the Sunday morning strike. Initial assessments by the IAEA, however, were that this had not happened. Fordo is Iran's second nuclear enrichment facility after Natanz, its main facility, which already has been targeted by Israeli air strikes and was also hit by the U.S. on Sunday, along with Isfahan. Construction is believed to have started around 2006 and it became first operational in 2009 — the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence. Analysis: Israel eyes the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions In addition to being an estimated 80 meters (260 feet) under rock and soil, the site is reportedly protected by Iranian and Russian surface-to-air missile systems. Those air defences, however, likely have already been struck in the Israeli campaign, which claims to have knocked out most of Iran's air defences and the U.S. bombers were not fired upon during their mission. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal of attacking Iran was to eliminate its missile and nuclear program, which he described as an existential threat to Israel, and officials have said Fordo was part of that plan. “This entire operation ... really has to be completed with the elimination of Fordo,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News. A satellite image shows Iran's underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordow following U.S. airstrikes targeting the facility. The strategic long-range heavy bomber has a range of about 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometres) without refuelling and 11,500 miles (18,500 kilometres) with one refuelling, and can reach any point in the world within hours, according to Northrop Grumman. The mission against Iran was flown from its home base in Missouri. Whether the U.S. would get involved had been unclear in recent days. At the G7 meeting in Canada, Trump was asked what it would take for Washington to become involved militarily and he said: “I don't want to talk about that.” In the end, it took just two days to decide. Sunday's attack was specifically restricted to the three nuclear sites, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US defense secretary praises Trump at first news briefing but Pentagon says it is too early for full damage assessment The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, on Sunday repeated claims by Donald Trump that US strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities and its ability to acquire nuclear weapons even as the Pentagon acknowledged it was too early to provide a full damage assessment. The remarks from Hegseth in particular amounted to repeated praise for Trump and the operation that targeted the nuclear enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow, the key facility buried deep underground, and a third site at Esfahan where Iran was seen to store enriched uranium. “Thanks to President Trump's bold and visionary leadership and his commitment to peace through strength, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated,” Hegseth said. The main contingent involved seven B-2 bombers flying for 18 nonstop hours into Iranian airspace, refueling multiple times in the air, while unidentified fighter jets swept ahead of the group for possible Iranian fighter jets and surface-to-air missile threats over the nuclear sites. Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added. Neither Hegseth nor Caine provided details beyond their initial assessment that it had been “obliterated”. Following Trump's remarks in a televised address from the White House on Saturday night that the US could launch more attacks on Iran unless they started peace talks, Hegseth said the administration was in contact with the country's leadership through public and private channels. “I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that planes flew from the middle of America and Missouri overnight, completely undetected over three of their most highly sensitive sites,” Hegseth added. “We believe that will have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future.” Hegseth also said at the news conference that congressional leaders were notified about the strikes after the bombers left Iranian airspace – a decision that is sure to draw criticism from Democrats that Trump engaged in a conflict without the authorization of Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billions of dollars for ICE and border patrol in Trump's budget bill would supercharge the chaotic crackdown. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Polls show the so-called “big, beautiful” budget bill championed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress is becoming deeply unpopular as more people learn about the deadly consequences of proposals to slash the health care safety net. However, the legislation's massive investment in Trump's mass deportation campaign has received far less attention from Democrats and critics, including billions of dollars to deploy 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents nationwide. The GOP budget bill's $75 billion in supplemental funding for ICE is now under increasing scrutiny as reports and viral images emerge of protests against indiscriminate immigration raids and the violent arrests of U.S. citizens by masked and heavily armed federal officers. Trump has made it clear that he is intentionally using ICE to terrorize blue cities with Democratic mayors and large immigrant communities. Videos of masked ICE agents arresting protesters outside an immigration court went viral earlier this week. In suburban Long Island, New York, an ICE agent got into a car crash last week after residents confronted a dozen or so masked and armed agents outside an elementary school, The Intercept reported. In Vermont, residents are demanding the release of a migrant justice organizer and his teenage daughter after ICE agents smashed their car window in order to make arrests. Trump has made it clear that he is intentionally using ICE to terrorize blue cities with Democratic mayors and large immigrant communities. Adrian Martinez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen working at a Walmart outside of Los Angeles, was tackled and arrested by multiple U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents conducting sweeps in the area. Video shows Martinez push a trash bin in front of a border patrol truck before more vehicles pull up and armed agents surround him. Prosecutors claim Martinez punched an officer in the face, but security camera footage does not show Martinez throwing a punch before he is tackled. Martinez remained in jail facing serious federal charges as of June 20. How are they going to press charges when they were the ones doing that to him?” said Myra Villareal, Martinez's mother, in an interview with NBC Los Angeles. After millions of people marched against Trump ahead of the extravagant military parade he planned for his birthday on June 14, the president ordered federal law enforcement to double down on deportation operations in blue cities such as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, suggesting he sees mass deportation as a tool for targeting political opponents with federal police. Indeed, at least five elected officials — mostly Democrats — have been roughed up and arrested while attempting to defend their constituents or hold the Trump administration accountable. Earlier this week, New York comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by multiple masked ICE agents when escorting a man at an immigration court. As Trump ordered a peacetime deployment of the military to Los Angeles ahead of his audacious birthday last week, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) was tackled and handcuffed when attempting to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference in a local federal building. A Wisconsin judge as well as a New Jersey mayor and congresswoman have also been arrested and are fighting charges that Democrats say are bogus, authoritarian attempts to quash dissent. Even as critics slam the administration for ignoring due process, separating parents from schoolchildren, and invading communities with squads of federal officers, Trump's officials consistently responded by threatening that anyone who interferes with ICE will be arrested on federal charges. The agency is already $1 billion over budget and will likely violate federal law if spending continues apace, according to Axios. The cash crunch is fueled by hardliners such as Stephen Miller, Trump's anti-immigrant adviser, who have demanded that ICE arrest 3,000 people per day to achieve deportation goals. The quota is a major reason why ICE is sparking outrage and terror through its apprehension of law-abiding immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years when they show up for immigration court dates and check-ins. The GOP budget bill's proposal for slashing Medicaid health coverage for lower-income and disabled people is becoming increasingly unpopular, and Trump's immigration crackdown is rapidly losing public support as well. Both Trump's approval on the issue and support for ICE is slipping. If the bill's massive funding increase for immigration policing agencies hits the headlines while they are actively clashing with U.S. communities, Republicans may soon be facing an uphill battle for public opinion with midterms looming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites could push oil prices even higher and trigger a knee-jerk rush to safety, investors said, as they assessed how the latest escalation of tensions would ripple through the global economy. Iran said it reserves all options to defend itself, and warned of “everlasting consequences.” Speaking in Istanbul, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran was weighing its options for retaliation and would consider diplomacy only after carrying out its response. Investors said they expected U.S. involvement would cause a stock market selloff and a possible bid for the dollar and other safe-haven assets when major markets reopen, but also said much uncertainty remained. “I think the markets are going to be initially alarmed, and I think oil will open higher,” said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital. “We don't have any damage assessment and that will take some time. Even though (Trump) has described this as ‘done', we're engaged,” Spindel said. It's going to raise uncertainty and volatility, particularly in oil,” he added. Most Gulf stock markets, however, seemed unconcerned by the early morning attacks, with the main indexes in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait up slightly or flat. Israel's Tel Aviv main index was at an all-time high. Rising inflation could dampen consumer confidence and lessen the chance of near-term interest rate cuts. Saul Kavonic, a senior energy analyst at equity research firm MST Marquee in Sydney, said Iran could respond by targeting American interests in the Middle East, including Gulf oil infrastructure in places such as Iraq or harassing ship passages through the Strait of Hormuz. “Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path towards $100 oil if Iran respond as they have previously threatened to,” Kavonic said. While global benchmark Brent crude futures have risen as much as 18% since June 10, hitting a near five-month high of $79.04 on Thursday, the S&P 500 has been little changed, following an initial drop when Israel launched its attacks on Iran on June 13. Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said oil prices would likely spike before leveling off in a few days as the attacks could lead Iran to seek a peace deal with Israel and the United States. Still, any pullback in equities might be fleeting, history suggests. That would signal yields going lower and the dollar getting stronger,” said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at IBKR in Greenwich, Connecticut. “It's hard to imagine stocks not reacting negatively and the question is how much.” Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for global fixed income at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia, said it was uncertain whether U.S. Treasuries would rally after the U.S. attack, largely due to the market's hypersensitivity to inflation. “This could lead to regime change (which) ultimately could have a much bigger impact on the global economy if Iran shifts towards a more friendly, open economic regime,” said McIntyre.Crude had settled down on Friday after the U.S. imposed fresh Iran-related sanctions, including on two entities based in Hong Kong, and counter-terrorism-related sanctions, according to a notice on the U.S. Treasury Department website. Brent has risen 11% while WTI has gained around 10% since the conflict began on June 13 with Israel targeting Iran's nuclear sites and Iranian missiles hitting buildings in Tel Aviv. Currently stable supply conditions and the availability of spare production capacity among other OPEC members have limited oil's gains. Risk premiums have typically faded when no supply disruptions occurred, said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS. A senior Iranian lawmaker said on June 19 that the country could shut the Strait of Hormuz as a way of hitting back against its enemies, though a second member of parliament said this would only happen if Tehran's vital interests were endangered. SEB said any closure of the strait or spillover into other regional producers would “significantly lift” oil prices, but they saw this scenario as a tail risk rather than a base case given China's reliance on Gulf crude. Ajay Parmar, oil and energy transition analytics director at consultancy ICIS, said it was unlikely Iran would be able to enforce a blockage of the strait for too long. “Most of Iran's oil exports to China pass through this strait and Trump is unlikely to tolerate the inevitable subsequent oil price spike for too long - the diplomatic pressure from the world's two largest economies would also be significant,” he said.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that he plans to travel to Russia on June 22 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

The statement was made during Araghchi's press conference in Istanbul on June 22, according to Associated Press.

"We enjoy a strategic partnership and we always consult with each other and coordinate our positions," Araghchi said with reference to Russia.

Araghchi also said that there is "no red line" that the U.S. has not crossed in its recent actions against Iran.

Earlier that day, Russia condemned the U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them a violation of international law and Iran's sovereignty, a statement in stark contrast to Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry urged a response from the U.N. Security Council, saying that "the confrontational actions of the U.S. and Israel must be collectively rejected."

Tehran provides Moscow with ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed attack drones for its war against Ukraine as part of Russia and Iran's close strategic partnership.

Russia and Iran have cooperated to develop their own nuclear programs as both countries face Western sanctions. Russia supplied Iran with the Middle East's first nuclear power plant despite objections from the West.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow condemned on June 22 the recent U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them a violation of international law and Iran's sovereignty, a statement in stark contrast to Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on June 21 that the U.S. air strikes targeted three nuclear sites in Iran, Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, joining Israel's campaign against Iran's nuclear program amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East. The ministry also warned of possible radiological consequences, despite Moscow's own record of repeatedly placing nuclear facilities at risk during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and threatening to use nuclear weapons. Russia and Iran are close strategic partners, with Tehran providing Moscow with ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed attack drones for its war against Ukraine. Moscow has diplomatically backed Iran after Israel launched the initial air strikes against Iranian military and nuclear targets on June 13, an operation that sparked further waves of aerial attacks from both sides. Israel has increasingly warned that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon, an assertion backed by Trump despite U.S. intelligence previously disputing the claim. Tehran has rejected having a nuclear weapons program. Though Trump announced a complete "obliteration" of Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities in the recent attacks, the scale of damage is not immediately clear. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump for the operation, saying, "First comes strength, then comes peace. In turn, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that the U.S. "has committed a grave violation of the U.N. Charter, international law and the NPT by attacking Iran's peaceful nuclear installations." Washington's European partners have issued cautious responses to the U.S. attacks, calling for a diplomatic resolution while affirming that Iran's nuclear program is a danger to international security. "Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, as it would be a threat to international security," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bill sharpens the GOP's long-standing tension between a political strategy that increasingly relies on financially squeezed working-class voters and an economic agenda that still funnels its greatest direct benefits to the affluent. More than any other single factor, Democrats are counting on a voter backlash against the budget bill — which passed the House earlier this month and is moving toward a floor vote maybe as soon as this week in the Senate — to power them to gains in the 2026 midterm elections. “It's a powerful thing to be able to say they are cutting Medicaid and people's health care, popular programs, to fund a tax cut for the wealthiest people,” said Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster. Related article How Trump's megabill transfers wealth in the US Congressional Republicans are already trying to build defenses against that argument. Since the Ronald Reagan era, Republicans also have consistently shown that they can neutralize Democratic economic appeals to White blue-collar voters by painting the party as excessively liberal on cultural issues such as crime, immigration and LGBTQ rights. Yet the magnitude of what Republicans are attempting with this single bill will test that record. Simultaneously, according to nonpartisan analyses, the bill could strip health insurance from at least 16 million Americans and significantly cut food assistance — while also providing tax cuts worth over $100,000 annually to the top 0.1% of earners. An early skirmish between Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska and a liberal advocacy group is previewing how the debate may play out next year over what Republicans, adopting President Trump's terminology, are calling their “One Big Beautiful Bill.” “He's actually cutting Medicaid so he can give tax breaks to big corporations and billionaires,” an Omaha woman identified as Audrey declares in the television ad. The argument that Republicans are taking health care from people who need it to fund tax cuts for people who don't is likely to be central in Democratic House and Senate campaigns next year. “It is key that both House and Senate Democrats continue to implement this message as far and wide as possible,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote in a strategy memo released earlier this month. Bacon, one of just three House Republicans left in districts that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, has previewed the likely GOP response to those arguments in his pushback against the advocacy group's ads. “We expect if you're an able-bodied adult without children that you should be seeking a job or getting the skills to get another job or as a minimum, volunteering 20 hours a week,” Bacon said in a press call with local reporters earlier this month. But in choosing to pair the tax and spending cuts, the GOP conspicuously departed from its strategy for the tax cuts it passed under Presidents George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 and Trump in 2017. But by choosing to cut taxes and programs simultaneously, Republicans this year have eliminated any conjecture, allowing analysts to assess the plan's combined impact on families at different points on the income scale. Those analyses have returned a consistent verdict on the bill's winners and losers. Middle-to upper middle-class families, both analyses found, would see relatively small net benefits. Kogan said that no previous legislation careened to such extremes on both ends. When congressional Republicans previously married tax and spending cuts into a single bill did not end well for them. In that 1995 confrontation, Clinton won the battle for public opinion, reviving his foundering presidency and propelling him toward an easy reelection in 1996. Clinton prevailed by stressing the argument Democrats are echoing today: Republicans are cutting programs that benefit average Americans to fund tax cuts for the rich. As in 1995, the GOP budget plan is facing widespread public skepticism. Substantially more Americans said they opposed than supported the bill in recent national polls by the non-partisan Pew Research Center and KFF thinktank, as well as in Washington Post/Ipsos, Fox News, and Quinnipiac University surveys. Both of those pillars stand on shaky ground with the public. Compared with that era, Republicans today are much more reliant on working-class voters without a four-year degree — not only the white voters in that category, but also increasingly the blue-collar minorities who provided Trump's most important gains in the 2024 election. That means many more GOP voters than in Gingrich's time rely on federal safety net programs. Looking at people who have purchased health care through the ACA, KFF found that more identify as Republicans than Democrats. Medicaid funding is especially critical to hospitals in rural areas, which now vote overwhelmingly Republican. “The GOP coalition is dramatically different today than it was 10 years ago,” Ayres said. Republicans may face particular vulnerability among the newest addition to their coalition: working-class minority voters without a college degree. In the KFF poll, over four-fifths of minorities without a college degree said Medicaid was very important to their community and nearly three-fifths said it was very important to their own families — far more than the share of non-college Whites who said the same. In both the KFF and Pew surveys, more than three times as many of those blue-collar minorities said they expected the bill to hurt than to help them. Against all these headwinds, Republicans have some potentially potent responses. The White House has reportedly shared private polling with congressional Republicans showing support for the bill's measures to end taxes on tips and overtime, and is also urging them to stress the plan's provisions punishing states that provide Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. In the KFF poll, two-thirds of Americans backed a work requirement for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, another central component of the GOP plan. Most voters were likewise receptive to the GOP case that reducing Medicaid spending on those adults would save money for the elderly, low-income children and people with disabilities. Jason Cabel Roe, a Michigan-based Republican consultant, believes that it would have been better for the party to split the tax and spending cuts into separate bills, partly to make it harder for Democrats to link the two. But Roe believes public concern about the federal deficit and debt gives Republicans more leeway than Democrats believe to cut government programs — as long as the targets look justified. “Our argument is we are going to get people off the dole who don't belong there … and if we are able to find the savings through that strategy, I think we can weather this line of attack from Democrats,” he said. “If there are real stories of people losing their Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans benefits, then we have a problem .” Yet as KFF President Drew Altman wrote last week, the KFF poll also found that many voters were moved by Democratic counter-arguments, such as pointing out that most Medicaid recipients are already working, disabled, or caring for a family member. As Tanden pointed out, voters react to changes in health care policy more viscerally than most issues — a dynamic that has previously burned both parties. “They are playing with live bombs here,” Tanden said.</p>

“Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor [of terrorism]. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” Trump announced.</p>

WASHINGTON, June 22. /TASS/. The US Air Force has conducted a successful attack on three Iranian nuclear facilities, and all aircraft have returned to airbases, US President Donald Trump reported on Truth Social.

"We have completed our very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran's space," the US leader wrote. "All planes are safely on their way home," he added.

According to Reuters, the attack involved B-2 strategic bombers previously redeployed to Guam, a US overseas territory in the Pacific. These aircraft are capable of carrying GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, which are specifically designed to penetrate heavily fortified underground targets.

Experts believe that this type of munition could be used in the strike on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, which lies buried approximately 90 meters below the surface.</p>

Iran reserves “all options” to respond to U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities on Saturday night, said Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Sunday morning.

He said Iran now “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people” in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities overnight from June 21 to 22 was a highly intricate plan that entailed more than 125 U.S. aircraft and warships and layers of deception, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a Pentagon press briefing.

Dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, Hegseth said preparation for the mission took place over the course of weeks and months, “So that we could be ready when the president of the United States called.”

The U.S. strikes were made a week after Israel launched a series of surprise airstrikes across Iran, aimed at degrading the country's nuclear programs and military capabilities.</p>
