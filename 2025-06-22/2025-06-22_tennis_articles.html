                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everyone in West Kensington was geared towards a mouth-watering showdown between Alcaraz and home hero Jack Draper, but that was scuppered by the British No.1 losing to the Czech star. Just 48 hours before she was due to play at Eastbourne, Raducanu's presence followed confirmation that she'll team up with Alcaraz for the mixed doubles at the US Open later this year. The Spaniard will be back on court at 2pm today. Meanwhile, Wimbledon organisers have been dealt another blow ahead of the event at SW19, which gets underway on June 30. You can check out at any time. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. He said afterwards: “It's tough to speak. I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer. "I promised my coach that I would stay there and keep practising, and after Wimbledon we will make a decision about whether I need to take a couple of months off before trying to come back. Dan Evans has accused rivals of being too excuse-happy. The British star, never one for mincing his words, has urged tennis stars to just shake their opponent's hand and accept they were better. Evans said: “I'm fed up with sportspeople when they lose, there's an issue. Just f****** shake the guy's hand and say, ‘Well done'. “This day and age, somebody's never better than us. It's always, you know, if we're tired or... Just be a sportsman, be a sportswoman, shake their hand, [say] 'fair play', and let's go. Don't need to know what's happened.” Jacob Fearnley has defended Jack Draper over his outburst at Queen's. During his defeat against Jiri Lehecka on Saturday, Draper slammed his racket into the advertising hoardings in a fit of rage. But British rival Fearnley has now said: “Obviously the players are under a lot of pressure and I'm sure Jack is feeling some pressure, but I think that more has something to do with the fact that he was so close to winning. “He was 5-5 in the third, and he obviously really wants to do well in front of the British fans and he got broken in a pretty crucial moment and Jiri was serving really good, so he probably thought that it was over. Not necessarily to do with all the pressure of playing at home. Carlos Alcaraz is heading into Wimbledon in excellent form. With Wimbledon qualifiers getting underway tomorrow, plans are in full flow ahead of the first round. Jiri Lehecka is 25th in the live rankings after a successful week at Queen's. He said on court after losing against Carlos Alcaraz: "It's tough for me to find some words now but I'm happy I had a chance to fight for the title today. "Congratulations to Carlos and your team for doing a great job as always. "Unfortunately it just wasn't enough from me today. I'm happy to lift this trophy once again. Carlos Alcaraz is the Queen's champion after a much less gruelling third set. He broke twice against the excellent Jiri Lehecka and wins 7-5 6-7 6-2. We'll have all the best reaction up next... It's a big early break for Alcaraz, with Lehecka's serve causing him problems throughout this match. Alcaraz now leads 3-1 and is serving to go 4-1 ahead. Some fantastic serving from Jiri Lehecka means it's all square in the Andy Murray Arena. Alcaraz is serving with Lehecka leading the second set 6-5. Jiri Lehecka's serving is a major weapon - but Alcaraz's own serves have been excellent. Both have exchanged games in the second set, with Alcaraz about to serve at 2-3. A tight first set goes the way of Carlos Alcaraz! Alcaraz then serves it out and is half way to his second Queen's title. Will Lehecka or Alcaraz be crowned the King of Queen's? We are now just an hour away from the final at Queen's, Carlos Alcaraz v Jiri Lehecka. Tennis fans can watch live free-to-air coverage of the clash, staring at 2:05pm on BBC One. Carlos Alcaraz has raised eyebrows by stating he'd like to kill Novak Djokovic for beating him in the Olympic Games gold medal match last summer. The 22-year-old this week sat down with comedian Josh Berry to talk tennis. He was put on the spot by his host when asked his choices in a game of ‘kiss, marry, kill', with the choices Djokovic, Rafa Nadal, or roger Federer. A hesitant Alcaraz laughed before saying: "I'd kill Novak. For winning that final of the Olympic Games. China's Wang Xinyu is emerging as Wimbledon contender after making her first ever WTA Tour singles final at the Berlin Open. 20 Liudmila Samsonova 6-4 6-1 on Saturday and will play 2023 champion at SW19 Marketa Vondrousova in today's final. “Normally, a Sinner-Alcaraz final would be expected, but we're talking about a particular Slam, there are always some surprises,” he told Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport. “If you find a[Ben Shelton or another great hitter on the day, important heads can fall. Grass is a treacherous surface, where the match can quickly get out of hand.” Bublik, who stunned Jannik Sinner in the second round in Germany, booked his place with a 4-6 7-5 (7-5) 6-4 win over Karen Khachanov. Carlos Alcaraz has admitted he always tried to follow Emma Raducanu's matches after the British star watched him plat at Queen's yesterday. Asked whether he would return the favour and attend one of her games, he replied: "Well, it depends on the schedule, obviously. So watching her in real could be fun." Cassper Ruud has become the latest seed to withdraw from Wimbledon. 16 star has been struggling with a knee injury since the French Open, and recently pulled out of a tournament in Mallorca. "He's back on court, but it looks like playing best-of-five sets is a bit too soon," said his manager, Tina Falster. World No.15 Arthur Fils, Sebastian Korda, Zhizhen Zhang and Nick Kyrgios are among the big names already out. Before attention turns to SW19, all eyes will be on Carlos Alcaraz today as the top seed faces Jiri Lehecka in the final at Queen's. You don't have to go anywhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz earned Halle revenge on Sunday. Last time was okay, but not two in a row to be honest!” Krawietz said during the trophy ceremony. The two star teams are now tied at 3-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Krawietz and Puetz saved all three break points they faced according to Infosys ATP Stats to earn their fourth ATP Tour title as a team and their third in Germany. Thanks for letting us win once here in Germany!” Puetz joked to Bolelli and Vavassori during the trophy ceremony. I think you're one of our favourite practice partners. You have a great team around you, very nice everyone, so best of luck for the rest of the season and hopefully we can see each other in Turin.” Krawietz and Puetz are in seventh place in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, while Bolelli and Vavassori are sixth. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool clinched their second ATP 500 of the season on Sunday when they defeated Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus 6-3, 6-7(5), 10-6 in the final of the HSBC Championships. The Britons rode their home support to victory at Queen's Club. "Out here today [there were] some tight moments and they got loud when it got to the end there," Cash said. "And it really helped us get across the line." Cash and Glasspool have now earned three ATP Tour titles this season, adding to their triumphs in Brisbane and Doha. They are fourth in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. We served really well and upper our level when it mattered."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Markéta Vondroušová has landed her first WTA title since Wimbledon in 2023, taking home the Berlin Open with a three-set victory over Wang Xinyu. Both players held their own respective droughts they wished to wipe clean in the searing Berlin heat. Vondroušová, having been plagued with injury since her triumph two years ago at the All England Club, her left shoulder clad with tape, looked to put a definitive end to a 24-month period which threatened to curtail her career. Wang, meanwhile, was playing in her maiden WTA final. 2 found an advantage for 4-3, overturning three game points to force a deuce and a break of her opponent's left-swinging serve. It looked to be a foothold Wang would retain as she served for the set. It was to be the first occasion in which Vondroušová benefitted from her counterpart seemingly seizing up in the decisive moments of the first set, claiming an important break from 30-0 behind. Suddenly, serving advantage evaporated in the scorching German sun. The 23-year-old exhibited multiple unforced errors from advantageous positions. First, a glorious backhand opportunity which sat just on top of the net with the court at her mercy. She looked to be halfway towards a maiden WTA title when she gave herself four set-point opportunities in the tie-break. Vondroušová, though, won all four points to level the tiebreak. While Wang put up a creditable defence, saving two set points before going on to establish two of her own, she eventually crumbled with Vondroušová claiming a decisive mini-break for 10-12. But she immediately returned the favour, and the match finally seemed to find some stability with both sides holding their serve until Wang, 5-4 up, found her opportunity to restore parity. An almost routine break to 15 showcased a sort of confidence which had eluded her in the opener, pushing the match to a decider. From there, Vondroušová's first title in two years seemed a foregone conclusion, and claiming the match with a hold to love showed the superiority with which she dispatched the decider. But battling past Madison Keys, Ons Jabeur and world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in her Berlin run suggests she may finally be back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bublik had lost his previous six meetings against Russian Medvedev, winning only one set in the process, but produced a superb exhibition of grass-court tennis to end that streak. Former world number one Medvedev has now lost his last six Tour-level finals. So often the showman, Bublik, showed his new maturity with a calm display in the final as he continued the form that saw him beat world number one Jannik Sinner in the last 16 this week. The 27-year-old broke the Medvedev serve in the eighth game of the first set and then held his own with ease to move ahead during an incredible 12-point winning streak. Medvedev had a set point when Bublik served at 4-5 in the second set, but could do nothing as his wily opponent feathered a delicate drop shot from behind the baseline. Third seed Medvedev then led 4-1 in the tiebreaker, but the unseeded Bublik stormed back to complete a memorable week and repeat his 2023 title run on the German grass. "I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer," said Bublik, who was outside the top 75 as recently as last month but will rise to 30 on Monday. "I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon because I was not enjoying it anymore. He's a super tough player to play, especially with my style, and today everything clicked in mentally and physically. Catch up on all the results from Halle here.</p>

The match lasted a prolonged two hours and 25 minutes, and after losing the tight contest, the Kazakh was in no mood to linger for any post-match pleasantries. She quickly slapped Sakkari's hand for a handshake, and avoided eye contact, before walking towards her chair.Sakkari, currently ranked No. 86, appeared to take exception to that, and a heated post-match scene ensued.Though it was unclear what the Greek said in response to the handshake in the initial moments, Putintseva's answer was obvious: a sarcastic bow in Sakkari's direction. "Just be like a human being," the former world No. Fireworks came after Maria Sakkari defeated Yulia Putintseva, 7-5, 7-6(6), for just her third Top 30 win in what's been a trying season for the Greek.

"I don't think she's going to invite me for dinner for the rest of our lives, but I don't care, to be honest," Sakkari said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz has continued to impress as Wimbledon approaches, having just clinched his 250th ATP Tour win. Sinner wants to rest before Wimbledon after his shock exit from Halle, where he fell to Alexander Bublik in the round of 16. Alcaraz meanwhile is into the final at Queen's, with the Spanish top seed coming up against Jiri Lehecka in London. The ATP number two defeated fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4, and in doing so clinched his 250th tour-level win.

Alcaraz is rapidly emulating many legends of the game, and he doesn't look like slowing down anytime soon. Very worryingly for his fellow ATP players, he now finds himself on a 17-match winning streak, and just reached a fifth consecutive final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, despite their youth, already have a rivalry destined to be written in the history books. However, it's worth remembering where this rivalry began on the ATP tour: ironically, in Paris. There was much excitement heading into this clash, between two teenagers who many were predicting would soon rise to the very top. By this point, Carlos Alcaraz had already won his first ATP-level event in Umag, and reached the fourth round of the US Open. Jannik Sinner, meanwhile, seemed slightly ahead of schedule, winning four titles and reaching the final of a Masters 1000 event in Miami during that year. It was a match-up that many had been waiting for, and it certainly delivered, with the younger of the two coming out on top in a fiercely contested straight-sets victory. He leaned over to state: ‘I hope we play some more.' It's fair to say that, not only have they played each other a fair amount since, but the quality has only increased. That being said, Pat Cash wondered about how Sinner might react to his French Open final loss, given how harshly he took defeats of that magnitude during his career. Last month's blockbuster Roland Garros final marked their 11th meeting since that match in Paris, with each meeting arguably ramping up in intensity, stakes and excitement. They are both on track to enjoy careers good enough to one day be considered alongside the likes of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. And, given their ongoing domination of the ATP tour, that could happen sooner than we think. Carlos Alcaraz & Jannik Sinner have won the last 6 Grand Slams. Between them, they have shared the last six Grand Slam titles, and seem set to meet again in the Wimbledon final too. Alcaraz has five major titles, and Sinner has three, and both have two of their favourite Grand Slams coming up in the next few months too. They truly seem set to maintain a stranglehold on the sport for decades, and will likely share many more legendary battles too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's fine form continued with a victory over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday, sealing his place in a second Queen's Club Championship final. And, regardless of whether he beats Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final, the Spaniard has already achieved another significant career milestone. Here, we look at the seven tennis greats who achieved 250 match wins in the fewest number of matches. Wilander and Lendl were two of the leading players of the 1980s and among each other's biggest rivals, meaning there is a sense of symmetry regarding their place on this list. Becker famously won the first of his six Grand Slam titles at the age of 17, triumphing at Wimbledon in 1985, meaning it is no surprise to learn that he amassed 250 tour wins so quickly. One of the most successful players of all time, ‘King of Clay' Nadal dominated on the dirt across his career, though the 22-time Grand Slam champion also found huge success on hard and grass courts. Carlos Alcaraz becomes third fastest man to achieve stellar feat as he reaches Queen's Club final Carlos Alcaraz advocates for drastic rule change after being warned during Queen's match It is impossible to tell if Alcaraz can match some of the milestones set by his tennis idol Nadal, though the world No 2 has moved ahead of his compatriot in these standings. Alcaraz sealed his 250th win at Queen's on Saturday with victory over Bautista Agut, taking just 311 matches to achieve that – two less than Nadal, and a feat only beaten by two fellow tennis greats. An eight-time Grand Slam singles champion and one of the most dominant world No 1's in ATP Tour history, Connors won 109 singles titles in the Open Era – the most of any man. It is therefore unsurprising to see that Connors quickly recorded 250 tour-level wins across his career, with the American ace losing just 60 matches before his milestone tour victory. The Spaniard won his second Queen's title having been successful in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner recently received a special message from American actor and film producer Brad Pitt. Pitt expressed his admiration for Sinner while promoting his upcoming film, F1 The Movie, which will be released in America on Jun. Sinner began his professional tennis career in 2018, shortly after turning 17. In his brief career, he has won three Grand Slam singles titles: two Australian Opens (2024 and 2025) and one US Open title in 2024. He has also secured 19 singles titles on the ATP Tour, including four ATP Masters 1000 titles. Pitt, along with his co-stars Damson Idris and Kerry Condon, has been promoting their film, F1 The Movie, worldwide. During a recent interview with Nicoletta Manzione on the Italian program TG1, Pitt took a moment to say “hello” to Sinner and praise him as “amazing.” #BradPitt al Tg1 per il lancio del suo attesissimo film sulla #FormulaUno, realizzato durante il campionato del mondo. L'intervista della nostra corrispondente da Londra.#Tg1 Nicoletta Manzione pic.twitter.com/GR00axSR7j On the tennis side of things, Sinner has participated in only four tournaments thus far in the season. This win marked his second Melbourne Major title and his third Grand Slam title overall. He defeated the likes of Arthur Rinderknech, Richard Gasquet, Jiří Lehečka, and Andrey Rublev in the first four rounds. Sinner faced Alcaraz once again in the championship match and lost to him, finishing as the runner-up. Sinner then began his grass court season at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle. Following the conclusion of his campaign at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Sinner will compete next at the Wimbledon Championships, which will take place from Jun. 13, 2025, at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London. He won his first-round match against Yannick Hanfmann with a score of 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. In the second round, he overcame compatriot Matteo Berrettini, winning 7-6(3), 7-6(4), 2-6, 7-6(4). 1 then triumphed over Miomir Kecmanović 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 and defeated Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4, 7-6(9) in the third and fourth rounds, respectively, to advance to the quarterfinals. Here, he fell to Daniil Medvedev, losing 7-6(7), 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-2, 3-6. He was the eighth seed at the tournament and won his matches against Juan Manuel Cerúndolo 6-2, 6-2, 6-2; Diego Schwartzman 7-5, 6-1, 6-2; Quentin Halys 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4; and Daniel Elahi Galán 7-6(4), 6-4, 6-3 in the first four rounds. In the quarterfinals, Sinner registered a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Roman Safiullin before falling 3-6, 4-6, 6-7(4) to eventual runner-up Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz has expressed his delight at having Emma Raducanu in the stands to support him after reaching the HSBC Championship final. Alcaraz, 22, overcame fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 to reach the final at Queens. He will face big serving Czechian Jiri Lehecka on Sunday afternoon at the Andy Murray arena, where a victory would give him the perfect momentum heading into his Wimbledon title defence. The Spaniard had many fans in the crowd cheering him on, including a particularly illustrious one in Raducanu. A strong friendship is forming between the pair, who recently signed up to play mixed doubles at the US Open together. The stylish duo, who have both clinched US Open titles, have been dubbed "Alcaranu" by fans. Raducanu was spotted cheering from the Queen's Club balcony alongside Myah Petchey – the daughter of her coach Mark Petchey – as Alcaraz secured victory over Bautista Agut. Following his 17th win on the trot, Alcaraz said: "I saw on social media she came up to watch my match. Yeah, I think it was great having her in the stands." Raducanu is set to compete at the Lexus Eastbourne Open next week, which serves as her last tournament before Wimbledon kicks off. Alcaraz suggested he will do all he can to return the favour and watch Raducanu in action. He said: "It depends on the schedule, obviously. Going further with his promise to Raducanu, he said: "Yeah, I would love to, yeah, if I have time, if I'm at the club or I don't have anything else to do, yeah, I would love to come and watch her. So watching her for real could be fun." Referencing their future venture in doubles, Alcaraz said: "I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. "I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. She took a while to respond. But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. "I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. The Spaniard is currently enjoying an 18-match winning streak and is gunning for his fifth straight final. Expressing his love for Queens, Alcaraz added: "It's great to be back in another final. "It's special to play a final here at Queen's. The confidence is pretty high right now. So hopefully tomorrow (Sunday) it's going to be even better."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took 5 1/2 hours, but on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz won the French Open for the second straight year. Alcaraz earned the win after dropping the first two sets, defeating Sinner after five sets and three tiebreaks. 2 seeds against one another in what is sure to become an instant classic. "I'm pretty sure you're going to be a champion, not once, but many many times," Alcaraz said of Sinner after the match. "It's a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, making history with you." Sinner, who had an early lead, failed to capitalize on three championship points in the fourth set before Alcaraz forced a deciding set. In the fifth set, it was Sinner who completed the unlikely comeback from a break down to force a third tiebreak. The young Spaniard defeated Sinner 10-2 in the fifth set tiebreak to win his fifth Grand Slam title. At age 22, he becomes the third-youngest man to win five major titles, trailing only Bjorn Borg and Rafael Nadal. But both seemed to get a second in the final set, with it all leading up to the thrilling ending. Alcaraz, who is famous for his ability to win marathon contests, is now 13-1 in five-set matches. Sinner, meanwhile, moves to 0-7 in matches that go past the four-hour mark. Alcaraz got on a roll to eventually tie Sinner at 5-5. Sinner then took the next game, but Alcaraz held on for an uncontested service game to force a tiebreak, which Sinner eventually won with some difficulty. The third set was all Alcaraz to start. He had briefly lost the goodwill of the crowd before pulling them right back in with multiple excellent points. Though Sinner launched a late comeback of his own to keep the set alive, Alcaraz held on for a 6-4 win in a sequence that mirrored the first set. But Sinner managed to get a second wind, breaking back late in the set to force yet another tiebreak. And in the end, Alcaraz was victorious after a dominant tiebreaker victory.</p>
