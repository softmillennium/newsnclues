                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2018, when Bitcoin was trading around $4,000 and most Americans, at least, thought cryptocurrency was a fad, Katie Haun found herself on a debate stage in Mexico City opposite Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who had dismissed digital assets as near worthless. As Krugman focused on Bitcoin's wild price swings, Haun steered the conversation toward something else — stablecoins. “Stablecoins are really interesting and really important to this ecosystem to hedge against that volatility,” she argued on stage, explaining how digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar could offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the ups and downs of traditional cryptocurrencies. A former federal prosecutor who spent more than a decade investigating financial crimes, including creating the government's first cryptocurrency task force and leading investigations into the Mt. Gox hack and corrupt agents in the Silk Road case, Haun had an unusual background for a crypto champion. Coming instead from law enforcement, she understood the criminal potential and legitimate uses of digital assets. Founding Haun Ventures in 2022, with more than $1.5 billion in assets under management — its team is now investing from a brand-new set of funds that have yet to officially close — she has been even more free to pursue her specific convictions about the future of money. The leap to hanging her own shingle hasn't been without its complexities. Despite her role at a16z and the industry connections that came with it, the two haven't publicly co-invested in anything since early 2022, shortly after she launched her fund, and Haun, who joined the board of Coinbase in 2017, stepped off it last year, while Marc Andreessen, who took colleague Chris Dixon's seat in 2020, remains a director. When asked Wednesday night at TechCrunch's StrictlyVC event about her relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, she downplayed any potential friction while acknowledging they aren't collaborators exactly. You're right that we haven't really done any deals together of late.” Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value, stablecoins like Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT are meant to trade at exactly $1, creating a digital representation of traditional currency that can move on blockchain networks. Indeed, fast-forward to today, and Haun's belief in stablecoins looks increasingly prescient. Reportedly, for the first time last year, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded Visa's. “I think people who looked at stablecoins a few years ago thought, what is the value prop?” Haun said Wednesday night. In reality, for most Americans, the existing financial system works reasonably well. But Haun, drawing on her prosecutor's understanding of global financial systems, says she has long been aware that the U.S. experience isn't universal. In countries with unstable currencies or limited banking infrastructure, stablecoins offer something unique, she argues, which is instant access to stable, dollar-denominated value that can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies. The technology has evolved dramatically since those early debates, certainly. And Circle says its USDC stablecoin is fully backed one-to-one by dollars held in JP Morgan bank accounts and audited by Big Four accounting firms. Little wonder the corporate world is taking notice in a big way. Stablecoins provide a way to move the value of U.S. dollars using cryptocurrency rails instead of traditional banking infrastructure, potentially saving these retail-heavy companies billions in processing fees. While Circle and Tether are committed to having enough reserves to support their tokens, unlike traditional banks, there's no insured government protection behind these reserves. Relatedly, if major corporations can issue their own currencies, what happens to monetary policy and banking regulation? While well-regulated stablecoins like USDC are backed by actual dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, others operate with less transparency or rely on complex algorithmic mechanisms that have proven vulnerable to collapse. (TerraUSD has had the most specular crash to date, wiping out $60 billion in value when it nosedived.) Corruption concerns in particular came into sharp focus recently when President Donald Trump's family issued its own stablecoin, a move that highlighted potential conflicts of interest in an industry where political influence can directly impact market value and regulatory outcomes. It now awaits a House vote before potentially reaching the president's desk. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has been particularly vocal in her opposition, calling the legislation a “superhighway for Donald Trump's corruption.” Her criticism centers on a notable gap in the bill: while it prohibits members of Congress and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products, it says nothing about their family members. Asked about Warren's concerns on Wednesday night, Haun practically rolled her eyes. “I think it's really ironic that Elizabeth Warren or other Democrats who do call this corruption are not running to pass crypto legislation,” she said. “Had there been rules of the road in place [already], there would have been a framework, there would have been clear rules for what's a security, what's a commodity, and what are the consumer protections around that.” Haun, whose venture capital firm has made numerous stablecoin investments including Bridge (acquired by Stripe for reportedly 10 times forward revenue), is largely supportive of the legislation, unsurprisingly. But she has one notable criticism: the bill's prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. Currently, that money goes to companies like Circle and Coinbase. But Haun wonders why consumers shouldn't get that yield, just like they would with a savings account. Haun was less nuanced when it comes to another Warren concern: that if the GENIUS Act is signed into law, stablecoins could become a vehicle for money laundering and terrorism financing. In fact, as the stablecoin ecosystem continues to mature, Haun sees even bigger changes ahead. “BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, they've already tokenized their money market funds. Instead of having to be wealthy enough to meet minimum investment thresholds, someone with $25 and a smartphone could buy fractional ownership in a share of Apple or Amazon, for example. “Just because something's inevitable doesn't mean it's imminent,” Haun said on Wednesday. But she's confident the transformation is coming, driven by the same forces that made stablecoins successful: they're faster, cheaper, and, she insists, more accessible than traditional alternatives. Looking back at that 2018 debate with Krugman, Haun's persistence seems to have paid off. A major question now isn't whether digital dollars will reshape the financial system but perhaps more importantly, whether regulators can keep pace with the technology while addressing legitimate concerns about corruption, consumer protection, and financial stability. Instead, she sees this as a familiar tech adoption story — one that has played out repeatedly and often takes longer than people initially imagine. “We think it's really early days,” she told the crowd. She's also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.

New U.S. restrictions could prevent leading chip manufacturers from installing chipmaking tools in their China fabs. The U.S. government is considering cancelling the validated end-user (VEU) program for multinational chipmakers, which would adversely affect companies such as Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, which operate fabs in China. There are no revokes of VEUs, as yet, but the government has this in place as a just-in-case scenario. The review targets special trade allowances for multinationals that were given to select non-China-based chipmakers after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on fab tools exported to China in late 2022. When the Biden administration imposed export controls on advanced fab tools originating in the U.S., essentially barring their sales to entities in China, it granted the so-called VEU authorizations to Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC to let them obtain semiconductor production equipment for their fabs in China without an export license. The VEU streamlined the process for American companies — including but not limited to Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research — to ship to their Chinese customers, which had bought tens of billions worth of fab equipment in recent years. VEUs for the major memory makers reduced delays and provided predictability, but they obviously came with specific terms such as limits on equipment types and mandatory reporting. A White House official explained to Reuters that the move is part of a precautionary tactic, as the U.S. is preparing in case the current trade agreement with China collapses or another dispute arises. Though there are currently no plans to revoke the authorizations, officials want the option available if bilateral relations take a nosedive. A spokesperson from the U.S. Commerce Department confirmed to Reuters that semiconductor firms would still be able to conduct business in China even if the permissions were pulled. Any future enforcement actions would align foreign multinationals with the same licensing obligations currently applied to U.S. exporters. The intent is to create a uniform system rather than target specific firms. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

When asked why, he argued that the “barrier is much higher” to posting on LinkedIn, because “this is your resume online.” Plus, users can face real backlash if they post something that's too obviously generated by AI. “If you're getting called out on X or TikTok, that's one thing,” he added. “But when you're getting called out on LinkedIn, it really impacts your ability to create economic opportunity for yourself.” And he said he uses AI himself when he talks to his boss, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella:  “Every time, before I send him an email, I hit the Copilot button to make sure that I sound Satya-smart.” Subscribe for the industry's biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch's coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is quite a surprise that the kingpins behind Windows and Linux never met previously. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. In the center of the group photo, you can see Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds standing shoulder-to-shoulder - or actually they look more friendly than that. It is rather surprising that the kingpins behind Windows and Linux had never met previously, but we will take the host's, Russinovich's, word for it. Time usually mellows a man, and perhaps putting these two together at the same table would have been a recipe for trouble in decades past. “I had the thrill of a lifetime, hosting dinner for Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds and David Cutler,” wrote Russinovich on LinkedIn. No major kernel decisions were made, but maybe next dinner ;)” Many social media commenters were also taken aback by the mass of computer technology talent squeezed into one frame. Some also pondered over what the tech world would be like now, if not for these men. Or perhaps they went down the light and trivial conversational route, with tech topics sidelined by an unspoken consensus? Bill Gates became an IT industry legend as the co-founder of Microsoft. He was pivotal to pioneering commercial software and personal computing ecosystems development from the mid-1970s onwards. Gates stayed at the helm of Microsoft well into the heydays of Windows, but is now most famous for his charitable works. His comments on the tech industry can still stoke headlines, though. He also seems to miss the 'brave' Pat Gelsinger's leadership at Intel. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. This non-commercial approach to advancing computing, especially software, contrasts with that of Gates and Microsoft. However, even though the rival Windows OS costs money and is openly derided in tech circles, the year of Linux hasn't yet arrived. In contrast with Gates' take on AI, he considers it to be “90% marketing.” He also doesn't seem to care about inflicting friendly fire damage on members of the Linux community, recently publicly raging against the “random turd files” he found in Linux 6.15-rc1.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. A lot of mechanical keyboards struggle with aesthetics. If the styling is overdone, you might inhibit functionality or just have too much going on visually. Whichever way you go, there's still a chance you'll get it wrong and have something that doesn't look good. But there's been an influx of really well-designed keyboards of late: Keychron's K2 HE Special Edition is a great example, along with the Mchose GX87 Ultra, not to mention the countless high-end custom keyboard kits available today. With most of these keyboards, keycaps take a backseat—even if they look good, they're usually fairly standard and minimal. Asus takes the opposite approach with the ROG Azoth X: A simple white case, but colorful and stylized keycaps. It's not the most conventional design, but they look really good and manage to liven up a desk without taking over your setup. This keyboard manages to look good without sacrificing substance—the Azoth X has 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth connectivity, 1,000-Hz polling, and an internal assembly that makes it both fun to type on and easy to modify. It's available in white with either click or linear NX switches, and includes a silicone wrist rest. All that costs a pretty penny, though, at $300. This keyboard is most comparable to Razer's BlackWidow V4 75% in typing experience. The biggest difference is the switch options: Razer's 75% keyboard is only available with tactile switches, while Asus offers linear and clicky switches. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The unit I received came with Asus's Snow linear switches. They aren't the smoothest switches I've tested, but the friction felt when typing is both minimal and consistent, resulting in a typing experience that's still enjoyable. These switches also have minimal stem wobble, meaning keypresses feel stable and confident when typing. They require less force than a Cherry MX Red switch, requiring 53 grams of force to fully bottom out compared to the MX Red's 60 grams. This difference is noticeable and makes the switches feel more responsive without as much risk of mis-inputs compared to a truly lightweight (sub-50g) spring. It still has some of the bounce and softness expected from a gasket mount, but it is less than many comparable keyboards. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. While plate-mount stabilizers are typically going to feel less stable than PCB-mount, the ones used here still feel good and have no rattle out of the box. There are a lot of things I like about the design. The keycaps are slightly flatter than the average keycap and have a two-piece assembly with a transparent back for RGB diffusion. The case has a sleek and angular design that looks stylish and space-age without taking up a lot of room. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. My only concern is that, with how small some of the icons are, they could be difficult for some folks to read at a glance. The black-and-white styling with purple and magenta highlights creates a really fun design motif, and the space imagery feels reminiscent of ultra-clean sci-fi designs in Portal 2 or Counter-Strike's Asiimov skins. The keycaps are printed using dye sublimation, and unlike some other dye-sub keycaps, the printing has sharp, defined edges and consistent coloration. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Some of the branding on its keycaps feels a bit silly and on-the-nose, with the enter key saying “JOIN THE REPUBLIC” and left shift saying “GAME ON” without any alternative keycaps with normal text or symbols. Aesthetically, I'm a bit confused by the idea of the “Republic of Gamers (ROG)” being an actual organization to join, and why the keyboard you've already bought is telling you to join said group. I'm a bit annoyed that there aren't any alternative keys that describe their function, especially when the unique shape of these keycaps makes it difficult (maybe even impossible) to find replacements. However, that was entirely an aesthetic problem, while here it's a direct trade-off for functionality. It's not a huge deal (I still like the styling of this keyboard overall, and this issue won't bother most buyers), but it's worth noting. Ten screws span the outside and can easily be removed to have full access to the internals. The main assembly is connected to the daughterboard with a ribbon cable, and can be disconnected and removed without having to touch the OLED screen, which is part of an entirely separate secondary board. Because the screen isn't attached to the gasket mount system, it won't be put under any stress when typing. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Asus' Armoury Crate is one of the most effective gaming software programs I've tested. It's easy to use, lightweight, and doesn't include unnecessary add-ons (an issue I noted with SteelSeries GG's extra features and built-in advertisements). Asus consistently includes tooltips, explanations, and instructions on how to use features and settings, which is helpful for software that isn't in use constantly. The Azoth X is a competent gaming keyboard. While it doesn't compete with cutting-edge Hall effect (HE) switches with rapid trigger functionality and customizable actuation points, the Azoth X has the sound, charm, and predictability of a standard mechanical keyboard—all things that can be absent with Hall effect keyboards. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. While I wouldn't recommend this keyboard over an HE (like the Wooting 80HE) for gaming at professional levels, it's certainly good enough for anyone playing games casually. I found it serviceable for every aspect of my daily computer use, which included gaming, word processing, photo and video editing, and general browsing. Features like on-screen system monitoring can help with game optimization, while multimedia controls let you control music or videos at a glance without having to minimize your game. What makes this keyboard stand out is how good it feels to use. Mechanical keyboards have been around for years and, as a result, people have become really good at getting a specific sound, feel, and experience out of them. If you're looking for a customizable mechanical keyboard that finds a middle ground between gaming performance and satisfying user experience, the Azoth X and the BlackWidow 75% Pro are neck-and-neck. Both of them feel great to type on, have useful OLED displays in the corner, and are supported by intuitive and well-made software.

MxBenchmarkPC on YouTube showcased an Unreal Engine Paris tech demo running on an RTX 5080 and Core i7-14700F, comparing the 5.6 and 5.4 versions of the engine against each other at 1440p and 4K resolutions. In the first run, Unreal Engine 5.6 was 22% faster compared to version 5.4; additionally, CPU usage dropped by around 17% on average across all 16 threads (of the 14700F's 8 P-cores) with version 5.6. The 720p run showed even greater gains for Unreal Engine 5.6, which outperformed version 5.4 by a whopping 30%. The Paris demo also showcased improved environmental and object lighting in most scenes. Interior scenes are particularly darker with chairs and tables gaining extra shadowing in 5.6 over 5.4. The improved lighting fidelity gives the demo a more photorealistic look in version 5.6, while version 5.4 lighting looks more "gamified" by contrast. Unreal Engine 5.6 is primarily a performance-focused patch targeting 60 FPS with hardware ray tracing on the latest consoles, high-end PCs, and powerful mobile devices. We have yet to see any games (beyond Fortnite, allegedly) taking advantage of Unreal Engine 5.6. But this new update provides the best opportunity yet for the engine to rid itself of its infamous stuttering issues plaguing many Unreal Engine 5 titles.

YouTuber JayzTwoCents discovered that manually enabling Resizable Bar in certain non-whitelisted games/applications can yield a noteworthy performance boost. The YouTuber published a video showcasing an impressive 10% improvement in score in 3DMark Port Royal from simply turning ReBAR on with Nvidia Profile Inspector. JayzTwoCents discovered this feature as he was diagnosing some performance issues with his extreme overclocking rig, featuring a Core i9-14900KS and RTX 5090, aimed at competing against LTT labs and extreme overclocker Splave (who has also written content for us). The Intel-powered rig was underperforming in 3DMark Port Royal by several thousand points compared to his GPU test rig featuring a Ryzen 7 9800X3D. After talking with Splave, the YouTuber allegedly discovered that most (if not all) extreme overclockers (using Intel-based CPUs) are manually activating Resizable Bar with Nvidia Profile Inspector for 3DMark. Simply turning on ReBAR (in the driver) gave JayzTwoCents' 14900KS rig a 3,304-point boost, starting at 37,105 points and moving up to 40,409 points. Resizable Bar became mainstream in 2020 when AMD began supporting the feature with its Ryzen 5000 CPUs and RX 6000 series GPUs, calling it Smart Access Memory (SAM). The technology debuted with PCIe 2.0 all the way back in 2006, but it wasn't until 2020 that CPU and GPU manufacturers realized its benefits, particularly for gaming. Worse still, some games drop performance with ReBAR enabled. This has forced GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia to test ReBAR on a game-by-game basis and only enable it by default in their GPU drivers if a game responds well to the feature. Still, enthusiasts have found over the past several years that Nvidia has not whitelisted all games or applications that benefit from ReBAR enablement. Manually testing ReBAR enablement in games that Nvidia has not yet whitelisted can yield significant performance improvements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been two years since Lungy launched (here's the original ShowHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34534615) and it's had a huge update and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.My background is as a surgical trainee and I started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London. During COVID, there were huge numbers of patients coming off ventilators and patients are often given breathing exercises on a worksheet and disposable plastic devices called incentive spirometers to encourage deep breathing. This is intended to prevent chest infections and strengthen breathing muscles that have weakened. I noticed often the incentive spirometer would sit by the bedside, whilst the patient would be on their phone – this was the spark that lead to Lungy!Since making the first version we've made exercises fully customisable (you can dial in exact timings for each breath phase), added new breathing indicators, learning modules, e.g. self-care for anxiety symptoms, and lots of new visuals. The free version gives you access to a new breathing exercise each day, whilst premium unlocks the full library of exercises, exercise data and visuals..The visuals are mostly built using Metal (a couple use SpriteKit) and there are lots to choose from - boids, cloth sims, fluid sims, a hacky DLA implementation, rigid body + soft body sims - each one reacts to breath and touch. The audio uses AudioKit with a polyphonic synth and a sequencer plays generated notes from a chosen scale (you can mess around with the sequencer and synth in Settings/Create Music). We're still working on improving the breath detection, using ML - currently, it uses microphone input, with optional camera input to guide positioning.We're also close to finishing the medical device version - http://lungy.health - designed as a pulmonary rehab platform for patients with asthma, it should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.Thanks for reading - would love to hear any feedback!https://www.lungy.appLungy Version 2 here: https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887 My background is as a surgical trainee and I started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London.

It's less 'cognitive' than other apps, but a few studies have shown breathing exercises are as effective for stress as guided meditation, but also much simpler to follow [0]. I'm always slightly surprised at how effective breathing is in helping relaxation - although it obviously makes a lot of physiological sense.</p>

Everywhere I've worked, whether in an office or my own house, I've begun with the purest of intentions to keep my desk clean and clutter-free, only to weigh the time and energy cost of constantly putting things away just to pull them out again the next day. One of the biggest, ahem, sticking points in my decluttering process is the sheer number of sticky notes I use. Classic Post-It brand notes, sticky notes shaped like flowers, novelty pads, tape flags—all have a place in my office supply arsenal. I write everything by hand, with a pen. Not only in my paper planner but also on the sticky notes I have in nearly every room of my house. And I always will, as it's been scientifically proven that writing things down boosts learning and memory, since writing by hand activates more wide-ranging connections in the brain. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Doctor's office unexpectedly calling while I'm in another room? Reminder for my husband who's still asleep and doesn't have his phone set to silent, so I can't text him? However, the worst offender of sticky note detritus is by far my workstation. If I receive any kind of actionable instruction, whether it's in a meeting, an email, a Slack message, or via a phone call, it's immediately written down on a sticky note and slapped on my planner or, if longer-range, pinned to the wall above my desk, which is lined with felt bulletin board wall tiles from Amazon and currently looks like the pelt of a disappointing piñata. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, I hadn't really thought much about what those notepads were doing for my space visually until I saw the Poppin' Sticky Memo Ball, the 4.5-inch dodecahedron that looks something like a girly soccer ball but is actually a desk ornament you can put to use. This is the sticky note stack made into decor. The Sticky Memo Ball originated not in a boardroom at 3M, nor in the brains of Romy and Michelle, but at Rochester Institute of Technology. (Named in honor of Italian designers Lella and Massimo Vignelli, the latter of whom is known for his modernist designs incorporating geometric shapes.) All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In 2016, Metaproject was sponsored by Poppin, the New York–based office supply company, and students were tasked with coming up with products to fit the company's focus on the intersection of practicality and high design. Multiple creations came to fruition, but only one eventually made it to market: student Afifi Ishak's Sticky Memo Ball. “This design enriches the user's mood and interaction when it comes to things on the desktop,” RIT's website description reads. It is “rich in sculptural geometry and experience design, which gives a powerful visual message as you peel away layers and is supported by the plastic core.” I admit I was expecting all 12 sides to have different-colored notes, but there are two each of six colors: purple, lavender, peach, hot pink, ocean blue, and baby blue. Still, I appreciate having six 2.5-inch color-codable sticky notes in one place, especially if that place doubles as desk decor. Although I have noticed that the other members of my household initially mistook the Memo Ball for a soccer ball, which it does resemble, especially from afar. Note to Poppin: Make it in different colors!) All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In terms of adhesive strength, I'd say the five-sided notes—of which there are 25 per pad, for a total of 300 per ball—sit somewhere between Post-It brand notes, which could stick to a wall for a few days, and a novelty pad from somewhere like Rifle Paper, whose notes are stylish but have a tendency to come unstuck from even horizontal surfaces. At that point the finished ball could act as a 12-sided die “for advice and predictions,” the promotional copy says. I tried four different sides and was not able to scrape the glue and paper off to see more than a couple of words. But the ball is kind of fun to spin and flip around while you're on a call or in a meeting, and it would make a great gift for coworkers (you can buy the balls in a bulk box of six), moms, or anyone who's looking to level up their desk decor.

Right now, Amazon has its Fire TV soundbar on sale for 29% off. Normally going for $120, that discount is enough to bring this television audio accessory down to $85—its lowest price ever. The best way to improve your home audio for watching movies, football games, and big budget TV shows without breaking your own budget is with a soundbar. It rests easily on top of your TV stand or can be mounted to the wall, whichever you prefer. The soundbar connects to your TV easily using HDMI ARC and then fills your room with spectacular sound thanks to the DTS Virtual:X surround sound. This emulates full, 3D cinema quality sound and makes it so you have a great listening experience no matter where you are sitting in relation to the soundbar. Take the sound even further with Dolby Audio-supported entertainment. The Fire TV soundbar works seamlessly with Fire TV smart TVs and streaming media players, so you will only need one remote to control your TV and your audio. Just use the remote that came with you Fire TV. So if you're ready to turn your back on the low-quality audio you TV's built-in speakers are providing you, you can upgrade to the Fire TV soundbar for the low price of $85 over at Amazon.
