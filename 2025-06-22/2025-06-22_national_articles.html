U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan 'Razin' Caine hold a press briefing at the Pentagon after the U.S. completed an attack on three key Iranian nuclear sites. The U.S. military and Trump administration leveraged strategic deception and decoys to carry out the surprise and successful strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday evening that took the world by surprise after President Donald Trump indicated such an operation could unfold in the coming weeks, not necessarily days. Trump announced the Saturday evening strikes on Iran in a Truth Social post that was not preceded by media leaks or speculation that strikes were imminent. The unexpected social media post was followed just hours later by a brief Trump address to the nation while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance. The strikes, which the administration has described as an overwhelming success that obliterated Iranian nuclear facilities and backed the nation into a corner to make a peace deal, were celebrated by Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine as ones that were cloaked in secrecy and intentionally deceptive to confuse the enemy. "At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers launched from the continental United States," Caine said during a Sunday morning press conference from the Pentagon. A deception effort, known only to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa." Ahead of the Saturday evening strikes, six B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri were en route to a U.S. Air Force base in Guam, U.S. officials confirmed to Fox News. "The main strike package, comprised of seven B-2 spirit bombers, each with two crew members, proceeded quietly to the east with minimal communications," Caine said. Once overland, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver, requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications." Fox News Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin said during a Saturday evening appearance as news broke of the strikes that reports of the bombers were likely part of the "misleading tidbits put out there to suggest that maybe President Trump had had put off the decision." "Those six B-2 bombers that were heading west toward Guam, they would not have made it to Iran in time to take part in this strike," she said, while speaking with Fox News' Bret Baier Saturday evening. Again, this was all part of the deception. There was a great deal of sort of misleading tidbits put out there to suggest that maybe President Trump had put off the decision and that this would happen two weeks from now." Hegseth said in his remarks before the media Sunday morning that the U.S. military had leveraged "misdirection" and total secrecy, aside from top national security officials, to carry out the strikes "without the world knowing at all." "It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security. The surprise strikes following Trump saying, via comment delivered by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Thursday during a press briefing, that he would make a decision on Iran within the next two weeks, which initially signaled that such strikes could unfold in the coming weeks and not imminently. "I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, 'Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,'" Leavitt said at a White House press briefing Thursday, quoting Trump. Trump said in his address to the nation late Saturday that "Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated" and that Iran now faces the choice of making peace or facing future attacks. If they do not, future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier." Trump described the strikes as a "spectacular military success." "A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan," he said. "Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number-one state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success." "For 40 years, Iran has been saying, ‘Death to America. They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs," Trump continued. We lost over a thousand people, and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate in particular."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. military struck three sites in Iran early Sunday, the mission called “Operation Midnight Hammer” involved decoys, deception and was met with no Iranian resistance, according to the Sunday morning Pentagon news briefing by Hegseth and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday America does not “seek war,” and it didn't target Iranian troops or people.

Dan Caine speaks during a news conference at the Pentagon in Washington, Sunday, June 22, 2025, after the U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel's effort to destroy the country's nuclear program. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Sunday signaled a willingness to renew talks with Iran and avoid a prolonged war in the aftermath of a surprise attack on three of the country's nuclear sites as U.S. officials assessed Tehran's nuclear ambitions and the threat of retaliation against American interests. The coordinated messaging by his vice president, Pentagon chief, top military adviser and secretary of state suggested a confidence that any fallout would be manageable and that Iran's lack of military capabilities would ultimately force it back to the bargaining table. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a news conference that America “does not seek war” with Iran while Vice President JD Vance said the strikes have given Tehran the possibility of returning to negotiate with Washington. President Donald Trump, who had addressed the nation from the White House on Saturday night, returned to social media on Sunday to criticize Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who had objected to the president taking military action without specific congressional approval. “We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the ‘bomb' right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could! )” Trump said as part of the post on Truth Social. At their joint Pentagon briefing, Hegseth and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that “Operation Midnight Hammer” involved decoys and deception, and met with no Iranian resistance. Vance said in a television interview that while he would not discuss “sensitive intelligence about what we've seen on the ground,” he felt “very confident that we've substantially delayed their development of a nuclear weapon.” Pressed further, he told NBC's “Meet the Press” that “I think that we have really pushed their program back by a very long time. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on CBS's “Face the Nation” that “there are no planned military operations right now against Iran, unless, unless they mess around and they attack” U.S. interests. It was not immediately clear whether Iran saw the avoidance of a wider conflict as in its best interests. Israeli airstrikes that began on June 13 local time targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and generals, prompting retaliation from Iran and creating a series of events that contributed to the U.S. attack. While U.S. officials urged for caution and stressed that only nuclear sites were targeted by Washington, Iran criticized the actions as a violation of its sovereignty and international law. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Washington was “fully responsible” for whatever actions Tehran may take in response. “I don't know how much room is left for diplomacy.” China and Russia, where Araghchi was heading for talks with President Vladimir Putin, condemned the U.S. military action. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom was moving military equipment into the area to protect its interests, people and allies, but that he was focused on finding a solution. The Pentagon briefing did not provide any new details about Iran's nuclear capabilities. “Iran found out” that when Trump “says 60 days that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation,” Hegseth said. But the U.S. benefited from Iran's weakened air defenses as it was able to conduct the attacks without resistance from Iran. “Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission,” Caine said. Caine added that the U.S. used other methods of deception as well, deploying fighters to protect the B-2 bombers that dropped a total of 14 bunker-buster bombs on Iran's sites at Fordo and Natanz. This story has been corrected to reflect that Caine, not Hegseth, said the bombers dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs on Fordo as well as on Natanz.</p>

Iran may try to retaliate against the U.S. after a stealth strike hit three key Iranian nuclear facilities, though the regime lacks the capabilities to make a "significant escalation," an expert on the Middle East and U.S. national security told Fox News Digital on Sunday. "I do foresee some kind of face-saving efforts," Olidort said, noting that Iran could potentially launch cyber-attacks or attacks on infrastructure in the region. Iran has already launched more missiles at Israel in the wake of the U.S. military's Operation Midnight Hammer, striking at least 10 impact sites and injuring at least 20 people in Israel. A close-up of a crater over the underground Natanz facility on June 22, 2025, after U.S. strikes targeted the enrichment site. But Olidort said he didn't expect "any significant escalation" from Iran, not because of the regime's lack of will to do so, but because it now simply lacks the capabilities for a stronger response after Israel launched waves of its own strikes against the regime earlier this month. Israel has said its strikes targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and ballistic missile sites, and killed multiple Iranian military leaders. This satellite picture by Planet Labs PBC shows Iran's underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo after a U.S. airstrike targeted the facility on Sunday, June 22, 2025. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has declared that "now is the time for peace." As for the impact on the power Iran wields through its force of proxies in the region, Olidort said it's notable that none of them have immediately jumped to Iran's aid following the U.S. strikes, which possibly points to Iran's weakness. Olidort said the U.S. operation's impact on Iran's nuclear program could set the regime's goal of achieving a nuclear weapon back "a considerable amount." "Before these strikes, Israel had taken out many of Iran's capabilities and many of its nuclear scientists," he said, adding that he estimated Israel had already set back Iran's nuclear program by two to three years. The U.S. launched a surprise strike using B-2 stealth bombers on Iran's Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities on Saturday. It remained unclear as of Sunday whether any enriched nuclear material was destroyed in the U.S. strikes or if Iran had moved the material beforehand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv, Israel, is pictured, Jan. 8, 2025. President Donald Trump speaks from the East Room of the White House in Washington, Saturday, June 21, 2025, after the U.S. military struck three Iranian nuclear and military sites, directly joining Israel's effort to decapitate the country's nuclear program, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio listens. “Given reports of regional hostilities, the U.S. Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region,” the department said in its notice for Saudi Arabia. In Turkey, the department said U.S. personnel “have been cautioned to maintain a low profile and instructed to avoid personal travel to the U.S. Consulate Adana consular district,” which includes the NATO airbase at Incirlik. “Negative sentiment toward U.S. foreign policy may prompt actions against U.S. or Western interests in Turkey,” the statement said. Late Saturday, the department said it was stepping up evacuation flights for American citizens from Israel to Europe and continuing to draw down its staff at diplomatic missions in Iraq. But even before the U.S. airstrikes on Iran were made public by President Donald Trump on Saturday evening in Washington, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem had announced the start of evacuation flights for private Americans from Israel. Sixty-seven American citizens left Israel on two government flights bound for Athens, Greece on Saturday and four more evacuation flights to Athens were planned for Sunday, according to internal State Department document seen by The Associated Press. A nongovernment charter flight is scheduled to depart Israel for Rome on Monday. In addition to the flights, a cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 American citizens, including several hundred Jewish youngsters who had been visiting Israel on an organized tour, arrived in Cyprus, according to the document. It also said the evacuation of non-essential personnel at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Erbil is continuing. Those staffers had been ordered to leave even before Israel began its military operation in Iran more than a week ago. “As part of our ongoing effort to streamline operations, additional personnel departed Iraq on June 21 and 22,” the department said. “These departures represent a continuation of the process started on June 12.” As of Saturday, more than 7,900 Americans had asked for assistance in leaving Israel and more than 1,000 had sought help in leaving Iran, where the U.S. has no diplomatic presence, the document said. It was not clear how many Americans had successfully made it out of Iran through overland routes, although the document said more than 200 had entered neighboring Azerbaijan as of Saturday since the conflict began. After the U.S. strikes in Iran, security officers at all U.S. embassies and consulates have been instructed to conduct reviews of their post's security posture and report back to the State Department by late Sunday.</p>

Ric Bucher weighs in on whether Kevin Durant can still be the #1 option on a championship roster. He breaks down Durant's current game, leadership, and whether he has what it takes to lead a team to an NBA title today. 10 overall pick of the 2025 draft and five second-round picks, ESPN reported. Kevin Durant, #35 of the Phoenix Suns, reacts during the second half of game four of the Western Conference First Round Playoffs at Footprint Center on April 28, 2024, in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix believed adding Durant to a team with Devin Booker, and later Bradley Beal, could help elevate them back to the NBA Finals. Dec. 25, 2023; Phoenix, Arizona: Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant (35) drives against Dallas Mavericks forward Tim Hardaway Jr. (10) during the first half at Footprint Center. Durant, 36, has still proven to be one of the top scorers in the game when healthy. He averaged 26.6 points per game and shot 52.7% from the field. He's been an All-Star in each year he's been available to play since the 2009-10 season. He missed the entire 2019-20 season with an injury. The Suns get two key players in Green and Brooks. Green played all 82 games for the second straight year in 2024-25. He averaged 21 points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kristin Chenoweth performs during the 54th annual Songwriters Hall of Fame induction and awards gala on Thursday, June 12, 2025, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York. OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — At 4-foot-11, Kristin Chenoweth is still making it to the NBA Finals. Chenoweth's performance will air live on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern, shortly before tipoff of the season's final game. She teased the appearance on social media Saturday, revealing — while wearing Thunder gear — that she was in Oklahoma City, then said she better “start warming up” and sang the first few notes of the national anthem. Chenoweth's Thunder fandom has been no secret since the franchise's early years, though she also has professed at times to liking the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks as well. That said, the Thunder are clearly her top choice — so much so that she once told the Tulsa World she spent three hours bedazzling a Thunder hat. She went to Oklahoma City University after growing up in Broken Arrow, about 115 miles northeast of where the Thunder play. She even dressed the pup up once in a Thunder outfit. Chenoweth has been the anthem singer at multiple Thunder games in the past, sometimes alone and at least once with children from her Chenoweth Broadway Bootcamp. That camp is part of the arts and education fund that she founded to cultivate “young artistic expression by enriching children's lives through the power of education, entertainment and experience.” And in 2009, she won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's “Pushing Daisies.”</p>

Iran's military launched dozens of missiles into Israel on Saturday night after President Donald Trump ordered U.S. airstrikes against three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Five to six bunker buster bombs struck the Fordow nuclear site, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity. Thirty Tomahawk missiles were fired against Natanz and Isfahan from U.S. submarines, Fox News' Jennifer Griffin reports. Trump said Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities were "totally obliterated" during a brief address the American people from the White House Saturday. At least a dozen people were injured after Iran launched roughly 30 missiles into Israel on Saturday night. By subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted that the U.S. is "not at war" with Iran on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered strikes on three of the country's nuclear sites. Rubio made the statement during an appearance on "Sunday Morning Futures" with host Maria Bartiromo. He went on to warn that any retaliation from Iran would be “the worst mistake they've ever made.” While many Americans were able to leave without issues, "numerous" citizens faced "delays and harassment" while trying to leave, the outlet added, citing the cable reportedly dated on Friday. Two citizens attempting to leave Iran were reportedly detained. The State Department told Fox News Digital that U.S. citizens may face more difficulty exiting than those who hold U.S.-Iranian dual citizenship. "U.S.-Iranian dual nationals must exit Iran on Iranian passports and should be prepared to encounter checkpoints and questioning from Iranian authorities before departing Iran. "If you plan to leave Iran, the Department has opened a crisis intake form for U.S. citizens in Iran to pass information about consular assistance," the department added. "Due to the limitations of U.S. consular support in Iran, U.S. citizens seeking departure should take advantage of existing means to leave Iran. The crisis intake form and the latest information for U.S. citizens seeking to depart Israel and Iran can be found on our banner page on travel.state.gov." Iran's "supreme leader," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was reportedly a no-show for potential negotiations with the United States in Turkey last week, and then remained in hiding as the U.S. military pounded Iranian nuclear sites this weekend. President Donald Trump was reportedly working with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to coordinate high-level talks between U.S. and Iranian officials in Istanbul last week. Trump told Erdoğan he could deploy Vice President JD Vance and White House envoy Steve Witkoff – and Trump offered to come to Turkey himself if it could mean meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to the Israel-Iran war and a nuclear deal, Axios reported, citing three U.S. officials and a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Trump also received "signals" from Iranian back channels hours before his call with Erdoğan that they wanted to talk, one White House official told Axios. Erdoğan and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan reportedly communicated Trump's offer to Pezeshkian and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Progressive champion Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a handful of other Democrats quickly floated the prospect of impeaching President Donald Trump for launching a military strike on Iran without Congressional authorization. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment." Democrat Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois also argued that the president's order to bomb Iran's nuclear sites without seeking Congressional approval could be considered an "unambiguous impeachable offense." Casten, a four-term representative whose district covers southwestern Chicago and surrounding suburbs, wrote Saturday night on social media that "this is not about the merits of Iran's nuclear program….to be clear, I do not dispute that Iran is a nuclear threat." "I'm not saying we have the votes to impeach," Casten added. Affected countries include Lebanon, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The state department increased its warning levels for Americans in both Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but there is no departure order. Meanwhile, Jordan remains at a level two advisory, calling for Americans in the country to exercise special caution. Former national security adviser John Bolton praised President Donald Trump for choosing to strike Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday. Bolton made the comments during an appearance on CNN's "State of the Union," adding that he believes "regime change" in Iran is necessary. "I think President Trump made the right decision for America to attack Iran's nuclear weapons program, and I think we're on the verge of potentially seeing regime change in Iran as a part of that," Bolton said. "This is a huge change in the Middle East. I've thought somebody should do it for a long time, but better late than never," he added. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., condemned President Donald Trump's airstrikes on Iran on Sunday, saying it was an illegal extension of executive authority. Kaine made the statement during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," telling host Shannon Bream that Trump's move was "unconstitutional." "The Senate has already ruled that the 2001 AUMF [Authorization for Use of Military Force] does not cover action against Iran because I filed a similar resolution a few years ago, and we had to battle this out before the parliamentarian. It's clear that there is no congressional authorization for Trump's war against Iran," Kaine said. Every member of Congress needs to vote on this," he added. "After decades in which Iran trampled on and ignored all the international community's oversight mechanisms - it has now remembered the UN institutions and seeks to condemn those who stopped their malicious plans," Danon said. "The U.S. and Israel do not deserve any condemnation, but rather an expression of gratitude for making the world a safer place," he added. "Essentially, the message was, 'We're not at war with Iran, we're at war with Iran's nuclear program,'" Baier said. Vice President JD Vance praised President Donald Trump's national security team following Saturday night's strikes on Iran on Sunday. Vance noted recent media criticism of Trump's team and argued that Saturday's strike shows the administration is prepared to do its job. "The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down," Vance wrote on X. "While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team. He stopped short of saying Iran's nuclear program had been completely "destroyed," however. President Donald Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that the U.S. used six "bunker buster" bombs to destroy the Iranian nuclear site at Fordow on Saturday evening. "The lead B-2 dropped two GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapons on the first of several Aim points at Fordow as the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 Mops dropped against two nuclear target areas. Iran's nuclear agency confirmed the U.S. struck all three facilities. Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat. Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to "penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes" underground. Hegseth made the statement during a Sunday press conference detailing Operation Midnight Hammer. Vice President JD Vance echoed Hegseth's words in an appearance on NBC News' Meet the Press, saying the U.S. is not at war with Iran, but rather, "We're at war with Iran's nuclear program." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said President Donald Trump was "fully committed" to engaging in peace talks with Iran before ordering strikes on the country's nuclear facilities Sunday. Hegseth made the statement while speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, asked if there was a "particular moment" when Trump decided the airstrikes were necessary. "I would just say having the opportunity to witness, his leadership, he was fully committed to the peace process, wanted wanted a negotiated outcome, gave Iran every single opportunity and unfortunately, was met by stonewalling, which is why he gave them plenty of time to continue to come to the table and give up enrichment, give up the nuclear program," Hegseth said. "But there was, I won't say the particular moment. There was certainly a moment in time where he realized that it had to be a certain action taken in order to minimize the threat to us in our troops," he added. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered details on President Donald Trump's Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday. "At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers launched from the continental United States," Caine said. "As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy, a deception effort, known only to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa." "Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise," he said. Some Americans have attempted to cross the border into Jordan via road before purchasing commercial flights back to the U.S. Others have relied on charter flights out of Tel Aviv, where the airspace is heavily restricted. Ron DeSantis has assisted in organizing such charter flights, and has so far helped evacuate hundreds of Americans with flights to Tampa, Florida. Birthright Israel, an educational organization, has also evacuated 1,500 Americans aboard the Crown Iris, a luxury Israeli cruise ship sailing from Ashdod Port to Larnaca, Cyprus. This satellite picture by Planet Labs PBC shows Iran's underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo after a U.S. airstrike targeted the facility Sunday, June 22, 2025. Satellite imagery shows the aftermath at Iran's Fordow nuclear facility Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered a strike on the site. Fordow is a nuclear enrichment site buried deep underground, and the U.S. strike involved multiple "bunker buster" munitions. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., praised President Donald Trump's decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday. Fetterman, a staunch supporter of Israel, was among the few Democrats who supported Trump's move publicly during Saturday's fallout. "As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by POTUS," Fetterman wrote. "Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities," he added. More than a dozen injuries were reported in Israel on Sunday morning after Iran launched more missiles toward the Jewish State, striking at least 10 impact sites. Approximately 30 missiles were used in Iran's latest attack and about 10 made it through Israeli Air Defenses, Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin said in an update live from Tel Aviv. "There's a tremendous impact when these missiles do make impact so when we talk about the assessment of injuries, understand that is preliminary," Tobin said. Fox News Digital's Lorraine Taylor contribute to this report. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was delivering remarks at a "Fighting Oligarchy" rally in Tusla, Okla., on Saturday night when President Donald Trump announced the United States had successfully attacked three nuclear sites in Iran. An aide interrupted Sanders' remarks to deliver the message Trump had just blasted off on Truth Social. "We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan," Trump said in the post. Trump added in the post: "All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. Thank you for your attention to this matter." Sanders nodded along as the crowd continued to chant, "No more wars!" before responding to the news in real time. He said the news was not only "alarming," but "so grossly unconstitutional." “Stopping Iran from having a nuclear bomb is a top priority, but dragging the U.S. into another Middle East war is not the solution. Trump's strikes are unconstitutional and put Americans, especially our troops, at risk," Khanna said. The bipartisan War Powers Resolution, introduced by Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., in the House of Representatives seeks to "remove United States Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in the Islamic State of Iran." The legislation was introduced this past week as strikes between Israel and Iran raged on. We need to deescalate and pursue a path of peace,” he said. Ellie Cohanim, former Deputy Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism during the first Trump administration, says the president deserves a peace prize for his decision to destroy three Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday. Cohanim, who is also an Iranian refugee, joined "Fox & Friends Weekend" on Sunday to discuss her thoughts on the strikes. "President Trump has truly saved the world and I certainly hope that we will see recognition for what he has accomplished for the entire world. He deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for this," she said, in part. She also said that destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities gives "a new hope" for the Middle East and she hopes to see peace between Israel and its neighbors one day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo XIV made a strong appeal for peace during his Sunday Angelus prayer in St. Peter's square, calling for international diplomacy to “silence the weapons.” Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Sunday that it is most important to deescalate the situation in Iran as soon as possible. People in Tokyo also expressed their concerns as they heard the news. This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows vehicles at Fordo enrichment facility in Iran on Thursday, June 19, 2025. President Donald Trump arrives to speak from the East Room of the White House in Washington, Saturday, June 21, 2025, after the U.S. military struck three Iranian nuclear and military sites, directly joining Israel's effort to decapitate the country's nuclear program, with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. U.S. President Donald Trump had said Thursday that he would decide within two weeks whether to get involved in Israel's war with Tehran. Some have questioned whether a weakened Iran would capitulate or remain defiant and begin striking with allies at U.S. targets scattered across the Gulf region. Here is a look at reactions from governments and officials around the world. Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, left, addresses a United Nations Security Council meeting at U.N. headquarters on Friday, June 20, 2025, as Secretary General Antonio Guterres looks on. The U.K., along with the European Union, France and Germany, tried unsuccessfully to broker a diplomatic solution in Geneva last week with Iran. Starmer said Iran's nuclear program posed a grave threat to global security. Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as deputy head of President Vladimir Putin's Security Council, said several countries were prepared to supply Tehran with nuclear weapons. He didn't specify which countries, but said the U.S. attack caused minimal damage and would not stop Tehran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemned” the airstrikes and called them a “a gross violation of international law, the U.N. Charter, and U.N. Security Council resolutions.” President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi warned of “grave repercussions” for expanding the Middle East conflict and urged a return to negotiations. President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sissi attends the 34th Arab League summit, in Baghdad, Iraq, Saturday, May 17, 2025. Saudi Arabia, which previously condemned Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders, expressed “deep concern” about the U.S. airstrikes, but stopped short of condemning them. Its Foreign Ministry in a statement urged all parties to show restraint and “avoid escalation, which the peoples of the region, burdened by conflicts and their tragic humanitarian repercussions, cannot tolerate.” Qatar has served as a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas war. Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Tuesday, April 22, 2025, at the State Department in Washington. “Lebanon, its leadership, parties, and people, are aware today, more than ever before, that it has paid a heavy price for the wars that erupted on its land and in the region,” Aoun said in a statement on X. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, left, speaks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during Abbas's arrival at the Presidential Palace in Baabda, east of Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, May 21, 2025. “These attacks violate all norms of international law,” the government said in a statement. China condemned U.S. strikes on Iran, calling them a serious violation of international law that further inflamed tensions in the Middle East. The European Union's top diplomat said Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, but she urged those involved in the conflict to show restraint. “I urge all sides to step back, return to the negotiating table and prevent further escalation,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in a post on social media. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and France's President Emmanuel Macron listen as President Donald Trump talks before a group photo at the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada. “Too many civilians will once again be the victims of a further escalation,” Costa added. Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris called the U.S. airstrikes “an extraordinarily dangerous escalation of a conflict that already best be described as a tinderbox.” Ireland, which has been especially critical of Israel's war in Gaza, echoed other European calls for negotiations that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. “We're now entering a moment of particular danger,” Harris said. Left-wing Latin American governments expressed fierce opposition to the U.S. strikes. Chile's President Gabriel Boric said they violated “rules we have established as humanity.” Mexico's Foreign Ministry made “an urgent call for peace.” In contrast, Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei, a loyal ally of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, praised the attacks on social media. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Sunday that it was crucial to calm the situation as soon as possible, adding that the Iranian nuclear weapons development also must be prevented. Ishiba, asked if he supports the U.S. attacks on Iran, declined to comment. Pope Leo XIV arrives for his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, Wednesday, June 18, 2025. Pope Leo XIV made a strong appeal for peace during his Sunday Angelus prayer in St. Peter's square, calling for international diplomacy to “silence the weapons.” After an open reference to the “alarming” situation in Iran, the first American pontiff stressed that “today more than ever, humanity cries out and invokes peace and it is a cry that demands reason and must not be stifled.” Pope Leo urged every member of the international community to take up their moral responsibility to “stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• US strikes Iran: The US attacked three key nuclear facilities early Sunday in an operation Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed “obliterated” Iran's nuclear ambitions, though a full assessment is ongoing. • “Operation Midnight Hammer”: The strikes involved more than 125 aircraft, including some B-2 bombers that served as a “decoy,” according to US officials. Other B-2s dropped more than a dozen massive “bunker buster” bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz facilities, while Tomahawk missiles struck Isfahan. • Iran's response: Iran's foreign minister accused Washington of crossing a “very big red line” and voiced skepticism about potential diplomacy, as the world awaits an official response from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Donald Trump has warned the US could launch more attacks if Iran does not make peace. The United Nations will hold an emergency Security Council meeting at 3 p.m. President Donald Trump made the final order for the US to strike Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, a senior White House official told CNN. Trump had been deliberating for days about US involvement and directed his press secretary to offer a two-week timeline from the briefing room in recent days. But he had been leaning toward joining Israel's military campaign in private discussions with senior staff as his envoy Steve Witkoff was still making diplomatic efforts. Trump made the final call on Saturday and directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to go ahead, this official said. Massive “bunker buster” bombs were dropped on two of the nuclear sites around 6:40 p.m. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who has called US President Donald Trump's decision to authorize strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities “unconstitutional,” warned that Republicans could lose the House majority next year over the issue. We could lose the majority over this one issue.” I think this was a bad move politically, but it's also just a bad move legally and constitutionally and policy-wise,” he continued. Massie told Raju “absolutely” Trump broke a campaign promise by engaging in the conflict in Iran, predicting that while the Republican base might agree, GOP lawmakers may not be as willing to criticize Trump because “they're, frankly, afraid of him,” as well as Israel's lobbying influence. “If there was an imminent threat, why did Speaker Johnson not call us back from our recess?” he asked, noting that the House was not in session last week. “The President can act for 60 days without a vote of Congress. But here's the reality: After 60 days, he has to stop unless there is a vote. So at some point, Manu, I think we're going to be able to force a vote, unless Speaker Johnson pulls some shenanigans with the Rules Committee,” he said. If Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, “The first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government, because … a lot of their oil comes through there.” Rubio added the US retains “options to deal with that,” but the move “would hurt other countries' economies a lot worse than ours.” He said it would result in “massive escalation that would merit response, not just by us but from others.” CNN's Fred Pleitgen is on the streets of Tehran, Iran's capital city, a day after US President Donald Trump confirmed he approved US strikes on Iran. You can watch this report on YouTube Shorts here. Days before the US strikes, law enforcement officials told CNN that while intelligence and law enforcement agencies are reexamining known or suspected Hezbollah associates in the US, looking for possible threats that could arise as tensions with Iran increase, there's no indication of credible threats at this time. “There's always a threat,” one federal law enforcement official told CNN of Iran. On physical, domestic attacks, DHS warns that if Iranian leaders “issued a religious ruling” calling for retaliatory violence against US targets, “the likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase.” President Donald Trump on Sunday to urge Congress to pass his legislative bill, touting growing Republican unity, in the wake of US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Now let's get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done. Remember: After months of negotiations, Senate Republicans are gearing up for a potential vote this week on Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill. It will be a major test for Trump and Senate Republican Leader John Thune. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna defended their efforts to reassert Congress' authority over military action with a co-sponsored war powers resolution. Massie called it an effort to “rein in the executive and reassert Congress' authority, sole authority to declare war… and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war” in an interview on CBS' “Face the Nation.” Khanna, meanwhile, said it was an “unfair smear” to call those who don't support the engagement in Iran “isolationist.” “First, let me just say that it's a totally unfair smear to call people isolationist — the vast majority of Americans who don't want more war and want diplomacy. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine predicted on Sunday that some Republicans will support his resolution to restrict the president's war powers when he forces a full Senate vote on the issue this week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing for a vote “as soon as possible” on his resolution so that “all members of the Senate have to declare whether or not the US should be at war with Iran,” Kaine told “Fox News Sunday.” “We will have Republican votes,” the Virginia Democrat said, though he conceded he wasn't sure which of his GOP Senate colleagues would back the initiative. Senators are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on the situation in Iran. “I know many Republicans will fall in line and say a president can do whatever he wants, but I hope members of the Senate and the House will take their Article One responsibility seriously and say you didn't even notify us, much less get an authorization, the US should not be at war without a vote of Congress,” Kaine said. “There was no imminent threat to the United States from [Iran's] nuclear program. It was an offensive word choice by a president without consultation with Congress,” he said. In a separate Sunday interview on CBS' “Face the Nation,” Kaine dismissed Vice President JD Vance's remark that the US is “not at war with Iran. “When you're bombing another nation, ask them if they think it's war,” the senator said. Reaction to the strikes has so far broken along predictable partisan lines. As Trump escorted around Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, to an event for new members being held in one of the clubhouse's dining rooms, he was loose and — at least in public — in an easygoing mood, people who saw him said. It came after days of public deliberation, as Trump alternated between issuing militaristic threats against Iran on social media and holding private concerns that a military strike could drag the US into prolonged war. Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was not aware ahead of time about the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and that there is a chance it just inspired a “hornet-mad regime” to sprint toward a nuclear weapon. Himes told CNN's Kasie Hunt that he “learned about this strike last night on Twitter, which, as you point out, is an uncomfortable thing for the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.” Before the strikes, he had not seen any intelligence to suggest there was an imminent risk of Iran building a nuclear weapon. Himes added that Iran may have moved any uranium, and there is a risk of a “hornet-mad regime that has decided that the only way we're going to forestall this in the future is to actually sprint towards a nuclear weapon.” Himes called the decision to strike an “enormous gamble.” And if history matters, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, if history matters, gambles in the Middle East very rarely go the way you expect or even hope they might go,” he said. The diplomat refused to say how Iran might respond to the military strikes by the US on its nuclear sites early Sunday, nor what had been damaged, but said Tehran “is entitled … to exercise its right of self-defense.” He added: “And we will do that for sure.” Baghaei said President Donald Trump's recent statements and threats of more attacks were “bullying at a global level.” Israeli officials, such as Defense Minister Israel Katz, have said Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “cannot continue to exist” – a statement Baghaei called “despicable” and “outrageous.” Baghaei, who served in the Iranian United Nations mission in New York between 2006 and 2010, said Iran had been trying its “best for diplomacy and peace.” “History will not forgive what is being done by the US administration,” he said. A senior Iranian official told CNN it is clear US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been coordinated in their separate attacks on Iran, adding that Iran will continue to attack “the aggressor.” “From the beginning it was clear that Trump and Netanyahu were quite coordinated with one another, and in fact they were pursuing a common project. All this as he is supporting him (Netanyahu) with equipment, weapons and intelligence,” the senior official said. All throughout the negotiations period, Israel was bolstering its capacity to confront. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei spoke exclusively to CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Iran after the US attacked three key nuclear facilities in the country. Baghaei said the US' actions were “unprecedentedly dangerous” and a “betrayal of diplomacy.” Israel has confirmed it struck the Iranian city of Bushehr, after Iranian state-affiliated media said explosions were heard in the southwestern city Sunday. The IDF also said that it had hit, for the first time, a strategic site in Yazd that it says had launched over 60 missiles at Israel. More than 500 staff members and contractors have departed the US diplomatic mission in Iraq as of Sunday morning, a source familiar said, noting that the plans for departure were already underway prior to the US strikes on Iran. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for direct negotiations between the United States and Iran in the wake of the strikes on key nuclear sites and said America is “prepared to talk to them tomorrow.” The top US diplomat reiterated that Iran could have a civil nuclear program but no uranium enrichment. “The Iranian regime should wake up and say, ‘OK, if we really want nuclear energy in our country, there's a way to do it.' “Steve Witkoff has traveled extensively around the world trying to reach that deal with them, but they play too many games. Although Iran “consistently” messages interlocutors, Rubio said, “they don't even talk to us directly.” “They want to pass messages and notes like we're in third grade. Let's talk about how we peacefully resolve this problem. Rubio said Iran has “a very simple decision” to make. Iran has rejected the idea of not being able to enrich uranium. Vice President JD Vance sought to calm concerns among those who fear the US is drifting toward another extended conflict in the Middle East following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. “But there's a question about, how do you achieve peace? And we believe the way that you achieve peace is through strength,” Vance added, addressing a question about Trump supporters who are uneasy with the intervention. “We took a very narrow and limited approach to destroying the Iranian nuclear program,” he said, adding “I think that more than anything, is going to ensure peaceful resolution in that region of the world. You can't sit there and allow the Iranians to achieve a nuclear weapon.” Vance went on to counter MAGA supporters who have voiced concerns that military involvement in the Middle East contradicts the president's non-interventionist promises he made during his 2024 campaign and during his first term as well. “The president, more than anybody, is worried about protracted military conflicts. That is not what we're getting ourselves involved in,” Vance said. Americans who are unable to depart Iran “should be prepared to shelter in place for extended periods,” the US State Department warned as it reiterated the US does “not anticipate offering direct US government assisted departure” from the country. In updated guidance dated Sunday, after the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, the department said “US citizens seeking departure should take advantage of existing means to leave Iran.” The US does not have a diplomatic presence in Iran. Switzerland, who assists US citizens in Iran, has closed its protecting power office until further notice. “The Department has opened a crisis intake form for US citizens in Iran to pass information about consular assistance. However, because of the limitations on consular support in Iran, we do not anticipate offering direct US government assisted departure from Iran,” the Sunday guidance states. It also advises that US-Iranian dual citizens “must exit Iran on Iranian passports and should be prepared to encounter checkpoints and questioning from Iranian authorities before departing Iran.” CNN reported on Friday that hundreds of Americans have fled Iran as the conflict with Israel has escalated, according to an internal State Department report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To onlookers at the club, Trump showed little anxiety about his decision to authorize airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities that could have profound ramifications both on US national security and his own presidential legacy. The B-2 stealth bombers carrying 30,000-pound bunker busters were preparing to take off at midnight from their base in Missouri, destined for Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Another set of planes was heading west, a deliberate attempt at misdirection as Trump demanded complete secrecy for his momentous decision. As Trump escorted around Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, to an event for new members being held in one of the clubhouse's dining rooms, he was loose and — at least in public — in an easygoing mood, people who saw him said. “I hope he's right about the AI,” Trump joked at one point, gesturing to his guest. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.” It came after days of public deliberation, as Trump alternated between issuing militaristic threats against Iran on social media and holding private concerns that a military strike could drag the US into prolonged war. Deferring the strike decision for a fortnight appeared in keeping with the mission's attempts at diversion – a tactic designed to obscure the attack plans, even though Trump held off giving a final go-ahead until Saturday, according to senior US officials. The operation began at midnight ET Friday, with the B-2 bombers launching from Missouri on an 18-hour journey that was the planes' longest mission in more than two decades, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a Sunday morning Pentagon briefing. It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security.” Discussions about potential options for American strikes on Iran began in earnest between Trump and members of his national security team during a weekend retreat at Camp David in early June, where CIA Director John Ratcliffe briefed Trump on US assessments that Israel was prepared to imminently begin strikes. Caine said Sunday that the initial assessment shows “extremely severe damage and destruction” to Iran's three nuclear sites, though he noted it will take time to determine the ultimate impact to the country's nuclear capabilities. “As the president has directed, made clear, this is most certainly not open-ended,” Hegseth said Sunday. “Doesn't mean it limits our ability to respond. The uncertainly seemed to give Trump pause, and throughout the week he said in public he hadn't yet made a decision, even if behind the scenes it appeared to Trump's advisers that his mind was made up. Trump departed his Bedminster golf club Saturday afternoon and returned to the White House for a scheduled “national security meeting” — travel that was unusual for the president on a weekend but was previewed on his daily scheduled released the day prior. The US conveyed to Iran through back-channel discussions that the strikes Trump ordered Saturday would be contained and that no further strikes were planned going forward, according to two people familiar with the discussions. In April, Trump issued an ultimatum to Iran on a potential nuclear agreement, warning Tehran to strike a deal within 60 days – by mid-June. At the same time, Trump urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on attacking Iran so he could give talks the time and space to show progress. A first round of talks was held in mid-April between the US and Tehran in Oman, led by Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Despite optimistic notes sounded following the conversations, there was little progress toward an actual nuclear deal. On June 8 – less than a week before Trumps' 60-day deadline was set to expire – he huddled with his advisers at Camp David, where he was presented with potential options on Iran. The next day, Trump and Netanyahu spoke by phone. Several weeks earlier, Netanyahu had told a group of US lawmakers that Israel was going to strike Iran — and he was not seeking permission from the US to do so. Sixty-one days after Trump's ultimatum, Israel launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders. But senior Trump officials also initially distanced themselves from the attack, issuing statements that Israel took unilateral action and the US was not involved. As Israel continued its military campaign in Israel, Trump traveled to Alberta, Canada, for a G-7 summit, only to return to Washington early “because of what's going on in the Middle East,” the White House said. Trump spent much of the past week meeting in the Situation Room with his national security team to review attack plans and their potential consequences. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement dictated by Trump: “Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.” But there were signs that diplomacy was not moving forward. Witkoff made attempts at meeting his Iranian interlocutor, Araghchi, with little luck. Ater European leaders met with Iran's foreign minister on Friday in Geneva, US officials felt it appeared the Iranians would not sit down with the US without Trump asking Netanyahu to stop Israel's attacks — something Trump was not willing to do, sources said. Ahead of Saturday's strikes, the US gave Israel a heads up it was going to attack. Netanyahu held a five-hour meeting with top Israeli officials that lasted through the US strikes, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The US had also notified some Gulf partners that it was ready to strike Iran within the coming days, but it did not specify targets and time frame, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trump and his team were in contact with top congressional Republicans before Saturday's strikes, but top Democrats were not told of his plans until after the bombs had dropped, according to multiple people familiar with the plans. The operation began at midnight Eastern Time Friday into Saturday morning. All told, over 125 aircraft were involved, including the B2s, refueling tankers, reconnaissance planes and fighter jets. ET, Caine said, a US submarine “launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets” at the Isfahan nuclear site. ET, or 2:10 a.m. local time, the lead B-2 bomber plane launched two bunker-buster bombs at Fordow nuclear site, Caine said, and the “remaining bombers then hit their targets.” Those additional targets were struck, Caine said, “between 6:40 p.m. After US planes had left Iranian airspace, Trump revealed the attack to the world on his social media platform, Truth Social. “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump wrote, adding that “a full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” CNN's Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzky, Zachary Cohen, Sarah Ferris, Betsy Klein, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, Jim Sciutto and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, several U.S. B-2 bombers deployed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, with some going east and others going west. The bombers that flew west were a decoy, Caine told reporters on Sunday morning alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Prior to crossing into Iranian airspace, a U.S. submarine in the region launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets. More than 125 aircraft were involved in the mission, Caine said. The bombers were carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, a 30,000-pound bomb designed to hit hardened underground structures, and they were used at Natanz and Fordow. Israel does not possess the MOP, so it sought U.S. involvement to target these underground facilities, though it was prepared to target them with alternative methods. While Caine said the mission resulted in “extremely severe damage,” he also said it's “way too early” to assess if Iran still has nuclear capabilities. Hegseth said it was a limited operation but that the military is prepared to conduct additional attacks if Iran retaliates against U.S. forces or interests in the region. Hegseth also noted that the operation was not about regime change in Iran. Instead, President Donald Trump “authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interest posed by the Iranian nuclear program.” Trump said on Thursday that he would take up to two weeks to decide whether the U.S. should involve itself in the conflict but made the call long before that time frame closed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States decisively entered into conflict with Iran on Saturday after President Donald Trump ordered US warplanes to drop massive bombs on three nuclear sites inside the country, thrusting him squarely into an escalating Middle East conflict even as he holds out hope the matter can be resolved diplomatically. In social media posts and during a late-night address from the White House, Trump described the bombings as entirely successful and warned Iran against retaliation. 1 state sponsor of terror,” Trump said during his four-minute speech from the White House Cross Hall. live updates Trump says Iran's key nuclear facilities were ‘totally obliterated' in US strikes “Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” Trump said, flanked by his vice president, secretary of state and defense secretary. “If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.” The debate over whether to target Iran directly had divided Trump's political coalition, with concerns high among some members of the Republican base that intervening could drag the US into a new, prolonged conflict. The US used six B-2 bombers to drop a dozen “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow nuclear site, a US official told CNN. Trump said in a message on social media that “a full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” “There is not another military in the World that could have done this,” Trump wrote. The MOP — a 30,000-pound bomb with 6,000 pounds of explosives — was designed for “reaching and destroying our adversaries' weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities,” according to a fact sheet from the US Air Force. The move to target the Fordow facility in particular, which successive US presidents had considered but ultimately decided against, will now insert Trump directly into a growing crisis that he had once hoped to defuse through diplomacy. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke Saturday evening following the strikes, two White House officials said. Trump said during his speech that he and Netanyahu had worked closely to coordinate the attacks in Iran. The Israeli leader praised Trump's decision, saying it will “change history.” Related article Trump administration briefed top Republicans before Iran strikes, but not Democrats The people of Israel thank you,” Netanyahu said in a statement. As Trump was mulling his decision, Iran had vowed to retaliate to any US aggression, and American military assets had begun massing in the region to prepare for any retaliatory action from Tehran. After his address to the nation, Trump issued a stark warning to Iran, saying any retaliation will be met with “far greater” force than the Saturday strikes. Trump had come to believe over the last several days that US forces were necessary to taking out Iran's highly fortified nuclear facilities, and made the decision when it seemed clear that diplomacy remained deadlocked. US officials had come to believe Iran was not ready to strike a satisfactory nuclear deal after Europeans leaders met with their Iranian counterparts in Geneva on Friday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN's Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The organization, Action Against Hunger (ACF), is running a project to combat malnutrition that had been relying on funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to procure much-needed therapeutic food sachets. But now, a group of former USAID staff has come together to connect big donors with cost-effective projects like this, which desperately need cash to carry out operations already in the pipeline. Related article The UK, Germany and Canada have slashed foreign aid this year, deepening damage done by US cuts, analysis shows Rosenbaum said that thinking about cuts to American programs tackling things like malnutrition, extreme poverty and disease prevention was keeping him up at night after he lost his job earlier this year. So, he and other laid-off USAID workers decided to do something. They began vetting projects being carried out by USAID partner organizations, which had abruptly lost their funding earlier this year. The spreadsheet was first inspired by reach-outs from a few small family foundations seeking expert guidance on where to best put their dollars, amid the initial uncertainty surrounding US government aid cuts. “There have been a handful of folks who have come out of the woodwork and literally written us an email that's like, ‘I set aside $100,000, $200,000, a million dollars… And this is exactly how I want to think about giving… So, help us figure out how to do this,'” he said. Earlier this week, the PRO team also launched a tool for smaller donors to contribute online, crowdfunding for some of the most critical aid projects. Now, anyone can give a one-time or monthly contribution to the team's “Rapid Response Fund” to support vetted projects in Sudan, Haiti, Nigeria and more. “Part of what we're offering for funders is that the fixed cost of standing these projects up has already been taken on by the US government. “But the flip side is that the cost of shutting them down is extraordinarily high,” he added, noting that typically it takes years for local organizations to build trust with authorities, leaders and communities. Related article US foreign aid cuts threaten decades of progress on driving down malaria In Mali, an organization called the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) was at risk of shutting down a project that delivers medical care to children under five, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as well as providing mobile health clinics to internally displaced people. “We were forced to suspend activities and reduce activities at different points,” said Carlota Ruiz, the organization's head of grant management, adding that more than half ALIMA's operating budget in Mali had come from USAID. Weeks ago, the organization was facing the prospect of shutting down vital services, but now a new grant will allow ALIMA to provide 70,000 medical consultations to people in need and treat more than 5,000 children with severe acute malnutrition. “We had a foundation reach out to us, saying that they were interested in funding our project in Mali, and that they had based this decision in large part on the analysis that the PRO had done,” Ruiz told CNN. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, ACF says it is close to securing funding to keep one of its malnutrition projects going, after coordinating with the PRO team. The funding will go towards procuring more ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). “June, July, and August, including part (of) September, are the highest months in Nigeria in terms of malnutrition and food insecurity,” the staff member, who asked not to be named, told CNN. “So having these supplies in a situation where the (other) funding mechanisms are stalled… will make a big difference in terms of continuity of lifesaving activities.” But the funding will only go towards that one project. “But this project cannot address all the other aspects of our work.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Other top congressional Democrats serving on intelligence committees were also not informed of the strikes ordered on Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday night, according to CNN. President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he had ordered strikes against Iran's Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz nuclear facilities. “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was informed beforehand, the Washington Examiner confirmed. CNN reported that Republican members of the Gang of Eight, including Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), were also informed. Six 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs were dropped on the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, according to Fox News's Sean Hannity, who spoke with Trump after the strike, and 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities by U.S. submarines. All three sites were reported to be destroyed.</p>
