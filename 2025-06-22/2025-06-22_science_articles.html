                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, even with the most powerful telescopes, we can't directly observe these earliest stars, so determining their properties is one of the biggest challenges in astronomy. Now, an international group of astronomers led by the University of Cambridge have shown that we will be able to learn about the masses of the earliest stars by studying a specific radio signal - created by hydrogen atoms filling the gaps between star-forming regions - originating just a hundred million years after the Big Bang. By studying how the first stars and their remnants affected this signal, called the 21-centimeter signal, the researchers have shown that future radio telescopes will help us understand the very early universe, and how it transformed from a nearly homogeneous mass of mostly hydrogen to the incredible complexity we see today. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Astronomy. "This is a unique opportunity to learn how the universe's first light emerged from the darkness," said co-author Professor Anastasia Fialkov from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. "The transition from a cold, dark universe to one filled with stars is a story we're only beginning to understand." This signal, influenced by the radiation from early stars and black holes, provides a rare window into the universe's infancy. Although REACH, which captures radio signals, is still in its calibration stage, it promises to reveal data about the early universe. Meanwhile, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) -- a massive array of antennas under construction -- will map fluctuations in cosmic signals across vast regions of the sky. They found that previous studies have underestimated this connection as they did not account for the number and brightness of X-ray binaries - binary systems made of a normal star and a collapsed star - among Population III stars, and how they affect the 21-centimeter signal. Unlike optical telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, which capture vivid images, radio astronomy relies on statistical analysis of faint signals. REACH and SKA will not be able to image individual stars, but will instead provide information about entire populations of stars, X-ray binary systems and galaxies. "We show evidence that our radio telescopes can tell us details about the mass of those first stars and how these early lights may have been very different from today's stars. The research was supported in part by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Anastasia Fialkov is a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physicists Prof. Dr. Ingo Rehberg from the University of Bayreuth and Dr. Peter Blümler from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz have developed and experimentally validated an innovative approach for generating homogeneous magnetic fields using permanent magnets. Their method outperforms the classical Halbach arrangement -- which is optimal only for infinitely long and therefore unrealizable magnets -- by producing higher field strengths and improved homogeneity in compact, finite-sized configurations. Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated over relatively large spatial regions through the targeted arrangement of permanent magnets. A well-known example of an effective design is the so-called Halbach array. However, this approach is based on the idealized assumption that very long -- ideally infinitely long -- magnets (line dipoles) can be arranged in a circle in such a way that the individual contributions superimpose to produce a homogeneous magnetic field in the center region. In their work, Peter Blümler and Ingo Rehberg present optimal three-dimensional arrangements of very compact magnets, idealized by point dipoles. For these new arrangements, Rehberg and Blümler developed analytical formulas, which they subsequently validated experimentally. To this end, they constructed magnet arrays from 16 FeNdB cuboids mounted on 3D-printed supports. The resulting magnetic fields were measured and compared with theoretical predictions, revealing excellent agreement. The new design concepts offer great potential for applications in which strong and homogeneous magnetic fields are required. These nuclei are then excited by radio waves, generating measurable voltages in detectors surrounding the body. Algorithms use these signals to calculate detailed cross-sectional images that allow physicians to distinguish tissue types based on properties such as density, water or fat content and diffusion. However, superconducting magnets are technically complex and extremely costly, making this technology hardly available in many parts of the world. For such cases, intensive research is underway to develop alternative methods for generating homogeneous magnetic fields using permanent magnets -- a field to which the present study makes a promising contribution. Further potential areas of application include particle accelerators and magnetic levitation systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers at Rice University have discovered a surprisingly simple method for vastly improving the stability of electrochemical devices that convert carbon dioxide into useful fuels and chemicals, and it involves nothing more than sending the CO2 through an acid bubbler. Their study, published in Science, addresses a major bottleneck in the performance and stability of CO2 reduction systems: the buildup of salt that clogs gas flow channels, reduces efficiency and causes the devices to fail prematurely. Electrochemical CO2 reduction, or CO2RR, is an emerging green technology that uses electricity, ideally from renewable sources, to transform climate-warming CO2 into valuable products like carbon monoxide, ethylene or alcohols. However, practical implementation has been hindered by poor system stability. "This typically happens within a few hundred hours, which is far from commercial viability." To combat this, the Rice team tried an elegant twist on a standard procedure. Because the salts formed with these acids are much more soluble than potassium bicarbonate, they don't crystallize and block the channels. In contrast, systems using standard water-humidified CO2 failed after about 80 hours because of salt buildup. The researchers also demonstrated that the method could be scaled without compromising performance with large-scale devices maintaining energy efficiency and avoiding salt blockage over extended periods. They observed minimal corrosion or damage to the anion exchange membranes that are typically sensitive to chloride by keeping the acid concentrations low. The approach was also shown to be compatible with commonly used membranes and materials, reinforcing its potential for integration into existing systems. To observe salt formation in real time, the team used custom-built reactors with transparent flow plates. Under conventional water humidification, salt crystals began forming within 48 hours. With acid-humidified CO2, however, no significant crystal accumulation was observed even after hundreds of hours, and any small deposits were eventually dissolved and carried out of the system. "Using the traditional method of water-humidified CO2 could lead to salt formation in the cathode gas flow channels," said co-first author Shaoyun Hao, postdoctoral research associate in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Rice. "We hypothesized -- and confirmed -- that acid vapor could dissolve the salt and convert the low solubility KHCO3 into salt with higher solubility, thus shifting the solubility balance just enough to avoid clogging without affecting catalyst performance." The simplicity of the approach, involving only small tweaks to existing humidification setups, means it can be adopted without significant redesigns or added costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than a decade, ticagrelor (Brilinta in the US and Brilique in Europe) has been recommended for patients with acute coronary syndrome -- a range of conditions related to sudden reduced blood flow to the heart. Now, as generic versions of the drug prepare to launch this year, The BMJ has expanded its investigation, looking at two key platelet studies that AstraZeneca claimed explained ticagrelor's ability to treat acute coronary syndrome successfully. What's more, one active trial investigator never became a study author, while one author told The BMJ he was not involved in the trial, and most investigators, including the principal investigator, were unreachable or declined to be interviewed. Victor Serebruany, an adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University and ticagrelor's most renowned critic, told The BMJ that "there are episodes of skyrocketing rebound and profound platelet inhibition after ticagrelor making patients prone to thrombosis or bleeding. If doctors had known what happened in these trials, they would never have started using ticagrelor." Circulation and AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment. Serebruany added: "It's been obvious for years that there is something wrong with the data. We all need to know how and why that happened."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What he hoped to destroy forever was recently found by archaeologists, giving experts a fresh perspective on the life of Continental soldiers during the Revolutionary War. As crews made way for the construction of a new sports center on Colonial Williamsburg Foundation property, archaeologists first took to the area to see if 18th century maps and period documents referencing the construction of barracks in 1776 through 1777 produced any archaeological fruit. They have plenty to pick from, as the nearly four-acre site has artifacts showing both the barracks and everyday life of soldiers. Archaeologists have excavated only a small section of the area—the sports center was shifted on the site to ensure future exploration of the barracks—but the team has already found bricks and an intact chimney base, gun hardware, lead musket shot with toothmarks, high-end ceramics, and personal items likely owned by officers. Those barracks didn't last long, though, with Gary saying a report from a soldier describes the burning of the barracks by British troops while they moved toward Yorktown in 1781. “Later on, after the Cornwallis troops moved through, they could see the barracks on fire in the distance … For us as archaeologists, this is a burning event, which is a catastrophic event,” Gary tells Fox News. “But it can also lend itself to really good preservation.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of solar physicists has released a new study shedding light on the fine-scale structure of the Sun's surface. Using the unparalleled power of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, built and operated by the NSF National Solar Observatory (NSO) on Maui, scientists have observed, for the first time ever in such high detail, ultra-narrow bright and dark stripes on the solar photosphere, offering unprecedented insight into how magnetic fields shape solar surface dynamics at scales as small as 20 kilometers (or 12.4 miles). The level of detail achieved allows us to clearly link these stripes to the ones we see in state-of-the-art simulations -- so we can better understand their nature. These stripes, called striations and seen against the walls of solar convection cells known as granules, are the result of curtain-like sheets of magnetic fields that ripple and shift like fabric blowing in the wind. "These striations are the fingerprints of fine-scale magnetic field variations." This is the sharpest ever achieved in solar astronomy. "Magnetism is a fundamental phenomenon in the universe, and similar magnetically induced stripes have also been observed in more distant astrophysical objects, such as molecular clouds," shares NSO scientist and co-author of the study Dr. Han Uitenbroek. "Inouye's high resolution, in combination with simulations, allows us to better characterize the behavior of magnetic fields in a broad astrophysical context." This discovery not only enhances our understanding of this architecture but also opens the door to studying magnetic structures in other astrophysical contexts -- and at small scales once thought unachievable from Earth. "This is just one of many firsts for the Inouye, demonstrating how it continues to push the frontier of solar research," says NSO Associate Director for the NSF Inouye Solar Telescope, Dr. David Boboltz. "It also underscores Inouye's vital role in understanding the small-scale physics that drive space weather events that impact our increasingly technological society here on Earth."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, a new breakthrough in quantum physics may have just sped up the timeline. But before this can happen, there is a significant obstacle that must be overcome. “Quantum systems have always been extremely susceptible to noise,” says lead researcher Tomohiro Itogawa. “Even the slightest perturbation in temperature or a single wayward photon from an external source can easily ruin a quantum computer setup, making it useless. Noise is absolutely the number one enemy of quantum computers.” Thus, scientists have become very interested in building so-called fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are robust enough to continue computing accurately even when subject to noise. Magic state distillation, in which a single high-fidelity quantum state is prepared from many noisy ones, is a popular method for creating such systems. “The distillation of magic states is traditionally a very computationally expensive process because it requires many qubits,” explains Keisuke Fujii, senior author. Following this line of inquiry, the team was inspired to create a “level-zero” version of magic state distillation, in which a fault-tolerant circuit is developed at the physical qubit or “zeroth” level as opposed to higher, more abstract levels. Whether one calls it magic or physics, this technique certainly marks an important step toward the development of larger-scale quantum computers that can withstand noise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings challenge claims that seed oils are harmful to cardiometabolic health. Linoleic acid, which is found in vegetable oils -- especially seed oils like soybean and corn oil -- and plant foods, is the primary omega-6 fatty acid consumed in the diet. "There has been increasing attention on seed oils, with some claiming these oils promote inflammation and raise cardiometabolic risk," said Kevin C. Maki, Ph.D., adjunct professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington and chief scientist at Midwest Biomedical Research. "Our study, based on almost 1,900 people, found that higher linoleic acid in blood plasma was associated with lower levels of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, including those related to inflammation." The new results are consistent with those from observational studies that have shown higher intake of linoleic acid to be associated with lower risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. "Although other studies have assessed relationships between linoleic acid and cardiometabolic risk factors, our study used objective biomarkers rather than diet records or food frequency questionnaires to assess linoleic acid intake," said Maki. Specifically, study participants with higher linoleic acid showed lower levels of glucose and insulin as well as HOMA-IR, a biomarker of insulin resistance. They also had lower levels of inflammation biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetyls, and serum amyloid A. "We saw consistent results across the different biomarkers measured," Maki said. "People with higher levels of linoleic acid in their blood tended to have a healthier overall risk profile for heart disease and diabetes." Next, they plan to investigate how different types of oils with varying fatty acid content affect cardiometabolic risk factors.
