The first photos of Ryan Murphy‘s next series “American Love Story” have generated controversy, a full seven months before its February 2026 premiere date — and Murphy is hitting back. The couple died in 1999 when a plane Kennedy was piloting crashed. The photo series, featuring Paul Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon in character as Kennedy and Bessette, was posted to Instagram June 13, setting off a week-long firestorm of heated internet and think-piece debate. Related Stories ‘The Americas' Narrator Tom Hanks Would Trade ‘Dad' Nickname for ‘The Best Park Ranger They've Ever Heard' Stay in LA Group Pushes Los Angeles to Streamline Production Permits as State Awaits $750 Million Tax Credits In a June 16 “The Cut” piece, author Danya Issawi criticized the style choices for Kennedy and Bessette. “These do not appear to be the understated, tailored, and soft-yet-structured Calvin Klein, Prada, and Yohji Yamamoto garments Bessette-Kennedy wore in the '90s, nor are they reminiscent of them,” Issawi wrote, taking specific issue with the fashion items looking like “modern-day replicas of their '90s counterparts.” In an interview with Vogue, Bessette's hair colorist Brad Johns piled on, “No one would believe that Carolyn in the '90s would ever have that color from me. “Why didn't Vogue call us and ask, ‘Let's talk about your decisions. “It's interesting because Vogue called several times with interest in covering the show, but one of the first things they write is this without even checking with our us?” Murphy also told Variety that several of the pieces in the photo were not final. “We're writing a story about a person – an unknown person – who falls in love with the most famous man in the world and suddenly she can't leave her house. Joining in the critical chorus was actual Kennedy Jack Schlossberg (here's a family tree for those curious), who said the family was not involved in the production. “See, the right to privacy — which includes the ability to control your own name, image, and likeness — doesn't survive death in the state of New York, and for that matter, he's considered a public figure,” Scholssberg said in an Instagram video. “So, there's not much we can do. But I hope those making these shows take seriously what he stood for in his life, all that he achieved in it. And that they donate some of the profits to what they're making to the John F. Kennedy Library. But I think it would be really hard if your relatives are always in the media.” Murphy's series are no stranger to controversy. Both “Monsters” seasons, each of which tackled real life murderers, ignited heated debates. One of those subjects, Erik Menendez, even an issued a statement himself criticizing the show. “I think it's interesting that he's issued a statement without having seen the show.” Murphy told Entertainment Tonight at the time — a quote he seems to be echo in the Kennedy-Bessette brouhaha.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After President Donald Trump's decision to strike three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, administration officials are barely bothering to pretend the unprecedented — and potentially calamitous — attacks were motivated by new intelligence suggesting Iran was on the brink of having nuclear weapons. Just months ago, Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified to Congress, in her opening statement, that the U.S. intel community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and had not reauthorized its nuclear weapons program. While Trump recently publicly disputed Gabbard's testimony, according to two administration officials with knowledge of internal deliberations in recent weeks, the president's decision to strike was not driven by any new U.S. intelligence on Iran. “There is no intel,” says one of the officials, who were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Iran posed no imminent threat of attack to the United States,” he wrote on social media. Trump's attacks on Iran constitute an act of war — and could set off a new, long-term conflict with potential to grow into something much larger. Trump did not claim on Saturday that he launched the attacks because Iran was close to having a nuclear weapon — as he had suggested earlier in the week. The Trump administration has since attempted to recast Gabbard's comments before Congress, because, after she said Iran was “not building a nuclear weapon,” she had added: “Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.” Gabbard posted on X on Friday, “The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division. America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.” GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley Defends Wind Energy After Trump Calls It ‘Junk' Mahmoud Khalil Says He'll ‘Continue to Protest' Following ICE Detention Release Trump's Admin Is Policing Foreign Students' Social Media for ‘Political Activism' She points to a statement earlier this month from U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Michael Kurilla, who asserted that Iran's “current [uranium] stockpiles and the available centrifuges across several enrichment plants are sufficient to produce its first 25 kg of weapons-grade materials in roughly one week and enough for up to 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks.” Not long ago, Trump was working to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran — a development that was somewhat ironic given Trump had withdrawn from Barack Obama's Iran deal in his first term as president. Across the federal government, senior officials and policymakers aren't pretending that Trump's claims of an imminent nuclear threat are built on anything but vibes, whether intentionally manufactured or not. Vance was asked whether Trump had moved to attack Iran based on U.S. intelligence or rather intel provided by Israel, which has been attacking Iranian nuclear and military sites, officials, and scientists since June 13. “Of course, we share intelligence with a lot of agencies, British, Israeli and so forth, but it was our intelligence that motivated us to act,” Vance said, before quickly pivoting. … If you believe, as we did, that the Iranians are rushing towards a nuclear weapons program while simultaneously refusing to negotiate, how can we do anything but take serious action against this program?” Bonnaroo Pivots to Full Refunds for Canceled Festival, 'Not Announcing Future Dates' Dr. Demento, Madcap Radio DJ Who Launched Weird Al's Career, Announces Retirement “That's irrelevant,” Rubio said, saying it didn't matter if such an order was given.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the track, staying in her lane was essential for Olympic champion Allyson Felix, the most decorated track and field athlete of all time. To stray outside the lines would mean instant disqualification. Off the track, Felix faced a different kind of pressure to stay in her lane – keeping on good terms with her primary sponsor, Nike. It came as shocking news, then, when Felix publicly took on the company in 2019, writing a New York Times op-ed that criticized the corporation's maternity policies governing its roster of female stars. Bentonville Film Festival: 'Rosemead,' 'The Librarians,' 'Sovereign' Win Awards, Lucy Liu Receives Rising to The Challenge Honor “I've been one of Nike's most widely marketed athletes. If I can't secure maternity protections, who can?” she wrote. It's one example of a sports industry where the rules are still mostly made for and by men.” “I was the type of athlete who I just put my head down,” Felix observed during a Q&A at Bentonville moderated by Deadline. “I did try to stay in my lane for so long. And so this idea of speaking out was so uncomfortable, but I think the one thing that really gave me that push and that courage was becoming a mother — and becoming a mother to a daughter. Then 32, Felix understood she couldn't hope to dominate her sport much longer. So did Nike, which offered her a 70 percent pay cut. “They thought I was just done,” Felix says in the film. Clauses were built into the proposed contract incentivizing Felix if she kept reaching podiums, and penalizing her financially if she didn't. Complicating matters for Felix, she very much wanted to become pregnant with her husband, Kenneth Ferguson. Recovering from a pregnancy would postpone attempts to rack up more medals, jeopardizing her income. It's a dilemma, of course, that male athletes don't encounter. As the film documents, tense negotiations continued between Felix, her older brother Wes Felix – who manages her career – and Nike. The clear inference is that Nike didn't want to establish a precedent for other women athletes in its stable. “For someone like Allyson, as she said, staying in her own lane, being the good girl, doing the right thing — to go up against a company like that, it's phenomenal,” executive producer Tonya Lewis Lee observed at the Q&A. “And not only that, I mean she got them to change their policy.” As the New York Times reported, within only a few months of Felix publishing her op-ed, following “broad public outcry and a congressional inquiry, Nike announced a new maternity policy for all sponsored athletes… The new contract guarantees an athlete's pay and bonuses for 18 months around pregnancy. Three other athletic apparel companies added maternity protections for sponsored athletes.” Matt O'Neill, the co-director, calls what Felix achieved a major win. O'Neill said Nike has not commented publicly on the film since its world premiere at Tribeca. “But we went to Nike with a series of questions [during production] because there's lots of things that are said in the film, and we wanted to have their point of view on things that were said. And based on that conversation, nothing changed in the film.” “I've been a very private person for the majority of my life and so it really was so different and a big decision to decide to do this,” she said of participating in the documentary. During her career, Felix won multiple golds in solo events and in relays – the latter being the very definition of a joint endeavor. “They just put me at ease; it was very comfortable through the years that they followed me and I think it was able to translate really, really well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The country star was joined on opening night by NFL legend Andre Johnson and Jim "Mattress Mack" McIngvale. Morgan Wallen didn't disappoint fans on the second night of his I'm the Problem tour stop in Houston on Saturday (June 21). After kicking off the weekend with a surprise appearance by NFL legend Andre Johnson and Houston businessman Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale on Friday at NRG Stadium, the 32-year-old country star had more star power in store for night two. Dressed in a black Kid Rock T-shirt, Wallen walked out flanked by Drake and Clemens as the singer's “Broadway Girls,” featuring Lil Durk, played in the background. Morgan also shared the walkout moment on Instagram, set to Drake's 2011 track “Under Ground Kings.”  “All summer long,” he captioned the post. Diplo took to the comments, writing, “Man can't be stopped.” This isn't the first time Wallen and Drake have teamed up. Wallen's dramatic walkout moments at NRG Stadium have become a hallmark of his live shows, with past surprise guests including Travis Kelce, Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. The back-to-back concerts in Houston launched Wallen's 20-date I'm the Problem tour, which runs through Sept. 13 and hits 10 cities across the U.S. His next stop is a two-night run at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisc., on June 28–29. The tour features an all-star lineup of supporting acts, including Koe Wetzel, Miranda Lambert, Brooks & Dunn, Ella Langley, Gavin Adcock and Thomas Rhett.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We explore some of Wikipedia's oddities in our 7,021,436-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole. Upon recovering, they claimed they had died and their body had been reanimated with a new soul, sent by God to preach the good word. Thereafter, they wore androgynous clothes, and no longer used gendered pronouns or their birth name. Biggest controversy: The Friend's reinvention may have been because of outside pressure. after their transition, citing, “pride and ambition to distinguish [them]self from the rest of mankind.” Strangest fact: Maybe less “strange” than “noteworthy”—the Friend built a successful congregation, the Universal Friends, the first religious community founded by an American. Their theology, however, was nearly identical to mainstream Quaker thought, to the point where one of the Friend's two published works was plagiarized wholesale from early English Quaker Isaac Penington. Like mainstream Quakers, the Friend preached abolition (and had a racially integrated congregation). Thing we were happiest to learn: While the Friend preached sexual abstinence, they eventually found love. At least, as far as we can tell—Wikipedia uses the “these women who lived together for decades and raised a child together were very, very good friends” tone well-known to readers of history. Sarah adopted similarly androgynous dress, planned the house they built and lived in together for the rest of her life, and left her child in the Friend's care after her death in 1793. Thing we were unhappiest to learn: The Friend made some enemies. Like so many outside-the-mainstream congregations, they founded a utopian community in Upstate New York. Jerusalem, NY (which still exists, with a population of roughly 4,400), was settled by the Universal Friends, but only after several land ownership disputes. The daytime sky growing dark on New England's Dark Day, in May of that year, was seen as confirmation of the prophecy. In fact, smoke from forest fires and heavy cloud clover were the only horsemen about that day. It took a mere 245 years after the Friend's coming out for the State Department to add an “X” gender marker for nonbinary passport holders. Convicted felon Donald Trump reversed this policy earlier this year, as part of his ongoing efforts to strip LGBTQ+ Americans of basic rights. Those rights became a hot-button political issue through the lens of sports. Although trans athletes had been competing under NCAA rules since 2012 with no issues, Trump began fabricating wild stories of public schools performing trans surgeries on the campaign trail, and those delusions are now affecting civil rights law. For example, former Los Angeles Dodger and Oakland A Glenn Burke was not only the first Major League baseball player to come out as gay, he also invented the high five.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, “American Idol” host Ryan Seacrest always makes headlines when he's photographed with a new woman by his side. Longtime NBC News correspondent Andrea Canning, best known for her crime reporting on “Dateline,” posted a nearly 30-year-old photo on social media of herself and Seacrest, with her arms wrapped around his neck. She tagged him and wrote, “Throwing it back to 1997 @ryanseacrest #roomies” Another commented, “we need the tea.😂” and someone else chimed in, “So. In 2013, Seacrest revealed on his KISS-FM radio show how he and Canning became roommates, according to Us Weekly. Living in Los Angeles with two other guys, all in their early 20s, he said they decided “that we should look for a stranger” to be their fourth roommate. “But, even better, we should have a girl stranger move in who can help us recruit (women) because we were 22 and completely single,” he told his co-hosts. “At the time when we were going out, it was much easier to meet a girl if we had a girl with us, as opposed to just three guys being together. Canning then called into the show, Us Weekly reported, and reminded Seacrest, “I met you at one of your raging parties. We all ended up having those parties, but that's what I remember the most. The two reminisced about stocking up on beer at Costco and Canning recalled, “Our parties became so legendary that we had to move, remember? There were too many people and the neighborhood was plain.” When the photo of Seacrest and Canning was taken in 1997, he was still five years away from making his debut on “American Idol,” the show that would change his life. Seacrest managed to land a radio gig in L.A., as well as some small TV shows, including a kids' game show started by one of his heroes, TV legend Merv Griffin, who also created “Wheel of Fortune,” which Seacrest began hosting in 2024. “I was on the radio in Los Angeles doing afternoon drive,” he told iHeartRadio's Math & Magic in 2024 about his big break on “Idol,” noting, “I had been on television a little bit and gotten some good experience, but nothing at the level with the impact of what was about to come.” He and Canning, meanwhile, were roommates while she was in L.A. working as a field producer for the entertainment TV show “Extra.” Her bio states that she moved to Ontario, Canada in 1997 to work as a reporter for two years before moving on to Miami before getting scooped up by ABC News in 2004, per her online bio.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daryl Dixon is heading to Spain in the new season of his eponymous The Walking Dead spinoff, premiering on Sunday, September 7 at 9 pm ET/PT on AMC and AMC+. A new teaser can be found above, and first-look photos below. In The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, Daryl (Norman Reedus) washes ashore in France and struggles to understand how he got there and why. The show's second season, The Book of Carol, picked up where Season 1 left off, following Daryl Dixon and Carol Peletier. They both confront old demons while she fights to find her friend and he struggles with his decision to stay in France, causing tension at the Nest. Additionally, Genet's (Anne Charrier) movement builds momentum, setting Pouvoir on a violent collision course with the Union of Hope in the fight for France's future.

Additional cast includes Candela Saitta, Hugo Arbués, Greta Fernández, Gonzalo Bouza, Hada Nieto, Yassmine Othman, Cuco Usín, and Stephen Merchant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was lots of slime, but also inspiration and maybe a little controversy. My main takeaway from the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards is that kids like pretty much the same musical artists as everybody else. Sabrina Carpenter won favorite album for Short n' Sweet, just as she had won the Grammy for best pop vocal album in February. These four artists could have been winners on just about any show. Kendrick Lamar and SZA took favorite music collaboration for “luther,” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks and could very well be headed to a Grammy win for record of the year early next year. (The song's namesake, Luther Vandross, died in 2005, long before most of the current Kids' Choice Awards audience was even born.) Ariana Grande won favorite movie actress for playing Glinda in that blockbuster film and also took favorite song from a movie as a featured artist on Cynthia Erivo's “Defying Gravity.” While slime, and lots of it, is the clearly main attraction on this show, several of the winners snuck inspiring and important messages into their acceptance speeches. Own your space in this world and know that you are chosen for greatness.” benny blanco made a similar point when he accepted (in-person) favorite viral song for “Bluest Flame,” a collab with his girlfriend, Selena Gomez (who wasn't present). I just can't thank each and every one of you enough for voting. I will continue to make these clean versions of these songs for you, and I'm so grateful that you're listening.” Auli'i Caravalho accepted the award for favorite female animated voice from a movie for Moana 2, capping her speech by saying, “Our first film taught us the importance of righting the imbalance between man and nature and the second film tells us how important it is to welcome people from faraway shores.” In the past, that latter comment would have seemed unremarkable, but in these highly-charged times it seemed to be touching on a hot-button issue. It came at the end of his acceptance speech for the King of Comedy Award, where he was inevitably slimed, yet he said, “Are you kidding me? The King of Comedy award was presented by Black's Nacho Libre co-stars Ana de la Reguera and Héctor Jiménez, who, Black noted, came from Mexico to present the award. “Viva Mexico,” Black said, another comment that would have seemed innocuous not so long ago but suddenly seemed highly topical. There were two musical performances: “cliché,” by mgk, from his upcoming seventh studio album, Lost Americana, and “Gnarly,” by KATSEYE, from their upcoming second EP, Beautiful Chaos. mgk (wearing a Lost Americana T-shirt) was introduced by his daughter, Casie Baker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the fun things about seeing a guy like James Gunn get elevated into being the head of his own superhero studio—specifically, DC Studios, which Gunn now co-runs with Peter Safran—is that he doesn't stop being the same James Gunn who used to constantly run his mouth on social media. We can't be one hundred percent sure, for instance, but we're pretty sure this is the first time we've ever heard a studio head tell the collective internet to get off one of his creatives' nuts. The nutbearer in question being The Batman director Matt Reeves, who's been working for some time on a script for a sequel to his out-of-continuity—Gunn calls them Elseworlds, nodding to an old-school DC Comics designator—blockbuster. I mean, you like his movie because of Matt. So let Matt do things the way he does.” Reeves' nuts suitably defended, Gunn also gave some insight into how he and Safran divide up their duties at DC Studios, which breaks down about how you'd expect. (Gunn handles the creative side of things, while Safran—who came up as a talent manager before moving into producing, where he made Warner Bros. enormous amounts of money with The Conjuring and Aquaman—takes the lead on more business-minded matters.) That's in addition to fielding a lot of questions about what's coming next, including Gunn talking around whatever his next directorial project will be. Discovery's David Zaslav when he got the job, and he's refused to announce it because “I felt like it was too easy to rip off by another company.”) There's also lots of the standard checking in on projects: The Sgt. Rock movie Luca Guadagnino recently dipped out on is still in the works (“Right now it wasn't exactly where I wanted it to be creatively”); Amazon-focused Paradise Lost is “slow-moving” but “moving along.” (And is only loosely connected to whatever DC's doing next with Wonder Woman.) Supergirl has already been filmed, Peacemaker season 2 has just wrapped filming, and Clayface is coming up on the schedule, having been basically wished into existence by Mike Flanagan. And, of course, The Batman Part II is coming someday… just as soon as we all take our collective leave of Matt Reeves' beleaguered nuts.
