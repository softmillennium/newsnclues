                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since then, the price has jumped up and down but it has been standing below the 21-day EMA during all of this time. During this same period, rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and BNB Chain (BNB) have performed much better as investors have been quite pessimistic about Ethereum's outlook. The market is waiting for the official implementation of Ethereum's Pectra upgrade as it could improve the EVM's ability to scale by prioritizing top validators through a higher staking requirement and giving layer-two protocols like Arbitrum a mechanism to increase their transaction validation speeds. All of these dApp contribute to generate high transaction volumes every day and stabilize the network's throughput. However, the price had not made a lower low as it has now and this is a reason to be concerned about what could come next for ETH. Sure, there were multiple failed breakouts along the way, but they showed that bullish momentum was picking up its pace. As of today, ETH has not managed to break above its 21-day EMA. If that bullish breakout occurs, the price could rally to $1,900 first. This is an important area of resistance as this year's volume profile shows that it was the one with the second highest trading volumes. If ETH does climb and breaks above that level, this could lead to a strong uptrend as levels above that mark have lower volumes, meaning that bulls will encounter less resistance to push the price higher. Meanwhile, a break below the token's most recent low at $1,375 could plunge ETH to $1,155 and invalidate this scenario. For now, momentum is on the side of bulls but market conditions are challenging and the macro backdrop is still quite unfavorable so it would be no surprise that ETH drops to lower levels this year if the U.S. economy deteriorates, inflation moves higher, or the Fed decides not to lower rates at all this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Regarding news, fresh developments around ETFs, cryptocurrency regulations and adoption dominate media discourse. Bitcoin price has stabilized within a 2% narrow range between $83,000 and $85,000 for the better part of this week. The calming trend comes after volatile reactions to Trump's tariffs announcements in early April triggered intense turbulence, driving BTC to multi-month lows below $75,000. Notably, BTC has managed to avoid a detour below the $80,000 level this week, signaling that weak hands may have been shaken out of the market recently. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs flipped into buying mode, acquiring $106.9 million, according to Farside data. BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC took in $81 million and $25.9 million apiece, while the other funds remained muted on the data, per Farside data. Daily trading volume plunged to $83.8 billion, reflecting a notable cooldown in risk appetite after an aggressive early-week rally. Bitcoin (BTC) held steady at $84,510, up 3% over the past 7 days, while Ethereum (ETH) failed to break out, hovering at $1,590 with only a 0.2% weekly gain. Meanwhile, XRP retreated slightly to $2.07, with momentum fading after a 3.6% weekly rise. Friday's market movement reveals a clear shift in capital from altcoins back toward Bitcoin and stablecoins, as investors brace for regulatory uncertainty. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) delay in approving or denying Grayscale's Ethereum spot ETF staking, previously expected by April 17, has weighed heavily on sentiment. While the SEC invoked its statutory right under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the decision window by up to 90 days, this sudden procedural move has triggered short-term caution across top altcoin markets. This hesitation is particularly evident in Solana and XRP, which had attracted speculative capital tied to ETF optimism and political tailwinds. At the time of publication, SOL has stumbled below $135 support, after posting 7% gains on Thursday as a Canadian firm announced the launch of worlds' first SOL ETF. Affirming the bearish sentiment, Ripple (XRP) price has also reversed toward $2 after rallying on Ripple and reaching a consensus with the SEC to pause all appeals in its long-running lawsuit. The stalling of these top altcoins, alongside a slight uptick in stablecoins like USDC and USDT, suggests that institutional and large retail capital is rotating defensively while awaiting clarity from US regulators. Authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the document outlines a strategic refocus on crimes involving direct harm, such as investor fraud, terrorism financing, and money laundering through crypto. The memo suggests a reduced emphasis on broader regulatory crackdowns, marking a departure from the Biden-era approach that targeted compliance failures and structural violations by crypto firms. Richard Kim, a former executive at Galaxy Digital, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has been arrested on securities and wire fraud charges. According to an FBI affidavit, Kim induced investors under false pretenses and lost significant amounts through high-risk crypto bets. Privacy-focused crypto platform eXch has announced it will shut down operations following sustained pressure from a transatlantic crackdown targeting the project over alleged illicit activity facilitation. Despite distancing itself from being a mixer, the platform said it faced consistent misinterpretation from regulators and intelligence agencies regarding its privacy tools. As part of its wind-down, eXch will donate 50 BTC to fund open-source privacy initiatives across Bitcoin, Thorchain, and Ethereum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) is likely headed for a period of heightened volatility as 170,000 BTC — worth over $14 billion at its current price of $84,500 — have moved from wallets held for three to six months, a cohort often linked to market turning points, CryptoQuant warned in a post. On-chain behavior from this group has historically served as an early signal for major price action, according to the post. Mid-term holders are typically considered to be traders that hold a cryptocurrency for anywhere between three to 12 months. They tend to be more reactive to market conditions than long-term holders but less impulsive than short-term traders, making their movements especially telling during transitional periods. In either case, analysts view this as a sign that a sharp move is coming, though the direction remains unclear. A similar pattern emerged ahead of previous surges and corrections, including during 2021's bull run and 2022's capitulation. Bitcoin has been trading between $75,000 and $87,000 over the past months as tensions between the U.S. and other countries as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies have caused anxiety in markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>17, Ameen Soleimani posted a detailed thread on X that sharply critiqued what he sees as Ethereum's (ETH) growing detachment from practical concerns. Soleimani's comments were framed as a response to a values-oriented post by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, which had been endorsed and shared by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In his posts, Soleimani challenged what he described as Ethereum's reliance on abstract ideals and aspirational messaging, arguing that these narratives often obscure the real challenges facing the network. He expressed concern that the culture around Ethereum risks becoming too comfortable with vague slogans at the expense of accountability and grounded problem-solving. He is best known as the creator of MolochDAO, a decentralized funding collective launched in 2019 to support Ethereum infrastructure. He co-founded SpankChain, an adult content platform built on Ethereum that explored use cases in direct crypto payments and censorship resistance. He also backed RAI, a decentralized, non-pegged stablecoin developed by Reflexer Labs, and participated in public discussions around Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused protocol currently under legal scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. One of the more pointed issues raised in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's continued dependence on centralized stablecoins. While Ethereum presents itself as a platform for decentralized finance, a large share of its day-to-day activity is still conducted through assets issued by private companies. According to DeFiLlama, the combined value of USDT and USDC deployed across Ethereum exceeds $100 billion. These tokens serve as core collateral in lending markets, key trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, and settlement mechanisms across a wide range of DeFi protocols. Their widespread integration has made them foundational to many applications built on Ethereum. Both USDT and USDC are issued by companies that operate under national regulatory regimes. These issuers maintain fiat-denominated reserves, publish regular attestations, and possess the authority to freeze or blacklist wallet addresses. While such powers are used sparingly, their existence introduces a form of counterparty risk that sits uneasily with Ethereum's broader decentralization narrative. At the protocol level, Ethereum remains open, permissionless, and resistant to censorship. But the tools most commonly used within its application layer rely on infrastructure that can be altered or restricted by centralized actors. It highlights how decentralization in Ethereum is not evenly distributed across all layers, especially in the context of financial instruments that are susceptible to regulatory oversight and issuer control. Another area of concern in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's evolving relationship with political systems. While the protocol is often described as apolitical and neutral, recent developments show that its broader ecosystem is increasingly interacting with legal frameworks and policy discussions across jurisdictions. This shift does not alter Ethereum's core design, which remains permissionless and open. However, it reflects a growing need for engagement with regulators, particularly as the network supports more capital, users, and applications. Infrastructure tied to Ethereum — including validator operators, custodians, and development teams — frequently operates under national laws and is subject to local compliance requirements. Many of these entities are based in jurisdictions with active enforcement regimes. As of April 2025, Ethernodes data indicates that over half of all active Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries like the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, where crypto-related legal obligations are well established. While these interactions remain informal, they suggest a deliberate effort to contribute to policy formation, without necessarily steering the protocol in any political direction. As Ethereum becomes more embedded in real-world finance and infrastructure, the need for legal clarity increases. Protocol developers, node operators, and wallet providers often require stable regulatory environments to mitigate operational risks. Meanwhile, policymakers increasingly seek technical input to inform emerging regulation. Ethereum remains decentralized at the base layer and does not rely on state endorsement for its technical operation. Soleimani's thread also takes aim at the Ethereum community's embrace of “permissionless innovation,” a principle rooted in the idea that anyone should be able to build without needing approval. While this concept has driven much of Ethereum's early growth, Soleimani argues that its consequences are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. One of the most prominent examples he cites is Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol launched via autonomous smart contracts on Ethereum. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the protocol, alleging that it facilitated money laundering for criminal actors, including North Korea's Lazarus Group. Storm now faces charges related to money laundering, violations of international sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money services business — charges that carry a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years. He is especially critical of the belief that developers do not need legal support. These briefs argue that writing and deploying open-source code should be protected under free speech, and that creators of decentralized tools should not be held liable for misuse by third parties. While these positions have gained support within parts of the crypto industry, they remain legally uncertain. The right to build remains intact at a technical level, but the legal risks tied to privacy tools and cross-border transactions are growing. In Soleimani's view, defending permissionless innovation now requires more than idealism. Soleimani also raises concerns about Ethereum's reliance on the price of ETH to maintain network security. In his post, he revisits an earlier disagreement with Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, who had previously suggested that ETH's market price was not particularly important. Soleimani pushed back by asking a direct question: if ETH were to lose its value, how would Ethereum continue to secure its network? Since the network's transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum no longer uses miners. Instead, it relies on validators who stake ETH to verify transactions and keep the system operational. 18, ETH is trading around $1,570, reflecting a drop of over 52 percent from recent highs. According to data from Beaconcha.in, more than 34 million ETH is currently staked, representing roughly 28 percent of the total supply. Soleimani's argument is that proof-of-stake systems do not separate monetary value from security. It is a core part of how the network stays resilient. Soleimani closes his post with a question that extends beyond any single disagreement. Despite his strong criticism, he does not write off the network. Instead, he reflects on past moments where change did occur. He sees this as proof that the community is capable of adapting when it chooses to. His hope is that similar shifts can happen again. The challenges facing Ethereum today are different in nature — they involve legal risk, coordination problems, and questions about how power is distributed. Whether Ethereum can reconcile these tensions depends on how it responds to them. Project 11 challenges everyone to crack the Bitcoin key using a quantum computer.

Back said that current quantum computers do not pose a credible threat to Bitcoin's cryptography but will likely threaten it in the future. Related: Bitcoin's quantum-resistant hard fork is inevitable — It's the only chance to fix node incentives Still, Back said that whether such a situation will reveal if Satoshi Nakamoto is alive also depends on Bitcoin's future privacy features. “It depends a bit on the technology, there are some research ideas that could add privacy to Bitcoin,” Back said. “So, possibly there might be a way to fix quantum issues while keeping privacy.“ Related: Lawyer sues US Homeland Dept to probe supposed Satoshi Nakamoto meeting He added that, since this is a controversial choice, it makes sense to let the community decide. Back explained that most quantum-resistant signature implementations are either unproven in terms of security or very expensive from a data perspective. He cited Lamport signatures as an old and proven design, but pointed out that they weigh tens of kilobytes.</p>

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, with Wall Street banks suddenly staring down the barrel of an “existential” bitcoin and crypto threat, Trump's war with Fed chair Jerome Powell could be about to trigger a bitcoin price and wider market "black swan." Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned interest rates must remain high to prevent the return ... More of inflation—something that could weigh on the bitcoin price and stock market. Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.” “If I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump later said in the Oval Office while taking questions from reporters during a visit with Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni. Krüger predicted that if Trump were to fire Powell, stock markets would “implode," with the bitcoin price going “down hard then up as it progresses from a pure risk asset to a risk-safe haven hybrid.” The bitcoin price has dropped since U.S. president Donald Trump took office but remains well above ... More where it was this time last year. Bitcoin has so far failed to trade in line with the traditional safe haven asset, gold. This week, Powell reiterated that the Fed was waiting for greater clarity before making any moves, predicting Trump's tariffs would likely worsen inflation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana's memecoin activity has dropped over 80%, but its apps still lead in blockchain earnings. Solana continues to top blockchain revenue charts, even as activity on its network drops sharply. Data from Blockworks Research reveals that while memecoin activity on Solana has dropped by over 80% from its peak, the network's applications still account for more than 70% of all on-chain revenue across the ecosystem. This trend is further supported by findings from Syndica, which reported that Solana-based decentralized applications (dApps) generated 46% of total on-chain revenue across all networks in March. While Solana still holds the lion's share of on-chain earnings, its total network revenue has plunged more than 90% from the highs recorded in January. The sharp decline is mainly tied to lower transaction fees. According to DeFiLlama data, Solana now collects under $5 million weekly fees, marking its weakest performance since September last year. A key factor behind this decline is the collapse of several headline-grabbing memecoins, such as LIBRA, which was linked to key political figures and drove massive speculation on the blockchain network.

With its price down by 46% over the last three years, Ethereum (ETH 0.22%) now confronts yet another problem. While it certainly won't be alone, the possibility of devastation is ahead. The new threat could enable Ethereum to reverse its fortunes. There's not much point in investing in a chain or developing an application there if your money can easily be liberated from your wallet by a hacker. It isn't always possible for a chain's developers to foresee threats. But right now, one potentially severe threat in particular is getting a lot of attention. You've probably heard of quantum computers, which may in the future be able to perform certain tasks like cryptographic codebreaking far more efficiently than the classic computers that we use every day. Therefore, there is also a risk that a future quantum computer might be powerful enough and its users sufficiently adept to crack the encryption used for blockchains like Ethereum's. Such attackers could steal vast sums of cryptocurrency and potentially destroy a blockchain's entire ecosystem overnight. This is one of the few things that could make Ethereum go to zero. It's also unclear precisely when or if quantum computing will become advanced enough to pose an immediate threat. It is also in the process of considering whether to adopt a few other proposals for fortifying Ethereum against the quantum computing threat. While any implementation of those proposals is at least a few years away, the chain is far ahead of its competitors in its planning process. Ethereum's early progress in preparing for quantum computing is important because it shows that security is a serious focus for the chain. But investors won't buy a coin based on the future security characteristics of its chain alone, and you shouldn't, either, at least not yet. Make no mistake: Ethereum is currently the major chain that is among the least likely to fall victim to a quantum computing-based exploit, on the basis of its work in evaluating proposals and funding research into mitigation strategies. Eventually, it could make Ethereum a coin worth buying, especially if its competitors fail to keep up with its preparations for the future. And investors shouldn't merely settle for discussion of risk mitigation measures; there's no real value in being added to the chain until it upgrades its tech. So keep an eye on Ethereum in the context of this issue. If it stays ahead of the pack in preparing for quantum computing, that will be a bullish sign that Ethereum desperately needs right now.

According to AltcoinGordon, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, Ethereum (ETH) could potentially reach $10,000 based on current market trends and technological advancements. This prediction aligns with increased institutional interest and the growing adoption of Ethereum's blockchain technology. As traders evaluate this insight, they should consider the implications of network upgrades and global economic factors. [Source: Twitter/@AltcoinGordon]

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analyst and trader Benjamin Cowen believes Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to continue outperforming altcoins. In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 892,000 YouTube subscribers that the total market cap of altcoins (Total3) when paired against Bitcoin is going to continue on a downtrend. Cowen further says that Bitcoin is likely to continue outperforming altcoins until the US monetary policy eases. “My base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over… … I'm bullish on Bitcoin dominance because quantitative tightening has not ended. If the Federal Reserve were to end quantitative tightening at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, then it's possible that my opinion would change.” Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of the total market capitalization of BTC relative to all other crypto assets. A rising Bitcoin dominance indicates that Bitcoin is either rising faster relative to other crypto assets or its decline is relatively muted compared to the rest of the digital asset market.

As larger tokens wobble, such projects may benefit from renewed interest in innovative, early-stage altcoins. Crypto may be decentralized, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Global events – from trade policies to economic sanctions still impact investor behavior. When things get hairy, riskier assets like altcoins tend to cool off. But when things settle or get better, confidence can come back fast. Whether it's interest rate changes or trade agreements between China and the US, these events impact how people move their money – and crypto is often the first place it flows when sentiment turns bullish. It means tensions between global powers may be easing or at least cooling off for now. That kind of shift tends to open the door for broader market optimism. This usually triggers a “risk on” mood – where capital flows into growth assets like tech stocks and crypto. Altcoins, especially early stage projects could benefit from this renewed appetite for higher reward plays as the market looks forward. With global markets turning a corner and crypto confidence creeping back, here are three coins making early moves worth paying attention to. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is an ERC-20 token project that merges the viral appeal of meme culture with real utility through advanced AI-driven trading algorithms. Currently in presale at $0.004 and with over $3.2 million already raised, Dawgz AI positions itself not merely as a meme, but as a utility-driven asset with long-term growth potential. Here's what's making Dawgz AI more than just another presale coin: Dogwifhat might've already had its viral moment, but this pup's story isn't over. It hit an all-time high of $4.85 just a few months ago, and despite a big pullback, its community is still strong and the trading volume is high. With over 218K followers and meme coin mania still alive, WIF could easily fire back up as retail interest returns. Here is a quick look at the numbers that matter: As meme coins continue to attract retail energy, Popcat could be a top comeback contender. When market sentiment flips from cautious to optimistic, Bitcoin usually leads, but altcoins move faster. That's because smaller-cap tokens are more volatile by nature, and it takes less volume to move them. As a result, when confidence returns, altcoins often outperform in percentage gains. This is why traders looking for sharper upside often start eyeing early-stage or under-the-radar coins. With trade tensions easing and investor appetite returning, altcoins are starting to pop again. While the big names have stayed steady, early movers like Dawgz AI are getting noticed for their timing, features, and potential upside.
