Nayib Bukele has been accused of planting margaritas on the table where a Democrat senator and a wrongfully deported man were meeting in El Salvador.

Mr Bukele, the Salvadorian president, posted images on social media of Chris Van Hollen meeting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who has been imprisoned in one of the country's high-security jails since being deported from the US last month.

The brightly coloured pictures show the pair sitting at a table with two glasses set in front of them, seemingly with salt-encrusted rims and glace cherries balanced on top.

An aide to Mr Bukele placed the cocktails in front of the men during their meeting in an attempt to stage a damaging photo, a person familiar with the situation claimed to The New York Times.

Mr Bukele, who styles himself as “the world's coolest dictator”, posted three images of the meeting on social media.

Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody 🇺🇸🤝🏼🇸🇻 https://t.co/2xVt4SNOGn

They show Mr Van Hollen and Mr Abrego Garcia greeting each other in the polished lobby of a hotel in San Salvador, the country's capital, the Maryland senator smiling at his companion over a cocktail, and the pair sitting at a table with their drinks in front of a lush green backdrop.

By contrast, a photo posted by Mr Van Hollen shows the men with a glass of water and its colours are much more muted.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' and ‘torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,” Mr Bukele wrote on social media, adding a cocktail emoji.

“Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honour of staying in El Salvador's custody,” he added.

Prof Hany Farid, an expert in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, said the cocktail glasses looked “a little odd” in Mr Bukele's images but did not believe they were Photoshopped.

“We find no evidence of manipulation in these images,” he told The Telegraph.

Mr Trump was asked by a reporter on Friday what he thought about the images of Mr Abrego Garcia apparently sipping margaritas in El Salvador.

The US president used the opportunity to hit out at Democrats who had taken up the cause of an individual he claimed was an “illegal alien, MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist”.

“This is the man that the Democrats are wanting us to fly back from El Salvador to be a happily ensconced member of the USA family. Isn't it a shame?” he said, calling Mr Abrego Garcia a “very violent person”.

Mr Bukele also retweeted a number of social media users who praised him for “trolling” the Democrats, including Mike Flynn, Donald Trump's disgraced former national security adviser.

It marks the latest development in the battle over Mr Abrego Garcia's public image.

The 29-year-old was removed from the US in March despite an immigration court order against his deportation. The Trump administration said his removal had been a mistake and it has been ordered to “facilitate” his return to the US by the Supreme Court.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticised the press for treating a man it alleged was a member of the vicious MS-13 gang as a “sympathetic figure”.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia had a history of violence and was not the upstanding ‘Maryland Man' the media has portrayed him as,” it said in a statement, releasing court filings in which his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, sought a restraining order against him for allegedly punching and bruising her.

Ms Vasquez, who did not continue with the process, has nevertheless campaigned for her husband's return and says he is a “loving partner and father” unfairly targeted by the Trump administration.

Mr Van Hollen said on social media he had called Ms Vasquez on Thursday, and said he would provide a “full update” after returning to the US.

Also on Wednesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released files apparently showing Mr Abrego Garcia had been detained as part of a murder investigation.

An officer spoke with a “past and proven reliable source” who advised that he was an “active member” of MS-13, in which he had the rank of “chequeo” and went under the moniker “Chele”.

When Mr Van Hollen initially attempted to reach Mr Abrego Garcia on Thursday he was stopped by Salvadoran military officials.

The Maryland senator said he had travelled to El Salvador to “see if Kilmar Abrego Garcia is doing ok”, saying “nobody has heard anything about his condition since he was illegally abducted from the United States”.

Trump said he'd stop the war in 24 hours if elected, but his team appears daunted by negotiation with ‘a lot of detail attached to it'

One key to a successful negotiation is always being willing to walk away from the table. But it isn't clear whether the Trump administration has threatened to give up on a Russia-Ukraine peace deal as a negotiating tactic or simply because it lacks the concentration for a complicated negotiation – a shortcoming that has dogged the administration's foreign policy through its first three months in office.

Standing on a tarmac in Paris, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a threat that the US could simply “move on” from mediating the biggest military conflict in Europe since the second world war. That would be the latest about-face for an administration that has already taken a back seat on negotiating a peace in Gaza and retreated on implementing worldwide tariffs that shook financial markets around the globe earlier this month.

Diplomacy, it turns out, is hard. The 24 hours that Donald Trump promised he would need to halt the fighting in Ukraine have long since passed. And the administration has done little of the hard diplomatic work that was required to secure landmark deals like the Dayton agreement or the Camp David accords in the past.

There have been plenty of meetings: Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff has spoken three times with Vladimir Putin, during which he has listened to the Kremlin leader's thoughts on Ukraine for hours, and Rubio was on the phone with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and met with Ukrainian officials and European leaders in Paris on Thursday.

But there are few indications that new ground has been struck, that the US has exerted any pressure on the Kremlin or that the negotiations have identified what kinds of security guarantees would exist to ensure that Russia wouldn't simply continue the war when it sees fit. One element of a “Trump deal” appears to be this: that it doesn't take very long or involve very much effort to achieve.

“We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,” Rubio said, noting that the US wanted to stop “thousands” of people from dying in the next year. “So if they're serious about peace – either side, or both – we want to help. If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on. We're going to move on to other topics that are equally if not more important in some ways to the United States.”

Rubio clearly wished to vent frustration on Friday, a day after Trump had said in the White House that he was waiting for Russia's response to the proposed framework for a peace deal and expected to have it this week. The White House appears to be increasingly frustrated with Moscow, something that both European and Ukrainian officials had hoped would take place.

But if Trump walks away from a deal and the war altogether, the decision will still play into Putin's hands – relieving Ukraine of a key ally and financial backer in its fight against Russia. Moscow appears to see the situation as a win-win: either taking a favourable deal with the White House or waiting for Trump to lose patience. Which he is now threatening to do.

There are more hopeful voices in the administration. JD Vance, the Ukraine-sceptic vice-president, told Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday that he felt “optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close”. There had been “some things … even in the past 24 hours” that he said could indicate a chance to secure a ceasefire.

But to listen to Rubio or Witkoff, the various sides have barely moved from their opening positions. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the United States had offered Russia some sanctions relief in exchange for a deal – something that Rubio had offered as far back as his confirmation hearings in January. And Witkoff appeared surprised on Fox News that Russia wanted “so much more” than just a ceasefire. “I mean, it's just a lot of detail attached to it,” he said. “It's a complicated situation from, you know – rooted in some real problematic things happening between the two countries.”

There was always an expertise gap in the difficult negotiations over a ceasefire to the Russian war in Ukraine. Now the administration appears to have a patience gap and has signaled it is ready to walk away. Ukraine does not have that option.

            The United States and Iran are due to hold their second round of nuclear talks on Saturday, as what both sides are looking for in a deal begins to take shape.
    


            Delegations from both countries met in Oman last weekend for talks mediated by the Gulf Arab nation. The next round is being held in Rome.
    


            Since last weekend's talks, which both parties described as “constructive,” remarks from various members of the Trump administration have flip-flopped, oscillating between maximalist demands that Iran has said were “red lines” and a more conciliatory approach the Islamic Republic may concede to.
    


            This comes amid threats by President Donald Trump that the US will resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors.
    


            Here's what we know about the talks.
    


            A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US. Under the deal, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
    


            That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities and has so far advanced its program of uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade.
    


            Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful.
    


            Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents told CNN.
    


            Days later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the US. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington.
    


            Trump has said that the deal he seeks with Iran would not be similar to the 2015 agreement inked under the Obama administration.
    


            “It'll be different, and maybe a lot stronger,” he said.

Trump envoy stresses need for verification in Iran nuclear talks



            Comments from Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, have suggested differently as of late.
    


            Iran has in recent weeks been vocal with its concerns about striking a nuclear deal with Trump, who it says has a history of backtracking. The Islamic Republic has also voiced objections to any deal that fully dismantles its nuclear program, as opposed to only limiting its uranium enrichment to civilian-only use – as was stipulated under the 2015 agreement.
    


            Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal ensured through a number of mechanisms that Iran's nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful.
    


            But conflicting remarks from US officials before and after last Saturday's meeting have muddied Washington's demands.
    


            Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, said that moving forward, talks with Iran would be about verification of its nuclear program, but stopped short of mentioning a demand to fully dismantle Iran's nuclear program, as other US officials have said in the past. In other words, indicating a deal that would be similar to the Obama-brokered agreement.
    


            “The conversation with the Iranians will be much about two critical points,” Witkoff told Fox News on Monday. The first is verification of uranium enrichment, “and ultimately verification on weaponization, that includes missiles, type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb.”
    


            However, Witkoff later reversed his position in a statement on X in which he said any final deal with Iran would require it to “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.”

            Asked to explain Witkoff's apparent reversal, an administration official told CNN: “It's the most recent elaboration of policy.”
    


            Other officials have been hawkish on what the US expects from Iran. On Sunday, a day after Witkoff started talks with Iranian negotiators in Oman, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Tehran to fully dismantle its nuclear program.
    


            “Iran, come to the table, negotiate, full dismantlement of your nuclear capabilities,” he said on Fox News.
    


            Iranian officials have dismissed that proposal as a non-starter, accusing the US of using it as a pretext to weaken and ultimately topple the Islamic Republic. Tehran is entitled to a civilian nuclear energy program under a UN treaty.
    


            The UN nuclear watchdog has however warned that Iran has been accelerating its enrichment of uranium up to alarming levels.
    


            Iran this week doubled down on its right to enrich uranium and accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals.
    


            “Iran's enrichment (program) is a real and genuine matter, and we are ready to build trust regarding potential concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters on Wednesday, state-run Press TV reported.

US-Iran negotiators hold ‘constructive' nuclear talks, will meet again next week



            Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei weighed in early Thursday on X, likening the shifting US position to “a professional foul and an unfair act in football.”
    


            “In diplomacy any such shifting (pushed by hawks who fail to grasp the logic/art of commonsensical deal-making) could simply risk any overtures falling apart,” he wrote. “It could be perceived as lack of seriousness, let alone good faith. … We're still in testing mode.”
    


            Iranian media has reported that Tehran had set strict terms ahead of the talks with the US, saying that “red lines” include “threatening language” by the Trump administration and “excessive demands regarding Iran's nuclear program.” The US must also refrain from raising issues relating to Iran's defense industry, Iranian media said, likely referring to Iran's ballistic missile program, which the US' Middle Eastern allies see as a threat to their security.
    


            Meanwhile, Iran's highest leadership has approached the talks with extreme caution.
    


            In his first comments on the issue since the Iranian and American negotiators met in Oman, Khamenei said Tuesday that Tehran is “neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic” about talks with the United States over its nuclear program.
    


            Israel has been among the staunchest advocates for Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear weapon and never acquire a nuclear bomb.
    


            On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement defending his aggressive policy towards Iran, saying, “Israel will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.”
    


            A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday that Witkoff spoke with Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs and Netanyahu's closest confidant, about the first round of US-Iran talks in Oman.

            Dermer was sitting beside Netanyahu in Washington last week when Trump suddenly announced the US-Iran talks would begin imminently. The surprise revelation of the start of negotiations appeared to startle Netanyahu, who has increasingly pushed for a military option against Iran.
    


            Sources familiar with the matter had previously told CNN that news of the US-Iran nuclear talks were “certainly not” to Israel's liking, and it remains unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the negotiations or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.
    


            Sitting beside Trump at the Oval Office earlier this month, Netanyahu touted a Libya-style nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which in 2003 dismantled the North African nation's nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
    


            After relinquishing its nuclear program, Libya descended into civil war following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gadhafi's regime and led to his killing. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be rejected from the outset.
    


            Dermer and Mossad director David Barnea met Friday with Witkoff in Paris ahead of the second round of Iran talks.

US intelligence agencies believe Israel is likely to strike Iranian nuclear facilities this year



            Earlier this year, US intelligence agencies warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel would likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran's nuclear program this year, according to sources familiar with the assessments.
    


            However, The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump had urged Israel not to strike Iran's nuclear sites as soon as next month in order to let talks with Iran play out, which could impact planned engagements for Trump's national security team in the coming days.
    


            The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not deny the veracity of the article, instead asserting that Israel's actions have delayed Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Responding to the New York Times' report that he'd waved off Israeli strikes, Trump said on Thursday: “I wouldn't say waved off,” but “I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death.”
    


            “I hope they (Iran) want to talk, it's going to be very good for them if they do, and I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well.”

Report finds over a quarter of Canadians exposed to ‘more sophisticated and more politically polarizing' fake content

More than a quarter of Canadians have been exposed to fake political content on social media that is “more sophisticated and more politically polarizing” as the country prepares to vote in a federal election, researchers have found, warning that platforms must increase protections amid a “dramatic acceleration” of online disinformation in the final weeks of the campaign.

In a new report released on Friday, Canada's Media Ecosystem Observatory found a growing number of Facebook ads impersonating legitimate news sources were instead promoting fraudulent investment schemes, often involving cryptocurrency.

Canada's federal election, on 28 April, is the first national vote in which Canadian news is not permitted to be shared on products owned by Meta, including Facebook and Instagram. The ban, which began in August 2023, is a result of a standoff between the tech giant and Ottawa over the Online News Act that forced intermediaries such as Meta and Google's parent company Alphabet to compensate journalism outlets for sharing their content. Meta described the legislation, Bill C-18 – passed on 18 June – as “unworkable” and argued that the only way to comply with the law is to “end news availability for people in Canada”.

But media researchers found more than half of Canadians still say they get political news from Facebook, despite the platform's ban on news articles from reputable outlets.

“People using Facebook aren't often thinking, ‘Am I reading the news?' But they leave feeling more informed politically, either from comments from friends or family, about the election. They might see a post from a candidate or follow cultural news aggregating types of accounts,” said Aengus Bridgman, the executive director of the MEO.

“But we know this is not the same quality of information they might have accessed before the ban. The richest, densest and most accurate and factchecked information is not making it through any more. Neither is information that might contradict the views they hold. All of that just has been cut really – like, off at the knees.”

Bridgman says that most of the content the team uncovered – including more than 40 Facebook pages promoting fraudulent ads, with new pages being created and identified every day – were meant to be humorous or ironic, instead of convincing. None of the content the team found is expected to sway the electorate.

But Canada's Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (Site) is monitoring the election for disinformation and says it expects increased online political activity following the two closely-watched leaders debates. China, Russia and Iran remain the greatest threats to Canada's election, according to the taskforce.

Last week, Site officials said they had found an information operation linked to China on Chinese-language social media platform WeChat, the popular news account Youli-Youmian.

“Foreign interference has been top of mind this election, with candidates bludgeoning each other on this issue. We monitor these platforms and our evaluation of that incident in particular doesn't feel as though it had any material influence or consequence,” said Bridgman.

“We don't think one WeChat channel posting a couple times about Canadian politics articles consistent with their editorial line amounts to foreign interference.”

Instead, researchers have focused their attention on a series of scams that appear to be a continuation of a trend replicated in other countries, in which ads showing “fake sensational political headlines” impersonate small business and personal accounts.

Bridgman cautioned that the broader risk of deepfakes comes when a population is uninformed. “If you've never heard about this person before, you cannot distinguish audio or video of them in compromising situations or making offensive remarks. And in the context of politics, we worry that with more unfamiliar candidates, the risk of convincing deep fakes escalates,” he said.

Among posts examined by the team were seven deep fake videos falsely showing prime minister Mark Carney promoting the fraudulent investment platforms featured directly in the ads. These deepfakes typically mimic broadcasts by the CBC or CTV, two of the top news outlets in Canada.

In one of those, the headline reads “Mark Carney announces controversial retaliatory tariff plan in response to Trump's devastating tariff hikes this week”. The article shows Carney meeting with a top CBC news anchor and includes a purported transcript of an interview, in which he promises to send money to Canadians if they register for what purports to be a newly formed government programme. The link, however, brings users to a cryptocurrency scam.

In another, a page called Money Mindset, which uses the logo of the CBC/Radio-Canada, bought five French-language Facebook ads that were active from one to four hours between 4 and 9 April. One of the ads, featuring a deep fake video of Carney, cost US$300–$399 (about C$500) and received between five and six thousand impressions. In total, the five ads represent an investment of approximately C$1,000 and have received around 10,000 impressions.

“These imposter ads, fake news articles, and deepfake videos can undermine the credibility of both the targeted party leaders featured in the content and the news brands and journalists whose names, logos, or visual designs are being impersonated,” the report said.

A spokesperson for Meta told the Guardian it was “against our policies to run ads that try to scam or impersonate people or brands” adding the company encouraged people to report fraudulent content.

“This is an ongoing industry-wide challenge – scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams.”

But researchers say the response from tech companies “appears to have been inconsistent and insufficient for preventing these ads from spreading” – pointing to the proliferation of ads in recent days. The observatory also found that since many of these ads do not self-disclose as political, they often do not appear in the Meta's ad library, which hampers the ability to assess the scope of the trend.

“Imagine that on TV there's an ad using clearly fraudulent content or is a deepfake. In what world would that be allowed? It would never get approved for use because of the advertising standards in this country,” said Bridgeman.

“And yet, Facebook runs these ads that get hundreds of thousands of views across the country and it's just a pure scam. In the midst of a federal election using an image of Carney and a fake CBC news website on a platform that bans the news – this feels like we're kind of in like a Black Mirror kind of moment. And what worries me is that it feels like people are just okay with this.”

A charity controversy and GOP unrest threaten Casey DeSantis's chances of succeeding her husband as governor in 2026

It had the hallmarks of a dynasty in the making. When Ron DeSantis was asked in February whom he would like to see succeed him as Florida governor when he is termed out of office in 2027, his answer was unequivocal: his wife, Casey.

“There's no question about it,” he told a press conference in Tampa.

“She's someone who has the intestinal fortitude and the dedication of conservative principles that, you know, anything that we've accomplished, that she'd be able to take to the next level.”

Now, storm clouds are swirling as Florida's glamorous first lady, a close political adviser to her husband as well as his loyal wife, ponders whether to throw her hat in the ring.

A political initiative she founded in 2021 to improve welfare provision has become mired in controversy over its charity wing's failure to file required tax documents. There have also been probing questions from Florida Republicans over a “probably illegal” $10m donation from a legal settlement to the state that was secretly directed to the charity – some of which ended up in the hands of her husband's political cronies.

It is a scandal that some observers believe has the potential to sink her possible candidacy for the November 2026 gubernatorial election before it even begins, or at least provoke some soul searching in the DeSantis camp about how and when to launch it.

“This is really her first test of negative publicity, and some negative attention in the media, and we'll see ultimately how that plays out,” said Michael Binder, professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Florida.

“I don't know that it's a death knell for her candidacy. Rick Scott was a Medicare embezzler and it didn't necessarily prevent him from not only winning a governor's race twice, but getting elected to the Senate. So these things can pass.

“But that being said, none of this is great for her. And press like this is not great.”

Binder's department conducted a February poll that showed Casey DeSantis with a 30% approval rate overall, rising to 57% among registered Republicans.

“She polled well a year-plus ago because she has some name recognition relative to the other candidates. I suspect eventually she'll get into the race. But I certainly see this being a tougher race than probably both parties might think,” he said.

It is an unfamiliar position for Casey DeSantis, 44, one half of what some see as the fairytale couple of Florida politics since their Disney World wedding in 2009. A former television news reporter with a compelling story, including surviving breast cancer, she has been her husband's chief cheerleader, confidante and campaigner.

She was at his side through his first election to Congress in 2012 and elevation to the governor's mansion in Tallahassee six years later on the back of a tweeted endorsement from Donald Trump.

As recently as February, her own star was shining brightly, even as Florida's Republican legislators began pushing back against Ron DeSantis's handling of state affairs and agenda after six years as governor.

Donors were reportedly lining up to support her potential candidacy. Sources told NBC News that DeSantis saw his wife as a way to keep the governorship out of the hands of some of those with whom he has been recently feuding, including the agriculture commissioner, Wilton Simpson, and another former ally, the representative Byron Donalds.

Then came the hammer blow of Trump's endorsement of Donalds, before an alleged “kiss the ring” breakfast visit in March by both Ron and Casey DeSantis to the president's West Palm Beach golf club. That was quickly followed by the burgeoning charity scandal enveloping the Hope Florida Foundation, a non-profit supporting Casey DeSantis's flagship initiative to reduce government funding for welfare programs and replace it with more community and corporate input.

The Tampa Bay Times discovered that the DeSantis administration secretly directed $10m to the charity from a $67m overbilling settlement last year between the state's agency for health care administration (AHCA) and the Medicare operator Centene. The direction was in apparent contradiction of Florida law requiring such money to be paid into a trust or act as general revenue for state legislators to spend.

It was subsequently revealed that two organizations that received money from Hope Florida gave $5m each to political committees that supported Ron DeSantis's ultimately successful efforts last November to defeat a ballot amendment calling for the legalization of recreational marijuana.

On Wednesday, the executive director of Hope Florida, Erik Dellenback, resigned, as the charity came under heightening scrutiny.

The scandal has angered some senior Florida Republicans, including the house speaker, Daniel Perez, and state representative Alex Andrade.

Perez said it appeared DeSantis transferred the $10m to Hope Florida “in the dead of the night” and has threatened subpoenas to get answers; Andrade, chair of the house healthcare budget subcommittee, last week spent two hours questioning the DeSantis-appointed AHCA secretary, Shevaun Harris.

“The reference to that $10m not being taxpayer dollars I find offensive,” he said, after Harris explained the money was a “donation” by Centene to Hope Florida on top of the settlement, and therefore exempt from state law.

Andrade said he believed the redirection of the money was a DeSantis “policy decision … that I believe was illegal”.

Harris, who was appointed in February, claimed she was “ambushed” at the meeting, and has denied that AHCA did anything wrong. Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said Hope Florida's actions were legitimate.

On Monday, Ron DeSantis lashed out at his fellow Republicans, adding more heat to a feud that has been simmering since legislators shut down his immigration proposals in January, then launched an inquiry into the DeSantis administration's spending habits.

“Shame on you in the Florida House and your terrible behavior in leadership,” DeSantis told a press conference in Kissimmee, reported by Florida Politics.

The outlet said the governor denounced “a lot of baseless attacks” and “manufactured smears against the first lady and the program that's Hope Florida”.

The next steps for Casey DeSantis are uncertain, but some observers believe the controversy has ended any hope she had of becoming only the second woman, after Wyoming's Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, to succeed her husband as a state governor.

“It's clear, even at this point, that the Hope Florida scandal is going to kill her campaign in the cradle,” Peter Schorsch, publisher of Florida Politics, wrote in a post on X.

“She's never gonna get back to the pristine starting point she needed to be at to run for governor.”

Frank Orlando, political science professor at St Leo University, said Casey DeSantis had essentially been caught up in the escalating dispute between her husband and state politicians, who are making hay from the Hope Florida situation.

“She's been a relatively popular first lady of Florida, and my feeling from talking with legislators in Tallahassee is that it's primarily a beef with Ron,” he said.

“It's just finding ways to pick fights, to undermine his authority. To the extent that Casey is involved, it's the fact that she would be in that wing of the party, and holding that banner. I don't think this is being done to undermine Casey as much as it is saying to Ron: ‘We've been under your thumb for six years, and we're not going to take it any more.'”

            The Trump administration's patience with peacemaking for Ukraine, always painfully thin, now appears to be running out altogether.
    


            “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after meeting European and Ukrainian officials for talks in Paris.
    


            For President Donald Trump, who swept into office convinced he possessed the skills to quickly end the gravest conflict in Europe since the World War II, there is immense frustration with the lack of progress.
    


            “The President has spent 87 days at the highest level of this government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end,” Rubio added, as the bloodshed in the war zone continues unabated.
    


            So what would to “move on” look like?
    


            One option might be redouble US military support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's efforts to court the Kremlin, or perhaps because of them, Russian intransigence has emerged as the main obstacle to peace, such as Moscow's foot-dragging over Trump's proposed 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine alone has agreed.
    


            Admittedly, fresh deliveries of billions of dollars more of American arms to Ukraine may be an unpopular policy U-turn among some Trump supporters, but a newly invigorated Ukrainian push-back on the battlefield could encourage the Kremlin to reassess its negotiating position.
    


            New, properly tough US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and those who buy it, have also been touted as a potential means of applying maximum pressure on Moscow.
    


            Problem is, forging a peace in Ukraine is just one of the agenda items in what Trump and the Kremlin see as a much broader, lucrative reconfiguration of US-Russian relations – involving energy deals, space exploration and mining contracts – which Trump may be reluctant to jeopardize.
    


            Back in Paris, Rubio hinted at a possible second, more likely, option.
    


            “It's not our war. We didn't start it. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it's not our war,” Rubio stressed, alluding to the possibility that the US could simply walk away, leaving Ukraine and its European backers to face Russia alone.
    


            That would pose a huge challenge, given Ukraine's depleted resources and Europe's dire unreadiness, currently, to bolster the front lines with sufficient military supplies of its own.
    


            For the Kremlin, American disengagement is a double-edged sword. It may give its battered forces a freer hand in Ukraine, but it doesn't necessarily deliver the win that Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, insists that he wants, instead dragging out the pain.
    


            Russian troops, who are being killed and injured at an alarming rate, would continue to be fed into the brutal “meat grinder” of the Ukrainian front lines, increasing simmering social pressure on the Kremlin at home.
    


            Pressure on the Russian economy, already weakened by war, would also increase. If there is no peace deal, there is unlikely to be any easing of the punitive international sanctions already straining fragile Russian finances.
    


            Putin, bent on total victory, may regret passing up the extraordinary chance offered by Trump to end his disastrous Ukraine war and cut his country's substantial losses.
    


            The Trump administration insists it has not yet entirely given up – just hours after Rubio's comment, Vice President JD Vance said the White House was “optimistic” it could still end the war – but is signalling that that point may be drawing close.
    


            “We need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” Rubio said of peace in Ukraine before heading back to Washington.
    


            The Kremlin is also engaging in the brinkmanship, its spokesman insisting “there are no contacts planned for this week, but, on the other hand, let's say that the established contacts allow us to very, very quickly agree on such a conversation if necessary.”
    


            There is, it seems, still a narrow scope for a face-saving, last minute breakthrough. But time and patience in Washington to end the war in Ukraine seems to be rapidly running out.

ROME, April 18. /TASS/. US Vice President JD Vance has expressed optimism about the end of the conflict in Ukraine and announced progress in its settlement over the past 24 hours.

"I want to update the prime minister (Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - TASS) on some of the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on. Since there are the negotiations I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close," he said at a meeting with Meloni in Rome.

Less than 24 hours after the talks at the White House, Meloni receives JD Vance, who has traveled with his family to Rome, where he will celebrate Easter (on April 20). He will also reportedly meet with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

On April 17, French President Emmanuel Macron met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US presidential special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris. According to the Elysee Palace, the "constructive talks" helped to "bring positions closer" on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict.

Another meeting of representatives of the five countries is scheduled for next week in London, the AFP news agency reported.

MOSCOW, April 18. /TASS/. From the very first days that the West introduced its unilateral sanctions, Moscow and Tehran banded together, and the recent signing and ratification of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership can be seen as a culmination of this decision, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

"Regardless of when the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was signed and when it will take effect, such cooperation was launched from the very first days after the West imposed illegal restrictions on our countries," he pointed out at a joint press conference following talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

"Apart from political activities on the international stage, we have also long been consistently and effectively introducing the practice of financial and bank payments, logistics chains and other mechanisms serving trade and investment, which protect us from unlawful actions. Meanwhile, the enactment of the treaty simply reflects our determination to boost our friendly, strategic relations in all areas no matter what," Lavrov added.

The top Russian diplomat also emphasized that Moscow and Tehran "have a lot of supporters within the United Nations, including the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter that develops position documents, particularly demanding an end to illegal practices and a return to the norms of international law."

            Turkey started hastily organized mass trials on Friday to prosecute some of the hundreds of people who took part in the widespread demonstrations over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the major rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

            Some 189 people, including journalists, students and activists, were on trial across two overflowing court rooms in Istanbul's Caglayan justice palace, one of the city's main courts.
    


            Both courts ruled to split the list of defendants to more manageable numbers after hearing procedural motions by defense lawyers.
    


            Charges against the defendants stem from the protests that erupted after Imamoglu's arrest on March 19 on corruption allegations — a move critics see as an attempt to sideline a key rival to Erdogan ahead of elections expected to be held in 2028.
    


            At least 1,400 people were arrested during the demonstrations, posing one of the biggest challenges yet to the long rule of Erdogan, who is seeking to extend his presidency.
    


            Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the trials as politically motivated, citing a lack of evidence and calling the charges incompatible with democratic norms.
    


            A small group of parents and supporters gathered outside the court before the trials to demand justice for students who are among those being prosecuted, holding signs, releasing balloons and chanting “we want justice for our kids.”
    


            “We release these balloons to symbolize their right to freely express themselves, their right to education, and their right to lead free lives,” the group said in a statement.
    


            Eight journalists who were arrested while covering the protests in Istanbul also appeared in court on Friday.
    


            One defense lawyer called for the immediate dismissal of the case and told the court, “The journalists were carrying out their constitutionally protected jobs.”

            HRW reviewed the indictments against 650 demonstrators “accused of protest-related offenses,” noting that 120 were charged for assemblies held after an eight-day protest ban expired.
    


            Potential sentences range from six months to five years, yet in some cases the evidence appeared thin. In one case, a rock allegedly held by a protester was cited as a weapon.
    


            Protesters in the capital Ankara were met with police water cannons. In Istanbul, police doused people with pepper spray, and some officers kicked and hit demonstrators after several fireworks and other objects were thrown at riot police near the city's municipality building, according to Reuters.
    


            Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe director, criticized the trials as “a warning against exercising the rights to peaceful protest or free expression,” and urged prosecutors to drop charges without concrete evidence.
    


            Turkey's record on assembly rights has long drawn scrutiny, with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issuing over 70 rulings against Ankara since 2010 for disproportionate crackdowns, HRW said.
    


            The Council of Europe has called on Turkey to protect “the right to peaceful protest.”
    


            “The presumption of innocence, the use of pre-trial detention strictly as a measure of last resort and the protection of political expression” must all be guaranteed, the Council said.
    


            Despite this, Erdogan's government has tightened control, with Freedom House, a US-based nonprofit research organization, labeling Turkey “not free” amid censorship and surveillance laws.
    


            As the trials begin, observers have warned of deepening authoritarianism. With 90% of Turkish media under government influence and journalists routinely targeted, the cases underscore a broader erosion of rights under Erdogan, who has ruled since 2003 and could remain in power until 2029.
    


            Elections are not scheduled until 2028 but would need to come earlier if Erdogan, 71, who has run Turkey for 22 years, wants to run again. Imamoglu leads the president in some polls.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.

He spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.

“We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,” Rubio told reporters. “Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on. It's not our war. We have other priorities to focus on.”

He said the U.S. administration wants to decide “in a matter of days.”

Rubio's comments stepped up pressure on both sides to reach a peace deal, even as the U.S. and Ukraine made progress on a minerals agreement that Trump has sought to recoup billions of dollars in military assistance that Washington sent Kyiv since Russia's full scale invasion in February 2022.

They also indicated the road to a complete truce will be long and mired with contention, despite U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly claiming on the campaign trail that he could end the war within a day. Trump said last month that he was “being a little bit sarcastic” when he claimed that.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance struck a more hopeful tone in Rome on Friday, ahead of talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

“We think we have some interesting things to report on, of course in private,” he said. On the negotiations, “I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close.”

He didn't give more details.

Rubio's comments came as the U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a long-delayed deal granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Donald Trump's peace push. Trump said Thursday: “We have a minerals deal.” Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.

The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term co-operation.

The framework of the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Negotiations have since resumed.

Despite apparent impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. He didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.

When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “fairly complex” negotiations are ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Trump and Putin are scheduled in the coming days.

“Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,” he said.

Peskov also stressed that a limited, 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington that both Russia and Ukraine last month embraced in principle has now lapsed, but did not say what steps Moscow might take next.

While voicing their readiness to implement the agreement, the warring parties issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. They differed on the start time of halting strikes, and alleged near-immediate breaches by the other side.

After weeks of tensions with European allies, Rubio said the European negotiators proved helpful. “The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.”

European concerns are growing about Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. The talks in Paris were the first time since Trump's inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.

The meetings addressed security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again after a peace deal is reached.

Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.

Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russia kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.

One person died and 98 others, including six children, were hurt as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early in the day, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on Friday. He said cluster munitions struck a “densely populated” neighbourhood four times.

Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.

Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.

Neil Duhon blames archdiocese for allowing his rapist to prey on children throughout his career

The clergy abuse survivor who helped prosecutors secure the only conviction against a notorious child rapist and retired Roman Catholic priest in New Orleans is still hoping that authorities file criminal charges against his former high school principal and everyone else who enabled the clergyman.

“Everybody that had any part … needs to be held accountable. Period – period,” Neil Duhon, whose rapist was Lawrence Hecker, said in an interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, the first and only time he's ever revealed his identity to the public.

Referring to the Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans, the institution that employed and protected Hecker for decades and kept doing so even after the cleric admitted he had preyed sexually on minors throughout his career, Duhon added: “I hope they get some type of criminal charge.

“You know, they are responsible for all of this.”

And Duhon, who is now 65 but was about 16 when Hecker raped him in 1975, had particularly harsh words for a judge who handled part of his ordeal. New Orleans criminal court judge Benedict Willard delayed Hecker's trial date for more than a year before recusing himself on the day that jury selection for the case was to begin. Only by handing the matter over to another judge did Willard finally clear the way for Hecker to plead guilty in December – shortly before the priest died.

Duhon called Willard “a coward – a coward. That's it.”

The hours-long interview Duhon granted a pair of outlets whose reporting aided Hecker's successful prosecution provided the most detailed account yet of the stand he took against one of the Catholic church's most inveterate abusers. Hecker's prosecution also showed how the clergy molestation crisis roiling the US church for decades was not yet over.

As Duhon told it, he was a freshman student at New Orleans' St John Vianney high school – which catered to boys interested in joining the priesthood – when he met Hecker in 1973. The school, which has since closed, required students to essentially help local Catholic churches with their masses and other services. And Duhon was assigned to do that at a church adjacent to St John called St Theresa and colloquially known as Little Flower, where Hecker introduced himself to him.

Hecker left Little Flower – which has since closed, too – in about 1974. But during the summer of the following year, Duhon saw him again at one of the weekly pool parties that the Notre Dame seminary, an institution in New Orleans that educates and trains priests, would host for St John students.

According to Duhon, Hecker recognized him and asked if he was still working at Little Flower. Duhon said he was.

Days later, after finishing his mass-related duties at Little Flower, Duhon was exercising on a weight bench set up in a room attached to the church bell tower. Hecker appeared unannounced, offered to give him pointers that could help Duhon earn a spot on a wrestling team being started at St John, and eventually put him in a headlock.

Duhon tried to force himself free of Hecker but couldn't. He said he suddenly felt Hecker's penis inside of him. As he tensed up, Duhon said Hecker's arm came across his upper chest toward his neck. Duhon said he lost consciousness and woke up alone.

The shadows cast in the room were much longer than he remembered them, suggesting hours had passed. Duhon said he soon realized he had semen on his backside. His mind raced as he removed his gym shorts and underwear, changed into his trousers and rushed to his bus stop. Along the way, he said he suddenly realized he was carrying the soiled clothes and – overcome with disgust – threw them in a garbage can.

Duhon said his mother was the first person he told about his rape, when laundry day arrived the following Friday. He said he disclosed the attack to her after struggling to give an answer when she asked where his gym shorts and underwear were so she could wash them.

He said his mother said nothing but appeared to be in shock. Duhon said he was never sure whether she disclosed the rape to his father. But his parents soon decided he would not return to Little Flower and instead would work a newspaper delivery route with his father.

Not immediately realizing that he was traumatized, Duhon said he returned to St John much more combative than he had been before. One priest and teacher, Luis Fernandez, had the habit of using a lengthy stick to strike students who were sleeping, talking or inattentive. He hit Duhon with it one day that year, and the pupil snatched it away, igniting a heated confrontation that got him sent to the office of the principal, Paul Calamari.

Calamari initially punished Duhon with detention. But later that same day, Duhon was standing in the lunch line with a friend and began arguing with him over something he can no longer remember. They ended up in a fistfight. Teachers sent Duhon back to Calamari. Duhon recalled the principal saying: “Ah … you're fighting now. Why you fighting, Neil?”

As he remembered it, Duhon didn't mince any words and immediately told Calamari that Hecker had raped him. Duhon said Calamari's reaction was to angrily ask who else the boy had told.

“My mom,” Duhon recalled saying, which prompted Calamari to summon the boy's parents and meet with them without their son present.

Ultimately, Duhon recalled agreeing to undergo treatment from a psychiatrist in lieu of expulsion over the fight with his friend and confrontation with Fernandez. The sessions – which Duhon suspects were paid for by the school – focused on managing his anger problems and what Calamari called “fantasy stories” instead of addressing his rape at the hands of Hecker, he said.

“We never talked once about that,” said Duhon, adding that the sessions went on for months.

Duhon said he eventually graduated from St John, burned his memorabilia from the school and threw his class ring into Lake Pontchartrain. Despite everything, his mother wanted him to become a priest, and he enrolled briefly at St Joseph seminary college north of New Orleans. Yet he said he intentionally tanked his studies and withdrew, having concluded he was not comfortable around priests and felt “hypocritical” pretending he was.

Duhon later served in the US navy and coast guard. And he served as an emergency medic and police officer, first in Louisiana and then in north-west Ohio. He got married, started a family in Ohio and tried not to think about St John.

But that became impossible beginning in 2018 when, amid its efforts to manage the fallout of the worldwide Catholic church's clergy abuse crisis, New Orleans' archdiocese released a list of priests and deacons whom it had judged to be credibly accused of child molestation.

Hecker was on that list in connection with reported abuse that had nothing to do with Duhon. Another person on that list was Calamari, who became a priest after Duhon's rape. Carl Davidson, a priest who worked at St John and had successfully recruited Duhon to join a choir there, was on the list, too.

Robert Cooper, who taught at St John while Duhon was a student there, would be added after a 2020 investigation by WWL Louisiana and a reporter now at the Guardian.

Not on the list was Fernandez, whom the reporters also investigated later. After the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020 in an attempt to limit its liability from lawsuits prompted by the abusive conduct underlying the list, the church quietly canceled most of Fernandez's retirement benefits. The priest, who moved to Florida, later told the Guardian that a church attorney told him he lost the benefits because of a credible child molestation accusation, though he correctly said he had never been put on the New Orleans archdiocese's credibly accused list.

Duhon noted that the credibly accused list's publisher, Archbishop Gregory Aymond, worked at St John at the beginning of his career alongside all those clergymen. Looking back, Duhon said it was as if his high school education unfolded within the clutches of “a pedophile ring”.

“I actually feel [that] as an adult now looking back,” Duhon said.

Louisiana state police troopers would arrive at a similar suspicion after Duhon was put in touch with attorney Richard Trahant, who frequently represents clergy abuse survivors. Duhon – with Trahant's help – reported Hecker to law enforcement in June 2022, formally accusing him of rape, a crime for which he could be prosecuted no matter how long ago it occurred.

Duhon immediately realized how grueling the ensuing process would get. For example, immediately after Duhon described passing out as Hecker began raping him, an apparently inattentive investigator filling in that day for a co-worker jabbered: “There's no penetration.”

“Yep – this is over,” Duhon recalled saying irately as he got up to leave and considered abandoning his complaint.

Yet he calmed down and continued cooperating, though there was little progress for several months.

In June 2023, the Guardian reported on a printed copy of a confession Hecker provided to his church superiors in 1999, in which the priest admitted molesting or sexually harassing several children other than Duhon. The Guardian provided the confession to WWL Louisiana in August 2023, and journalists from both outlets confronted Hecker on camera.

Hecker told the outlets that his written confession about “overtly sexual acts” with underage boys was accurate and authentic. Nonetheless, he insisted that the children were “100% willing” despite their legal inability to consent.

As part of the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy, the judge overseeing the proceeding – Meredith Grabill – was provided that confession. But as she weighed whether such information about Hecker should remain secret because of confidentiality rules governing the bankruptcy or be accessible to the public, she indicated she would “destroy” documents “that this court received” pertaining to the self-admitted child abuser.

Duhon, after learning about that during his interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, said Grabill has “got to get [her] head examined”.

“A judge squashing that … is absolutely ridiculous,” Duhon said. “It's just ridiculous.”

The media outlets were also able to report on a video deposition that Hecker gave during civil litigation stemming from a separate complaint against him. The video was confidential but obtained by the outlets. In it, Hecker outlined how New Orleans' last four archbishops had helped him avoid all accountability over the course of decades.

Hecker also testified about collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of retirement benefits after he retired in 2002, in effect on his own terms.

In September 2023, just two weeks after Hecker's on-camera confession to WWL and the Guardian made national headlines, the office of New Orleans' district attorney, Jason Williams, obtained a grand jury indictment charging Hecker with rape, kidnapping and other crimes against Duhon.

The case was the first time Hecker faced consequences for his crimes. It was randomly allotted to Judge Willard.

Hecker turned 92 shortly after his indictment. And over the next year, Willard repeatedly postponed trying the case over questions about whether Hecker – at his advanced age – had the mental competence required to withstand trial.

Doctors determined that Hecker had dementia but fit the constitutional criteria to legally stand trial. It seemed that Hecker would be tried in late September. And Duhon flew in from Ohio to be the star witness, one of nearly a dozen victims of Hecker whom prosecutors had lined up to testify against the clergyman.

Yet on the morning of jury selection, Willard suddenly recused himself from handling the case, citing nothing more than a clash of personalities with one of Williams's prosecutors.

Duhon, through Trahant, released a media statement saying Willard's waffling on the bench offered an example of why many rape survivors decline to ever come forward.

It wasn't immediately clear how much more time Willard's recusal might cost Hecker's prosecution. But the judge who took over the case, Nandi Campbell, set a trial date for 3 December. And Campbell made clear the trial would go forward that day barring the death of Hecker, who by then had turned 93.

On the morning of the trial, as prospective jurors gathered outside the courtroom, Hecker suddenly pleaded guilty as charged. Campbell imposed a mandatory life sentence a little more than two weeks later.

But first, she held a hearing during which Duhon addressed his rapist. It was the first time Duhon had seen Hecker in person in half a century.

Duhon directed his words at Hecker, saying that he couldn't wear trousers without underwear to this day without thinking of the rape.

“My whole aspect of church changed” because of that attack, Duhon said to Hecker, as a weeping Campbell listened.

Duhon also said he would never forgive Hecker – not that the priest asked for it when Campbell gave him the chance to address the courtroom before he was sentenced.

Hecker served eight days of his punishment. He died early in the morning of 26 December of natural causes as he awaited transfer to Louisiana's maximum-security state penitentiary, infamously nicknamed Angola.

Duhon got emotional reflecting back on his reaction when he first got word of Hecker's death.

“I actually felt free,” Duhon said. He said he regretted that he had lost both of his parents before ever experiencing the relief Hecker's death brought him.

Still, “my feeling [was], ‘It's finally over,'” Duhon remarked.

But he also feels the case isn't totally resolved. Duhon said he was aware that his case spurred a broader investigation into Hecker's former employer.

Statements sworn under oath in April 2024 by the Louisiana state police investigator who built the case against Hecker, Scott Rodrigue, allege that authorities already have probable cause to suspect that the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was illegally “covered up and not reported” to authorities, Rodrigue's sworn statement said.

Calamari was questioned about Hecker as part of that investigation. And he admitted he was a child molester, according to Rodrigue's sworn statement. However, Calamari has not been charged for, as Duhon put it, sending an underage boy to therapy without alerting police that the child had been raped.

And neither had any of Hecker's other superiors – who Hecker acknowledged in his deposition had coddled him despite knowing he was a serial child molester.

Duhon said he decided to shed his anonymity to lend weight to his plea for Rodrigue and his colleagues to complete that investigation, no matter the political and logistical hurdles that may complicate their efforts.

“We need to hold the archdiocese accountable,” Duhon said. “I mean – their secrets cannot stay secret any longer. [They] really can't.”

In prior statements, archdiocesan officials have said they are cooperating with the state police investigation. They have said that they “hope and pray [Hecker's] death will bring closure and peace to … survivors”.

Duhon furthermore said he wanted to openly tell his story as a demonstration of strength to his fellow survivors.

As he put it: “I'm Neil Duhon. I was sodomized [and] choked unconscious by a priest named Father Lawrence Hecker.

“I couldn't say that with my name attached to it prior to his death. But now … to publicly say this, I feel that it just sets [me] right.”

U.S. President Donald Trump watches as Rev. Mariann Budde, second right, arrives at the national prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, on Jan. 21, in Washington.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Michael Coren is an Anglican priest, journalist and author of the memoir Heaping Coals.

As a Galilean he was an outsider in Jerusalem, that epicentre of ancient Judaism soaked in history and conflict. Most of his ministry had been carried out in small towns, often with the poor and the dispossessed, and far away from the mighty and the powerful. That's not a surprise – remember, even by Galilean standards he and his hometown were considered insignificant. “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”

It can, it did. The great radical of history, the rebel who sang the world a new and perfect song, the revolutionary who told us that all was possible if we forgave and empathized, understood and loved. Yeshua, Jesus, the Christ. This week we remember and commemorate his death and resurrection, the paschal sacrifice for all humanity. Initially welcomed into Jerusalem, days later he would be rejected and disowned, suffering a grotesque execution reserved for slaves and traitors. It's a time for humility and reflection.

I can't help thinking that there will be little of either among U.S. President Donald Trump and his people, even though theirs is the most ostentatiously and aggressively Christian administration in recent American history. The term needs qualification of course. These are mainly Christian nationalists (a painful oxymoron), conspiracy theorists obsessed with the end times, Catholics who condemn the Pope as being dangerously left-wing, prosperity preachers, and mere charlatans – Mr. Trump himself adopted the mantras of the Christian right only when he first ran for president.

So, what would I as a priest say to the man and to those around him this holy season? I'd quote the figure they mention so often, and how he said that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” I'd remind them of the rich young fellow who asked Jesus what he must do to obtain eternal life, and that Jesus replied that he should sell everything and give the money to the poor.

I'd tell of Jesus in the Temple, who found people selling bruised animals for sacrifice and exchanging currency at fraudulent levels, and how he made a whip of cords, drove these exploiters out of the temple, poured their coins onto the ground and overturned their tables.

I'd remind that when Jesus spoke of war and peace, he used words that in the original Greek are not passive but demanding and insistent. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” No arms trade, no military occupation, no threats to bomb and kill.

I'd speak of community and society, and how the MAGA cult of harsh individualism is antithetical to Gospel values. “How does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?” said Jesus. “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.”

I'd ask them what they say to God during times of prayer. In those intimate, emotionally naked moments do they genuinely listen, do they open themselves up, ask for guidance, and question their bombast and abuse? Or do they use religion, rather than faith, as a justification for malice and division? It isn't the first time this has happened, though some of us hoped we'd embraced history's lessons.

I'd ask if they wondered how Jesus would have reacted to a hard-working mother being arrested and deported even though all she wanted was a better life for her children. Ask them if admiring force rather than reason was the message of the beatitudes. Ask whether the Son of God told us to lie. Ask why they were so opposed to women's choice when Jesus never mentions abortion. Ask why they were so intimidated by society's fringes when that was precisely where Jesus found his natural home.

Ask them, plead with them, to embrace the truth of the Easter heart set free. And that I'll pray for them.

    Editor's Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.



            On a trip to the English countryside, Catherine, Princess of Wales, signaled that the Y2K style revival — which has resurrected both Ugg boots and wearing dresses over pants — is still in full swing.
    


            In a short film released by the palace on Monday, the princess is seen sporting a puffy dark green baker boy hat as she joined a group of Scouts for an outing in England's Lake District last month.
    


            The baker boy hat (also called a newsboy cap) was a staple of '90s and early '00s fashion. Jennifer Lopez matched hers with a pink tracksuit, Britney Spears' collection included variations in blue denim and pink leather, and Anne Hathaway wore a tweed version in “The Devil Wears Prada” following her fashionable on-screen makeover.
    


            This isn't Kate's first time rocking the iconic noughties look — in fact, it appears to be her go-to when visiting the Scouts. Back in 2013, the then-Duchess of Cambridge wore a similarly small-brimmed, puffy style to join the youth organization for a volunteer training day.
    


            Despite its name, the hats were not exclusively worn by bakers. The style's humble beginnings instead date back to 1571, when England's parliament passed a law requiring all working-class men to wear woolen hats on Sundays and holidays, or risk a fine, according to British hatmaker Hicks & Brown. The caps proved popular with dockworkers, shipwrights and bandits, and, over time, the baker boy hat became synonymous with the newsboy cap (which was actually worn by boys working at newsstands).
    


            Though Kate's choice of headgear has been called “divisive” by Vogue and a “Dickensian fashion moment” by Elle Australia, she's in good company: Kendall Jenner was spotted walking the streets of New York City in a baker boy hat earlier this year and Anne Hathaway opted for the throwback look in Paris in 2023.
    


            Never one to shy away from an outfit repeat, the Princess of Wales also appeared to sport the exact jacket she wore in the controversial edited family photo amid speculation about her health following abdominal surgery last year (she subsequently revealed her cancer diagnosis a few weeks later). In the latest video, she matched the green bomber with a cozy camel-knit sweater and a classic pair of skinny jeans.  matched the green bomber with a cozy camel-knit sweater and a classic pair of skinny jeans.
    


            The princess, who has served as joint president of the UK's Scouts association since 2020, wore the ensemble for her walk with a group of Scouts aged between 10 and 15 near the shores of Lake Windermere in northwest England.
    


            “I find it a very spiritual and very intense emotional reconnection,” she said, describing her relationship with nature in a short film about the excursion. “It is so therefore meaningful to me as a place to balance and find a sort of sense of peace and reconnection in what is otherwise a very busy world.”

            Maintaining a good relationship between the United States and Europe has long been seen as a no-brainer by leaders on both side of the Atlantic. After all, it's this friendship that has led to decades of peace, stability and prosperity.
    


            And then came US President Donald Trump.
    


            In his second term, Trump and his closest aides have repeatedly expressed a deep disdain for Europe, centered mainly around their belief that the continent is taking advantage of the US when it comes to security and trade.
    


            They say the US has for decades been subsidizing Europe's inadequate defense spending, while getting slapped with tariffs and trade barriers in return.
    


            But their dislike seems to be at least partly rooted in ideology.
    


            Majda Ruge, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that Trump's foreign policy is an extension of the culture wars that he and his administration are leading against liberalism at home.
    


            “And Europe is considered to be one of the bastions of that liberalism,” she said.
    


            She said Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement has been largely inspired by people's disappointment with globalization.
    


            “It is based on grievances and backlash against globalization, elites, against international organization, supranationalism and everything that the European Union represents,” Ruge told CNN. “And then you have the backlash against progressive liberal policies on gender, on education, on immigration. Again, Europe finds itself there on the wrong side of the culture war,” she added.
    


            Few in the Trump administration have shown as much contempt for Europe as Vice President JD Vance.
    


            Just weeks into his tenure, Vance stunned European leaders by using his speech at the Munich Security Conference to berate them over free speech and migration. He went as far as suggesting that the biggest threat to European security wasn't Russia or China, but “the threat from within,” which he characterized as “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.”

            He followed that up a wide-ranging interview with British website UnHerd on April 15 where he shared his and the president's frustration with European leaders.
    


            “The reality is – it's blunt to say it, but it's also true – that Europe's entire security infrastructure, for my entire life, has been subsidized by the United States of America,” he said.
    


            “It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States.”
    


            But the extent of his dislike for the continent was laid bare when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to a group chat of Trump's top officials on the nongovernment messaging app Signal.
    


            Vance suggested calling off a US attack on the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who had been disrupting key international shipping routes for months, because it would help European economies more than it would America's.
    


            “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in the chat.
    


            That remark was in line with Trump's long-held belief that European countries have been able to underspend on defense because they knew the US would step in and bail them out.
    


            He has threatened to take the US out of NATO and questioned Article 5 of the treaty, the principle of collective defense – a key pillar of the alliance that has only been invoked once in its history, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.
    


            Trump made defense spending a major issue when he first became US commander in chief and 22 out of NATO's then 27 members were spending less than the agreed upon 2% of their GDP on defense.
    


            Things have changed since then – partly because of Trump's pressure, but mostly because of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which was a major wake-up call for Europe.
    


            In 2024, only eight out of the expanded alliance's 32 members didn't meet the target.
    


            And while it is true that the US has invested a lot of money and manpower into Europe's security, experts say the picture is a lot more nuanced than how Vance and other top Trump lieutenants present it.

            “Americans didn't do this out of the goodness of their hearts,” Ruge said. “Regardless of the administration, the US has rarely done something on the foreign policy front, which hasn't been to the benefit of or in line with (the) national interests of the United States.”
    


            Sudha David-Wilp, vice president of external relations and senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, agreed with that assessment – and warned that pulling away from the time-tested alliance could end up costing the US.
    


            “Yes, the United States is the one that invests more blood and treasure, but the United States has also benefited from this network that has been created in the last 70 years,” she told CNN.
    


            The US was able to rely on the support of its European allies on a number of occasions, even when it didn't necessarily benefit their own political standing – such as when they refused to condemn the decision by the US to kill Iran's General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, or when they supported the US invasion of Afghanistan and contributed troops to the multinational force there as required by NATO's Article 5, even though majorities of their citizens opposed it.
    


            “Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Does it need reform? Yes. But by tearing it all down, it could make (the world) more dangerous and riskier for the United States,” David-Wilp said.
    


            Trump and those close to him have long pushed for the US to pull back from its traditional role as the world's policeman, warning against America's involvement in foreign conflicts.
    


            The paradox of this, Ruge said, is that Vance and other “restrainers” are aligned with many European countries who have in the past criticized US interventions abroad.
    


            Vance said as much in the interview with UnHerd, when he suggested that if Europe was a “little more willing to stand up” to the US, it “could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq.”
    


            Both Germany and France opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion, a stance which greatly angered the Bush administration. The then-Secretary of State Colin Powell threatened France with “consequences” over its decision to stand up to Washington. An anti-French sentiment took hold across the US — with actions like “French fries” being renamed “freedom fries” in establishments around the country.
    


            “If you think about the Signal chat, where they're going into the action of bombing of Houthis in Yemen and saying ‘we're going to give the bill to Europeans,' well, there's an amount of hypocrisy, because American action – especially in the Middle East and North Africa – has produced huge amounts of liabilities for Europe,” Ruge said.
    


            The US has a vast network of military bases across Europe, with some 80,000 service members deployed there, down from a 20-year peak of 105,000 at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The current number is roughly one fifth of what it used to be during the Cold War.
    


            The strategy of stationing American troops closer to conflict zones dates back to World War II and has proven to be beneficial time and time again.
    


            While different administrations have tinkered with the number of troops and locations of bases, the US has always maintained a significant military presence around the world.
    


            “One can certainly make credible arguments that it's important to move assets to regions like the Indo-Pacific, but it still makes sense to have a presence in Europe, because having a presence in Europe also helps the United States when it comes to out-of-area conflict,” David-Wilp said.

            According to research by the Atlantic Council, it would cost the US taxpayer nearly $70 million more per year to rotate military forces in and out of Europe rather than have them based in Germany and Poland.
    


            The huge investments the US has been making into defense in Europe and elsewhere have also directly benefited the American economy.
    


            Because while Trump and others often make it sound like the US is pouring cash into Europe, and Ukraine in particular, what the US is mostly doing is pouring money into American defense contractors.
    


            “In terms of what the alliance has given to the US, besides all the other benefits, just in terms of the economy – the benefit (the) American economy has drawn from this in terms of weapon sales and weapon production is huge,” Ruge said.
    


            Of the more than $175 billion in aid that the US Congress has appropriated to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than $120 billion has been spent directly with US companies or on US Forces, according to conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute.
    


            And according to the Kiel Institute, which monitors aid to Ukraine, European countries have provided even more aid to Ukraine than the US – first by using their own existing arsenals and then by procuring weaponry from Western defense industries. With four out of the top five global defense contractors being American companies, US industry is getting a sizable chunk of this new business.
    


            Trump has made his personal contempt for the European Union clear on multiple occasions in recent months. He even complained to Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, incorrectly, that the bloc was making it difficult for him to expand his golf resort in Ireland.
    


            Last month, Trump claimed the EU was “formed to screw the United States” when announcing his “Liberation Day” tariffs.
    


            It was a strange suggestion given that the EU would likely not exist if it wasn't for the post-war push by the US to help form it. President Harry Truman was a great advocate of European unity and his and subsequent US administrations have supported European integration, seeing a united Europe as a more prosperous trade partner and stable ally.
    


            In Trump's worldview, the US is being “screwed” by the EU because it is running an overall trade deficit with the bloc. But, just like with defense spending, the issue is more complex than Trump might suggest.
    


            The US and the EU have the largest trading relationship in the world, having traded $1.4 trillion worth of goods and services in 2023, according to the latest available official data. And while the US ran a trade deficit with the EU in goods, it had a surplus in services.
    


            The two sides have been balancing on the edge of a trade war after Trump unveiled 25% tariffs on European steel, aluminum and car exports, and 20% “reciprocal” tariffs on all other goods. The EU said it would retaliate but then put a pause on the planned countermeasures after Trump announced he'd temporarily halt the tariffs.
    


            But while a full-blown trade conflict has been avoided for now, trust between the two sides of the Atlantic has been fractured – perhaps irreparably.

NEW YORK, April 18. /TASS/. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that at his recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he discussed the territorial aspect of the Ukraine conflict, and that the issue could be partially resolved in Russia's favor.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Witkoff said that "Russia might get some of the regions, but not all." The US envoy also suggested "that Ukraine might care less about some of the regions if they are Russian speaking," the newspaper notes.

According to Witkoff, the territorial issue was the focus of his talks with the Russian leader.

The US presidential envoy told Fox News earlier that he had already held three meetings with Putin. Witkoff noted that their recent talks in St. Petersburg had allowed him to understand that Putin wanted "permanent peace." According to the US envoy, the "so-called five territories" (Crimea, the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions - TASS) are crucial for resolving the conflict. However, in his words, "there's so much more to it."

Putin and Witkoff met in the Russian city of St. Petersburg on April 11. The meeting, which lasted over four hours, was focused on the situation in Ukraine.

Putin has repeatedly called for resolving the Ukraine conflict, highlighting the need to take Russia's interests into account when addressing the root causes of the crisis. According to him, this is the only way to establish long-term peace, which is what Moscow wants.

US president tells reporters he needs to see ‘enthusiasm' from both sides to end the war in Ukraine

Donald Trump has been speaking to reporters during the swearing-in ceremony for Mehmet Oz as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

On the subject of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said:

We're going to get it done ideally. If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult … we're going to just take a pass. Hopefully we won't have to do that.

He said he believed there was a “good chance” of “solving the problem”.

Gary Shapley, the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, has been ousted after treasury secretary Scott Bessent complained to Donald Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of billionaire Elon Musk, according to the New York Times.

Citing five people with knowledge of ousting, the New York Times reports that Bessent believed that Musk “had done an end run around him” to get Shapley installed, despite the IRS having to report to Bessent's department.

The Times further reports that Musk's so-called “department of goverment efficiency” encouraged Shapley's appointment through White House channels without consulting Bessent, according to the sources who spoke to the outlet.

The next acting head of the IRS is expected to be the deputy treasury secretary, Michael Faulkender, the Times reported.

He would hold the role until the president's nominee for the permanent role, former Missouri congressman Billy Long, if approved by the Senate, takes over.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, Donald Trump said that the US is having good conversations with China amid the ongoing trade war between the two countries.

“By the way, we have nice conversations going with China … It's, like, really very good,” he said.

He did not offer additional details, Reuters reports.

On Tuesday, China Daily, the country's official state media published an editorial saying:

“The US is not getting ripped off by anybody… The problem is the US has been living beyond its means for decades. It consumes more than it produces. It has outsourced its manufacturing and borrowed money in order to have a higher standard of living than it's entitled to based on its productivity. Rather than being ‘cheated', the US has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train.”

A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a request by the Trump administration to allow it to move forward with removing temporary legal protections for about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants.

Reuters reports that the San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals declined to pause a lower-court judge's 31 March order halting homeland security secretary Kristi Noem's decision to terminate the temporary protected status granted to Venezuelans.

Trump, asked about Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, says he has “no interest in that prisoner”.

“He's a fake,” Trump tells reporters.

I know. I know them all. They're all fake.

He claims Ábrego García's record is “unbelievably bad” and that he's “not a very innocent guy”.

Trump said his entire life has been “one big negotiation” and that he can recognize when people are “playing” him.

He tells reporters he needs to see “enthusiasm” from both sides to end the war in Ukraine.

I think I see that enthusiasm. I think I see it from both sides.

“Nobody's playing me,” he adds.

Donald Trump has been speaking to reporters during the swearing-in ceremony for Mehmet Oz as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

On the subject of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said:

We're going to get it done ideally. If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult … we're going to just take a pass. Hopefully we won't have to do that.

He said he believed there was a “good chance” of “solving the problem”.

A federal judge who blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ruled the agency cannot go forward immediately with plans to fire hundreds of employees.

US district judge Amy Berman Jackson expressed concern that administration officials have not been complying with her earlier order that maintains the agency's existence until she rules on the merits of a lawsuit seeking to preserve the bureau, the Associated Press reported.

Jackson said she will bar the carrying out of any mass firings or cutting off of employees' access to agency computer systems.

A hearing has been scheduled for 28 April to hear testimony from officials.

Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke about US-UK trade talks and Ukraine in a phone call on Friday, according to Downing Street.

A statement from a No 10 spokesperson reads:

The leaders began by discussing the ongoing and productive discussions between the UK and US on trade. The Prime Minister reiterated his commitment to free and open trade and the importance of protecting the national interest.

The leaders also discussed the situation in Ukraine, Iran and recent action taken against the Houthis in Yemen.

They agreed to stay in touch.

Faced with a flurry of adverse court orders it would rather not follow, the Trump White House is increasingly deploying a strategy of claiming or even manufacturing its own uncertainty to dodge their effects without appearing to outright defy them.

The Trump administration has faced several major legal setbacks in recent weeks, most notably in its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants without due process under the Alien Enemies Act or in spite of protective orders.

In each of the two cases, when ordered to take specific steps to recall deportation flights or secure the release of a man wrongly deported, the administration has opted to adopt twisted readings of the order rather than comply.

Addressing Van Hollen, the White House said Ábrego García is “NOT coming back”.

Donald Trump and his team will continue to study whether to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said.

“The president and his team will continue to study that matter,” Hassett told reporters at the White House in response to a question.

Trump lambasted Powell as “always too late and wrong” in a Truth Social post on Thursday, condemning him for not lowering US interest rates.

Trump has claimed Powell would resign if he asked him to. Powell himself has said that he would not resign if asked to do so by the president.

Secretary of state threatens to pull plug ‘within days', as Kyiv says it has signed mineral deal memorandum

The US will abandon its efforts “within days” to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine unless there are clear signs a settlement can be reached, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said, as Kyiv says it has signed a memorandum with the US over a controversial minerals deal.

Speaking in Paris on Friday after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said Donald Trump was still interested in a deal. But he added that the US president had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress.

“It is not our war. We didn't start it,” Rubio said, adding that if a deal were not possible – with both sides still far apart – the US president was “probably at a point where he's going to say, well, we're done”. Trump felt “very strongly” about this, he said.

Rubio's comments are the clearest signal yet that the White House is ready to walk away from its diplomatic attempts to negotiate an end to the war. It was unclear if this would also mean an end to US military assistance to Kyiv. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that deliveries had already “practically stopped”.

Last month Zelenskyy agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin, however, has rejected the plan. Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that ending the war was “not a simple topic”. Moscow was seeking a settlement that “ensured its own interests”, he added.

In recent weeks Russia has launched a fresh military push across the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and stepped up its air attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. On Sunday it bombed the city of Sumy, killing 35 people and injuring 117.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January he has piled pressure on Ukraine, stopping most US military assistance and temporarily cutting off intelligence sharing. This week he falsely blamed Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.

In contrast, Trump has refused to criticise the Russian president or to impose sanctions on or punish Moscow. Senior US officials – including the special envoy Steve Witkoff, who held talks last week with Putin in St Petersburg – have instead parroted Kremlin talking points.

According to Bloomberg, the US's latest peace plan presented on Thursday to European leaders would effectively freeze the war along the existing frontline. Russia would keep the territory it occupies, while Kyiv would not be allowed to join Nato.

Talks are due to continue in London next week. US officials conceded that the proposal would be irrelevant if the Kremlin did not agree to stop the fighting, and said security guarantees were essential for Ukraine if the deal were to work, Bloomberg reported.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, speaking in Rome after a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said he was optimistic “the very brutal war” could be stopped. “Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on,” he said.

Meanwhile, significant details of the minerals deal remain unclear, including whether Kyiv has agreed to a White House demand that it “pays back” the cost of earlier military assistance.

Zelenskyy was poised in February to sign a framework agreement over a wide-ranging economic partnership. It was derailed after his disastrous encounter with Trump and Vance in the Oval Office.

Since then negotiations have continued. Overnight, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, said a memorandum had been finalised. It paved the way for the setting up of an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, she indicated.

“We are happy to announce the signing with our American partners,” she said. Speaking to reporters in the White House, Trump said a deal could be signed next Thursday.

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, added: “We're still working on the details.” He said the latest version ran to 80 pages and was “substantially what we'd agree on previously”. “That's what we will be signing,” he said.

According to the latest draft, seen by the Guardian, Ukraine acknowledges the “significant material and financial support” Kyiv has received from the US since Russia's 2022 invasion and the desire from both countries for a “lasting peace”.

It says Ukraine's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, will visit Washington next week to hold final “technical talks” with Bessent. They are expected to complete discussions on a “reconstruction investment fund”, the memo adds.

The deal would need to be ratified by Ukraine's parliament, Ukraine's deputy minister of economy said on Friday.

Zelenskyy is keen to improve relations with the Trump administration. At the same time, he has so far rejected the White House's demand that revenue from the new joint fund is used to cover the cost of weapons deliveries provided by the Biden administration.

Trump has previously said Ukraine “owes” the US $300bn (£226bn). Zelenskyy has pointed out this assistance was given as a grant, not as a loan, with Republicans and Democrats approving it in Congress. Any future partnership has to be based on “parity”, and should benefit both countries, he says.

The deal may help US weapons manufacturers who are facing a critical shortfall of key rare-earth minerals imported from China. Beijing has restricted their export in response to Trump's escalating trade war.

Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy thinktank in Kyiv, said the deal had gone through “multiple iterations”. He added: “It's hard to say what's inside.”

Landa said he did not expect Kyiv to accept that previous “non-refundable military aid” was now “debt”. “That's not only unfair and unrealistic, but may also negatively affect the full global financial system,” he said.

He continued: “If it suddenly turns out that countries and organisations can demand payments for aid given unconditionally in previous years, it will make recipients more cautious, and could reopen difficult issues from previous decades around the world.”

The latest negotiations came as Russia killed one person and injured about 70 in a ballistic missile strike on a residential area of the city of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine. Five of the injured were children. There were also strikes on Dnipro, Kyiv and Mykolaiv, as well as the Donetsk region.

“This is how Russia began this Good Friday – with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shaheds – maiming our people and cities,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the Russians used ballistic missiles equipped with cluster munitions. “That is why the affected areas are so extensive,” he said. At least 20 blocks of flats, 30 houses and an educational institution were damaged.

On Palm Sunday Russia dropped two Iskander missiles in the city centre of Sumy. One of them hit a congress centre. The other exploded between two university buildings and next to a crowded bus and cars.

The United States is shutting down three of its eight operational bases in northeastern Syria, reducing its military presence from 2,000 to 1,400 troops, the New York Times reported on April 17, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The closures include Mission Support Site Green Village, MSS Euphrates, and a smaller unnamed facility. U.S. commanders will reportedly decide within 60 days whether to further reduce the troop presence.

Despite the reduction, the U.S. military will continue supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance controlling northeastern Syria, in operations against the Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump has "expressed deep skepticism" about maintaining any military presence in Syria. However, military analysts have recommended keeping at least 500 troops in the country to counter lingering terrorist threats. 

Since pro-Russian dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a rebel offensive and fled to Russia, Moscow also began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country.

A Russian delegation had since traveled to Syria to meet the new leadership, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin pledged support and cooperation to Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Bloomberg reported that Moscow is close to an agreement with Syria's new government to maintain a limited military presence in exchange for assisting with anti-Islamic State operations in eastern Syria.

Ukraine has also reached out to Syria's new government regarding Russia's military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30, 2024, and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter.

A full ceasefire in Ukraine is "unrealistic," Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said during an April 17 briefing, challenging diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

The statement came more than a month after Ukraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposal, introduced during earlier negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. 

"We had an attempt at a limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure facilities, which was not observed by the Ukrainian side," Nebenzya claimed, referring to a partial deal reached during U.S.-mediated talks in Riyadh on March 25.

"Under the current circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to talk about a (full) ceasefire at this stage."

After meeting with U.S. delegates on March 11, Kyiv accepted the full ceasefire deal on the condition that Russia would also halt hostilities and refrain from undermining Ukraine's defenses. Moscow refused, demanding a halt to foreign military aid and restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Russia's rejection of the full truce has coincided with strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure. According to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Moscow has violated the energy ceasefire more than 30 times since its announcement.

The Kremlin denies the accusations. Its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claimed Russia continues to honor the agreement but "reserves the right" to abandon it if Ukraine fails to comply.

Russia claims that it has been upholding a 30-day moratorium on strikes against energy facilities since a verbal agreement in a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18.

This period lapsed on April 17, and Peskov said no decision has been made yet on the next steps. Kyiv has dismissed the March 18 truce announcement as a Kremlin propaganda stunt without any substance, saying Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian energy facilities since then.

In turn, Russia accused Ukraine of targeting the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast and other energy facilities — accusations that Kyiv has rejected — as Moscow seeks justifications to continue its attacks on Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on March 28 to submit evidence of Russian violations to U.S. officials. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Moscow had sent a list of ceasefire breaches to the U.S., the U.N., and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

With U.S.-led diplomatic talks stalled, Russia continues to insist on maximalist demands, showing little readiness for a genuine peace agreement. Ukraine maintains it remains committed to a complete ceasefire if Russia agrees to reciprocate.

A Democratic senator has met a man wrongly deported from the US to El Salvador and called on the Trump administration to speed up his return.

Chris Van Hollen, the senator for Maryland, posted a photograph on X of him meeting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the United States in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation.

Mr Van Hollen said also called Mr Abrego Garcia's wife on Thursday “to pass along his message of love”. 

The lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Mr Abrego Garcia, whose lawyers are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US.

The Trump administration has called his deportation a mistake and the US Supreme Court has called on the White House to bring him back.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting minutes before Van Hollen shared his post, saying, “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.” 

Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody 🇺🇸🤝🏼🇸🇻 https://t.co/2xVt4SNOGn

A spokeswoman for El Salvador's presidency said she had no further information.

The meeting came hours after Mr Van Hollen said he was denied entry into a high-security El Salvador prison on Thursday while he was trying to check on Mr Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.

The Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about 3 kilometres (2 miles) from the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.

“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” Mr Van Hollen said.

President Trump and Mr Bukele said this week that they have no basis to send Mr Abrego Garcia back.

US government officials have said that Mr Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who was living in Maryland, has ties to the MS-13 gang, but his lawyers say the government has provided no evidence of that and Mr Abrego Garcia has never been charged with any crime related to such activity.

Mr Van Hollen's trip has become a partisan flashpoint in the US as Democrats have seized on Mr Abrego Garcia's deportation as what they say is a cruel consequence of Mr Trump's disregard for the courts. 

Republicans have criticised Democrats for defending him and argued that his deportation is part of a larger effort to reduce crime. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt held a news conference Wednesday with the mother of a Maryland woman who was killed by a fugitive from El Salvador in 2023.

The Maryland senator told reporters on Wednesday that he met with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who said his government could not return Mr Abrego Garcia to the United States.

“So today, I tried again to make contact with Mr Abrego Garcia by driving to the CECOT prison,” Mr Van Hollen said Thursday.

Mr Van Hollen said Mr Abrego Garcia has not had any contact with his family or his lawyers. “There has been no ability to find out anything about his health and well-being,” Van Hollen said. He said Abrego Garcia should be able to have contact with his lawyers under international law.

“We won't give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected,” Mr Van Hollen said. He said there would be “many more” lawmakers coming to El Salvador.

Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, is also considering a trip to El Salvador, as are some House Democrats.

While Mr Van Hollen was denied entry, several House Republicans have visited the notorious gang prison in support of the Trump administration's efforts. 

Riley Moore, a West Virginia congressman, posted Tuesday evening that he had visited the prison where Mr Abrego Garcia is being held. He did not mention Mr Abrego Garcia but said the facility “houses the country's most brutal criminals”.

“I leave now even more determined to support President Trump's efforts to secure our homeland,” Mr Moore wrote on social media.

The fight over Mr Abrego Garcia has also played out in contentious court filings, with repeated refusals from the government to tell a judge what it plans to do, if anything, to repatriate him.

Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the US more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants — whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country's maximum-security gang prison just outside San Salvador. 

That prison is part of Mr Bukele's broader effort to crack down on the country's powerful street gangs, which has put 84,000 people behind bars and made the president extremely popular at home.

Human rights groups have accused Mr Bukele's government of subjecting those jailed to “systematic use of torture and other mistreatment.” 

Officials deny wrongdoing.

UNITED NATIONS, April 18. /TASS/. A ceasefire in Ukraine is unrealistic at this point, as Kiev fails to honor the moratorium on striking energy infrastructure, said Russia's envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya.

"We had an attempt at a limited ceasefire concerning energy infrastructure, which was not observed by the Ukrainian side. Under these circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to talk about a ceasefire at this point," he told reporters.

On March 18, US President Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the sides of the conflict to refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed and immediately gave the Russian military the appropriate command. Vladimir Zelensky later said Ukraine would also support the proposal.

However, Ukraine attacked Russian energy sites from March 18 to April 16 in 15 regions. They are the Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Zaporozhye, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Krasnodar and Kherson regions, Crimea, and the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. The strikes were carried out with drones and various artillery capabilities, including the HIMARS. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Kiev has not actually observed the moratorium, and attempts to attack the Russian energy sector continue.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on President Trump withdrawing her bid for the U.N. ambassadorship, Columbia University's interim president resigning and Iran signaling openness to 'indirect' nuclear talks.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., have already begun trading barbs in the 2026 gubernatorial race amid reports that the Republican congresswoman is considering a run.

When asked about Stefanik's potential bid, the Democrat responded by saying she's heard from "people in the North Country" concerned about Trump's tariffs policies and how that will impact the region, particularly with its relationship with Canada.

"So, no matter who the GOP nominee is next year that I'll be running against, it'll be an extreme MAGA Republican and I look forward to that fight," Hochul said while taking questions on Wednesday.

Stefanik, who has not officially announced a campaign, clapped back at the governor.

"The Worst Governor in America takes the bait and responds by talking about ‘People in the North Country.' Just a quick reminder of Hochul's abysmal polling of the "People in the North Country - it is the region where she is the least popular in the entire state…and that's saying a lot because she's unpopular everywhere," Stefanik posted to X on Wednesday afternoon.

"And North Country voters will not forget her attempt to disenfranchise and rob them of their voice and vote. They will not forget what she did to our farmers and our COs. Oh and one more thing … even Democrat candidates in the North Country refuse to publicly support her. Just ask them!" she continued.

Although Cook Political Report ranks the race as "Likely D," Hochul is currently facing scrutiny for a 39% approval rating, according to a recent Marist poll. The Democrat notably faced off against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in 2022 while he was in Congress. He had the best Republican gubernatorial performance since Gov. George Pataki won in 2002.

Stefanik was recently pulled as the United Nations Ambassador pick in order to keep the narrow Republican majority in the House as high as possible.

"I have been proud to be a team player. The president knows that. He and I had multiple conversations today, and we are committed to delivering results on behalf of the American people. And as always, I'm committed to delivering results on behalf of my constituents," she said on Fox News' "Hannity" last month.

Just hours before reports emerged that Stefanik was considering her next political move, Trump posted to Truth Social that "Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is GREAT!!!" Sources told Fox News that allies of the president have encouraged her to run.

On the Republican side, Rep. Mike Lawler, Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman and Bethany town supervisor Carl Hyde Jr. are also considering bids. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Rep. Ritchie Torres may primary Hochul.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praises the courage of a guest at the briefing and calls out Democrats' hypocrisy on illegal immigration on Hannity.

The White House released a splitscreen image overnight to underscore the stark contrast between where Republicans and Democrats stand on illegal immigration. 

One image featured distraught Angel Mom Patty Morin being comforted by President Trump in the Oval Office. Morin's daughter, Rachel Morin, was savagely beaten, raped and killed in Maryland by an illegal migrant from El Salvador in 2023. 

The other image showed Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., sitting and talking with deported illegal alien Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, in El Salvador.

RACHEL MORIN'S MOTHER TEARFULLY BEGS MEDIA TO 'TELL THE TRUTH' ABOUT CRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Abrego Garcia was deported last month by the Trump administration, which says that he was an MS-13 gang member who also violently beat his wife. 

Van Hollen, who called the deportation "absolutely unjust," flew to El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia's release.

"We are not the same," the White House captioned the image while tagging Van Hollen.

The image of Morin was taken on Wednesday when she visited the White House and spoke to reporters from the White House briefing room, where she called out Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador. 

She noted that Van Hollen, who represents her state, had never once reached out to her since her daughter was killed.

"To have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge – barely acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, and now a grandbaby without a grandmother, so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that is not even an American citizen," Morin said. "Why does that person have more right than I do for my daughter or my grandchildren? I don't understand this." 

Following Martinez-Hernandez's conviction, Van Hollen issued a statement vowing to bolster border security while also "supporting our immigrant communities." 

Patty Morin appealed to the media to "tell the truth" about violent illegal aliens who were let into the country. Rachel Morin's killer, Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, allegedly committed a murder in his home country. He was also linked to a home invasion and assault in Los Angeles before moving to Maryland.

Van Hollen flew to El Salvador this week to meet with Abrego Garcia and was denied multiple times. He was granted his request on Thursday night and met with Abrego Garcia on Friday.

"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar," Van Hollen wrote on X, along with the picture the White House posted. "Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love."

Van Hollen previously said that it was "absolutely unjust and illegal to have this Marylander detained one more day in a notorious prison in El Salvador."

Garcia who was living in Maryland with his wife and children, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison "Terrorism Confinement Center" (CECOT) last month, and officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although now some top Trump officials say he was correctly removed and contend he's a member of the notorious MS-13 gang.

Both a federal district court and the U.S. Supreme Court have ordered the Trump administration to "facilitate" his release and return to the U.S. for proper deportation proceedings.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Abrego Garcia would not be allowed back into the U.S. unless El Salvador were to decide otherwise. "He is not coming back to our country."

Fox News contributor Sara Carter tells 'Hannity' about her visit to El Salvador's CECOT prison.

U.S. District Judge William Fitzpatrick has agreed to delay the Justice Department's motion to dismiss its case against Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, the Virginia-based Salvadorian national accused of being a top leader of the MS-13 gang in the U.S.

The ruling, handed down Friday, directs the government to keep Villatoro Santos in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, and not be transferred to DHS officials until the appeal is resolved.  

Villatoro Santos was arrested less than a month ago in Woodbridge, Virginia, and was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.

His high-profile arrest was supervised by both U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel from a nearby tactical center.

At the time, Bondi touted his capture and referred to him as the "top MS-13 leader" on the East Coast.

Shortly afterward, however, the Department of Justice abruptly filed a motion to dismiss their case against Villatoro Santos – prompting speculation as to what would happen to him next.

His counsel said during an April 15 hearing that the government had not clarified next steps for their client, and suggested the Trump administration might move to summarily deport him without due process.

Villatoro Santos' lawyer, Muhammad Elsayed, claimed during the April 15 hearing that the decision to dismiss the case had come from "high up" in the Trump administration, and argued if he were released, he would likely be deported almost immediately to CECOT, the Salvadorian prison housing hundreds of U.S. migrants. 

"They have already determined the outcome, that he'll go to the worst prison in the western hemisphere," Elsayed said earlier this week.

At the hearing, his attorneys also invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported last month to El Salvador for being an alleged MS-13 member.

Two federal judges in Texas and New York also temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act law to deport certain nationals, siding with their contention that the plaintiffs in question are at risk of removal by the Trump administration, possibly without the opportunity to seek habeas relief in a U.S. court.

The updates follow a 5–4 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a lower court's restraining order, allowing the Trump administration to temporarily resume use of the Alien Enemies Act — albeit with new due process protections for migrants.

The high court said individuals slated for deportation must have the opportunity to challenge their removal, with sufficient time to do so in a U.S. court.

Vice President JD Vance voiced confidence that the United States would be able to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, even as others in the Trump administration express doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about negotiations.

“We think we have some interesting things to report on, of course, in private. So the negotiations, I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close,” Vance said as he met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday in Rome, where he will spend Good Friday through Easter.

Vance's comments stand in contrast to those made just hours earlier by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who warned that if there aren't legitimate signs of progress in the coming days, President Donald Trump could halt his efforts to negotiate a peace deal.

RUBIO FLOATS IDEA THAT US WILL ‘MOVE ON' FROM RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL

“We're not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio told reporters after meeting with Ukrainian and European officials in Paris, France. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks.”

Rubio also added that if a deal is not possible, “then I think we're just going to move on.” 

Trump told reporters on Thursday that a long-delayed minerals deal will be signed next week, which could help on the Ukrainian side of negotiations.

Meloni and Vance met in the Oval Office on Thursday, during which the prime minister and Trump discussed negotiating a new trade deal between the United States and the European Union.

“We think Italy can be a reliable and serious partner in Europe, in the Mediterranean, in the Mediterranean area, and so we are proud to have this special relation with U.S. and with this administration,” Meloni said during the brief press conference in Rome.

On Friday morning, Trump and Meloni also released a joint statement that reaffirmed the two nations' cooperation on trade, Ukraine, and technology. Trump accepted Meloni's invitation to visit sometime in “the very near future.”

“The U.S. and Italy underscore that the war in Ukraine must end, and fully endorse President Trump's leadership in brokering a ceasefire and delivering a just and lasting peace,” the statement said. 

While in Rome, Vance, a convert to Catholicism, is also meeting with the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, but he is not expected to meet with Pope Francis, whom he has feuded with over the Trump administration's immigration policies.

Vance led the audience at the 20th National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in prayer for the ailing pope in February.

“Every day since I heard of Pope Francis's illness, I say a prayer for the Holy Father because while, yes, I was certainly surprised when he criticized our immigration policy in the way that he has, I also know that the pope, I believe that the pope is fundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership,” Vance said.

The vice president is in Italy with second lady Usha Vance and their children Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel. He is also set to visit India, where he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.

Fox News' Madeleine Rivera provides details on Sen. Chris Van Hollen's, D-Md., meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and the response from President Nayib Bukele. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react.

President Donald Trump is calling Sen. Chris Van Hollen a "fool" on Friday after the legislator flew to El Salvador to meet with deported illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia. 

"Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. GRANDSTANDER!!!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. 

Garcia, a 29-year-old illegal immigrant living in Maryland, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison "Terrorism Confinement Center" (CECOT) last month, and officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although now some top Trump officials say he had been correctly removed and contend that he is a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. 

"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar," Van Hollen, a Democrat, said in a post on X on Thursday. "Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return."

Van Hollen said earlier Thursday that "Kilmar Abrego Garcia had been illegally abducted and is being held in a notorious prison in El Salvador -- barred from contacting his family or lawyers." Van Hollen also spoke to the press in El Salvador, in a video posted on YouTube. 

Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez said in a statement that "we still have so many questions, hopes, and fears," according to the Associated Press. 

Both a federal district court and the U.S. Supreme Court have ordered the Trump administration to "facilitate" Garcia's release and return to the U.S. for proper deportation proceedings.

The Trump administration also released information on Wednesday indicating that Abrego Garcia's wife has accused him of repeated abuse of her.  

Fox News obtained the written domestic violence allegations filed in court against Abrego Garcia by Vasquez in 2021.

In the filing, written in her own handwriting, Vasquez alleged that Abrego Garcia had repeatedly beaten her, writing: "At this point, I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he [has] left me."

Ahead of Sunday's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, this Formula 1 season is looking like McLaren vs. McLaren. Still, defending champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull says he hasn't lost hope.

McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri are the only ones to consistently have the pace through the first four rounds of the championship. 

Norris has a three-point lead but admits he isn't at his best — though he had the fastest time of the day in practice on Friday — while Piastri has momentum after winning in Bahrain last week.

Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes have all had their moments but none has been a consistent challenger, as McLaren's 58-point constructors' championship lead shows. 

Norris went fastest in the second practice session, while Yuki Tsunoda crashed to continue his difficult start with Red Bull.

Norris was .163 seconds faster than Piastri in the second session, which was run under floodlights and more representative of race conditions than the hotter daytime session. Verstappen complained earlier in the day of his car feeling “very loose” in high-speed corners but ended Friday third fastest, .280 off Norris.

In his third race weekend with Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, Tsunoda clipped the wall on the inside of a corner and slid into the barrier on the other side, requiring a red flag.

Alpine's Pierre Gasly was the surprise leader in the first session, just .007 of a second faster than Norris. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari was .07 off Gasly in third and Piastri fourth, barely a tenth of a second off the pace. Lewis Hamilton was eighth in the other Ferrari. Verstappen was ninth.

Verstappen is the only non-McLaren driver to win a grand prix this season, but in Bahrain he was struggling so much that Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said he was concerned the Dutch star might reconsider his future.

Verstappen said this week he wasn't considering the championship picture this early in the season.

“I'm not thinking about that. I just go race by race,” he said. “At the moment we are not the quickest. So then naturally it's very tough to fight for a championship, but it's still a very long road ... I'm hopeful that we can still improve things.”

Two-time champion Fernando Alonso dampened speculation Verstappen could seek to join his Aston Martin team after Red Bull car designer Adrian Newey made that move last year.

Asked if he'd welcome being Verstappen's teammate, Alonso said Thursday: “Yes, but it's unlikely to happen. Very unlikely.”

Alonso's current teammate is Lance Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence Stroll.

Jeddah hosts the fifth race in six weeks in a hectic start to the season, which stays at a record 24 races. There's a little respite after Saudi Arabia, with two weeks till the next event in Miami.

“It's on the upper end of the limit. It feels like race 10 already,” said Williams driver Alex Albon, adding it's especially tough on mechanics and other crew members.

“As drivers, we travel better than everyone else in the paddock. We stay in better hotels than everyone else in the paddock — it's just a function of being in a privileged position. With mechanics ... these are people with families. These are the people that really struggle.”

The rookies are still enjoying their first taste of F1, though. 

“It's just the beginning of my career, so I just want to keep racing and keep driving,” Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto said. “I'm learning new things every single weekend, so for me, if I could have another race next weekend, I would be very happy as well.”

The United States could be ready to move on from brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested on Friday that President Donald Trump will halt his efforts to work on a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war if there aren't legitimate signs of progress in the upcoming days. Rubio's warning comes after he met with Ukrainian and European officials in Paris. 

“We're not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said after meeting with officials on Thursday. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks.”

Rubio stressed that these were Trump's sentiments and that the president had spent much time trying to broker a deal. However, the secretary of state said other consequential matters required just as much time and attention.

“The president feels very strongly about that,” Rubio said. “He has dedicated a lot of time and energy to this. … This is important, but there are a lot of other really important things going on that deserve just as much, if not more, attention.”

The notion that the U.S. could walk away from brokering a deal came after Trump announced on Thursday that a minerals deal with Ukraine would be signed next week. 

“We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday … next Thursday,” Trump said. “Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later elaborated on the deal, stating that both sides are “still working on the details.” He added they were “shooting for around April 26” to complete the agreement.

TRACKING WHAT DOGE IS DOING ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

However, arranging a peace deal to end the war remains a challenging objective. It is a complex situation with multiple variables, a difficulty that Rubio acknowledged in his comments on Friday.

“There's no one saying this can be done in 12 hours,” Rubio added later. “But we want to see how far apart it is and whether those differences can even be narrowed, if it's even possible to get movement within the period of time we have in mind.”

            It's a familiar, beloved scene for millions across America: snow drifting outside and Christmas music playing while families decorate their homes with string lights, stockings and a star atop the tree.
    


            But few know exactly where those iconic holiday items come from.
    


            Most of the time, they hail from just one city in China's Zhejiang province: Yiwu, nicknamed “Christmas Town,” which supplies nearly 90% of all decorative Christmas goods used in the United States, according to state media.
    


            And many of those products can be traced back to Yiwu's wholesale market — the biggest in the world.
    


            It's a labyrinthine complex measuring nearly 1,000 acres, the equivalent of roughly 750 football fields. Inside, foreign buyers browse narrow corridors overflowing with merchandise, ranging from piano-playing musical Santa dolls to artificial Christmas trees — as well as countless other items destined for American homes, including “Make America Great Again” hats, massage guns and foldable camping chairs.
    


            But these days, there's an undercurrent of anxiety. These vendors are on the front lines of global trade — and are now grappling with triple-digit tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which have sent shockwaves across the world and upended relationships forged over decades between the US and China, two superpower economies.
    


America's overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%, the highest trade penalties imposed by the US in nearly a century, with Trump's most recent “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese imports coming after earlier rounds related to fentanyl.
    


            For many vendors, the measures have already cost them customers, slashed their profits and forced them to pivot to other markets. When CNN visited the market earlier this week, many voiced both concern and bewilderment at Trump's actions, but also desire for a peaceful resolution as they pick up the pieces of their disrupted businesses.
    


            “Some of our long-term clients have stopped dealing with us and we are all very sad,” said Ran Hongyan, 43, who has been selling Christmas decorations for 15 years.
    


            After the tariffs hit, she tried offering her American customers a discount to save the relationship, but it didn't work. Eight out of ten canceled their contracts this year, representing a loss of more than $135,000, she said.
    


            Ran said the US exports made up only a portion of her total clientele, but they're not just numbers on a screen or an accounting ledger. Many were longtime partners. She had met one American customer at a trade fair in China years ago, and they had worked together for nearly a decade; he even traveled to visit her factory where the products were made.
    


            “Because of the tariff issue, he said he had no choice but to cancel it this year and see what happens later,” she told CNN, standing amid rows of reindeer plushies and festive teddy bears in her small store. “We have been working together for a long time.”
    


            Much of President Trump's tariff rhetoric has been about restoring US factory jobs that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals.
    


            But it's difficult to see a future where the kind of products on display at Yiwu could be made by American hands — unless consumers are willing to pay much more for something as ubiquitous and currently inexpensive as plastic Christmas ornaments.
    


            The second-biggest exporter of Christmas decorations to the US is Cambodia, where factory wages are even lower than China, but Trump also imposed 49% tariffs on the small Southeast Asian nation, before the recent 90-day pause.
    


            The city of Yiwu is relatively small by Chinese standards, home to fewer than two million people, but it has an outsized footprint in global trade. Last year, it sent $81 billion of goods overseas, of which about $11.5 billion went to the US, according to local customs data.
    


            This massive impact is clear from the moment you land in the city. As you step off the plane, the boarding bridge connected to the airport is plastered with English ads that read: “China goods! Do global business in Yiwu!”
    


            When CNN visited the wholesale market, it was still bursting with activity. After all, the US is currently alone in slapping universal tariffs on the world's second-largest economy.
    


            The multi-story, multi-block complex boasts different types of goods on each floor, with coffee shops and snack stalls scattered throughout. Everywhere you turn, there is an explosion of color and sound, with an estimated 70,000 stalls crammed inside, according to local authorities.
    


            But the escalating trade war is already making a mark.
    


            CNN saw buyers from various countries perusing the booths and negotiating contracts with sellers, but there wasn't a single American in sight. Shopkeepers were on edge, too — with many declining to speak and cautious of local Chinese officials wandering the market.
    


            Even vendors who don't sell to the US are nervous.
    


            Trump may have delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other nations besides China, prompting many to suspend their own counter-measures, but talks are still ongoing, and there's no telling if the announced tariffs might be reinstated. Many economists, even Trump allies, are warning a global recession could still take place if the trade war continues.
    


            The back-and-forth means that the world's economies remain in flux, with consumers potentially tightening their purse strings and reassessing where they're spending their money. That could spell deep trouble for the people of Yiwu, whose livelihoods depend on overseas customers, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.
    


            Li Xinyao has been working at her family's imitation flower business at Yiwu market since it was established in 1993, selling plastic bouquets of roses, sunflowers, daisies and more. Though they don't currently have any American customers, their revenue has still taken a hit since the trade war kicked off.
    


            “Even though we think China will be better (and recover), but the United States is still the best country in the world, the richest,” she said. “The Americans always impact the world. When they start the trade war, all the people will worry about that, and our customers will maybe hold on (orders).”
    


            The turbulent global economy could also hurt her sales, since decorations, like plastic flowers, could be first on the chopping block for clients needing to cut expenditures, she said.
    


            “If we cannot lead a happy life, who will care about decorations?” she asked.
    


            For many other vendors, whose customer base is concentrated in the US, Trump's trade war means they will now need to look for other opportunities.
    


            In some ways, this pivot has been happening for years on a national level. The idea of decoupling, a scenario where two countries have virtually no trade or investment, has been bandied about in US-China circles for years, though such a historic rupture would cause enormous pain for both of the deeply intertwined economies.
    


            Tensions have been rising since the US-China trade war during Trump's first term, and China has been quietly bracing for a showdown in the years since. Since 2018, Beijing has diversified its supply chains and expanded trade relations with the rest of the world, thereby reducing the share of US exports. China's exports to the US made up 19.2% of its total overseas shipments in 2018 – but dropped to 14.7% in 2024, according to official figures.
    


            This means China now relies less on US businesses than it did before, an attitude the Yiwu sellers are adopting too.
    


            “I am now taking all goods that are halted by my US customers to the EU route. I will push all these goods to our EU customers,” said 39-year-old Nie Ziqin, who sells Halloween decorations.
    


            Up to half of her exports used to go to the US. Like Ran, she had cultivated trade relationships with “old customers for many years,” she said. But now, many of those orders have been suspended, even though they were negotiated before the tariffs were announced.
    


            Although her sales have dropped “significantly,” she voiced optimism about her other options. “I still have the domestic market, and the EU market. I am also doing cross-border e-commerce online,” she said, gesturing to the walls of ghostly masks, pumpkin lanterns, dancing ghouls and giant eyeballs around her.
    


            “Last year, we had already started to design products that (we) could sell to the Chinese domestic market.”
    


            Some of the vendors praised China's response to the trade war, echoing sentiments expressed on China's tightly controlled social media, where online users vented anger toward the US and supported Beijing's firm stance against Trump's tariffs.
    


            Last week Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125%, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping saying his nation was “not afraid.” Officials indicated Beijing would not raise rates further since it would be meaningless to continue escalating.
    


            “Our government is doing good in these things,” said Li, the imitation flower seller.
    


            But that doesn't lessen their fear, as they brace for impact and worry about what the trade war could mean for Yiwu and the families who live there.
    


            Li, the plastic flower seller, worries about how the state of the world will affect her six-year-old daughter “every day,” she said, adding that Chinese people “always worry about the next generation.” And even as a history buff, she remains confused about why Trump would launch such a trade war in the first place.
    


            “We want world peace. From my perspective, I really don't understand why they would do this,” she said.
    


            She and the other vendors all voiced hope that the two countries' leaders can reach an agreement and end the tit-for-tat tariffs that have plunged their lives and businesses into uncertainty. But as the trade war drags on, it's not clear whether that relationship can be repaired — or whether it will ever look the same again, even if vendors eventually resume selling to their long-time customers.
    


            For some, the damage has already been done.
    


            “When we do daily shopping, if we want to buy a bag or buy some daily necessities, we will now start considering whether these products are imported from the United States,” said Ran, the Christmas decorations seller.
    


            And if those goods are American-made: “I will definitely choose not to buy them.”

Vice President JD Vance is departing for a weeklong trip across Italy and India on Friday, just the latest in a string of diplomatic deployments President Donald Trump has assigned to his second in command.

According to the White House, the vice president and second lady Usha Vance will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, along with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, in Rome and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. 

One day earlier, Meloni met with Trump in the White House for a bilateral meeting focused on trade. The Vances will specifically “discuss shared economic and geopolitical priorities with leaders in each country,” the vice president's office said of his trips to Italy and India.

The assignment comes at a perilous moment in U.S. diplomacy. Both countries are facing heavy new tariff penalties should they fail to negotiate trade deals with the Trump administration by the summer. The president announced a 90-day pause of his “Liberation Day” tariffs earlier this month, lowering the effective rates for the European Union and India from 20% and 26%, respectively, to 10% while negotiations take place.

The trip also reflects the ways in which Vance, considered a possible successor to Trump in 2028, is rounding out his foreign policy portfolio. 

Last month, Vance traveled to Greenland to speak to American military personnel as the president continued to make the case for annexing the Danish territory. And in February, Trump sent Vance to Paris and then the Munich Security Conference, where he pressed European allies to increase their NATO defense contributions and take a more prominent role in policing the continent.

Ryan Walker, executive vice president of Heritage Action for America, told the Washington Examiner that Vance's ability to vocalize the “root” of Trump's “America First” foreign policy has made him a top “confidant” in crafting how the administration engages different foreign governments.

“Having someone like that in the administration is almost like a superpower, being able to communicate, boil it down to the root of what those policies are derived from, and based on what they're trying to solve,” Walker said of Vance. “JD Vance is the best one in the administration, in my view, at doing that and articulating the vision and the future for the American people, and, frankly, I think that the America First agenda and movement is going to need someone like JD in the future.”

Still, Vance's foreign relations input has produced a handful of hiccups. His remarks in Munich, and specifically accusations of free speech “backsliding” on the continent, were received icily by European allies. 

His recent comment that the United States is borrowing from “Chinese peasants” has apparently become an impediment to trade talks as well, with China asking that members of Trump's Cabinet remain respectful, according to Bloomberg.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian had called the remarks “astonishing and lamentable” last week.

Three veteran Republican operatives with ties to the White House suggested to the Washington Examiner that Vance is clearly being used as an enforcer abroad. The president has hosted a series of world leaders at the White House since January, but he is not expected to make his first foreign trip, to Saudi Arabia, until May.

“It's a great ‘one-two' punch,” one former Trump administration official said. “President Trump is trying to shake up America's relationships with allies and enemies alike. But he's also dealing with a ton at home, limiting his ability to travel and engage leaders on their own turf. That's where the vice president comes in.”

A second longtime Republican operative suggested that Vance's “happy warrior” mentality keeps foreign leaders “on their toes.” 

“These other countries are used to getting the bad cop routine from the Trump administration, so I think the vice president's ability to effectively vocalize the mechanics of President Trump's policies, and to do it with a smile, is invaluable,” that person continued. “It's a tool that the president really didn't have in his tool kit the last time around.”

TRUMP CONSIDERING CORPORATE TAX HIKE TO PAY FOR ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL' TAX REFORM PACKAGE

Ultimately, Walker thinks Vance's deployment as a top Trump messenger is helping to build the “leverage” to accomplish the president's foreign policy goals.

“I think our view is that something has to change, dynamics need to change, relationships need to change,” he explained. “Donald Trump, more than any other person in recent memory, at least in my view, understands leverage, and leverage is so important in developing trade relationships, developing military relationships, developing overall foreign policy relationships with other countries.”

Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni on President Trump's slated announcement on semiconductor tariffs and DOGE's new website enabling the American people to recommend potential cuts.

A federal judge in Baltimore issued a preliminary injunction Thursday restricting the Department of Government Efficiency's access to Social Security data. 

U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander, an Obama appointee, said DOGE-affiliated staffers must purge any of the non-anonymized Social Security data that they have received since Jan. 20. They are also barred from making any changes to the computer code or software used by the Social Security Administration, must remove any software or code they might have already installed, and are forbidden from disclosing any of that code to others.

The injunction does allow DOGE staffers to access data that's been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, if they undergo training and background checks. 

"The objective to address fraud, waste, mismanagement, and bloat is laudable, and one that the American public presumably applauds and supports," Hollander wrote in the ruling issued late Thursday night. "Indeed, the taxpayers have every right to expect their government to make sure that their hard earned money is not squandered."

But that's not the issue, Hollander said — the issue is with how DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, wants to do the work.

"For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation," the judge wrote.

The case was brought by a group of labor unions and retirees who allege DOGE's recent actions violate privacy laws and present massive information security risks. 

During a federal court hearing Tuesday in Baltimore, Hollander repeatedly asked the government's attorneys why DOGE needs "seemingly unfettered access" to the agency's troves of sensitive personal information to uncover Social Security fraud.

"What is it we're doing that needs all of that information?" Hollander said, questioning whether most of the data could be anonymized.

Attorneys for the Trump administration said changing the process would slow down their efforts.

"While anonymization is possible, it is extremely burdensome," Justice Department attorney Bradley Humphreys told the court. He argued the DOGE access doesn't deviate significantly from normal practices inside the agency, where employees and auditors are routinely allowed to search its databases.

But attorneys for the plaintiffs called it "a sea change" in terms of how the agency handles sensitive information.

Skye Perryman, President and CEO of the legal services group Democracy Forward, which is behind the lawsuit, said the ruling has brought "significant relief for the millions of people who depend on the Social Security Administration to safeguard their most personal and sensitive information." 

SCHUMER CALLS ON LELAND DUDEK, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF SSA, TO RESIGN

Hollander made clear that her order didn't apply to SSA workers who aren't affiliated with DOGE, so they can still access any data they use in the course of ordinary work. But DOGE staffers who want access to the anonymized data must first undergo the typical training and background checks required of other Social Security Administration staffers, she said.

Hollander, 75, is the latest judge to consider a DOGE-related case. Many of her inquiries Tuesday focused on whether the Social Security case differs significantly from another Maryland case challenging DOGE's access to data at three other agencies: the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. In that case, an appeals court recently blocked a preliminary injunction and cleared the way for DOGE to once again access people's private data.

Hollander's injunction could also be appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with the Trump administration in other cases, including allowing DOGE access to the U.S. Agency for International Development and letting executive orders against diversity, equity and inclusion move forward.

U.S. forces launched airstrikes against the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen on Thursday. The location is controlled by Houthi rebels, who have been causing havoc in the region. 

Thursday's military strike reportedly killed at least 38 people and wounded over 100 others. The attack was confirmed by the U.S. military's Central Command in a press release. 

“Today, U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” the statement read. “The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen. This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”

The number of casualties from the strike is believed to be one of the largest totals since President Donald Trump started ordering military strikes in March against the designated terrorist organization, the Associated Press reported.

Later, the Houthis reportedly fired a missile toward Israel on Friday, but it was intercepted, Israel's military said. The Times of Israel reported that the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command used a newly developed warning system to alert citizens in the area of the missile.

CENTCOM specified that Thursday's strike was intended to curtail the economic benefits the Houthis receive due to oil profits from the region. These funds allow the terrorist group to carry out its military operations instead of being distributed to people in Yemen.

“The Houthis have continued to benefit economically and militarily from countries and companies that provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,” CENTCOM's statement read. “The Iran-backed Houthis use fuel to sustain their military operations, as a weapon of control, and to benefit economically from embezzling the profits from the import.” 

“This fuel should be legitimately supplied to the people of Yemen,” the release noted. “Despite the Foreign Terrorist Designation that went into effect on 05 April, ships have continued to supply fuel via the port of Ras Isa. Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts.”

The Houthis denounced the U.S. airstrike in a statement of their own, the Associated Press reported. The group categorized the strike as directly “targeting of the entire Yemeni people.”

“This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,” the Houthis' statement read. “It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.”

            Russia's Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a ban on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization more than two decades ago.
    


            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as US and NATO troops were in the final weeks of withdrawing from the country after two decades of war.
    


            The Russian court's move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Moscow's list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law.
    


            At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker.
    


            The court's ruling on a request by the Prosecutor General's Office followed last year's adoption of a law stipulating that the official designation as a terrorist organization could be suspended by a court.
    


            The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989.
    


            Russian officials have recently been emphasizing the need to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan.
    


            In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terrorist groups.
    


            The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade.
    


            Such measures have isolated the Taliban on the world stage, although their government has established diplomatic ties with countries including China and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            The UN this year renewed its call for the Taliban to lift the bans.
    


            The group's decrees limiting the participation of girls and women have affected foreign aid to the country. The Taliban also have brought back their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, including public executions.
    


            Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the US under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases.
    


            Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with Crisis Group's Asia Program, said the Taliban's listing as a terrorist group was a legal impairment for trade and political ties with Kabul and its lifting reflected Moscow's desire to improve relations.
    


            “However, beyond making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage with Afghanistan, I am not sure what other major benefit this will have,” he said.
    


            South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Russian move was not ground-breaking because many countries had never formally designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization. At the same time, he called the decision a “win-win” for bilateral relations.
    


            For Russia, he said it would serve as a confidence-building measure helping pave the way for more engagement and enabling Moscow to better protect its interests in Afghanistan, particularly concerns about anti-Russia terror groups like Islamic State-Khorasan.
    


            “Meanwhile, for the Taliban, the court decision is a legitimacy-boosting outcome they can leverage to point to international acceptance of their rule,” Kugelman observed.

PARIS (AP) — France hosted high-level talks Thursday to discuss Ukraine and its security, the first time since President Donald Trump's inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials are known to have met together to discuss an end to the war. 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff joined other top Ukrainian and European officials for hours of separate meetings at the French presidential palace before French President Emmanuel Macron brought them all together for a final round of talks at the end of the day.

Macron described the talks as an important “convergence.” France announced that talks in the same format would continue in London next week.

The meetings came as concerns grow about Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia and after weeks of U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine failed to bring an end to the fighting. There is also frustration among Europeans over the Trump administration's other moves, from tariffs on some of its closest partners to rhetoric about NATO and Greenland.




Rubio wrote on X that the American delegation in Paris was looking to “secure real, practical solutions to end the Russia-Ukraine war.”

Rubio also spoke by phone Thursday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, conveying the same message he gave the delegations in Paris, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.

“President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” the statement says. “The encouraging reception in Paris to the U.S. framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement.”

Until now, Trump's officials have pursued separate negotiating tracks between the United States and Ukraine, and between the U.S. and Russia. 

Senior U.S. officials had previously made comments suggesting European representatives would not be involved in ceasefire negotiations. Experts said the talks are thought to be the first time Witkoff — Trump's chief envoy tasked with negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin — has met senior Ukrainian officials. 

Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, called this “really, really important. And I think that is emerging because I think the U.S. process has stalled and ... they realized that you need European input because they have skin in the game.''

“This is not just about a swath of territory in Ukraine,” she said. “This is about broader questions of European security and you can't disentangle those.″

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wanted his representatives to raise the question of security guarantees for Ukraine, and said he gave his team a mandate to discuss a full and partial ceasefire — but not matters relating to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

A senior French official said after Thursday's talks that U.S. officials were ''ready to discuss security guarantees,″ without elaborating. The official spoke anonymously as he was not authorized to be publicly named, according to presidential policy.

Ukraine's presidential adviser, Andrii Yermak, said the Ukrainian delegation and European partners discussed the next steps toward achieving a “just and lasting peace,” including a full ceasefire, the deployment of a multinational military contingent, and the development of an effective security architecture for Ukraine.

“It was a very substantive conversation. We continue our work,” he wrote.

Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, also joined the talks. Other participants included Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, the German government's foreign policy adviser and German Foreign Ministry's political director.

Around 30 countries led by Britain and France have been discussing a possible coalition to police any future peace agreement with Russia. 

The success of the coalition's operation hinges on U.S. backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support which European officials say is critical.

Polyakova, from the Washington group CEPA, suggested peace efforts have so-far failed because Putin does not want a ceasefire and is stalling for time. The Trump administration's strategy so far has been to offer Russia “lots of carrots” but “very few sticks” to bring Moscow to the negotiating table, she said.

The question “is whether these talks in this format will shift the administration's strategy,” she added.

Macron spoke with Zelenskyy twice during the day and has spoken frequently with Trump in recent weeks. France hailed Thursday's meetings as a diplomatic success borne from those relationships.

Hours earlier, a massive drone attack hit the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Wednesday night, killing three people, including a child, regional authorities said. 

Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks.

Rubio and Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace more than three years after Russia launched the war. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia, and Witkoff met last week with Putin.

Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine. 

At Thursday's talks in Paris, Macron also discussed the impact of Trump's tariff policies and the conflicts in the Mideast.

The U.S. has presented allies with potential plans for peace between Russia and Ukraine that include an end to fighting and rolled-back sanctions on Moscow, according to Bloomberg News.

The U.S.' proposals were shared in Paris on Thursday, European Union officials familiar with the situation told Bloomberg. French President Emmanuel Macron talked with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff as part of the Paris talks, according to the news outlet. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security advisors talked with foreign negotiators.

As part of the U.S. plan, the yearslong war would be considered frozen, the EU sources told Bloomberg. Ukrainian areas currently occupied by Russia would stay under the Vladimir Putin-led country's leadership, they said.

Ukraine would not enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance better known as NATO, under the proposal, the sources said.

Russia can see pared back sanctions as part of this proposal, according to Bloomberg. But Bloomberg's report noted that ending restrictions placed on the country from the EU, such as unfreezing immobilized assets, requires approval of all member states.

The plan would not be considered a final settlement between the two countries, one of the EU officials told Bloomberg. European allies would not recognize Russia-controlled territories of Ukraine as under Moscow's rule, per the source.

That official also said that the plan will need to be talked about more with Ukraine.

Officials said Russia will need to agree to cease fighting and Ukraine will need security guarantees for a peace plan to be successful.

President Donald Trump is moving forward with his promise to slash a top federal consumer watchdog.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began sending termination notices to nearly 90% of its employees on Thursday night, slashing the agency spearheaded by Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2011 with the aim of preventing another financial crisis like the one that sparked the Great Recession.

Over the past decade, the CFPB has filed lawsuits against major companies, including student lenders and banks like Capital One, over accusations of predatory behavior. It has also returned billions of dollars to consumers and introduced new rules to crack down on medical debt and overdraft fees.

"I regret to inform you that you are affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action," a copy of the notice viewed by Business Insider from Russell Vought, acting director of the CPFB and director of the Office of Management and Budget, said. "This RIF action is necessary to restructure the Bureau's operations to better reflect the agency's priorities and mission.

The notice added that employees will "retain access to work systems" until 6 pm ET on Friday, and that after that deadline, "system access will be discontinued, and you will be placed in an administrative leave status through your official separation date as outlined above."

The National Treasury Employees Union wrote in a legal filing on Thursday that Vought sent reduction-in-force notices to "the vast majority of CFPB employees." The notices, as first reported by Fox Business, went out to about 1,500 employees, slashing the agency's workforce by nearly 90%. The CFPB sent those numbers to BI.

"As one would expect with a RIF of that size, the plaintiffs have been told that entire offices, including statutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person," the NTEU wrote in the legal filing.

These termination notices come just one week after a federal judge ruled on April 11 that the CFPB could move forward with firing some employees deemed unnecessary to carry out the CFPB's "statutory duties." It followed an earlier ruling from a federal judge that froze the CFPB's earlier attempts at terminations, calling them a "hurried effort to dismantle and disable the agency entirely."

Business Insider reported on Wednesday that the CFPB laid out new priorities for the agency in an internal memo sent to employees. The memo, viewed by BI, said the CFPB would "shift resources from enforcement and supervision that can be done by the States."

That included plans to "deprioritize" student-loan oversight, medical debt, consumer data, and digital payments.

These changes are part of Trump and the DOGE office's efforts to slash the government workforce to reduce spending. Elon Musk, DOGE's unofficial leader, has previously said he wanted to "delete" the CFPB entirely, writing "CFPB RIP" in a February post on X.

Warren wrote in a statement on Thursday night that "Trump just gutted almost all CFPB staff, so the agency can't do its job of helping Americans who get scammed by big banks and giant corporations."

"Dismantling the CFPB in the face of a court order blocking an illegal shutdown is yet another assault on consumers and our democracy by this lawless Administration, and we will fight back with everything we've got," she said.

The OMB and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.

Paris Hilton may be best known as a pop culture icon, but she has big plans to cement her place in the world of business and the future of entertainment.

Among her many titles — including "The Simple Life" reality TV star and highest-paid female DJ — Hilton is founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global, next-generation entertainment company that spans albums, TV shows, books and consumer products.

"I want to build the next Disney," Hilton, 44, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. "The way Bob Iger sees Disney is the way I see 11:11 media, where it really puts together commerce and community and built this whole ecosystem that involves everything from television to video to audio to products to the metaverse."

Among Hilton's more recent projects are a skin-care line, a cooking show on Netflix, an encore "The Simple Life" with Nicole Richie on Peacock, an upcoming true crime podcast, a new animated kids show, and continued appearances in commercials for Sonic and Crocs.

"I just do things that I love and I'm passionate about," Hilton said. "I don't want to be put inside one box."

She said being an "undercover nerd" pushed her to be on the forefront of technology, including exploring the metaverse and in 2021 hosting her own "Paris World" event on Roblox, and that her ADHD is a "superpower" to pursue her many interests.

Hilton credited her family for instilling in her a hard-work ethic, one that propelled her great grandfather Conrad Hilton to found Hilton Hotels and his son, Barron, to scale the empire to success.

"Business is something that really runs in my blood," she said. "I always wanted to build something on my own. I didn't want to be known as the Hilton Hotel granddaughter. I wanted to be known as Paris."

Hilton went on to discuss how the alleged abuse she endured at a Utah boarding school as a teen drove her to seek success.

She said her parents sent her to the youth treatment facility after her school grades fell and they worried about her behavior.

"When I was in there, I just promised myself, 'I'm going to work so hard and become so successful that one day, no one will ever be able to control me or tell me what to do,'" Hilton said at the CNBC event. "That's something that really gave me that drive. I always thought success would just make me happy and I would never have to depend on anyone but myself."

In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for, aid and protect children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act and played a key role in the passing of 10 state laws reforming residential treatment facilities.

"It was so scary," Hilton said of going public with her experience and speaking out against the treatment facilities. "The whole world had known me from 'The Simple Life' and this character that I built, and even that character I built was a trauma response to what I went through."

She said she was encouraged to speak out by Alexandra Dean, who directed Hilton's 2020 documentary "This is Paris."

"It just made me realize that I could use my voice to help make a difference for so many children," Hilton said. "Turning my pain into a purpose has been the most healing experience of my life."

The US attacked a key Yemen oil port controlled by the Houthis overnight and killed dozens of people, according to the Iran-backed militants, raising the specter of a widening conflict in the Middle East.

The assault on the Ras Issa fuel-import terminal appeared to be one of the biggest and deadliest since US President Donald Trump ordered an aerial campaign against the Houthis in mid-March. The strikes have so far failed to stop Houthi maritime assaults in the Red Sea and missile attacks on Israel, causing the American military to consider supporting a ground offensive on the group by Yemeni factions.

In recent months, backlash against Elon Musk has spurred a Tesla boycott movement, pushing some owners and shareholders to ditch the brand — and, in some cases, leading to vandalism incidents.

Business Insider spoke to four Tesla owners about their concerns on ownership amid a growing campaign against the EV giant.

While one owner returned his Cybertruck as a precaution for his kids, the other three owners said they don't plan to get rid of their vehicles, despite the rise in anti-Tesla sentiment.

The following stories are based on transcribed conversations with Tesla owners. Business Insider has verified their identities and vehicle ownership. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.

Ben Baker is a Tesla owner living in Sacramento, California, who sold his Cybertruck.

I'm a huge fan of technology. I already own a Tesla, which I absolutely love, and I really wanted a Cybertruck.

I think Cybertrucks are freaking awesome. They're really fun to drive. They're roomy and spacious. I wasn't buying it for other people, I was buying the Cybertruck because I wanted to drive the future.

Not too long ago, after the election, somebody keyed my Tesla Model Y, and I was like, "OK, that's no big deal." I live in California, which is a Democratic state, and so I kind of figured that there would be some of that stuff. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal until I went and bought a Cybertruck.

The first week I drove the Cybertruck, I took my family to Starbucks in it. My family went in and I took some cool pictures. As I was doing that, three people walked behind me and started looking at me and laughing. Then one of them called me a Nazi.

I go, "What are you talking about? I'm just buying this awesome truck. I think it's awesome. I'm not a Nazi." They were like, "Whatever, Nazi."

I thought was weird.

Later on, one of my daughters told me that if I kept the Cybertruck, she was going to get bullied. My son, who leans right, said I should be able to drive the car I want.

I started thinking about if one of them is driving the Tesla Cybertruck and someone started vandalizing it. My daughter is young, she's had her license maybe a year. That's terrifying to me.

I'm a father and I have to do the right thing by my kids. If I could afford to own a Cybertruck myself and then send them to school with another vehicle, then great, it would be on me if it got damaged. But I can't have that happen to them in that vehicle. And who knows how far these guys will take it. They could harm my kids physically — and I couldn't live with myself if that happened. To me, it just wasn't worth seeing my daughter live in fear of the vehicle getting vandalized at their school.

I ended up taking it back, and Tesla was really cool about it. I was able to unwind everything.

I think people should have the right to protest — but they should have the right to protest without destruction. That's where the lines have been crossed.

John VonBokel is a 45-year-old Tesla owner living near St. Louis, Missouri. Business Insider has verified his shareholder status.

I have appreciated and admired Tesla for some time. I was under the impression that it aligned with my personal beliefs in terms of environment, which also overlaps with my personal political beliefs.

Now I feel as though I was wrong all along, or something has changed — but I certainly don't feel like I align with the company and the brand anymore. The shift has been uncomfortable and difficult.

As of October last year, I had hundreds of Tesla shares, and I sold all of them in the last few months.

My decision to sell was primarily financial. After the election, the stock just started going up, and I couldn't figure out how Elon Musk and Trump being together was beneficial to Tesla — and certainly not to the degree that warranted its market capitalization to nearly double.

For me, that meant it was overvalued and I needed to cash out. But I'm under no illusion that selling my shares had any impact on Elon's personal wealth or are somehow a repudiation of his actions.

I feel like what Elon Musk is doing politically is negatively impacting the brand and the company. But I'm more interested in protests that are focused on Elon Musk and Donald Trump's specific actions, or politics in general.

The name "Tesla Takedown" itself evokes something negative to me. They're trying to take down a company that I believe is still full of good people who just happen to be led by somebody I don't support anymore.

While I'm not interested in taking down the company, I'm also not interested in supporting it.

I drive a Tesla pretty much daily and haven't experienced vandalism, so I'm not worried about that. But I certainly would struggle to buy a new Tesla now.

Coincidentally, though, they don't have anything that I really want. I have multiple Teslas that I'm happy with. I have test-driven the newer versions, but there aren't any improvements that make me want to get a new loan at current interest rates.

The future is difficult to predict. My decision to purchase another vehicle would depend partly on what they come out with.

Mitchell Feldman is a Telsa owner living in the UK.

I'm a gadget enthusiast, and I was drawn to buying a Tesla because it had all the things I wanted in a car. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. I liked the idea of never having to go to a gas station again. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me.

I bought my Model Y in 2022, and it's performed over and above my expectations.

In March, I experienced the first negative reaction to my Tesla since I've had the car. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing.

The guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, "Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?"

I was quite aghast. I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say.

I've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla.

I hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO.

The incident made me realize how the perception of Musk impacts his brands. It hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla, however. I'm hoping to have the new Model Y in a few months.

Everyone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says.

Michele Pierog, a 57-year-old Tesla owner from New Hampshire.

I got myself a Tesla Model Y in 2023. I wanted something that was convenient, and I didn't think that any competitor brands had charging infrastructure as robust as Tesla's.

I wanted to try out the car, but thought I'd probably sell it in two years. After three months of driving it, I was amazed by how much I enjoyed never having to go to a gas station.

The utility has been great. I often use its self-driving driving capabilities. There's plenty of room, and it has a "frunk" — a trunk and the front where I keep games for my granddaughter when we're traveling. We call it the "frunk of fun."

I'm not a huge news watcher, so I wasn't really aware of the Tesla controversy. I knew Elon Musk had been put in a position of power, and people weren't happy, but I wasn't aware this impacted Tesla drivers until a friend called me a couple of weeks ago. She asked how I felt about driving my Tesla.

My response was that nothing had changed for me. The utility of the car was the same.

I did some research afterward and saw that there were protests at Tesla dealerships and some violent acts around Teslas. Regardless of what people's political views are about my vehicle, I think it's wrong that people are vandalizing Teslas.

Recently, when I was driving my granddaughter, someone in a truck behind me drove up aggressively close to me and sandwiched me between them and the car in front. They started beeping and yelling at me. I don't know if this was because of my Tesla, but I assumed that it was because it coincided with media reporting of Tesla vandalism, and there aren't many other Teslas in my area.

Even though this is speculative, I'm now wondering whether my vehicle choice is putting me in a bad position safety-wise.

I don't yet feel unsafe enough to get rid of my Tesla, but it saddens me that I may have to make a decision about changing my car based on other people's perceptions.

Driving a Tesla doesn't automatically mean I support what Elon is doing or have a particular political view. I don't think people should make assumptions about me because of the car I drive.

Ukraine said Thursday that it had signed the basis of a minerals deal with the U.S., although the details of the outline agreement are yet to be announced.

Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said both sides had signed a "memorandum of intent" that was the basis of an agreement that is likely to see Ukraine and the U.S. jointly develop the country's natural resources.

"We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine," Svyrydenko posted on social media platform X.

"There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries," she added.

Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's deputy prime minister, gave no further detail on the contents of the outline deal but posted images of her and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent purportedly signing the agreement.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Bessent had told reporters that a comprehensive agreement would be signed next week.

"Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday — next Thursday [24 April]? Soon. And I assume they're [Ukraine] going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. But we have a deal on that," Trump said at a press conference at the White House on Thursday.

Bessent added that "we're still working on the details. We're shooting for around April 26th."

Asked for more details, the treasury secretary said the deal was "substantially what we agreed on previously [with Ukraine] ... We went straight to the big deal, I think it's an 80-page agreement, and that's what will be signed."

CNBC has asked the White House for further detail on the deal and is awaiting a response.

Trump has coveted a minerals deal with Ukraine since his inauguration in January, saying an agreement to jointly develop and monetize Ukraine's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas and other natural resources would act, effectively, as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine throughout the war with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signalled on Thursday that the outline of a deal had been reached, telling reporters, "this is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions," Reuters reported.

He added that the offer to sign the memorandum before the comprehensive deal, which would require the Ukrainian parliament to ratify it, had come from the U.S. side, the news agency noted.

President Donald Trump said there may be a point where he doesn't want to put higher tariffs on China because the move could deter buying.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he may not raise tariffs if China goes beyond the 125% duty it has on American goods.

"At a certain point, I don't want them to go higher because at a certain point, you make it where people don't buy," Trump said when a reporter asked what happens if China raises tariffs on the US.

"I may not want to go higher, or I may not want to even go up to that level — I may want to go to less, because you want people to buy, and at a certain point, people aren't going to buy," he added.

Earlier on Thursday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it wouldn't pay attention to Trump's "tariff numbers game" after the White House said Chinese exports face a levy of up to 245%. Last week, Beijing called escalating US tariffs a "joke" and said they no longer hold "any economic significance."

China is the third-largest buyer of US goods, behind Canada and Mexico. According to US government figures, China bought $143.5 billion worth of American products last year.

In addition to tariffs, China and the US have imposed various punitive measures on each other in the escalating trade war. China has curbed the import of Hollywood films, and earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Beijing asked its airlines to stop taking deliveries from Boeing. The US said that companies selling H20 chips to China will need a license, a move analysts said is essentially a ban on exporting those chips.

On Thursday, Trump added that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have a "very good relationship" and said Xi has reached out to him "a number of times."

The president on Thursday also commented on TikTok, whose fate in the US remains unclear.

"We have a deal for TikTok, but it'll be subject to China, so we'll just delay the deal till this thing works out one way or the other," Trump said, responding to a question about whether he would consider reducing tariffs to complete a TikTok deal.

TikTok's parent company faces a summer deadline to divest its US operations or face removal from US app stores. Trump has twice pushed back the deadline.

Among the parties who have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's US operations are Amazon, Oracle, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, and the YouTuber MrBeast.

"If we're making a deal, I guess we'll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok, it wouldn't take very long," Trump said.

Donald Trump has indicated he's open to trade talks with China.

Hi, this is John Liu in Beijing, where the metaphor du jour is that the US and China are playing a game of chicken over tariffs and trade.

There's a lot that the metaphor gets right. Pride, for one, is fueling the impulse for escalation on both sides, as is the aversion to backing down, lest it suggests weakness.

Volatility in the won spiked to its highest since the US presidential election in November. 

South Korea plans to more than double the amount of overseas bonds it can issue to fund currency market activity to $3.5 billion, with officials citing the need to respond to sharp fluctuations. 

The revised issuance ceiling is part of a 12.2 trillion won additional budget aimed at supporting the flagging export-oriented economy now faced with US tariffs. The Finance Ministry made the proposal on Friday, which must be approved by parliament.

In this article

Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and "predictive algorithms" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

"By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely," the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced fees on Chinese-built vessels after a United States Trade Representative investigation by the Biden-Trump administrations found China's acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

"Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce," said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. "The Trump administration's actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships."

The USTR said China largely achieved its dominance through its increasingly aggressive and specific targeting of these sectors, severely disadvantaging U.S. companies, workers and the U.S. economy.

The fees will be charged once per voyage and not per port, as originally proposed.

The policy proposal, begun under the Biden administration and culminating in a January report concluded China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage, would allow the U.S. government to impose steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports. The original proposal called for a service fee of up to $1 million to be charged on each Chinese-owned operators (such as Cosco). The original proposal also said that for non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.

The USTR acknowledged this change was made due to the public comments at the two days of hearings on the fines in March where over 300 trade groups and other interested parties testified. Many warned the government in letters and in testimony that the U.S. was in no position to win an economic war that placed ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels in the middle. Soon, Chinese-made vessels will represent 98% of the trade ships on the world's oceans.

Vessel owners could be eligible for a remission of the fees if they can provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. The remission of the fee would be based on a net tonnage capacity of equal to or less than the U.S. built vessel ordered. "If a prospective vessel owner does not take delivery of the U.S.-built vessel ordered within three years, the fees will become due immediately," the report read.

For the first 180 days, the fees would be set at zero and are broken down into various categories. All charges are based on the net tonnage of a vessel. Container vessels can range from 50,000 to 220,000 tons.

Service Fee on Chinese Vessel Operators and Vessel Owners of China:

The fee will be charged up to five times per year, per vessel. The register did not break out the price per container.

Service fees on vessel operators of Chinese-Built vessels is lower.

The fee will be charged up to five times per year, per vessel.

Fees on foreign-built car carrier vessels will also be based on their capacity. The fee would start at $150 per Car Equivalent Unit (CEU) in 180 days. 

The second phase actions will not begin for three years and would target LNG vessels. The USTR would limit restrictions on transporting LNG via foreign vessels. These restrictions will increase incrementally over 22 years.

Ocean carriers if they provide proof of ordering a U.S.-built vessel, the fees or restrictions on an equivalent non-U.S.-built vessel are suspended for up to three years.·   

Fees on Chinese-built ships effectively do not cover Great Lakes or Caribbean shipping, shipping to and from U.S. territories.

Bulk exports like coal or grain will be exempt, along with empty ships arriving at the ports.

Ethereum

Solana

Since then, the price has jumped up and down but it has been standing below the 21-day EMA during all of this time.

In the past month, ETH has booked a 22.2% loss and has underperformed all other cryptocurrencies in the top 10. During this same period, rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and BNB Chain (BNB) have performed much better as investors have been quite pessimistic about Ethereum's outlook.

Even though this blockchain has distanced itself from its competitors in terms of ecosystem growth and market value, its scaling issues have plagued its reputation and have undermined the performance of its native asset.

Solana, Sui, and BNB Chain all offer lower transaction fees and the power to process more transactions per second (TPS).

The market is waiting for the official implementation of Ethereum's Pectra upgrade as it could improve the EVM's ability to scale by prioritizing top validators through a higher staking requirement and giving layer-two protocols like Arbitrum a mechanism to increase their transaction validation speeds.

Interestingly, on-chain data shows that transaction volumes within the Ethereum network have stood at normal levels despite the market's downturn.

This emphasizes the strength and diversity of its ecosystem, which includes robust decentralized exchanges, liquid staking protocols, yield-farming, and lending platforms.

All of these dApp contribute to generate high transaction volumes every day and stabilize the network's throughput.

Moving to the charts, Ethereum has entered similar periods of consolidation in the past – two times in the past year and a half to be exact.

In the past two instances, the price rose to a higher high right after it went through a temporary pause.

However, the price had not made a lower low as it has now and this is a reason to be concerned about what could come next for ETH.

The past two times that ETH rose to all-time highs, it took the price 6 months or less to get there after it stepped off oversold territory in the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

As a result of this month's strong uptick, ETH has now stepped outside oversold as well. Note that the uptrend started after the price climbed above the 21-day EMA. Sure, there were multiple failed breakouts along the way, but they showed that bullish momentum was picking up its pace.

As of today, ETH has not managed to break above its 21-day EMA. Hence, there has been no buy signal yet.

If that bullish breakout occurs, the price could rally to $1,900 first. This is an important area of resistance as this year's volume profile shows that it was the one with the second highest trading volumes.

If ETH does climb and breaks above that level, this could lead to a strong uptrend as levels above that mark have lower volumes, meaning that bulls will encounter less resistance to push the price higher.

Momentum indicators are favoring a bullish short-term outlook for now but the 21-day EMA is the most critical indicator to watch to determine if the trend is changing.

Meanwhile, a break below the token's most recent low at $1,375 could plunge ETH to $1,155 and invalidate this scenario.

For now, momentum is on the side of bulls but market conditions are challenging and the macro backdrop is still quite unfavorable so it would be no surprise that ETH drops to lower levels this year if the U.S. economy deteriorates, inflation moves higher, or the Fed decides not to lower rates at all this year.

Cryptocurrency markets continued to move sideways on Friday, with Bitcoin price stagnation below $85,000, leading to traders hesitating to enter larger altcoin positions. Regarding news, fresh developments around ETFs, cryptocurrency regulations and adoption dominate media discourse. 

Bitcoin price has stabilized within a 2% narrow range between $83,000 and $85,000 for the better part of this week.

The calming trend comes after volatile reactions to Trump's tariffs announcements in early April triggered intense turbulence, driving BTC to multi-month lows below $75,000.

Bitcoin is trading at $84,600 at press time, according to Coingecko data. Notably, BTC has managed to avoid a detour below the $80,000 level this week, signaling that weak hands may have been shaken out of the market recently. 

Bitcoin ETF demand emerges as one of the key factors anchoring Bitcoin prices over the last 24 hours. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs flipped into buying mode, acquiring $106.9 million, according to Farside data.

BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC took in $81 million and $25.9 million apiece, while the other funds remained muted on the data, per Farside data. 



The global crypto market slid 1.9% over the past 24 hours, pulling total capitalization to $2.76 trillion. Daily trading volume plunged to $83.8 billion, reflecting a notable cooldown in risk appetite after an aggressive early-week rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) held steady at $84,510, up 3% over the past 7 days, while Ethereum (ETH) failed to break out, hovering at $1,590 with only a 0.2% weekly gain.

Solana (SOL), which surged 7% on Thursday following the debut of the world's first spot Solana ETF in Toronto, stalled at $134.41. Meanwhile, XRP retreated slightly to $2.07, with momentum fading after a 3.6% weekly rise. Both altcoins appear to have entered consolidation phases after leading the altcoin surge earlier in the week.

Friday's market movement reveals a clear shift in capital from altcoins back toward Bitcoin and stablecoins, as investors brace for regulatory uncertainty. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) delay in approving or denying Grayscale's Ethereum spot ETF staking, previously expected by April 17, has weighed heavily on sentiment. 

While the SEC invoked its statutory right under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the decision window by up to 90 days, this sudden procedural move has triggered short-term caution across top altcoin markets.

This hesitation is particularly evident in Solana and XRP, which had attracted speculative capital tied to ETF optimism and political tailwinds. 

At the time of publication, SOL has stumbled below $135 support, after posting 7% gains on Thursday as a Canadian firm announced the launch of worlds' first SOL ETF. 

As the US SEC's deadline elapsed, Polymarket bettors dropped odds on the July 31 SOL ETF approval deadline to 22%, 5% lower on the day. 

Affirming the bearish sentiment, Ripple (XRP) price has also reversed toward $2 after rallying on Ripple and reaching a consensus with the SEC to pause all appeals in its long-running lawsuit.  

The stalling of these top altcoins, alongside a slight uptick in stablecoins like USDC and USDT, suggests that institutional and large retail capital is rotating defensively while awaiting clarity from US regulators.

A newly released memo from the US Department of Justice indicates a shift in enforcement policy toward the cryptocurrency sector. Authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the document outlines a strategic refocus on crimes involving direct harm, such as investor fraud, terrorism financing, and money laundering through crypto.

The memo suggests a reduced emphasis on broader regulatory crackdowns, marking a departure from the Biden-era approach that targeted compliance failures and structural violations by crypto firms.

Richard Kim, a former executive at Galaxy Digital, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has been arrested on securities and wire fraud charges. The US Department of Justice alleges that Kim misappropriated nearly the entire $7 million raised for his crypto gambling project, Zero Edge, and used the funds for speculative trading.

According to an FBI affidavit, Kim induced investors under false pretenses and lost significant amounts through high-risk crypto bets. After failed attempts to recover losses through further trades and capital raises, Kim admitted wrongdoing and voluntarily surrendered to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Privacy-focused crypto platform eXch has announced it will shut down operations following sustained pressure from a transatlantic crackdown targeting the project over alleged illicit activity facilitation. Despite distancing itself from being a mixer, the platform said it faced consistent misinterpretation from regulators and intelligence agencies regarding its privacy tools.

As part of its wind-down, eXch will donate 50 BTC to fund open-source privacy initiatives across Bitcoin, Thorchain, and Ethereum.

Bitcoin price consolidates above $84,000 on Friday, a short-term support that has gained significance this week. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to weather storms caused by US President Donald Trump's incessant trade war with China after pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9 for other countries.

Official Trump ($TRUMP), the Presidential meme coin launched in January by the United States (US) President Trump family's World Liberty Financial company, is in a precarious situation that could see volatility spike significantly. 

Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $84,000 on Friday as President Donald Trump slammed Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates on time. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering rates by 25 basis points, urging Powell to do the same in the US.

Slovenia has become the latest European Union member state to crack down on untaxed crypto gains, unveiling a proposal to impose a 25% tax on personal profits from digital asset disposals starting in 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) is likely headed for a period of heightened volatility as 170,000 BTC — worth over $14 billion at its current price of $84,500 — have moved from wallets held for three to six months, a cohort often linked to market turning points, CryptoQuant warned in a post.



On-chain behavior from this group has historically served as an early signal for major price action, according to the post. Mid-term holders are typically considered to be traders that hold a cryptocurrency for anywhere between three to 12 months.



They tend to be more reactive to market conditions than long-term holders but less impulsive than short-term traders, making their movements especially telling during transitional periods.



When large amounts of bitcoin shift out of this cohort, it can indicate growing uncertainty or strategic positioning ahead of an anticipated market event. In either case, analysts view this as a sign that a sharp move is coming, though the direction remains unclear.



A similar pattern emerged ahead of previous surges and corrections, including during 2021's bull run and 2022's capitulation.

Bitcoin has been trading between $75,000 and $87,000 over the past months as tensions between the U.S. and other countries as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies have caused anxiety in markets.

Court: S.D. Florida 

Case: 1:23-cv-21912

Investors can still file a late claim to receive payment from the $11 million Astrals NFT settlement.

In March 2022, the Astrals NFTs and $GLXY token were launched as part of a metaverse initiative heavily promoted by basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. Following the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and rising concerns over project leadership and viability, allegations of selling unregistered securities led to significant investor losses.

Following this, Shaquille O'Neal was sued by shareholders and has agreed to settle by paying $11 million to investors.

You can submit your claim and be notified of any further updates.

What happens when a longtime Ethereum insider calls the ecosystem a “religion” that's lost touch with reality? A critical look at Soleimani's thread — and why it struck a nerve.

Table of Contents

On Apr. 17, Ameen Soleimani posted a detailed thread on X that sharply critiqued what he sees as Ethereum's (ETH) growing detachment from practical concerns. 

Okay so I'm drunk, bored and on a plane, so I'm going to address this point by point. I'm doing this because I despise the part of the Ethereum religion that promotes euphemisms over reality, as in my view it gets in the way of real progress. Why do you think I named it… https://t.co/Mu4hNVbDeb

Soleimani's comments were framed as a response to a values-oriented post by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, which had been endorsed and shared by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

In his posts, Soleimani challenged what he described as Ethereum's reliance on abstract ideals and aspirational messaging, arguing that these narratives often obscure the real challenges facing the network. 

He expressed concern that the culture around Ethereum risks becoming too comfortable with vague slogans at the expense of accountability and grounded problem-solving.

Soleimani is not new to Ethereum, nor is he speaking from the sidelines. He is best known as the creator of MolochDAO, a decentralized funding collective launched in 2019 to support Ethereum infrastructure. 

MolochDAO also distributed grants for Ethereum 2.0 research and contributed to resource coordination during the network's transition to proof-of-stake.

His involvement in Ethereum dates back further. He co-founded SpankChain, an adult content platform built on Ethereum that explored use cases in direct crypto payments and censorship resistance. 

He also backed RAI, a decentralized, non-pegged stablecoin developed by Reflexer Labs, and participated in public discussions around Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused protocol currently under legal scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.

Let's examine the core arguments Soleimani laid out and evaluate how his concerns reflect deeper tensions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

One of the more pointed issues raised in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's continued dependence on centralized stablecoins. 

While Ethereum presents itself as a platform for decentralized finance, a large share of its day-to-day activity is still conducted through assets issued by private companies.

As of Apr. 18, stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) account for a significant portion of Ethereum's liquidity and trading volume. According to DeFiLlama, the combined value of USDT and USDC deployed across Ethereum exceeds $100 billion. 

These tokens serve as core collateral in lending markets, key trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, and settlement mechanisms across a wide range of DeFi protocols. Their widespread integration has made them foundational to many applications built on Ethereum. 

However, this level of dependence brings different trade-offs. Both USDT and USDC are issued by companies that operate under national regulatory regimes. Tether is managed by iFinex, while USDC is issued by Circle and governed through the Centre Consortium.

These issuers maintain fiat-denominated reserves, publish regular attestations, and possess the authority to freeze or blacklist wallet addresses. 

While such powers are used sparingly, their existence introduces a form of counterparty risk that sits uneasily with Ethereum's broader decentralization narrative.

At the protocol level, Ethereum remains open, permissionless, and resistant to censorship. But the tools most commonly used within its application layer rely on infrastructure that can be altered or restricted by centralized actors. 

This distinction is important. It highlights how decentralization in Ethereum is not evenly distributed across all layers, especially in the context of financial instruments that are susceptible to regulatory oversight and issuer control.

Another area of concern in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's evolving relationship with political systems. While the protocol is often described as apolitical and neutral, recent developments show that its broader ecosystem is increasingly interacting with legal frameworks and policy discussions across jurisdictions.

This shift does not alter Ethereum's core design, which remains permissionless and open. However, it reflects a growing need for engagement with regulators, particularly as the network supports more capital, users, and applications. 

Infrastructure tied to Ethereum — including validator operators, custodians, and development teams — frequently operates under national laws and is subject to local compliance requirements.

Many of these entities are based in jurisdictions with active enforcement regimes. As of April 2025, Ethernodes data indicates that over half of all active Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries like the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, where crypto-related legal obligations are well established. 

The geographic distribution of these nodes gives Ethereum global reach, but also exposes it to varying degrees of regulatory oversight.

Meanwhile, on the global front, Ethereum Foundation members have taken part in policy discussions with governments in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. 

Over the years, Vitalik Buterin has held meetings with public officials in Montenegro and Argentina to explore national approaches to crypto governance. 

While these interactions remain informal, they suggest a deliberate effort to contribute to policy formation, without necessarily steering the protocol in any political direction.

In functional terms, this engagement is not unusual. As Ethereum becomes more embedded in real-world finance and infrastructure, the need for legal clarity increases. Protocol developers, node operators, and wallet providers often require stable regulatory environments to mitigate operational risks. 

Meanwhile, policymakers increasingly seek technical input to inform emerging regulation. The result is a two-way exchange — policy shaped by protocol insight, and protocol development influenced by regulatory context.

Ethereum remains decentralized at the base layer and does not rely on state endorsement for its technical operation. Still, the individuals and entities building within its ecosystem often work within legal boundaries. 

The result is not full detachment, but conditional independence — one where neutrality is preserved at the protocol level, even as engagement with political systems continues at the edges.

Soleimani's thread also takes aim at the Ethereum community's embrace of “permissionless innovation,” a principle rooted in the idea that anyone should be able to build without needing approval. 

While this concept has driven much of Ethereum's early growth, Soleimani argues that its consequences are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

One of the most prominent examples he cites is Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol launched via autonomous smart contracts on Ethereum. 

In 2022, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the protocol, alleging that it facilitated money laundering for criminal actors, including North Korea's Lazarus Group.

The sanctions were followed by arrests. Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, two of Tornado Cash's developers, were detained in the United States and the Netherlands. 

Storm now faces charges related to money laundering, violations of international sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money services business — charges that carry a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years.

For Soleimani, the issue is not just the legal action itself, but how the Ethereum community has responded to it. Some defended the developers, while others leaned on the argument that “code is speech” and therefore beyond the reach of legal systems. 

Soleimani views this assumption as misguided. In his view, relying on the neutrality of code to shield developers from responsibility ignores how financial technologies are regulated in practice.

He is especially critical of the belief that developers do not need legal support. In his post, he points to the legal teams and advocacy organizations that have submitted amicus briefs in defense of Roman Storm. 

These briefs argue that writing and deploying open-source code should be protected under free speech, and that creators of decentralized tools should not be held liable for misuse by third parties. 

While these positions have gained support within parts of the crypto industry, they remain legally uncertain.

This case has broader implications for Ethereum's development model. The right to build remains intact at a technical level, but the legal risks tied to privacy tools and cross-border transactions are growing. 

In Soleimani's view, defending permissionless innovation now requires more than idealism. It demands legal foresight, active engagement, and a deeper understanding of the risks that come with building in a regulated world.

Soleimani also raises concerns about Ethereum's reliance on the price of ETH to maintain network security. In his post, he revisits an earlier disagreement with Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, who had previously suggested that ETH's market price was not particularly important. 

Soleimani pushed back by asking a direct question: if ETH were to lose its value, how would Ethereum continue to secure its network?

This is a fundamental issue within Ethereum's current architecture. Since the network's transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum no longer uses miners. Instead, it relies on validators who stake ETH to verify transactions and keep the system operational. 

The effectiveness of this model depends on both the amount of ETH being staked and the market value of the token itself.

If ETH's price falls too low, the rewards for honest validation decrease, making it less attractive for participants to stake. 

At the same time, the cost of attacking the network becomes cheaper. This dynamic weakens both the incentive to secure the network and the deterrent against malicious activity.

As of Apr. 18, ETH is trading around $1,570, reflecting a drop of over 52 percent from recent highs. According to data from Beaconcha.in, more than 34 million ETH is currently staked, representing roughly 28 percent of the total supply.

Soleimani's argument is that proof-of-stake systems do not separate monetary value from security. ETH's price is not just a market metric. It is a core part of how the network stays resilient.

Soleimani closes his post with a question that extends beyond any single disagreement. Can Ethereum, as a system and a community, recognize its internal contradictions and still find a way to move forward?

Despite his strong criticism, he does not write off the network. Instead, he reflects on past moments where change did occur. For example, early debates around the importance of ETH's price eventually led to the emergence of the “ultrasound money” narrative. He sees this as proof that the community is capable of adapting when it chooses to.

His hope is that similar shifts can happen again. The challenges facing Ethereum today are different in nature — they involve legal risk, coordination problems, and questions about how power is distributed. These are not technical issues alone. They require a broader view of how the protocol fits into the world around it.

Whether Ethereum can reconcile these tensions depends on how it responds to them. That includes being realistic about the risks developers face, the tools it depends on, and the systems it interacts with. It also means accepting that decentralization comes with trade-offs that must be managed, not ignored.

 Adam Back suggested that the emergence of quantum computing could force Satoshi Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin to protect it, revealing whether they are alive. 

Early cypherpunk Adam Back, cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, suggested that quantum computing pressure may reveal whether the blockchain's pseudonymous creator is alive.

During an interview after a Q&A session at the “Satoshi Spritz” event in Turin on April 18, Back suggested that quantum computing may force Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin (BTC). That's because, according to Back, Bitcoin holders will be forced to move their assets to newer, quantum-resistant signature-based addresses.

Back said that current quantum computers do not pose a credible threat to Bitcoin's cryptography but will likely threaten it in the future. Back estimated that quantum computers may evolve to that extent in “maybe 20 years.”

When the threat becomes real, Back said the Bitcoin community will have to choose between deprecating old, vulnerable addresses or letting those funds be stolen:

Back expects the community to go with the former option, forcing Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator to move their funds if they wish to avoid losing them.

Still, Back said that whether such a situation will reveal if Satoshi Nakamoto is alive also depends on Bitcoin's future privacy features.

“It depends a bit on the technology, there are some research ideas that could add privacy to Bitcoin,” Back said. “So, possibly there might be a way to fix quantum issues while keeping privacy.“

Still, not everyone is convinced that — privacy enhancements or not — such a scenario would reveal whether Nakamoto was alive. An anonymous early Bitcoin miner and member of the Bitcoin community told Cointelegraph that he does not expect Nakamoto's coins to be moved:

He added that, since this is a controversial choice, it makes sense to let the community decide. He said that he'd be surprised if Nakamoto came out of the woodwork to move the assets.

Back explained that most quantum-resistant signature implementations are either unproven in terms of security or very expensive from a data perspective. He cited Lamport signatures as an old and proven design, but pointed out that they weigh tens of kilobytes.

Consequently, he suggested that Bitcoin should be prepared to switch to quantum-resistant signatures but only do so when necessary. He suggested a Bitcoin taproot-based implementation allowing addresses to switch to quantum-resistant signatures when needed.

A Brazilian court has sentenced three executives behind the collapsed crypto scheme Braiscompany to a combined 171 years in prison, concluding one of the country's largest crypto fraud cases to date.

Federal Judge Vinicius Costa Vidor found Joel Ferreira de Souza, the scheme's alleged mastermind, guilty of operating an unlicensed financial institution and laundering millions through shell companies and unregulated crypto wallets, according to local media.

De Souza received the steepest sentence: 128 years behind bars. Two others—Gesana Rayane Silva and Victor Veronez—received 27 and 15 years, respectively, for their roles in managing cash and acting as intermediaries in the scheme.

The ruling comes after Brazil's Federal Prosecutor's Office (MPF) accused five individuals of orchestrating a pyramid structure that raised R$1.11 billion ($190 million) from roughly 20,000 investors.

Braiscompany promised outsized returns through crypto trading but allegedly ran a parallel financial system using informal transfers and high-commission operations.

The court also ordered the seizure of R$36 million, though it's unclear how much victims will recover. According to Artêmio Picanço, a lawyer representing several victims, those affected must file civil claims soon before the funds are absorbed by the state.

Two defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence. The rest, the judge ruled, “acted to disguise the illicit origin” of the money, running operations that mimicked legitimate investment practices but served to enrich insiders.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump's escalating trade war (with a top Federal Reserve official confirming a bail out is ready for the $30 trillion bond market).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped sharply from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to lows of under $75,000 as traders are warned of a U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" that could be worse than 1971.

Now, with Wall Street banks suddenly staring down the barrel of an “existential” bitcoin and crypto threat, Trump's war with Fed chair Jerome Powell could be about to trigger a bitcoin price and wider market "black swan."

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned interest rates must remain high to prevent the return ... More of inflation—something that could weigh on the bitcoin price and stock market.

“Trump somehow firing Powell would represent another black swan. If it happens, react fast and short swiftly,” Alex Krüger, a closely-watched trader and economist, posted to X and referring to so-called black swan events that are typically hard to predict and have extreme consequences.

“This is not something I'd trade in anticipation," Krüger added. "When it comes to black swans, reacting fast works well.”

This week, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough” after Powell reiterated his intention to keep interest rates on hold due to uncertainty over Trump's tariff trade war.

Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.”

“If I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump later said in the Oval Office while taking questions from reporters during a visit with Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni. “I'm not happy with him.”

Krüger predicted that if Trump were to fire Powell, stock markets would “implode," with the bitcoin price going “down hard then up as it progresses from a pure risk asset to a risk-safe haven hybrid.”

The bitcoin price has dropped since U.S. president Donald Trump took office but remains well above ... More where it was this time last year.

Bitcoin has so far failed to trade in line with the traditional safe haven asset, gold. The gold price has shot higher as Trump's global trade tariffs come into force, with the bitcoin price following stock markets lower.

This week, Powell reiterated that the Fed was waiting for greater clarity before making any moves, predicting Trump's tariffs would likely worsen inflation.

“Powell stated that tariffs were not a catalyst for a rate cut,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “His remarks cast a fresh layer of doubt over the central bank's path forward and renewed concerns over stagflation risk.”

By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

It's Easter. Traditional markets are closed in many parts of the world and plenty of people are taking a break from work, and that's keeping crypto markets in check as well. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the biggest, most active cryptocurrencies, has gained less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours with bitcoin (BTC) up just 0.1%.

That's a pretty muted response to calls from President Donald Trump for the removal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump criticized Powell over his reluctance to cut interest rates, further adding to the economy uncertainty that has left bitcoin treading water and seen Wall Street piling onto gold.

Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, said Powell was “too late” in lowering interest rates, saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” The President's words come after Powell said the central bank sees unemployment and inflation rising because of the tariffs Trump imposed on most other countries.

The tit-for-tat has further raised uncertainty, to the point the S&P 500 closed the shortened trading week up just 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.1%.

"Right now, markets are extremely reactionary to White House decision making and are poised to remain that way for the foreseeable future,” Ira Auerbach, head of tandem at Offchain Labs and former head of digital assets as Nasdaq, told CoinDesk.

“Trump's push for rate cuts amid tariff-driven inflation risks could reignite bitcoin's original 'hedge against eroding purchasing power' narrative. Its recent risk-off behavior may be short-lived as monetary policy uncertainty intensifies."

For the time being, though, the hedge against currency debasement and uncertainty appears to be gold. The precious metal's recent bull run has meant that, over the last 20 years, it's outperforming the S&P 500. That's including dividends.

For crypto investors, signals are mixed. While on the macro front uncertainty reigns, under the Trump administration regulatory outlook has been improving and institutions have shown more comfort with the space.

“It is probably sound to 'let the dust settle' as tariff implementations and bilateral negotiations unfold,” dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d'Haussy told CoinDesk. “Market participants' consensus seems to signal central banks' action past the summer.” Stay alert!

Zug, Switzerland — April 2025 — Meta Earth, a modular blockchain network natively integrated with a Decentralized Identity (DID) protocol, has surpassed 1 million ecosystem participants in just a few months, with over 670,000 KYC-verified users via its ME ID system.

As modular blockchains rapidly redefine the future of Web3 infrastructure, Meta Earth is positioning itself as one of the most promising next-generation networks, combining technical scalability with real-world economic utility.



With the ME Network now live and in testing, Meta Earth introduces a sustainable model of blockchain participation: every verified user receives one permanently staked MEC token (Meta Earth's native asset) and daily staking rewards, as well as additional incentives through referral and ambassador programs.

The unique implementation of Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) represents a step toward a more equitable digital economy — where verified users around the world benefit from daily on-chain earnings and ecosystem privileges.

Unlike many blockchain projects focused solely on speed or market speculation, Meta Earth is rooted in a broader vision: to build a digital infrastructure that promotes equality, sustainability, and happiness.

This mission stems from founder Patrick Oerer's decades of experience in finance and tech, having witnessed global economic inequality and systemic inefficiencies firsthand.

To realize this vision, Meta Earth Holding Group was established, securing a diversified portfolio across blockchain, AI, real estate, and investment. In 2023, the group launched Meta Earth Association in Switzerland to support institutional onboarding and regulatory alignment.

The organization plays a pivotal role in funding early-stage infrastructure, compliance efforts, and expansion strategies.

Central to Meta Earth's socio-economic vision is its ME ID Protocol — a privacy-preserving identity framework that uses homomorphic encryption to deliver KYC-compliant, self-sovereign digital identity. Verified users maintain full control over their personal data, selectively granting access to verified counterparties.

At the core of Meta Earth's architecture is a modular, horizontally scalable framework, composed of distinct execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability layers. This design dramatically improves throughput, scalability, and developer flexibility.

ME Network offers a comprehensive ME-SDK development suite, enabling modular Rollup deployment with seamless MBC (Multi-Blockchain Communication) integration. Developers can construct application-specific Rollups while maintaining interoperability across the broader Web3 ecosystem.

While traditional Layer 2 infrastructures suffer from centralized sequencers, single points of failure, and operational bottlenecks.

ME Network addresses these inefficiencies through a decentralized sequencer model, wherein nodes stake MEC tokens to participate in sequencer governance and transaction ordering. ME Network also enhances Optimistic Rollup's challenge window, integrating zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to reduce dispute resolution times from seven days to under three days, significantly improving latency and cost efficiency.

This comprehensive infrastructure makes Meta Earth technically differentiated and institutionally viable — ready for enterprise-level adoption and regulatory integration.

While many Web3 projects chase fast traction through airdrops and inflated wallet counts, Meta Earth has pursued authentic user adoption. To participate, users must verify their identity through ME ID, which prevents bot activity and fake accounts.

This has helped the project avoid the “ghost chain” syndrome seen in other ecosystems and maintain long-term sustainability.

As of April 2025, the Meta Earth network has:

Community expansion has been steady and user-driven, reinforced by product-level incentives and utility, rather than speculation. Verified users gain access to features like ME Pass, staking programs, referral bonuses, and participation in the decentralized sequencer network.

Meta Earth is not resting on its achievements but continues to advance according to a clear and structured roadmap. Official projections indicate that 2025 will be a pivotal year, with the team prioritizing the release of ME Network v2.0, the initiation of Rollup-chain testing, and the expansion of DeFi infrastructure.

This phase is expected to catalyze rapid ecosystem growth and yield substantial advancements.

Additionally, Meta Earth has launched a Global Ambassador Recruitment Program, which has already expanded to dozens of countries and regions, attracting a high-quality user base.

This steady and organic community expansion serves as a solid foundation for ME Network's future technological innovations and large-scale ecosystem development.

Meta Earth is now actively inviting users, developers, and organizations to join its growing ecosystem. Anyone can mint their ME ID, receive a staked MEC token, and begin earning daily rewards. The team regularly announces public testing opportunities, product updates, and community incentives through its official channels.

Meta Earth (ME) is based on a modular, high-performance, infinitely scalable multi-dimensional fusion underlying value network — ME Network, which supports the high-concurrency big data processing needs of traditional industrial applications. And through an encrypted DID (Decentralized Identifier) system — ME ID & ME Pass which can effectively protect user privacy data, and a co-construction & co-governance mechanism which can fully reflect personal sovereignty and equality for all, as well as an economic model which can guarantee UBI (Unconditional Basic Income) without any distinction, Meta Earth is fully dedicated to enhancing happiness for a better life and maintaining ecological balance to promote sustainability.

 BTC bought between three and six months ago and moving onchain has spiked. It is a classic precursor to "significant" volatility, the latest analysis says. 

Bitcoin (BTC) speculators may spark “significant” BTC price volatility as a large tranche of coins moves onchain.

In one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on April 18, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant warned that a Bitcoin market shake-up is due.

Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) are signaling that the current calm BTC price behavior may not last long.

CryptoQuant reveals that 170,000 BTC owned by entities with a purchase date between three and six months ago has begun to circulate.

“Around 170,000 BTC are moving from the 3–6 month holder cohort,” contributor Mignolet confirmed. 

An accompanying chart shows the impact of previous STH events, with the latest being the largest by volume since late 2021. Price direction varies, with both upward and downward market responses visible.

“Volatility is coming,” Mignolet concluded.

As Cointelegraph reported, STH entities are notoriously sensitive to snap market moves and transitive narratives.

Recent BTC price downside has been met with episodes of panic selling by the cohort, which is defined as an entity buying up to six months previously.

Earlier this week, CryptoQuant listed STHs as one of the main sources of current Bitcoin selling pressure.

“Short-Term Holders (STH) have been the primary sellers, sending an average of ~930 BTC/day to exchanges,” fellow contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a separate Quicktake post. 

Crazzyblockk described a “classic shakeout” occurring in Bitcoin, while allaying concerns over a uniform rush for the exit across the investor spectrum.

“With Bitcoin trading sideways and volatility compressing, this cohort-driven breakdown helps us understand that the current correction is not a mass exodus by smart money — it's more likely a reaction from nervous short-term and mid-tier holders,” the post said.

Solana's memecoin activity has dropped over 80%, but its apps still lead in blockchain earnings.

Solana continues to top blockchain revenue charts, even as activity on its network drops sharply.

Data from Blockworks Research reveals that while memecoin activity on Solana has dropped by over 80% from its peak, the network's applications still account for more than 70% of all on-chain revenue across the ecosystem.

This trend is further supported by findings from Syndica, which reported that Solana-based decentralized applications (dApps) generated 46% of total on-chain revenue across all networks in March.

While Solana still holds the lion's share of on-chain earnings, its total network revenue has plunged more than 90% from the highs recorded in January. The current figures reflect a return to July 2024 levels, signaling a slowdown in network activity and user engagement.

The sharp decline is mainly tied to lower transaction fees. According to DeFiLlama data, Solana now collects under $5 million weekly fees, marking its weakest performance since September last year.

A key factor behind this decline is the collapse of several headline-grabbing memecoins, such as LIBRA, which was linked to key political figures and drove massive speculation on the blockchain network.

With the frenzy for these tokens fading, the blockchain's future revenue performance may depend on whether new apps and use cases can fill the gap left by memecoins.

Key Points

With its price down by 46% over the last three years, Ethereum (ETH 0.22%) now confronts yet another problem. While it certainly won't be alone, the possibility of devastation is ahead.

But where there's danger, there's often opportunity, and for Ethereum, this is likely one of those times. The new threat could enable Ethereum to reverse its fortunes.

As the cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector within cryptocurrency, Ethereum needs to have its users' trust. A big part of that trust is built on the security features of the chain. There's not much point in investing in a chain or developing an application there if your money can easily be liberated from your wallet by a hacker.

It isn't always possible for a chain's developers to foresee threats. But right now, one potentially severe threat in particular is getting a lot of attention.

You've probably heard of quantum computers, which may in the future be able to perform certain tasks like cryptographic codebreaking far more efficiently than the classic computers that we use every day. Therefore, there is also a risk that a future quantum computer might be powerful enough and its users sufficiently adept to crack the encryption used for blockchains like Ethereum's. Such attackers could steal vast sums of cryptocurrency and potentially destroy a blockchain's entire ecosystem overnight. This is one of the few things that could make Ethereum go to zero.

There is no risk of that happening today. It's also unclear precisely when or if quantum computing will become advanced enough to pose an immediate threat. Nonetheless, the issue is already on the radar of most of the core development teams of the largest cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum is no exception.

The Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit that is effectively the governance council of the chain, is investing in a research initiative with the mandate of making the chain secure via post-quantum cryptography (PQC), meaning cryptography resistant to threats from quantum computing. It is also in the process of considering whether to adopt a few other proposals for fortifying Ethereum against the quantum computing threat. While any implementation of those proposals is at least a few years away, the chain is far ahead of its competitors in its planning process.

Ethereum's early progress in preparing for quantum computing is important because it shows that security is a serious focus for the chain. But investors won't buy a coin based on the future security characteristics of its chain alone, and you shouldn't, either, at least not yet.

Make no mistake: Ethereum is currently the major chain that is among the least likely to fall victim to a quantum computing-based exploit, on the basis of its work in evaluating proposals and funding research into mitigation strategies. As (and if) the threat nears, that could make it more and more valuable. Eventually, it could make Ethereum a coin worth buying, especially if its competitors fail to keep up with its preparations for the future.

But the threat is still abstract. And investors shouldn't merely settle for discussion of risk mitigation measures; there's no real value in being added to the chain until it upgrades its tech. So keep an eye on Ethereum in the context of this issue.

If it stays ahead of the pack in preparing for quantum computing, that will be a bullish sign that Ethereum desperately needs right now.

According to AltcoinGordon, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, Ethereum (ETH) could potentially reach $10,000 based on current market trends and technological advancements. This prediction aligns with increased institutional interest and the growing adoption of Ethereum's blockchain technology. As traders evaluate this insight, they should consider the implications of network upgrades and global economic factors. [Source: Twitter/@AltcoinGordon]

Analyst and trader Benjamin Cowen believes Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to continue outperforming altcoins.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 892,000 YouTube subscribers that the total market cap of altcoins (Total3) when paired against Bitcoin is going to continue on a downtrend.

Total3 is the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies with the exception of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH).

“…now altcoin/Bitcoin pairs are somewhat flat. I think they're probably going to spend the next few weeks dropping just like they did last year… “

Cowen further says that Bitcoin is likely to continue outperforming altcoins until the US monetary policy eases.

“My base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over…

… I'm bullish on Bitcoin dominance because quantitative tightening has not ended. If the Federal Reserve were to end quantitative tightening at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, then it's possible that my opinion would change.”

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of the total market capitalization of BTC relative to all other crypto assets. A rising Bitcoin dominance indicates that Bitcoin is either rising faster relative to other crypto assets or its decline is relatively muted compared to the rest of the digital asset market.

On when the Federal Reserve could ease the US monetary policy, Cowen says,

“Now, I don't know how long it's going to take them to end quantitative tightening, it's possible they end it this summer.”

Bitcoin is trading at $84,270 at time of writing.

The best crypto to buy now might not always be tied to headlines, but smart investors know headlines can shift markets. As talk of a trade war softening gains ground, especially with Big Tech getting a pass, risk appetite is starting to return. That ripple effect is spilling into crypto, where altcoins are once again gaining traction. Here's three worth considering.  

Even as the broader market gave back some of Wednesday's historic rally, with the S&P 500 down over 3% and major crypto tokens like Bitcoin and Ether dropping 3% and 8% respectively, investor sentiment remains resilient. 

One rising pick is Dawgz AI, a low-cap project blending AI tools with meme-powered momentum, quietly building while the macro dust settles. As larger tokens wobble, such projects may benefit from renewed interest in innovative, early-stage altcoins.

Crypto may be decentralized, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Global events – from trade policies to economic sanctions still impact investor behavior. When things get hairy, riskier assets like altcoins tend to cool off. But when things settle or get better, confidence can come back fast. That's why global headlines still matter. Whether it's interest rate changes or trade agreements between China and the US, these events impact how people move their money – and crypto is often the first place it flows when sentiment turns bullish.



The recent exemption granted to major US tech firms in the ongoing trade talks is more than just a policy update – it's a signal. It means tensions between global powers may be easing or at least cooling off for now. That kind of shift tends to open the door for broader market optimism. When Big Tech breathes easy, so do investors. This usually triggers a “risk on” mood – where capital flows into growth assets like tech stocks and crypto. Altcoins, especially early stage projects could benefit from this renewed appetite for higher reward plays as the market looks forward.

With global markets turning a corner and crypto confidence creeping back, here are three coins making early moves worth paying attention to.

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is an ERC-20 token project that merges the viral appeal of meme culture with real utility through advanced AI-driven trading algorithms. Designed to operate on the Ethereum blockchain, the project leverages proprietary blackbox AI systems developed by Wall Street veterans to generate optimal trading yields. With a strong emphasis on community engagement, staking incentives, and a fully audited smart contract, Dawgz AI aims to set a new standard in the memecoin space—one where entertainment, innovation, and financial technology intersect. Currently in presale at $0.004 and with over $3.2 million already raised, Dawgz AI positions itself not merely as a meme, but as a utility-driven asset with long-term growth potential.



Here's what's making Dawgz AI more than just another presale coin:

If you're looking for a more in-depth overview of Dawgz AI, you can check the video below by the crypto enthusiast ClayBro.

Dogwifhat might've already had its viral moment, but this pup's story isn't over. Trading at $0.38 with a $381M market cap, WIF exploded from a meme into a cultural icon.

It hit an all-time high of $4.85 just a few months ago, and despite a big pullback, its community is still strong and the trading volume is high. With over 218K followers and meme coin mania still alive, WIF could easily fire back up as retail interest returns.

Here is a quick look at the numbers that matter:

Popcat isn't just riding the Solana wave, it's helping power it. Priced at $0.24 with a market cap of $235.57 million, Popcat became a meme coin rocket, exploding from nearly nothing to over $2.07 in just months. 

POPCAT price source: Brave New Coin Market Cap Data

While it's pulled back since, the POPCAT community is still massive, and it remains one of Solana's most recognizable meme plays. As meme coins continue to attract retail energy, Popcat could be a top comeback contender.

Here's what the numbers are saying:

When market sentiment flips from cautious to optimistic, Bitcoin usually leads, but altcoins move faster. That's because smaller-cap tokens are more volatile by nature, and it takes less volume to move them. 

As a result, when confidence returns, altcoins often outperform in percentage gains. This is why traders looking for sharper upside often start eyeing early-stage or under-the-radar coins. Tokens that are still in presale are exactly the kind of projects that can benefit most when the market turns risk-on.

The best crypto to buy is often the one gaining quiet traction while the market shifts in the background.  With trade tensions easing and investor appetite returning, altcoins are starting to pop again.  While the big names have stayed steady, early movers like Dawgz AI are getting noticed for their timing, features, and potential upside.

Ethereum (ETH) traded just below $1,600 on Thursday following a 60% plunge in the total net assets of US spot Ether ETFs. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun said that he won't sell his ETH holdings despite the sustained downtrend in the top altcoin's price.

US spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their negative flows on Wednesday after shedding $12.01 million, per SoSoValue data.

Since Trump's tariffs went live, ETH ETFs have seen a net outflow of $909 million. ETH's weak price has also caused their total net assets to plummet by over 60%, going from an all-time high of $14.28 billion in December to $5.25 billion on Wednesday. The sustained outflows signal increased institutional risk-off sentiment, hampering ETH's price growth.

This comes as issuers, including Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale and 21Shares, are seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking within their ETH ETF products. Approval from the SEC will see investors earning ~3% yield on their ETH ETF holdings, potentially slowing down selling pressure on the products.

Meanwhile, in an X post on Thursday, Tron founder Justin Sun noted that he will not sell its ETH holdings despite the top altcoin's weak price action in the past few months. Instead, he highlighted that Tron will continue collaborating with Ethereum developers.

"ETH is currently at a low price, but we have no intention of selling our ETH holdings," Sun wrote on X.

Sun has been a major investor in ETH, increasing his holdings on several occasions in the past year. While Sun reportedly transferred a huge amount of ETH to his HTX exchange in Q4' 24, he still holds a fat ETH balance across several staking protocols. One whale wallet potentially belonging to Sun holds over 168,000 stETH, per Arkham's data.

Sun's remark follows potential selling activity from digital asset firm Galaxy Digital, which has deposited 49,681 ETH worth about $79.37 million into Binance and Coinbase over the past five days, per wallet tracking platform Lookonchain's data. Several ETH whales also capitulated within the past month following Trump's tariff impact on the market.

Ethereum saw $23.10 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations is $12.52 million and $10.58 million, respectively.

ETH has been on an extended downtrend since December 16, stretching its move within a key descending channel beyond four consecutive months. This marks ETH's longest multi-month downtrend since it launched in 2017.

A breakdown below the channel's lower boundary could accelerate ETH's decline and cause immense capitulation. However, a breakout above the channel's upper boundary and reclaim of the $2,000 key level could flip ETH into a bullish trend.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of entering the oversold region, while the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has remained oversold since late February. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) posted two consecutive receding histogram bars, indicating a slight weakness in the bearish momentum.

Bitcoin price consolidates above $84,000 on Friday, a short-term support that has gained significance this week. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to weather storms caused by US President Donald Trump's incessant trade war with China after pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9 for other countries.

Official Trump ($TRUMP), the Presidential meme coin launched in January by the United States (US) President Trump family's World Liberty Financial company, is in a precarious situation that could see volatility spike significantly. 

Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $84,000 on Friday as President Donald Trump slammed Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates on time. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering rates by 25 basis points, urging Powell to do the same in the US.

Slovenia has become the latest European Union member state to crack down on untaxed crypto gains, unveiling a proposal to impose a 25% tax on personal profits from digital asset disposals starting in 2026.

Metrics details

The immunoregulatory metabolite itaconate accumulates in innate immune cells upon Toll-like receptor stimulation. In response to macrophage activation by lipopolysaccharide, itaconate inhibits inflammasome activation and boosts type I interferon signalling; however, the molecular mechanism of this immunoregulation remains unclear. Here, we show that the enhancement of type I interferon secretion by itaconate depends on the inhibition of peroxiredoxin 5 and on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. We find that itaconate non-covalently inhibits peroxiredoxin 5, leading to the modulation of mitochondrial peroxide in activating macrophages. Through genetic manipulation, we confirm that peroxiredoxin 5 modulates type I interferon secretion in macrophages. The non-electrophilic itaconate mimetic 2-methylsuccinate inhibits peroxiredoxin 5 and phenocopies immunoregulatory action of itaconate on type I interferon and inflammasome activation, providing further support for a non-covalent inhibition of peroxiredoxin 5 by itaconate. Our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of actions and biological rationale for the predominantly immune specification of itaconate.

They've been living above a German escape route for years.

We can't say for sure that a recently discovered secret tunnel connecting historic townhomes in Belgium was created by the Germans during World War I after they commandeered the properties, but a recent Dutch-language report into the find makes that possibility quite likely. 

During a renovation project in Tielt, Belgium, near the historic city center at the Nieuwstraat townhouses, the homeowner remodeling a floor at Nieuwstraat No. 7 discovered a hidden well cap with a nearly 13-foot-deep shaft underneath it, according to a translated statement from Belgium's Agency for Immovable Heritage. The shaft connected to a closed-off 18th century water well and, more interestingly, links to a nearly 32-foot-long tunnel only about four feet high that may have been built during the German occupation. 

The tunnel connects Nieuwstraat No. 7 to a cellar underneath Nieuwstraat No. 5. Finding a 100-year-old tunnel underneath your home is surprising regardless, but slightly (only slightly) less so when considering the history of the townhouse complex. During World War I, the Germans took over the townhome complex and made Nieuwstraat a four-year-long headquarters. The site served as a crucial Fourth Army command center featuring a war room that scripted the first chlorine gas attack and flamethrower uses in 1915 while coordinating operations on the Western Front until French bombardment in 1918. 

According to the report, this context makes it “likely that this tunnel was built as an escape route.” 

“Given the strategic function of the property,” the statement read, “with the map cabinet and top generals above the floor, that is not a forgotten theory.” 

The history of the home dates further back than German occupation. The house was built in 1769 on a plot of land once housing a small community of Franciscans. In 1906 a doctor purchased the house and extended it toward the rear. But in summer 1914, German troops invaded neutral Belgium and in October 1914 decided to house military command for the Fourth Army in Tielt, out of the range of enemy artillery, but strategically located near road and rail infrastructure. 

Nieuwstraat No. 7 become a strategic center that featured a 1:20,000 replica of the front lines. 

The tunnel find came near another underground find. One metal manhole cover gave access to a brick water well that featured the same bricks used when the house was constructed. But more surprising was a second manhole cover about three feet away. This one covered a vertical shaft with non-connected walls positioned between the well and house with supports made of bricks and beams that came well after initial home construction. “All these elements made it clear that this shaft is a later addition,” according to the report. 

At the bottom of the shaft, a northwest wall appeared to have been breached, featuring an opening over seven feet high that leads directly into a well. “The opening was cut through the brick wall, but neatly finished,” according to the report. Once in the well, there was a brick tunnel with a barrel vault running northwest, parallel to the rear of the houses in the Nieuwstraat. At the end of the tunnel a now-blocked passage gave access to the cellar of Nieuwstraat No. 5. 

While the report noted that the well and cisterns were likely original construction when the house was built, the work of the shaft with its metal I-beams and the cut in the well “can be dated to after 1909.” 

By ensuring the vertical shaft was inside the building, it also allowed for unseen movement between homes. While the tunnel was still somewhat small for comfortable human use, the shape of the tunnel, neat finishes of the interior, lack of slope, dimensions, and use of construction elements such as iron and steel make its use as a water conveyance tunnel unlikely. “The remarkable history of the house makes another function more likely,” according to the report, “namely an escape route from the First World War.”

NASA's Next Major Space Telescope Is Ready to Launch. Trump Wants to Kill It and Other Vital Science

Amid harsh cuts, the Trump administration has proposed canceling the nearly ready-to-launch Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope

By Nadia Drake edited by Dan Vergano

The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope is designed to observe hundreds of millions of galaxies and thousands of supernovas to investigate dark energy and the universe's accelerated expansion.

GSFC/SVS

Technicians at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center are nearing the finish line on the space agency's newest flagship astrophysics mission. Called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the eagerly awaited $3.5-billion observatory could solve the secrets of the dark universe, spot untold undiscovered worlds and light the way toward finding alien life. It only awaits final integration and testing, a short hop down to Cape Canaveral, Fla., and a longer journey to a sun-circling orbit near the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In a triumph for NASA, reliable sources say that Roman could launch as early as the fall of 2026, well ahead of its May 2027 target and potentially under budget.

But a leaked draft of the president's 2026 budget request, which Scientific American has reviewed, instead calls for canceling Roman.

“This is nuts. You've built it, and you're not going to do the final step to finish it?” says astrophysicist David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation and former co-chair of Roman's science team. “That is such a waste of taxpayers' money.”

Roman isn't the only casualty in the president's draft NASA budget, which is still in flux and will ultimately require congressional approval. The proposal cuts heavily into the $25-billion space agency's science division, home to missions that include JWST, the twin Voyager probes, the Hubble Space Telescope and a fleet of Mars rovers that have colored in our understanding of the cosmos and captured imaginations worldwide for half a century.

The draft budget includes an almost 50 percent cut to heliophysics, which studies the sun and space weather, reducing it to $455 million; a more than 50 percent reduction in Earth science funding, which includes climate monitoring, taking it down to roughly $1 billion; and a 30 percent cut to planetary science and solar system exploration, resulting in $1.9 billion. The last cut kills the upcoming DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission to Venus and NASA's beleaguered mission to bring rocks back from Mars. Notably, the document also cleaves off two thirds of the funding for NASA's astrophysics division, which studies stars, galaxies and cosmology, dropping it to $487 million and specifying that “no funding is provided” for telescopes other than JWST and Hubble.

Space policy observers expressed dismay at the budget cuts, particularly at the notion of throwing away a flagship space telescope. “This is a wholly unserious budget proposal,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking member of the spending committee for NASA, in a recent statement.

Privately, space policy experts have been even less charitable about the proposal: “It sets back a program that is clearly the leading program in the world—in a historic fashion,” says a former government official, speaking to Scientific American on condition of anonymity because of concerns about retaliation. “You take that program and shoot it through the head.”

NASA has refrained from saying much publicly. A spokesperson for the agency has only issued a statement that it has the draft “and has begun the deliberative process.” (The White House has not responded to requests for comment.) The agency received the draft on April 10, one day after Jared Isaacman, President Donald Trump's nominee for NASA administrator, insisted in his nomination hearing that the U.S. could send humans to the moon and Mars and “do all the other things” with NASA's current budget. “I do believe the president is looking to usher in the golden age of science and discovery,” Isaacman said. Now observers suggest that instead of ushering in that golden age, the Trump administration simply seems to be trading in the entire universe.

“If you want to take the most successful fleet of missions ever built, and the leadership that accompanies that fleet, and throw that all away, this is the budget to do it,” says another senior space scientist, speaking anonymously because of concerns about budgetary retribution from the Trump administration. “This budget is like, ‘Here is a shit sandwich with no side of pickle.' You don't even get the plate!”

This isn't the first time Trump's White House has tried to zero out Roman—it's the fourth. But in each previous instance Congress kept the program alive. Observers are hopeful that lawmakers will again rescue the telescope because space science has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.

In 2020 NASA named the project, which until then had been called the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), after Nancy Grace Roman, an astronomer who played a pivotal role in developing Hubble. The Roman telescope has been ranked as a top priority in astrophysics since a National Academy of Sciences review in 2010—a status that was only bolstered two years later, when the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which builds and operates spy satellites, donated two large, unused mirrors and associated optics to the mission.

Designed to survey our own planet, the NRO's 2.4-meter-wide mirrors match Hubble's in size. But they have a shorter focal length that makes them better suited for doing wide-field imaging surveys that monitor millions of stars and take broad looks at exploding stars, early galaxies and large-scale cosmological structures. “Every Hubble image you see—make it 100 times bigger,” Spergel says. “It's like 200 Hubbles. We will survey the entire sky, with Hubble-quality images.”

The project was initially overbudget, but after a hefty course correction, the team is on track to deliver Roman ahead of its planned 2027 launch—and, if so, below cost. That comes on the heels of repeated criticism from federal and congressional watchdogs over price tags and schedule overruns for large space agency missions in the past two decades.

“The team should be given an award, not beat up!” says the former government official. “This is what we want. This is exactly what we want to achieve.”

Like JWST, Roman sees the universe in infrared light—which means that it can spot very old, very faraway objects whose light has stretched into longer, redder infrared wavelengths as it has traversed the expanse. One of the mission's primary scientific goals is to gather the multitude of observations we need to understand dark energy, the mysterious force that is causing the universe to balloon outward.

“Roman has the sensitivity we need to understand what's going on with the 70 percent of the universe that we don't understand, which is dark energy,” Spergel says.

Crucially, recent results from other surveys suggest that this still mysterious dark energy, whose force is seemingly pushing galaxies apart at an accelerating rate, might surprisingly weaken over time. And Roman is designed to be complementary to the European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, which makes similar observations at visible wavelengths, and the U.S.'s powerful, ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is coming online later this year in Chile. “These are not missions that do the same thing,” says Henk Hoekstra, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies dark energy. “We have this strange universe—would you trust a single result and build our whole understanding of the universe on just this one measurement?” Another Roman instrument—a starlight-blocking coronagraph—is a key prototype for NASA's next major astrophysics flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory. That space telescope will look for signs of life in the atmospheres of faraway, habitable planets. Zeroing out Roman would mean losing all the information we'd get from that tech demo. And observers say the cut would also erode current and future astrophysics. Plus, pulling the plug on Roman would not only erode expertise; it would also damage international collaborations. For those to work, Hoekstra says, international partners need to trust that “people can't just suddenly turn off the tap and say, ‘We're not going to do this.'”

Many of the budget's proposed cancellations do exactly that.

“Why do we even plan on doing great things if, on a whim, we can just decide ‘nah'?” the senior space scientist says. “These things take a generation to build and enable multiple generations of scientists. They should not be blithely thrown away.”

Strange Circles in the Sky Are Still Baffling Astronomers

ORCs—odd radio circles—are one of the weirdest recent discoveries in the heavens above

It's rare these days for astronomers to find a new class of object in the heavens. After all, we've been searching the skies for centuries, so all the easy stuff has already been found.

Adding new capabilities to our searches does tend to result in new discoveries, however. Looking in different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example, is a good way to uncover novel things because different objects emit light in different ways.

Objects in newly discovered classes also tend to be faint because, again, bright objects will have already been spotted. This is why finding something completely new is unusual. It's also why they can be baffling—by definition, we've never seen anything like them before.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

In 2019 astronomers stumbled upon just such a thing when they found multiple examples of a previously unknown structure. The objects turned up in a pilot survey using the at-the-time newly completed radio telescope called the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (or ASKAP) telescope, a collection of 36 radio dishes, each 12 meters wide, located in Western Australia.

The newfound celestial objects were relatively big and circular—a shape that's common in astronomical bodies. When something out there looks circular, you're very likely actually seeing a spherical shell, like a soap bubble. Near the middle of the bubble, your line of sight only goes through a small amount of material, but near the edges, that path intersects more. If the material glows, then it will look like a circle from any viewing direction. Dying stars that are blowing off winds of gas tend to make these kinds of structures, and many examples are known.

These new objects in the ASKAP survey, however, didn't correspond to any previously known structure, didn't have an obvious source and, outside of radio emission, were invisible in wavelengths of light. Lacking any obvious mechanism for their creation, astronomers dubbed them ORCs: odd radio circles. Honestly, I give them credit for coming up with such a brief, descriptive moniker (and for presumably being fans of J.R.R. Tolkien). The discovery paper, published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, lists four such ORCs.

The very first ORC seen, called ORC 1 (of course), provided a clue to its origin. Searching images from other telescopes, the astronomers found an object emitting visible and infrared light right at the ORC's center. Later observations indicated it's an elliptical galaxy about five billion light-years from Earth. If it's the source of ORC 1, this first-of-its-kind odd celestial circle is a staggering two million light-years across—more than 15 times wider than our own Milky Way galaxy—making it vast indeed. It's also possible, however, that this galaxy may instead just happen to be coincidentally located near the apparent center of ORC 1 in the sky.

The MeerKAT image of ORC 1, superimposed on optical data from the Dark Energy Survey.

“MeerKAT uncovers the physics of an odd radio circle,” Ray P Norris et al., Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 513, Issue 1, June 2022, Pages 1300–1316, Published March 24, 2022

Worse, the other ORCs in the discovery paper are even weirder. ORCs 2 and 3 are roughly the same size in the sky and happen to be so close together that they're nearly touching, strongly implying they're related to each other in some way. But while ORC 2 is ring-shaped and bright, ORC 3 is faint and more like a disk, an evenly filled circle. If they're related, then why are they so different? There are several galaxies apparently near to them, but again, these objects occupy a lot of real estate on the sky, so the odds of coincidentally finding galaxies in proximity to them are good.

Astronomers have found more ORCs in the years since those initial discoveries, and some of them also appear to have a galaxy in their center, which does seem to strengthen the correlation. If true, then those ORCs are also in the million-light-year range in size.

If this connection is real, what physical mechanism is creating them? Ideas abound. One possible driver is a supermassive black hole. As far as we can tell, every big galaxy has one of these monsters at its heart. As matter falls in, it piles up around the point of no return in a huge disk. Strong magnetic fields that spin like a tornado near the center can launch incredibly powerful beams of matter and energy that scream away from the black hole at high speed. A 2024 study published in the Astrophysical Journal shows that these beams can inflate the gas that exists between galaxies, creating structures very much like the ORC observations.

Not all ORCs are created equal, though. In correspondence published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, astronomers reported they had found a diffuse x-ray emission at the location of an ORC they dubbed Cloverleaf, and its spectrum indicated that the high-energy light comes from hot gas typically found in low-mass galaxy groups that are somewhat heftier than our own Local Group (of which the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are the biggest members). This would put the ORC about 600 million light-years from Earth.

The structure of the Cloverleaf emission is somewhat irregular, displaying a patchiness that is usually associated with the collision and merger of two galaxy groups. Such a catastrophic event can dump a lot of energy into the gas around the galaxies, again creating an expanding wind that can take on a roughly spherical shape. An ORC is born.

If this interpretation of the Cloverleaf is correct, it indicates there's more than one way to make an ORC. These weird objects may, in fact, reflect a wide range of physical structures and distinctly differing origins. Another object, first reported in a 2022 paper, bears a resemblance to the original ORCs but lacks a central galaxy or galaxy cluster and appears as a ring in ASKAP images. Its location, though, is suspicious: it's located just three degrees from the edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud (or LMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. An association with the LMC would mean this ORC is only 160,000 light-years from us, which would make it only about 150 light-years in diameter! That would imply an entirely different formation history, making this ORC a likely supernova remnant, the expanding debris from a star that exploded long ago. What's odd is that it's located outside the LMC, where stars are sparse. Still, sometimes stars get ejected from galaxies; they can get catapulted away if they pass close to a massive black hole, for example, or if they were once part of a binary system and their companion star exploded, flinging them away at high speed.

It looks like the ORC category can encompass several different kinds of objects. That's not too surprising; as we have discovered over and again in astronomy, a collection of phenomena that all look similar can have radically different causes. Some supernovae are from high-mass stars that explode when their core collapses at the end of their life, while others are from already dead white dwarfs that accumulate enough matter on their surface to cause a catastrophic star-wide thermonuclear explosion. Gamma-ray bursts can be caused by extremely massive stars exploding or from two tiny but superdense neutron stars colliding. The list of coincidental similarities in a class of objects goes on and on.

Remember, the term ORC is descriptive, not explanatory. Some may be from galaxy group collisions, others from exploding stars and still others from supermassive black hole belches. Although astronomers have studied ORCs for several years now, they are still a brand-new class of object, meaning we're likely to have more theoretical explanations for them than we do actual examples to study in the sky. More observations should help astronomers classify them, and, as always, the hope is to categorize them, explain them and learn how they work.

Metrics details

Systemic inflammatory conditions are classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase that elevates the susceptibility to secondary infections. Comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these phases is largely lacking. To address this gap, we leveraged a controlled, human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation encompassing both phases. Single-cell RNA sequencing during the acute hyperinflammatory phase identified an inflammatory CD163+SLC39A8+CALR+ monocyte-like subset (infMono) at 4 h post-LPS administration. The late immunosuppressive phase was characterized by diminished expression of type I interferon (IFN)-responsive genes in monocytes, impaired myelopoiesis and a pronounced attenuation of the immune response on a secondary LPS challenge 1 week after the first. The infMono gene program and impaired myelopoiesis were also detected in patient cohorts with bacterial sepsis and coronavirus disease. IFNβ treatment restored type-I IFN responses and proinflammatory cytokine production and induced monocyte maturation, suggesting a potential treatment option for immunosuppression.

Systemic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of several diseases, such as sepsis and viral infections, including COVID-19, and contributes to 20% of global mortality1,2,3,4. Systemic inflammation is classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, often termed as ‘cytokine storm', followed by a late immunosuppressive phase5 that renders patients susceptible to secondary infections6. This sustained refractory state of the immune system is associated with high late-onset mortality7,8,9,10. Despite the substantial burden on healthcare systems, unraveling the molecular mechanisms underpinning systemic inflammation-related pathogenicity is extremely difficult, as a result of extensive heterogeneity in terms of inflammation onset time, etiology, site of infection and underlying comorbidities. Mouse models of systemic inflammation are ubiquitously used and valuable, but suffer from important interspecies differences and poorly replicate the human inflammatory response11, thereby limiting translatability12.

The human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation13, also known as experimental endotoxemia, is a tightly controlled systemic inflammation model in which healthy volunteers are injected with bacterial LPS intravenously to elicit transient but profound acute hyperinflammation, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase14. Previous studies utilizing the experimental endotoxemia model primarily conducted transcriptomic analyses at the whole-blood level and focused on the hyperinflammatory phase, thereby limiting the ability to dissect unbiased cell-type-specific effects of systemic inflammation and examine the mechanistic underpinnings of the immunosuppressive phase15.

In the present study, we combined massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cellular functional assays to characterize the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases after LPS administration in peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes. Leveraging of publicly available large cohorts of patients with sepsis and COVID-19 indicated the clinical relevance of our comprehensive longitudinal dataset. Our results identified conserved gene expression programs, mainly in monocytes and T cells, during the acute LPS-induced hyperinflammatory phase, early sepsis and COVID-19. In the immunosuppressive phase, we observed a significant impairment of monocyte functionality and maturation accompanied by decreased interferon type I (IFN-I) signaling that could be restored by IFNβ treatment.

To study systemic inflammation in humans in vivo, healthy male volunteers (Supplementary Table 1) were intravenously injected with 2 ng kg−1 of LPS (n = 7, age 24 (19–30) years) or placebo (n = 4, age 19 (18–28) years; Fig. 1a). The appearance of clinical systemic inflammation symptoms, such as fever and tachycardia (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and a transient profound increase in circulating cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-10, CCL4, CCL3, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, IL-1RN (IL-1ra gene) (Extended Data Fig. 1b) up to 8 h after LPS administration, confirmed the induction of hyperinflammation. Severe monocytopenia was observed at 1 h after LPS administration (Extended Data Fig. 1c), with CD14+CD16− classic monocytes (cMonos) starting to repopulate the blood ~3 h post-LPS and returning to baseline levels (defined as immediately before the LPS challenge) at ~6 h post-LPS16 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Between 6 h and day 7 (d7) after the LPS challenge, cMonos gradually differentiated into CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes (iMonos) and CD14−CD16+ nonclassic monocytes (ncMonos) (Extended Data Fig. 1d)16; however, the abundance of these subsets in blood remained significantly decreased at d7 after the LPS challenge (Fig. 1b), suggesting impaired monocyte maturation.

Genes were clustered (C1–C6) based on their behavior across the different time points. m, GO term analysis of genes in clusters C1–C6 defined as in l. The box plots in b show the median, first and third quartiles and the whiskers 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). The bar plots in f and g are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. The P values were calculated using two-sided, paired Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests.

Bulk RNA-seq of blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) showed significant perturbation at 4 h and 8 h post-LPS compared with baseline (1,459 upregulated and 1,222 downregulated genes), which substantially normalized at 24 h post-LPS (Fig. 1c), with no significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at d7 compared with baseline (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Gene ontology (GO) of upregulated DEGs at 4–8 h post-LPS was mainly attributed to inflammatory response (CXCL8 and IL-6) and IFN type I (IFN-I) signaling pathways (MX1 and IRF7) (Fig. 1e), whereas antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II was the most significant GO term of downregulated genes at 4 h (HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB5) (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2b). As decreased expression of the MHC-I receptor human leukocyte antigen isotype DR (HLA-DR) in CD14+ monocytes indicates the induction of T cell inhibitory, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a correlate of impaired outcomes in patients with sepsis17,18, we co-incubated blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers at baseline and at 4 h post-LPS (n = 6) with naive blood CD3+ T cells obtained from non-LPS-challenged healthy donors (n = 9) in the presence of CD3 and CD28 antibody-coupled beads to induce cytokine production and proliferation through T cell receptor stimulation. Co-incubation with cMonos obtained 4 h post-LPS strongly inhibited IFNγ and TNF secretion (Fig. 1f) and decreased T cell proliferation (Fig. 1g) compared with co-incubation with cMonos obtained at baseline, suggesting that they were immunosuppressive. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated a significant downregulation of IFN-I signaling at d7 compared with baseline in CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 1h). Nevertheless, very few genes were differentially expressed between these time points and, although the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was lower on d7 compared with baseline, this did not reach statistical significance at the level of individual genes (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Table 2).

To functionally investigate the late immunosuppressive phase, LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 7) were intravenously re-challenged with the same dose of LPS at d7. During the 8 h after this second LPS challenge, we observed markedly less pronounced clinical symptoms and TNF, IL-10, CCL4, CCL3, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2 and IL-1RN elevation compared with the same timeframe after the first challenge (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Bulk RNA-seq on blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) indicated that almost all DEGs (93.6%) from 4 h post-first LPS challenge showed a less pronounced response at 4 h post-second LPS challenge, with an average 30% decrease in responsiveness (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Table 3). Based on the difference in gene expression between CD14+ monocytes obtained 4 h after the first and second challenges, DEGs clustered into three groups: responsive (fold-change (FC) < 2, EREG and ACSL1), semi-suppressed (2 < FC < 3, OAS3 and IFITM2) and suppressed (FC > 3, CCL4 and NFKB2), with 15% of DEGs falling into the suppressed and semi-suppressed clusters (Fig. 1i). GO terms associated with chemokine-mediated response and neutrophil activation were suppressed, whereas phagocytosis remained functional 4 h after the second challenge compared with 4 h after the first challenge (Fig. 1j).

Next, bulk RNA-seq on blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) at baseline and at 4, 8, 24 h and d7 post-LPS that were restimulated ex vivo with LPS for 4 h indicated that DEGs could be classified into responsive (FC < 2), semi-suppressed (2 < FC < 3) and suppressed (FC > 3). Approximately 43% of DEGs at 4 h and 17% of DEGs at 8 h were semi-suppressed or suppressed (Fig. 1k). The response of CD14+ monocytes at 24 h was similar to that at baseline (6% (semi-)suppressed DEGs), whereas 12% of DEGs on d7 were semi-suppressed or suppressed compared with baseline (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Stimulation of blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 7) at baseline and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS administration with various pathogen-associated molecular patterns Pam3Cys, poly(inosinic:cytidylic acid) (poly(I:C)), LPS, flagellin and R848, and heat-killed pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans for 24 h indicated a marked attenuation in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL4, IL-10 and IL-1RN at 4 h post-LPS and a less pronounced attenuation at d7 post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 3e), suggesting broad immunosuppression in response to various triggers, not just LPS. Based on their dynamics at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h and d7 post-LPS administration, DEGs in LPS-restimulated CD14+ monocytes were classified into six clusters (C1–C6; Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 3f). GO analysis indicated that the cytokine production pathway was suppressed in all clusters (Fig. 1n). GO terms and individual genes related to the IFN-I signaling pathway were suppressed in LPS-restimulated CD14+ monocytes obtained at d7 (clusters C5 and C6) (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 3g). Ex vivo stimulation of blood pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers at baseline and at d7 with LPS for 24 h (n = 3) resulted in loss of iMonos and ncMonos, in contrast to samples cultured without LPS, which retained iMonos (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i). Blood cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS administration that were ex vivo stimulated with LPS exhibited significantly reduced expression of the IFN-induced protein BST2 compared with LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k).

Collectively, these results indicated an initial hyperinflammatory phase up to 8 h after an LPS challenge, followed by an immunosuppressive phenotype apparent at d7 post-LPS. The substantially attenuated in vivo and ex vivo monocyte responses at d7 suggested immunological rewiring in monocytes.

To determine the acute hyperinflammatory and late immunosuppressive phase changes in the transcriptomic profiles of bone marrow-residing mononuclear cells in LPS-challenged volunteers, bone marrow aspirated from the posterior iliac crest and peripheral blood samples were obtained at baseline (bone marrow, 7 d before the LPS challenge; blood, immediately before the LPS challenge) and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS challenge (n = 3), and scRNA-seq was performed using the 10x Genomics platform. After quality control and in silico removal of potential doublets, we obtained the transcriptomic profile of 116,183 cells across the 3 time points and 2 compartments (Supplementary Table 4). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)19 embedding identified mononuclear cells (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4a), with relatively similar proportions of each cell type between donors (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Based on hematopoietic lineage, cells were partitioned into: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid cells; B cells and plasmocytic dendritic cells (pDCs); T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and megakaryocyte and erythroid cells; the last of these did not show robust differences in RNA profiles across all time points (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4c).

Subclustering and batch correction of the HSCs and myeloid cells cluster revealed a strong displacement of the entire lineage at 4 h compared with baseline, with a prominent emergence of CD163+SLC39A+CALR+ monocyte-like cells (infMonos) at 4 h at the expense of cMonos present as baseline (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Expression of pro-monocyte signature genes, such as RETN and ALOX5AP, was increased in the infMono cluster, whereas expression of mature monocyte markers such as MHC-II genes was reduced (Fig. 2e). The enrichment of the pro-monocyte signature was accompanied by an increased proportion of RETN+ pro-monocytes at 4 h (Extended Data Fig. 4f), indicating the emergence of newly generated immature monocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood at 4 h post-LPS.

The gene expression profile of bone marrow and blood LYZ+ monocytes showed a high degree of similarity at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b), although blood monocytes had a slightly higher expression of mature monocyte genes, such as HLA-DRB5 and CLEC12A (Extended Data Fig. 5b). RETN+ pro-monocytes were the most abundant subset in the bone marrow at baseline, whereas cMonos, iMonos and ncMonos were more abundant in blood at this time point (Extended Data Fig. 5c). DEGs at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline were consistent between bone marrow and blood monocytes, with nearly all DEGs overlapping and having relatively similar fold-changes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).

Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) identified five main gene sets (DNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation, heat shock response, inflammatory response and myeloid cell differentiation) that were enriched throughout the myeloid lineage (Extended Data Fig. 5f), with heat shock response exhibiting the highest enrichment in all HSCs and myeloid cell types at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 5g). An unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) defined a gene program mainly comprising inflammatory (CD14 and LITAF), heat shock, IFN response (HSPA1A and HSPB1) and immature pro-monocyte genes (RETN) that were specifically enriched in infMonos (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 5h and Supplementary Table 5).

In inflamed mice, granulocyte–monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived monocytes that express elevated levels of neutrophil-associated genes such as MPO and ELANE20 are generated predominantly, at the expense of monocyte–dendritic cell progenitor (MDP)-derived monocytes. Leverage of a public human neutrophil dataset21 (Extended Data Fig. 5i) indicated that neutrophil-enriched genes (for example, MPO and AZU1) were not significantly increased in human LYZ+ monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 5j) at 4 h post-LPS.

We subclustered, batch corrected and visualized the CD3+ T cell and NCAM1+ NK cell subsets (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). SsGSEA showed that the IFN-I signaling signature caused the UMAP shift in these subsets at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). NMF defined a gene program (inflammatory T cells (Tinf cells)) that consisted of IFN-I responsive genes (for example, MX1, IRF1 and ISG15) induced in T and NK cells at 4 h (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 5). Highly similar gene expression profiles were detected in bone marrow and blood T and NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood exhibited a stronger response to LPS compared with their bone marrow equivalents (Extended Data Fig. 6g), whereas NK cells demonstrated comparable responsiveness in both compartments (Extended Data Fig. 6g). The proportion of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was substantially increased at 4 h relative to baseline in both compartments, whereas the abundance of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells declined (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Analysis of the B cell and pDC clusters showed a slight, yet noticeable, LPS-induced response in B cells at 4 h (Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). SsGSEA revealed four major signatures (IFN signaling, cell cycle, protein folding and oxidative phosphorylation) in B cells at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 6l). The IFN-signaling signature was upregulated in inflammatory B cells and pDCs at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 6m), similar to other lineages (Fig. 2j). Together, these observations indicated that LPS-induced specific signature gene programs were induced in monocytes and T cells during the acute hyperinflammatory phase after LPS administration.

To assess the clinical relevance of the LPS systemic inflammation challenge model, we analyzed public scRNA-seq datasets from an early bacterial sepsis cohort which consists of blood samples from patients with sepsis (n = 29) and less severe nonseptic bacterial infection (n = 17) obtained within 12 h of presentation to the emergency department and healthy controls (n = 19)22. Furthermore, we analyzed a mixed early COVID-19 or sepsis cohort, which includes blood samples from patients with mild (n = 11) and severe or critical (n = 12) COVID-19, sepsis (n = 13) (all sampled within 7 d of diagnosis) and healthy controls (n = 10)23. The LYZ+ monocyte compartment from these two datasets was selected and embedded using UMAP (Fig. 3a,b) and the infMono gene program was projected on to each cohort (Fig. 3c,d). Enrichment analysis indicated a significant enrichment of the infMono gene program in patients with bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19, who had the highest enrichment scores, as well as in patients with nonseptic bacterial infections, but not in patients with mild COVID-19 (Fig. 3e,f). Conversely, the gene signature induced in the monocytes of patients with sepsis in the early bacterial sepsis cohort22, referred to as MS1, was also enriched in the infMono cluster in our LPS-challenged cohort (Extended Data Fig. 7a), indicating the high similarity of early induced genetic programs in bacterial sepsis and LPS-induced systemic inflammation. We also extracted CD3+ T cells from the early bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 sepsis datasets and embedded them using UMAP (Fig. 3g,h) and projected the inflammatory T cell (Tinf) cell gene program on these datasets (Fig. 3i,j). Enrichment analysis revealed significantly elevated Tinf cell gene program scores across T cells from both datasets, with T cells from patients with COVID-19 exhibiting the highest enrichment (Fig. 3k,l). Thus, the infMono and Tinf cell gene programs induced at 4 h post-LPS are significantly elevated during bacterial and COVID-19 sepsis.

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the sustained immunosuppressive effects at d7 post-LPS challenge, we embedded and visualized all HSCs and myeloid cells from all time points (baseline, 4 h and d7 post-LPS) using UMAP (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Overall, the transcriptome of d7 HSCs and myeloid cells was highly similar to that of baseline HSCs and myeloid cells, with the exception of baseline iMonos and ncMonos (Fig. 4c). Differential abundance analysis using neighboring graphs indicated a significant loss of iMonos and ncMonos at d7 compared with baseline (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7c–e), suggesting impaired myeloid maturation. NMF identified two major programs highly active in iMonos and ncMonos (Fig. 4e,f). One comprised genes expressed solely by ncMonos, such as FCGR3A and CDKN1C, whereas the other comprised IFN-I-responsive genes, such as IRF7 and MX1 (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 7f). The average expression per cell for genes associated with the ncMono and IFN-I programs was not significantly altered in LYZ+ monocytes, but the abundance of cells expressing these two programs was significantly reduced at 7 d compared with baseline (Fig. 4g), suggesting an impairment in myeloid maturation in the immunosuppressive phase of LPS-induced systemic inflammation.

a, UMAP representation of HSCs and myeloid lineage cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3 for each compartment) at BL (bone marrow, 7 d before the LPS challenge; blood, immediately before the LPS challenge) and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS challenge, colored based on cell type. b, UMAP of all blood and bone marrow cells (n = 3) as in a, colored based on compartment. c, UMAP of all blood and bone marrow cells (n = 3) as in a, colored based on time point. d, Nearest neighbor graph-based, differential abundance analysis between BL and d7 of HSCs and myeloid cells from bone marrow and blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3 for each compartment).

To test whether impaired monocyte maturation occurred in bacterial sepsis, we leveraged publicly available blood samples from patients with sepsis collected at >14 d into the disease (n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 5)24. All patients had prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays and unresolved organ dysfunction24. UMAP embedding of LYZ+ monocytes (Fig. 5a) and nearest neighbor differential abundance analysis unveiled a significant loss of ncMonos in patients with late sepsis compared with healthy controls (Fig. 5b,c). Genes related to the ncMono and IFN-I gene programs showed minor changes in average gene expression per cell, whereas the abundance of cells that expressed these programs, especially the ncMono program, was significantly reduced in patients with late sepsis compared with healthy controls (Fig. 5d).

Box plots in c and g show the median, first and third quartiles and the whiskers 1.5× the IQR. The P values were calculated using unpaired, one-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests.

We also leveraged a public scRNA-seq dataset of patients who recovered from mild (n = 46) and severe (n = 29) COVID-19 as well as healthy controls (n = 20)25. Blood samples from patients were collected >14 d after the onset of symptoms to evaluate the late or convalescent phase of the disease. UMAP embedding of LYZ+ monocytes (Fig. 5e) and nearest neighbor differential abundance analysis showed a significant loss of ncMonos in patients who were convalescing from COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, both in patients who previously suffered mild and severe COVID-19 (Fig. 5f,g), with no significant changes in the average expression per cell of genes related to ncMono and IFN-I gene programs, but rather a reduction in the abundance of cells that expressed these programs (Fig. 5h).

Our observations revealed a significant reduction in the number of ncMonos in the late phase of bacterial sepsis or COVID-19, implying an impairment in the monocyte maturation process in these conditions.

To test whether IFNβ, a type-I IFN, could reverse LPS-induced immunosuppression, in vitro blood cMonos obtained from healthy donors (n = 8) were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng ml−1 of LPS for 24 h, and restimulated after 6 d with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of various concentration of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1). TNF and IL-6 production by cMonos that had previously been exposed to LPS was significantly reduced compared with cMonos that had not been exposed to LPS (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). All concentrations of IFNβ restored the production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos that had been previously exposed to LPS, whereas production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos not previously exposed to LPS was less affected (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Subsequently, we evaluated whether IFNβ could reverse the impaired cytokine production by monocytes observed at d7 post-in vivo LPS administration. To explore this, blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged healthy volunteers at baseline and d7 were stimulated ex vivo with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1) and analyzed at 4 h using RNA-seq (n = 3, 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ only) and at 24 h for TNF and IL-6 production (n = 6), as well as BST expression (n = 3, 250 U ml−1 of IFNβ only). TNF and IL-6 production by cMonos obtained at d7 was significantly reduced compared with production by cMonos obtained at baseline (Fig. 6a). All concentrations of IFNβ markedly enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS (Fig. 6a). Analysis of RNA-seq profiles indicated that IFNβ treatment strongly upregulated proinflammatory genes (for example, TNFSF10, IL6, TNF and IL1B) and ISGs (for example, IFI27, ISG15, IRF7 and MX1) in LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at d7 (Fig. 6b). Flow cytometry confirmed restoration of IFN-I responses by IFNβ, because the reduced cell surface expression of BST2 on LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS compared with cMonos obtained at baseline was abrogated after IFNβ treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8c–f).

a, Box plots of log2(fold-change) in TNF (left) and IL-6 (right) production by cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 6) on BL and d7 who were stimulated with LPS (10 ng ml−1) in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1) for 24 h. b, Comparison of expression of inflammatory and ISGs between cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) at BL and d7 who were stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100 U ml−1) for 4 h. Data were normalized to the response of BL cMonos. c, Flow plots of a representative example of CD14 and CD16 expression of cMonos obtained from a healthy donor immediately after isolation (BL) and after 3 d of incubation with or without 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence or absence of an anti-IFNAR Ab (10 μg ml−1). The experiment was repeated in six donors (see d). d, Bar plots of percentages of monocyte subsets in the blood of healthy donors (n = 6) immediately after cMono isolation (BL) and at d3 of incubation of cMonos with or without 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence or absence of IFNAR Ab (10 μg ml−1). The box plots in a show the median and first and third quartiles and the whiskers 1.5× the IQR. Bar plots in d are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. The P values were calculated using two-sided, paired Student's t-tests.

To investigate whether IFNβ modulated monocyte maturation, blood cMonos obtained from healthy donors (n = 6) were treated with or without 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence or absence of an IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) antibody (IFNAR Ab, 10 μg ml−1) for 3 d. We detected an increased abundance of iMonos in IFNβ-treated cultures compared with untreated cultures, an effect reversed by the IFNAR antibody (Fig. 6c,d). We did not observe an effect of IFNβ on the frequency of ncMonos (Fig. 6c,d), suggesting that additional factors are required for maturation to ncMonos or monocytes do not mature into ncMonos in these in vitro conditions. Culturing of blood pan-monocytes obtained from healthy donors (n = 4), with or without 250 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence and absence of IFNAR antibody (10 μg ml−1) for 24 h, resulted in the loss of ncMonos in all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8g), whereas IFNβ treatment significantly increased the expression of BST2 on cMonos and iMonos, compared with untreated cultures, and the IFNAR antibody reversed this effect (Extended Data Fig. 8h,i).

In this paper, we have described the dynamic transcriptional and functional landscape of peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes during the acute hyperinflammatory and late immunosuppressive phases induced by LPS administration in healthy volunteers. In the acute hyperinflammatory phase, distinct subsets of monocyte-like cells (CD163+SLC39A8+CALR+ infMonos) and Tinf cells (MX1+IRF1+ISG15+) emerged, a phenomenon also observed in patients with sepsis and COVID-19. The late immunosuppressive phase was characterized by a severely suppressed in vivo cytokine response to a second challenge with the same dose of LPS, ex vivo hyporesponsiveness of monocytes to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, suppressed IFN-I signaling and impaired myelopoiesis resulting in decreased maturation of monocytes toward iMonos and ncMonos. The impaired monocyte maturation was also observed in the late phase of sepsis or COVID-19.

The infMonos that emerged 4 h after LPS administration exhibited upregulated expression of inflammatory genes (for example, CD163, SLC39A8 and CALR) and immature pro-monocyte markers such as RETN, indicative of emergency myelopoiesis. This bears a similarity to the induction of immature MDSCs observed in patients with sepsis22,26. The acute hyperinflammatory phase was also characterized by activation of the IFN-I signaling pathway across multiple cell types, including HSCs, consistent with reports that LPS induces IFNβ and ISG expression27,28. IFN-I induction in murine HSCs can activate HSCs to proliferate and thereby contribute to emergency myelopoiesis, while inducing HSC exhaustion in the long term29,30,31.

Seven days after the LPS challenge, in the late immunosuppressive phase, the in vivo response to a secondary challenge with the same dose was severely suppressed. This immunosuppression is unlikely to be caused by direct exposition of (pro)monocytes to LPS because of the relatively short lifespan of monocytes (~1–2 d)16, their rapid disappearance from the circulation after LPS administration16 and the swift clearance of LPS from the blood (half-life ~30 min)32,33. Therefore, it is plausible that the immunosuppressed monocytes originate from stem or progenitor cells in the bone marrow exposed to systemic inflammation.

A significant reduction in the abundance of iMonos and ncMonos was observed in the late immunosuppressive phase, suggesting a maturation impairment. As iMonos and ncMonos were the highest ISG-expressing cells and IFNβ treatment resulted in maturation toward iMonos, our results imply an important role for IFN-I signaling in monocyte maturation. A possible causal link between diminished IFN-I response and impaired myelopoiesis is substantiated by findings in mice deficient for either IFNAR1 or IFNβ that generate significantly less mature monocytes, which express fewer ISGs34,35.

The infMono and Tinf cell gene programs identified during the acute phase of LPS-induced systemic inflammation were also significantly induced during the acute hyperinflammatory phase of bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. Furthermore, we detected a significant loss of ncMonos in patients with late-phase sepsis and individuals convalescing from COVID-19, akin to what we observed at d7 after LPS administration. These observations indicate that the LPS-induced systemic inflammation model recapitulated hallmark features of highly heterogeneous clinical complications, such as sepsis, rendering it a suitable in vivo model to both interrogate the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions.

The impairment in IFN-I signaling during the late immunosuppressive phase was multifaceted, involving the aforementioned reduction in the number of ncMonos, which were high expressors of IFN-I genes, but also significantly impaired ISG induction in cMonos upon ex vivo restimulation with LPS. This underscores the complexity of immunosuppression in systemic inflammatory conditions and highlights the need for targeted interventions that can both restore monocyte maturation and reactivate IFN-I signaling pathways. IFNβ reversed the immunosuppressed state of monocytes by reinstating the expression of inflammatory genes, ISGs and cytokine production, and induced maturation of cMonos toward iMonos.

A limitation of the present study is the use of a male-only study cohort, which limits the ability to apply these findings to female patients. Females make significantly more proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS administration than males36,37. However, despite the sex-based differences in the magnitude of the response, the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to LPS are highly conserved and there are no significant differences in the immune-related pathways enriched in both sexes36, so this model of systemic inflammation can guide future research in more complex disease models or clinical scenarios in both females and males.

Overall, our findings highlight a critical role of diminished IFN-I signaling in impaired myelopoiesis and immunosuppression and reveal that IFNβ may represent a promising treatment option to reverse immunosuppression in systemic inflammatory conditions.

The LPS-induced systemic inflammation (experimental human endotoxemia) study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Oost-Nederland (ref. no. NL61136.091.17). Eleven healthy male volunteers were recruited. All participants gave written informed consent and medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests and a 12-lead electrocardiogram did not reveal any abnormalities. Smoking, medication use, previous participation in experimental human endotoxemia studies or signs of acute illness within 3 weeks before the start of the study were exclusion criteria. For in vitro experiments, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers after obtaining written informed consent. Blood withdrawal for this purpose was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Oost-Nederland (ref. no. NL84281.091.23). All study procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, including the latest revisions.

We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled observational study in which participants were allocated to receive either an intravenous LPS injection (n = 7) or a placebo injection with 0.9% NaCl (n = 4). All LPS-challenged participants received a second LPS challenge on d7 after the first LPS challenge, using identical procedures. Bone marrow and blood were collected at baseline (bone marrow: day −7 compared with first LPS challenge, blood: immediately before the first LPS challenge), 4 h after the first LPS challenge (4 h) and at d7. Bone marrow aspiration from the posterior iliac crest was performed by a skilled physician assistant of the Department of Hematology at Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Bone marrow was collected in a sodium heparin solution (150 IU ml−1, ratio 3:1). Blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Additional blood was collected before and at several time points after the LPS challenges.

During LPS or placebo challenge days, all participants underwent the same study procedures, except for administration of either LPS or placebo. Briefly, 24 h before hospitalization, participants needed to refrain from alcohol and caffeine and from 22:00 onward no food and drinks were allowed. Before the challenge, participants were admitted to the research ICU of Radboudumc. An intravenous cannula was placed in an antebrachial vein to administrate fluids and LPS or 0.9% NaCl. A radial artery catheter was inserted to withdraw blood and monitor blood pressure continuously. Prehydration (1.5 l of 2.5% glucose/0.45% NaCl) was administered intravenously in the hour before the challenge. Thereafter, a bolus of 2 ng kg−1 of LPS (E. coli type O113, List Biological Laboratories, lot no. 94332B1) or saline (placebo) was administered intravenously and hydration fluid (2.5% glucose/0.45% NaCl) was continued at an infusion rate of 150 ml h−1 for 8 h. During hospitalization (up to 8 h post-LPS administration), the heart rate was monitored using a four-lead electrocardiogram (M50 Monitor, Philips), core temperature was measured at 30-min intervals with a tympanic thermometer (FirstTemp Genius 2, Covidien) and LPS-induced symptoms (headache, nausea, cold shivers and muscle and back pain) were scored using a numerical six-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 5 = worst symptoms experienced ever) with the addition of 3 points in case of vomiting, resulting in a total symptom score ranging from 0 to 28.

Blood cell counts were analyzed using a Sysmex XE-5000. For cytokine determination, blood was centrifuged directly after withdrawal (10 min, 2,000g, 4 °C) and plasma was stored at −80 °C until analysis. Concentrations of TNF, IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-10, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and IL-1RN (IL-1RA) were determined in one batch using a simultaneous Luminex assay (Milliplex, Millipore) on a MagPix instrument (Luminex).

Blood from LPS-challenged healthy volunteers was phenotyped with antibodies against CD45-Cy5.5 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A62835), CD14-ECD (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. B92391), CD16-PE (BD Biosciences, cat. no. 332779), CD64-FITC (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. B49185), CD11b-PC7 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A54822), HLA-DR-APC (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. IM3635), DRAQ7 (Biostatus, cat. no. DR71000), CD192-BV421 (BD Biosciences, cat. no. 564067), CD15-KO (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. B01176) and dumpgates CD3-AA750 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A94680), CD19-APC A750 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A94681) and CD56-APC A750 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. B46024) on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) at the Department of Hematology of Radboud UMC. Monocyte subtype populations were determined using the gating strategy depicted in Extended Data Fig. 9a. We used 1:100 dilution for all antibodies used in the present study.

Classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−) were isolated from participants taking part in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration, d0) as well as at 4 h and 7 d after in vivo LPS administration. To this aim, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes (STEMCELL Technologies). All samples were kept on ice in between procedures. PBMCs were subsequently depleted from neutrophils and intermediate and nonclassic monocytes using CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hereafter, classic monocytes were positively selected using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were resuspended in culture medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX), and 1 × 105 cells were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells were incubated with culture medium or various stimuli (Pam3Cys (10 µg ml−1; InvivoGen), poly(I:C) (50 µg ml−1; InvivoGen), E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, serotype 055:B5), flagellin (10 µg ml−1, InvivoGen), resiquimod (R848, 0.35 µg ml−1, InvivoGen), heat-killed E. coli (107 per well, ATCC35218), S. aureus (107 per well, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), cat. no. 25923), P. aeruginosa (107 per well, PA01), C. albicans (106 per well, UC820) and Aspergillus fumigatus (107 per well (with 10% human pooled serum), V05-27)) for 24 h. Hereafter, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The concentrations of TNF, IL-1β, IL-1RN (IL-1RA), IL-6, IL-10 and CCL4 (MIP-1β) in supernatants of ex vivo stimulated cell cultures were determined in one batch using a simultaneous Luminex assay on a MagPix instrument (Luminex).

Pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) were isolated from participants (n = 3) in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration d0) as well as at 7 d after in vivo LPS administration. To this end, cryopreserved PBMCs (isolated as described above) were thawed, and monocytes were isolated using a human pan-monocyte isolation kit (negative selection, Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX). Subsequently, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in round-bottomed, poly(propylene) 96-well plates and incubated in the presence and absence of E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1) and/or IFNβ (250 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h, after which samples were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometry antibodies used were mouse anti-human CD45-allophyocyanin (APC)/A750, mouse anti-human CD14-APC antibody (Beckman Coulter), mouse anti-human CD16-phycoerythrin (PE)/Cy7 antibody (BD Biosciences) and mouse anti-human BST2 (CD137/Tetherin) PE (Beckman Coulter).

PBMCs were isolated from participants in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration, 0 h) and at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h and 7 d and 7 d + 4 h after in vivo LPS administration. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and CD14+ monocytes were isolated by positive selection using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Unstimulated cells were lysed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored at −80 °C until preparation for bulk RNA-seq analysis (described separately below). For ex vivo stimulation, cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum) and seeded in flat-bottomed, 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well). Cells were left to attach for 1 h, after which culture medium was refreshed and monocytes were (re)stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. After stimulation, monocytes were lysed using TRIzol and stored at −80 °C until preparation for bulk RNA-seq analysis.

PBMCs of nine healthy donors were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperatures, with brake) in SepMate-TM-50 tubes. Cells were washed with cold PBS (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, Gibco, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX) and counted on a Sysmex XN-450 (Sysmex Nederland). To obtain a pure lymphocyte fraction, PBMCs were depleted of monocytes using EasySep Human CD14 Positive Selection kit II (STEMCELL Technologies) in a 96-well, non-TC-treated, round-bottomed plate (Corning) in combination with the EasyPlate EasySep Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies). Lymphocytes were counted on a Sysmex XN-450 and brought to a concentration of 1 × 106 ml−1 in PBS for carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling using the CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lymphocytes were labeled with 500 nM CFSE for 5 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation in the dark. After incubation, ice-cold fetal bovine serum (FBS) Xtra (Capricorn Scientific) was added in a 1:1 ratio to quench any remaining dye. CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were washed once with RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 10% FBS Xtra. After washing, lymphocytes were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640, Dutch modification containing 10% bovine calf serum (BCS, Capricorn Scientific) and counted on a Sysmex XN-450. Lymphocytes were subsequently kept on ice until cryopreserved classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) obtained from participants in the experimental endotoxemia study were thawed. These classic monocytes were obtained from PBMCs isolated at baseline (before LPS administration, 0 h) and at 4 h after in vivo LPS administration, as described above. For co-culture experiments, cells were thawed and washed using pre-warmed (37 °C) complete medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 20% FBS Xtra and 100 µg ml−1 of DNase 1). Monocytes were then resuspended in ice-cold RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, containing 10% BCS and counted on Sysmex XN-450. Subsequently, 5 × 104 CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were cultured in the presence and absence of 1 × 105 monocytes (1:2 lymphocyte:monocyte ratio) in a 96-well, TC-treated, round-bottomed plate (Sarstedt). To activate lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, 5 × 104 CD3/CD28 Dynabeads were added to the wells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and lymphocyte or monocyte co-cultures were left to incubate for 3 d. Thereafter, supernatants were stored at −20 °C for analysis of TNF and IFNγ production using ELISA (R&D Systems), whereas T cell proliferation was analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter) after staining of cells with a mouse anti-human CD3-PeC7 antibody (Beckman Coulter).

Classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) of eight healthy donors were isolated as described above. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX), and 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in flat-bottomed, 96-well plates. Cells were left to attach for 1 h, after which culture medium was refreshed with culture medium supplemented with 10% human serum. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 1 ng ml−1 of LPS. After 24 h, cells were washed with warm PBS. Thereafter, cells were incubated with culture medium supplemented with 10% human serum for 5 d and this culture medium was refreshed on d3. On d6, culture medium was removed and cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence and absence of IFNβ (100, 250 and 500 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h. Afterwards, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until determination of TNF and IL-6 using ELISA (R&D Systems).

Cryopreserved classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−, isolated as described above) obtained from participants in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration, d0) and 7 d after in vivo LPS administration were thawed, washed (see above) and resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum). Subsequently, 3 × 105 monocytes were stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250 and 500 U ml−1) for 4 and 24 h in a 96-well, TC-treated, flat-bottomed plate. After 4 h, cells were stored in RLT buffer containing 40 mM dithiothreitol (QIAGEN) for future RNA isolation and, after 24 h, supernatants were stored at −80 °C until determination of TNF and IL-6 using ELISA.

Maturation experiments: classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) of six healthy donors were isolated as described above. Monocytes were subsequently incubated in RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 50% human serum for 30 min on ice to block unwanted antibody FC receptor binding. Thereafter, 2.5 × 105 monocytes were incubated for 1 h in 5-ml Falcon, poly(propylene), round-bottomed tubes (Corning) with culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum) in the presence or absence of 10 µg ml−1 of mouse anti-human IFNα/-β receptor chain 2 antibody (Merck Life Science). Next, 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ (R&D Systems) or culture medium was added and cells were incubated for 3 d, after which they were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometry antibodies used were mouse anti-human CD45-APC/A750, mouse anti-human CD14-APC antibody (Beckman Coulter) and mouse anti-human CD16-PE/Cy7 antibody (BD Biosciences).

Responsiveness to IFNβ across subsets: pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) of four healthy donors were isolated as described above. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and and 50% human serum) was added for 30 min on ice to block unwanted antibody FC receptor binding. Subsequently, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in round-bottomed, poly(propylene), 96-well plates and incubated in the presence and absence of 10 µg ml−1 of mouse anti-human IFNα/-β receptor chain 2 antibody for 1 h. Subsequently cells were incubated with or without of E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, serotype 055:B5) and IFNβ (100 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h, after which samples were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry. The flow cytometry antibodies used are described above.

Total RNA was extracted from monocytes using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN), incorporating on-column DNase I (QIAGEN) DNA digestion. Afterwards, ribosomal RNA was removed using riboZero rRNA removal kit (Illumina). The efficiency of rRNA removal was confirmed using a reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) with primers for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as internal control) and 18S and 28S rRNA. RNA molecules fragmented into ~200-bp fragments by incubating in fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris acetate, 500 mM potassium acetate and 150 mM magnesium acetate, pH 8.2) for 7.5 min at 95 °C. First-strand complementary DNA from fragmented RNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase enzyme (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol and followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis.

Gene expression libraries were prepared using KAPA HyperPrep kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, synthesized double-stranded cDNA was incubated with end repair and A-tailing buffer and enzyme initially for 30 min at 20 °C and then for 30 min at 65 °C. Library-specific adapters were ligated to tailed DNA molecules using DNA ligase enzyme by incubating for 15 min at 15 °C. Ligation reaction was cleaned up using Agencourt AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter) and subsequently amplified using ten cycles of PCR. Finally, 300-bp fragments were selected using a 2% E-gel selection system (Invitrogen). Size selection was validated with a 2100 BioAnalyzer system (Agilent). Prepared libraries were sequenced utilizing NextSeq 500 machine (Illumina) with a paired-end sequencing setup.

Raw RNA-seq reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome and gene expression profiles were quantified using STAR aligner38. Genes with <50 mapped reads on condition average were excluded from the analysis. For each comparison of RNA-seq profiles, gene expression data of corresponding samples was normalized and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the DESeq2 (ref. 39) analysis package utilizing fold-change >2 and q value (Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P (Padj) value) <0.05 as statistical significance cutoffs.

To infer significantly enriched gene ontologies (GOs) for identified gene sets of interest, such as DEGs, we used the clusterProfiler40 analysis package. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the comparison of d0 and d7 monocyte gene expression profiles was done using the fgsea41 package.

For scRNA-seq, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes, as described above, and cryopreserved at −80 °C until further processing. No depletion or selection of a specific myeloid MNC was performed and the profiling was unbiased. Single Cell Gene Expression 3ʹ v.3 (10x Genomics) was utilized following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, approximately 10,000–15,000 single cells were loaded into a channel of chromium chip and the loaded chip was inserted into the chromium controller. After generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsion and reverse transcription of RNA, cDNA amplification, fragmentation and adapter ligation were done. The quality of prepared sequencing libraries was assessed using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) or NovaSeq (Illumina).

Demultiplexing the raw BCL files was done using Cell Ranger mkfastq (v.3.1.0) software and the resulting fastq files were mapped to the human GRCh38 reference genome using Cell Ranger count software with default parameters. The output count matrix was imported to R analysis software and further analyzed using Seurat (v.4.0.4)42. Low-quality cells with mitochondrial percentage >15% or with <200 genes and <40,000 UMI (unique molecular modifier) counts were excluded from the analysis. Cells expressing multi-canonical lineage markers at the same time, such as T and B cell-specific markers, were identified as potential doublets and removed from the analysis. Afterwards, gene expression profiles were normalized to sequencing depth and scaled to 10,000 counts and log(transformed). Batch correction for interdonor differences was done utilizing the RunFastMNN function from the SeuratWrappers package, which is the R implementation of the MNN43 batch correction method. Cells were embedded on a two-dimensional view using UMAP19 and clustered using the FindClusters function from the Seurat package with a resolution of 1. Cluster- or cell-type-specific marker genes were identified using FindMarkers function from the Seurat package with default parameters. Based on well-known cell-type markers, we annotated each cluster and visualized violin plots of gene expression for several cell-type-specific markers using the stacked_violin function of the scanpy (1.9.1)44 analysis package in Python. Cell density plots were generated using the embedding_density function of the scanpy package. For lineage-specific analysis, the same steps were done by initial extract of corresponding lineage cells from the whole bone marrow dataset and further embedding and clustering. Unless specified, all figures were generated using the ggplot2 visualization package and all heatmaps were generated using pheatmap package in R.

To perform differential abundance analysis and find out significantly reduced (or induced) populations we used the miloR package45. This package uses the k-nearest neighbor graph base differential abundance analysis, taking into account the metadata from different donors for each condition. We used the suggested workflow of the miloR package for the analysis, setting the k parameter to 30 and the prop parameter to 0.1 for LPS systemic inflammation and late sepsis datasets and 0.05 for the COVID-19 dataset. In datasets with significantly different cell numbers between conditions, cell numbers were downsampled to the same number. Cells were visualized using the ggplot2 package and rasterized for visualization purposes.

To identify signaling pathways responsible for variations observed between cell types and time points, we performed single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) using the VISION46 analysis package. We utilized hallmark, GO and Reactome gene sets from molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)47. After calculation of the enrichment of each gene set for each single cell, to cluster similar gene sets into one meta-gene set we measured Pearson's correlation of different gene sets and clustered highly similar gene sets into one meta-gene set, which we defined as the signature set. Using terms in each signature set we annotated each of them. We performed the same analysis for each of the three lineages studied in this article (HSCs and myeloid cells, B cells and pDCs, and T and NK cell lineages).

To identify the underlying gene program responsible for the generation of infMonos and Tinf cells at the 4 h time point of LPS systemic inflammation experiments, we performed non-negative mature factorization (NMF) using the RunNMF function of STutility48 package with the default parameters obtaining 40 factors per gene programs. Afterwards, highly similar gene programs were clustered together, generating a meta-gene program. The identified meta-gene program highly enriched in infMonos and Tinf cells was visualized using ggplot2. The top genes contributing to each of gene programs are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The same analysis procedure was done to determine gene programs that are highly active in the intermediate and nonclassic monocyte region. Top genes contributing to NCM-enriched and IFN-I gene programs are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

Metrics details

Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile three-dimensional (3D) material platform to explore quantum phenomena and functionalities that emerge from an intricate interplay among magnetism, band structure, and electronic correlations. Here, we report the observation of a nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior and collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM) in V1/3NbS2. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify a commensurate, collinear AFM order formed by intercalated V moments. In the magnetically ordered state, the spontaneous AHE is tenfold greater than expected from empirical scaling with magnetization, and this strongly enhanced AHE arises in the NFL regime that violates the quasiparticle picture. V1/3NbS2 challenges the existing single-particle framework for understanding AHEs based on one-body Berry curvature and highlights the potential of magnetically intercalated TMDs to unveil new electronic functionalities where many-body correlations play a critical role.

The interplay between many-body correlations and topology gives rise to new material properties and functionalities, triggering massive interest extending from condensed matter physics to a broad, multidisciplinary spectrum. One versatile material family for this theme is transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)1,2,3. These materials often exhibit strongly correlated states, and their two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures open up new pathways for correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from Mott and heavy-fermion physics to quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Another groundbreaking discovery based on TMDs is the zero-magnetic field fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) engendered by topological flat bands and enhanced electron correlation in moiré heterostructures, a discovery that could produce the next great leap in quantum computing and topological quantum devices10,11,12,13.

Stepping from the 2D heterostructures to three-dimensional (3D) materials, the intercalation of transition-metal elements between van der Waals layers of bulk TMD compounds introduces magnetism and electron correlations. This offers an alternative means to tune the carrier density and engineer the band topology in TMD systems, similar to the effects of electrostatic gating applied in moiré heterostructures14,15. The magnetically intercalated TMD family has diverse magnetic structures and electronic properties15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. While the interplay between magnetic ordering and topological band structure is widely investigated, less is known about the possibility of realizing novel electronic properties driven essentially by strongly correlated electrons. Berry curvature—the intrinsic mechanism of AHE—is currently understood within effective single-particle theories of non-interacting electronic bands without considering electron correlations or many-body entanglement26,27. Thus, a realization of AHE emerging in an NFL state that defies Landau's paradigm and does not have well-defined quasiparticles may incentivize the establishment of a new framework to explain Berry-curvature-driven phenomena in strongly correlated quantum phases.

Our focus here is V1/3NbS2, which comprises magnetic V ions intercalated between parent NbS2 layers (Fig. 1a). The shifted stacking between the two neighboring V planes breaks inversion and mirror symmetries, resulting in a non-centrosymmetric chiral structure (space group: P6322) (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). The combination of structural chirality and magnetism is known as a feasible pathway toward novel electrical transport phenomena. Band filling by 3d electrons of the intercalated V is predicted to modify the electronic band structure of the parent NbS2 dramatically, with the potential of realizing topological semimetal states14. Moreover, the band structure obtained by density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT) features nearly flat bands with a substantial density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, attributed to Kondo hybridization between V-3d and Nb-4d orbitals (Fig. 1c–e). Thus, V1/3NbS2 offers unique opportunities to engineer exotic quantum phases through the mixing of spontaneous symmetry breaking, electron correlation, and non-trivial band topology.

A unit cell (solid lines) contains two V layers. The magnetic moments of V (red arrows) form the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order; they are ferromagnetically ordered within the layer and antiferromagnetically stacked along the [0001] direction. b Six domain configurations of the Γ6 collinear AFM state, α+, β+, γ+,α−, β−, γ−. The balls represent V atoms, and the arrows represent the staggered magnetic moments. The circular plot shows the orientation of the staggered moment for each domain configuration. The sign of the induced AHE is marked by  + or  − . The dashed lines mark the staggered moment directions that forbid the AHE.

Among the candidate AFM structures for V1/3NbS2, the collinear AFM is particularly intriguing20,21. Large zero-field AHE has been established in noncollinear and noncoplanar AFMs, presenting compelling new opportunities for ultrafast non-volatile information storage17,18,19,28,29,30,31,32,33. Widening the landscape of such functional AFM orders may yield broad scientific and technological impacts. Collinear AFM structures exhibiting sizable spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses (i.e., zero-field AHE), termed altermagnets34,35, have recently attracted immense interest, yet their physical realization remains elusive. Recent studies on candidate altermagnets, such as MnTe and Mn5Si3, have identified zero-field AHE36,37. However, these observations have been limited to thin films, which hampers experimental determination of the microscopic magnetic structure and crystal structure. In this work, we combine high-quality single-crystal synthesis with neutron and X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical transport measurements to demonstrate that the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 displays enhanced zero-field AHE. This constitutes the first experimental evidence for the anomalous Hall effect in a collinear antiferromagnet.

We shall first determine the magnetic structure of our V1/3NbS2 crystals through single-crystal magnetization and neutron diffraction measurements. We use a right-handed coordinate system with axes x, y, and z to respectively represent the \([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\), \([01\bar{1}0]\), and [0001] real-space directions of the hexagonal V1/3NbS2 indicated through Miller-Bravais indices. Following Ashcroft and Mermin, we use square brackets for real space and rounded brackets for reciprocal space. The set of three symmetry-related x and y directions are labeled as 〈x〉 and 〈y〉, respectively. The magnetization M measured in a small field rises abruptly upon cooling below 50 K (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6), marking a transition to AFM order with a Néel temperature TN  =  50(1) K. Further cooling reveals anisotropic magnetic properties with small ferromagnetic (FM) components arising both in the xy plane and along the z-axis: While the out-of-plane M forms a plateau between about 10 K and 40 K and develops a weak upturn below about 10 K, the in-plane M decreases with T after reaching a 30 K maximum (Fig. 2a). Magnetization isotherms M(B) measured at 2 K show a spontaneous moment of about 0.01μB/V with finite coercivity for B∥z (Fig. 2b) and about 0.04μB/V without coercivity for B⊥z (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These weak ferromagnetic moments are less than 1% of the V3+ moment size (Methods) and may correspond to sample-averaged spin canting of less than 1∘ relative to a predominantly collinear AFM order. The M-T curves differ from those reported in a previous single-crystal neutron diffraction study21. There are also considerable differences between previously published magnetization data20,21,38 indicating differences in V composition and disorder. To facilitate interpretation here we report magnetic, electrical transport, specific heat, and neutron diffraction measurements on the same crystal. This crystal has near-perfect stoichiometry and exhibits the ideal ABAB stacking of V without the ABC-type stacking fault, as discussed in the “Methods” section, Supplementary Note 8, and Supplementary Fig. 12.

a Temperature dependence of the magnetization M of V1/3NbS2 measured for B =  0.1 T applied along the x (\([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)), y (\([01\bar{1}0]\)) and z ([0001]) directions, respectively. Data obtained under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) protocols are shown using solid and open symbols, respectively. The arrow marks the transition into the AFM state at the Néel temperature TN  = 50(1) K. Inset: the inverse susceptibility (1/χ) vs. temperature T for B∥y and z, The linear fit (solid line) to the high-T data above 300 K yields a Curie-Weiss temperature θW = −70(4) K (Methods). b Isothermal magnetization M loop measured at select temperatures by sweeping the magnetic field between B  =  ±7 T aligned along the z-direction. Inset: zoomed plot showing the hysteresis loop in M that develops at low T. c Magnetic Bragg peak at Q  =  (0001). The change in line shape reflects hysteretic changes in the magnetic domain size ξ along y under up- and down-sweeps of B∥x measured at 2 K. Relative to the zero field and 8 T state, ξ is strongly reduced upon raising the field from zero to 4 T. d Peak intensity of the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak as a function of temperature. The solid line in the main panel is a fit to the power-law form \(I \sim {({T}_{{{{\rm{N}}}}}-T)}^{2\beta }+{I}_{0}\), where β is the critical exponent, and I0 is the background intensity above TN. This fit yields β =  0.363(2), TN  =  50.1(1) K, and I0  = 247(5) counts per 1500 monitor counts. Inset: a log-log plot of the magnetic peak intensity vs. the reduced temperature (TN  − T)/TN. The solid line shows power-law behavior near the critical temperature. Error bars in all neutron scattering figures represent one standard deviation.

Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify an exclusively magnetic Bragg peak that appears at Q  =  (0001) upon cooling below TN  =  50.1(1) K (Fig. 2c, d). The temperature dependence of the peak intensity follows an order-parameter-like form (Fig. 2d). Temperature-dependent Bragg scattering is also detected at Q  =  (0003) but with weaker intensity (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with the V3+ magnetic form factor. The \((11\bar{2}\ell )\) (0  <  ℓ  <  1) scan at T  =  2 K shows no extra magnetic Bragg scattering at low T (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Based on the polarization factor for unpolarized neutron diffraction, this sets an upper limit of 0.1μB/V on the ordered z-axis moment in our sample. Thus, we can rule out the possibility of the Q = (000\(\frac{1}{3}\)) noncoplanar spin configuration reported in ref. 21. The structure factor for a series of magnetic Bragg peaks in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) and \((hh\overline{2h}\ell )\) reciprocal lattice planes is best accounted for by the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR), that describes an antiferromagnetic stacking of ferromagnetic vanadium layers (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). Refinement against the Γ6 structure yields a V moment of 1.7(1) μB/V, which is comparable with the moment size of 1.5(1) μB/V reported in ref. 20 and is consistent with the expected moment size gS  =  2μB with effective spin S  =  1 and g  =  2. The local easy axis of the collinear AFM structure is identified as \(\langle 2\bar{1}\bar{1}0\rangle\) through the field dependence of the \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) magnetic Bragg peak intensity under a magnetic field applied along the perpendicular \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) (〈x〉) direction (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

To detect a potential change in the antiferromagnetic structure associated with the weak upturn in out-of-plane M for T <  10 K (Fig. 2a), we first note that there is no anomaly in the temperature-dependent intensity of the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Fig. 2d). This shows the domain averaged in plane staggered magnetization does not change at 10 K. For sensitivity to the in-plane AFM domain distribution, we turn to the \((10\bar{1}0)\) Bragg peak. Supplementary Fig. 5g, h shows there is no change in the field dependence of the \((10\bar{1}0)\) intensity around T  =  10 K. This precludes a substantial change in the magnetic structure or its easy axis at 10 K. Thus, our neutron diffraction experiments show that the Γ6 collinear AFM structure with a staggered moment lying along 〈x〉 is retained as the sample-averaged magnetic structure down to at least 2 K. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the specific heat, C(T), exhibits no noticeable anomaly around 10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8a). These findings exclude the possibility of a magnetic phase transition into a noncoplanar AFM order below 10 K. Because an out-of-plane uncompensated FM moment does not break symmetry elements of the Γ6 collinear AFM configuration (Supplementary Note 5), it must emerge concurrently with the collinear AFM order in a single phase transition, albeit potentially with a very small magnitude as indeed observed (Supplementary Note 6). However, the in-plane FM component associated with the enhanced in-plane M for T  <  50 K is incompatible with the symmetry properties of the prevailing AFM order and is likely associated with stacking faults, as detailed in the discussion section below.

Though the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 state has a vanishingly small M, it hosts a sizable spontaneous (zero-field) Hall effect. Figure 3a shows the Hall resistivity ρxy measured for B∥z. The spontaneous component of ρxy(B  =  0) appears below 10 K and grows upon cooling, reaching  ≈ 0.1 μΩcm with a clear field coercivity of  ≈200 Oe at 2 K. For T  >  10 K, the spontaneous Hall effect vanishes, and ρxy shows nearly linear field dependence without hysteresis. Correspondingly, a spontaneous Hall conductivity σxy(B  =  0) ≈  ρxy/(ρxxρyy) only appears below 10 K, where it rises to approximately 3Ω−1cm−1 at 2 K (Fig. 3b).

a Field dependence of the Hall resistivity, ρxy, obtained at various temperatures under a magnetic field B∥z for the V1/3NbS2 single-crystal exhibiting the ideal ABAB stacking. b Temperature dependence of the zero-field Hall conductivities, σxy(B  =  0) (red circles; left-axis) and σyz(B  =  0) (blue circles; right-axis), obtained under B∥z and B∥x, respectively. The current I is applied along the y-direction. Inset: The Hall resistivity ρzy obtained at T  = 32 K with B∥x and I∥y. Error bars represent uncertainties in measured data. c The scaling relation between the net magnetization M and the spontaneous Hall conductivity σH(B  =  0). The Hall conductivity σxy(B = 0) of V1/3NbS2 (solid red circles) deviates greatly from the linear scaling for conventional ferromagnets (blue-shaded region), constituting the unconventional regime (red-shaded regime) associated with known Weyl magnets. In contrast, σyz(B  =  0) for V1/3NbS2 (half-filled red circles) is linearly related to the in-plane M as in ordinary ferromagnetic materials28,29.

In ordinary ferromagnets, the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σH is proportional to M, and the ratio SH  =  σH/M is of order (0.01–0.1) V−1, constituting the conventional regime (blue shaded region in Fig. 3c)26,29. In contrast, the observed Hall conductivity σxy in V1/3NbS2, when compared to its tiny net ferromagnetic moment of  ~0.01μB/V leads to SH  ~  1 V−1 for T ≤ 10 K (solid red circles in Fig. 3c), which is well beyond the linear relation for conventional ferromagnets. Instead, the AHE in V1/3NbS2 falls in the same regime as topological magnetic materials such as the Weyl magnets Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge)28,29, Co3Sn2S239, and Co2MnGa40 (red shaded region in Fig. 3c). Note that the net magnetization, μ0M <  10−3 T, in V1/3NbS2 is about one-tenth of the value found in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge), and just 1% of that in the ferromagnetic Weyl magnet Co3Sn2S2. The deviation from the conventional scaling relation indicates that an order parameter other than the net magnetization (i.e., cluster multipoles as discussed below) characterizes the symmetry-breaking mechanism in the AFM state, and there exists a significant contribution to the Berry curvature that is independent of the net magnetization32. Moreover, with such deviation recognized as a universal signature in topological magnets32, we anticipate that the out-of-plane spontaneous AHE in V1/3NbS2 might arise from topologically non-trivial band features, though further confirmation through spectroscopic probes is required for a firm conclusion41,42,43.

The in-plane spontaneous AHE, ρzy(B =  0), differs qualitatively from the out-of-plane AHE ρxy(B  =  0) in two aspects: (1) ρzy(B  =  0) peaks near 30 K and then decreases toward zero around 10 K (Fig. 3b); (2) the corresponding zero-field Hall conductivity σyz  ≈  −ρyz/(ρyyρzz) is an order of magnitude smaller than σxy(B  =  0) and lies within the regime for ordinary ferromagnets in the scaling plot for the anomalous Hall conductivity ∣σH∣ vs. M (Fig. 3b, c). Thus, the AHE ρzy(B  =  0) can be understood as driven by the in-plane FM component within the conventional scheme.

Another striking observation in V1/3NbS2 is the emergence of pronounced NFL resistivity within the same temperature regime (T  ≲  10 K) as the disproportionately large spontaneous AHE. The zero-field longitudinal resistivity ρ (Fig. 4a) is T-linear in the paramagnetic phase between 350 K and TN. It then drops sharply for temperatures below TN, which we ascribe to a reduction in magnetic scattering. On further cooling, ρ(T) once again exhibits linear T-dependence for T  ≲  10 K (Fig. 4a, c) before settling into a T1.6(1) behavior below about 1 K for B  ≲ 1 T (Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary Fig. 7c).

The blue dashed lines are guides for the eye. The linear fit 1/A  ~  ∣B  − Bc∣ (red dashed line) provides a critical field Bc  =  1.2(2) T. Error bars in b, f represent uncertainties in the measured data.

The zero-field electronic specific heat coefficient exhibits a logarithmic increase Cel(T)/T  ~ log(T*/T) below 1.3 K, which overlaps with the onset of ρ(T) ∝  T1.6(1) (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8b). As shown in the temperature-field (T - B) phase diagram (Fig. 4b), the NFL regime characterized by T-linear resistivity extends from approximately 10 K to 2 K within the AFM phase. For B  ≲  1 T, ρ(T) does not enter a Fermi liquid (FL) regime with ρ(T)  ~  T2 even in the T  →  0 limit.

The T-linear resistivity above 2 K persists for B∥z up to 8 T (Fig. 4b, c), with its onset temperature shifting to higher values with increasing B. In contrast, the T1.6(1) NFL phase below  ~1 K is replaced by a FL with T2 resistivity for B  ≳  2 T (Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Fig. 7b). In the field-induced FL phase, the coefficient A characterizing the T2 resistivity ρ =  AT2 increases by a factor of five with decreasing B and appears to diverge near  ~1.5 T, as indicated by the linear field dependence of 1/A  ~  ∣B  −  Bc∣, with Bc  =  1.2(2) T (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 7b). Since A measures the quasi-particle effective mass m*, the divergence of A near Bc marks a quasi-particle breakdown.

The NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 recalls observations in correlated quantum materials, ranging from high-temperature superconductors, heavy fermions, to twisted bilayer systems2,9,44,45,46,47,48,49. A generic feature of these materials is the T-linear resistivity governed by a universal transport scattering rate 1/τ that obeys the Planckian limit: ℏ/τ  =  αkBT, where ℏ and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively45,46,47,48,50. Following the procedure used in refs. 46,47,48, we obtained α  = 0.7  ±  0.2 for V1/3NbS2, which is of order unity as expected for Planckian behavior (Supplementary Note 4). The Debye temperature of V1/3NbS2 is as high as  ~380 K21, and the phonon contribution to the specific heat is negligible below  ~10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8a). Thus, the observed T-linear resistivity at low temperatures cannot be attributed to conventional electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. We can also rule out extrinsic factors, such as impurity phases and chemical inhomogeneity, as the cause of the observed NFL based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction and chemical composition analysis (Methods and Supplementary Note 8). On the other hand, two unique aspects of the NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 stand out: (i) Unlike typical quantum critical systems where the NFL behavior emerges at the margin of an ordered phase, the NFL regime in V1/3NbS2 occurs well within the AFM order without tuning (i.e., zero field and ambient pressure)51,52; (ii) The low-temperature T-linear resistivity covers a broad B range with the monotonically increasing onset temperature up to 8 T (Fig. 4b). This seems to defy straightforward explanation based on proximity to a magnetic-field-tuned QCP, for which the NFL behavior is typically confined near a critical field44,45.

The symmetry properties of the underlying AFM spin texture provide an essential basis for understanding the emergence of magnetization-free spontaneous AHE. The collinear AFM state in V1/3NbS2 can be viewed as a ferroic order of cluster dotriacontapoles that belongs to the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR) (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. 10)53. The two possible spin configurations Γ6(1) and Γ6(2) shown in Supplementary Fig. 10(a) are symmetrically distinct: Γ6(1) forces the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σxy to be zero, whereas Γ6(2) allows out-of-plane spin canting and finite σxy. With the staggered moment lying along the x-axis, the observed AFM order corresponds to the Γ6(2) configuration at zero field, which breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and can exhibit a finite spontaneous AHE even with vanishing net magnetization (Supplementary Note 6). Figure 1b illustrates the six equivalent domain patterns hosted by the Γ6 collinear AFM state, α+, β+, γ+, α−, β−, γ−, where the  + and  − refer to the different signs of the AHE signal. The presence of magnetic domains is evident from the hysteric behavior observed in ρxy(B) (Fig. 3a) and in the field dependence of rocking scans through the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). An out-of-plane magnetic field B∥z can shift the balance between  + and  − domain populations (Supplementary Note 6). This effect may result in a finite spontaneous AHE, σxy(B  =  0), which aligns with the experimental observation for T  ≲ 10 K (Fig. 3a).

Aside from the unique characteristics of the collinear AFM order, our experimental findings, in combination with the DFT+DMFT calculation (Method, Supplementary Note 7), suggest that electronic correlation effects play a role in generating the novel electronic state at zero fields. The NFL behavior and signature of quasi-particle breakdown near zero fields are reminiscent of the strange metal state observed in various classes of strongly correlated materials. On the theoretical front, the DFT band structure features narrow V-3dt2g bands hybridizing with Nb-4d bands near the Fermi level EF (Supplementary Fig. 11). Taking into account the electronic interactions between V-3dt2g orbitals within the DMFT, we obtain an itinerant AFM with the local magnetic moments of approximately 1.3μB at TN  ≈  50 K, comparable to the experimental staggered moment of 1.7(1)μB observed at T  = 2 K. With increasing on-site interaction U, the DFT+DMFT calculations predict that the ground state of V1/3NbS2 can be tuned through a quantum phase transition (QPT) separating the itinerant AFM and a correlated metallic paramagnet (PM); the latter hosts heavy quasiparticles with a significant mass enhancement factor of 50– 100 due to Kondo hybridization between the V-3d and Nb-4d electrons. The low-T specific heat data above the  ~log(1/T) upturn yields a large value of the electronic specific heat coefficient γ  =  40.6(3) mJmole−1K−2, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the DFT value of 0.14 mJmole−1K−2. By assessing γ under detailed tuning of the interaction parameters, we find that the experimentally observed mass enhancement can be reproduced only when the AFM ground state lies near the AFM-PM QPT. Thus, the experiment-theory comparison suggests that the zero-field AHE appears in a setting where correlated effects and quantum fluctuations play prominent roles. An effective non-thermal tuning parameter for accessing this anticipated QPT remains to be identified, with disorder strength being a plausible candidate. Below, we elaborate further on the nature and role of disorder in V1/3NbS2.

Two of our experimental observations defy symmetry-based expectations for a single macroscopic domain of AFM order: (i) The small yet finite in-plane ferromagnetic moment observed in Mx(B)(B  =  0) and the resulting spontaneous Hall signal σyz(B  =  0) (Figs. 2a and 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) are incompatible with the symmetry of bulk Γ6 AFM order (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. 10); (ii) The out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) becomes finite at approximately 10 K (Fig. 3a) where there is no peak in the specific heat nor a thermal anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic Bragg diffraction to indicate a thermodynamic phase transition (Supplementary Fig. 8a, Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary Fig. 5g, h). This suggests that structural disorder plays a role. Refinement of a structural model of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data reveals  ~85% V occupancy on the 2d site and  ~15% V occupancy on the 2b site (Methods, Supplementary Note 5, and Supplementary Tables 1, 2). In an intercalated layered structure such as V1/3NbS2, occupational disorder typically takes the form of planar stacking faults; defect V layers interspersed within the prevailing ABAB stacking pattern. Planar defects can strongly impact Hall and magnetization measurements, which rely on macroscopic coherence. In analogy to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in multilayer magnetic thin films54, the localized DMI associated with a planar defect can introduce a local twist or phase slip in the otherwise collinear Γ6 AFM order. A low density of planar stacking faults thus might induce the unexpected Mx(B)(B  =  0) and σyz(B  = 0) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and suppress Mz and the out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) (Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a, b). We thus hypothesize that the 10 K temperature scale is associated with a planar defect-induced crossover in domain wall dynamics of an otherwise collinear AFM.

We next discuss the possible physical origin of the low-T NFL behavior. Inside an AFM phase, spin fluctuations typically cannot give rise to divergence in self-energy required for quantum criticality. Another relatively underexplored mechanism for NFL behavior is related to chiral spin texture with non-trivial topologies, such as a skyrmion lattice underlying the pressure-induced NFL behavior in MnSi55. The broad crossover around 1.3 K in ρ(T) of V1/3NbS2 and the subsequent power-law behavior ρ(T)  ∝  T1.6(1) aligns well with the MnSi case55. However, the spontaneous AHE occurring in the same T regime requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, a condition not fulfilled by magnetic skyrmion bubbles. Thus, the concurrent NFL and spontaneous AHE suggest the possibility that the aforementioned AFM domain walls represent a new type of topological nano-magnetic entity. The AFM domain structure and domain wall dynamics are expected to be sensitive to variations in the stacking order. Thus, if one can manipulate the type and strength of the V disorder, V1/3NbS2 may hold the potential to serve as a physical example demonstrating the controlled disorder-tuning of strange-metal behavior and Planckian transport, as recently proposed in ref. 50.

In summary, we identify a substantial zero-field AHE in a collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 with vanishingly small magnetization. This observation suggests that 3d band filling by V intercalants could lead to topological band features, for which spectroscopic evidence is worth pursuing. Most remarkably, this spontaneous Hall signal co-occurs with pronounced NFL behavior that defies a conventional quasi-particle description. Strong correlation effects play a vital role in the emergence of zero-field AHE inside the NFL phase, the description of which goes beyond the widely-used free fermion Berry-curvature framework. These findings showcase a promising outlook for magnetically intercalated TMDs to realize exotic electronic states characterized by a rich interplay of many-body correlations, band topology, and magnetism. Structural disorders are known to substantially influence the intrinsic quantum phases and properties of intercalated TMDs. Anticipating improved understanding and control of disorder-related effects, the unusual electronic states found in the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 could lead to electronic and spintronic functionalities that extend beyond current paradigms.

The V1/3NbS2 single crystals were synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method using iodine as the transport agent. We first obtained polycrystalline samples by heating stoichiometric amounts of high-purity vanadium (Rare metallic, 99.999%), niobium (Rare metallic 99.999%), and sulfur (Rare metallic 99.9995%) in an evacuated silica ampoule at 1000 ∘C for 24 h. This heating process was done stepwise in a controlled manner before naturally cooling the material to room temperature. We then mixed 2 g of polycrystalline powder with 0.1 g of iodine in an evacuated silica tube (20 mm inner diameter, 15 cm length). Next, this ampule was loaded in a three-zone furnace in which the hot and cold zones were kept at 1000 ∘C and 800 ∘C, respectively, for 7 days. This resulted in several plate-like and well-faceted V1/3NbS2 crystals (maximum size  ~3 mm ×  ~2 mm) at the cold zone side of the ampoule.

We determined the chemical composition of the V1/3NbS2 crystals using electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) JXA-iSP100 (JEOL). The measurements provide an average atomic percentage ratio of V:Nb:S = 9.97: 29.80: 60.23, which corresponds to a composition of V1.004Nb3S6.06.

The structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data were collected on a single crystal of 0.16  ×  0.15  ×  0.02 (mm)3 on a Bruker Kappa D8 Quest diffractometer equipped with an IμS microfocus source (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å), a HELIOS optics monochromator, and a Photon II CPAD detector. The Bruker SAINT program was used to integrate the diffraction data. Scaling and multi-scan absorption corrections were performed using SADABS. The crystal structure of V1.00Nb3S6 was solved using intrinsic phasing methods in SHELXT56 and anisotropically refined using SHELXL57. All atomic parameters were refined anisotropically. The V content was restrained to 1.00 to match the total amount determined by EPMA. The data collection and refinement parameters are presented in Supplementary Table 1, and the atomic positions are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

We further investigated the local crystal structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM-2010F instrument operated at 200 kV at the Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP), the University of Tokyo. The specimen was put on a holder that allowed a tilt angle of  ± 30∘ for the TEM observation. Selected area electron diffraction patterns were obtained using an aperture of 10 μm diameter, being ca.125 nm in real space, and recorded using an imaging plate. Specimen for the TEM observation was initially prepared using a JEOL Ion-Slicer, but since it was altered during processing, a powder sample obtained by crushing the single crystal in an agate mortar was used instead. The powder was diffused into a solvent and dropped onto a microgrid together with the solvent to prepare an observation sample for TEM. The TEM results shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 confirm the non-centrosymmetric P6322 space group with (√3 × √3) V ordering at room temperature.

The behavior of bulk magnetization reported across existing studies on V1/3NbS2 reveals notable sample dependence20,21. To ensure consistency, we report the magnetic properties of the same crystal used for measuring electrical transport and specific heat, which is stoichiometric to within 1%, as mentioned above, and exhibits ABAB stacking (Supplementary Note 8). The magnetization data shown in Fig. 2a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 2a were obtained on oriented samples using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) under both zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions. The ZFC data were obtained by cooling the sample from 300 K to 2 K at zero field. A magnetic field of 0.1 T was then applied, and measurements of the magnetization were conducted while warming the sample to 400 K. Maintaining the B  = 0.1 T magnetic field, the sample was then cooled to base temperature. The FC M(T) data were subsequently acquired while warming the sample to 400 K. To obtain the isothermal magnetization M(H) curves, we first cooled the sample in zero field from T  =  300 K to the target temperatures. We then measured M(H) while scanning the magnetic field between  ±7 T. The magnetic susceptibility measured at a magnetic field B  = 0.1 T exhibits nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2a, inset. The inverse susceptibility, 1/χ, is linear in the temperature range between 300 K and 400 K, yielding a Curie-Weiss temperature θW = −70(4) K and an effective moment per V atoms μeff  = 2.9(1) μB for both the in-plane and out-of-plane field directions. The negative sign of θW indicates antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state, and the fitting parameter of μeff  = 2.9(1)μB is close to the value of \(g\sqrt{S\cdot (S+1)}{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}=2.83{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}\) expected for a V3+ ion with a spin-only local moment where g =  2 and S  =  1. This result is consistent with previous reports21,58.

Zero-field specific heat measurements down to 2 K were carried out using a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) through the relaxation method. The corresponding data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a. The low-T specific heat data shown in Supplementary Fig. 8b were acquired using the quasi-adiabatic method at the International Megagauss Science Laboratory of ISSP. Details of this technique are described in ref. 59. Each data point in the measurement was obtained within a short timescale of  ~5 ms under a 0.1 ms heat pulse, as shown in the inset of Supplementary Fig. 8b.

The longitudinal and Hall resistivities were measured in six-point geometry. Crystals were polished into bar shapes, with their long edge parallel to the in-plane x and y directions, respectively. Electrical contacts to the crystals were made by attaching 20 μm gold wires with silver epoxy. Measurements in the temperature range of 2 K–400 K were performed using the DC option of the PPMS system (Quantum Design). The resistivity data in the 0.1 K–4 K temperature range were obtained using a dilution refrigerator (Kelvinox 25, Oxford Instruments) and the AC method with an excitation current of 0.1 mA. The Hall contribution to the resistance and vice versa were extracted by subtracting and adding the resistance of positive and negative field scans, respectively.

A 20 mg plate-like single crystal with the z-axis perpendicular to the surface was used for neutron diffraction experiments. The experiment was performed on the triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)60. The sample was mounted on an aluminum sample holder with the [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction (〈x〉-axis) vertical and perpendicular to the horizontal scattering plane of the instrument for observing scattering signals in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane. All measurements were performed with a fixed final neutron energy of 14.7 meV, filtered through 25 mm pyrolytic graphite (PG) before the saggital focusing PG (002) monochromator and an additional 25 mm thick PG filter between the sample and the PG (002) analyzer. To determine the magnetic structure we used open-50'-50'-120' collimation and conducted rocking scans on the accessible magnetic and nuclear Bragg peaks. We inferred the fully Q-integrated intensity of Bragg peaks from rocking scans using Reslib. Specialized software was developed for the subsequent structural refinement to account for the resolution effect. A comparison between the calculated and observed structure factor is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a–c. The magnetic Bragg peaks detected in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane contain contributions from two out of three magnetic domains, which were taken into account in the analysis. The experimental moment size is within 15% of the spin-only value (see main text), confirming the assumption of a uniform distribution of domain size.

To investigate the field dependence of the magnetic structure, we conducted rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) and (0001) at the base temperature of 2 K with a magnetic field between 0 and 8 T applied along the vertical [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction. To achieve sensitivity to the magnetic correlation length/domain size, we used tight collimation around the sample for these measurements: Open-10'-10'-120'. Rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) are sensitive to the correlation length along the c-axis, which was found to exceed 800 nm for all field values (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Rocking scans at Q  =  (0001) are sensitive to the in-plane correlation length along the \([10\bar{1}0]\,\langle y\rangle\)-direction, which shows strong field dependence (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The contrast between the in-plane and out-of-plane correlation length indicates the formation of magnetic field tunable domains extending in the z-direction, which survive up to a field of 8 T applied along [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] (〈x〉). This is evident from the hysteresis observed in the field dependence of the y-axis correlation length (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The observed asymmetry in the hysteresis can be attributed to the hysteresis occurring only within a specific range of the applied magnetic field. In the negative field sweep, the applied field strength was not high enough to fully polarize the magnetic domains. This results in partial polarization, creating a minor loop.

To look for changes in the antiferromagnetic structure upon cooling below 10 K where a small c-oriented magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect appears, we examined the temperature and field dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak. These data were acquired using 14.7 meV neutrons on the EIGER triple-axis spectrometer at the Swiss spallation neutron source SINQ, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland. The magnetic diffraction intensity is proportional to the sum squared staggered magnetization along the perpendicular \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) and [0001] directions. With a field applied along the vertical \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) direction, there is thus sensitivity to the in-plane domain distribution. Though data marked with blue symbols have lower counting statistics, Supplementary Fig. 5g shows the field dependence of the overall domain fraction is indistinguishable above (blue symbols, 12 K) and below (red symbols, 1.5 K) 10 K. Supplementary Fig. 5h shows the temperature dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak intensity in the presence of a 2 T magnetic field along \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\), which disfavors domains with staggered magnetization along that direction. The temperature dependence is indistinguishable from that acquired in zero fields at the (0001) peak, where all domains contribute equally to the scattering. These data show the magnetic structure of V1/3NbS2 is virtually unchanged across 10 K. We propose that the appearance of a zero-field Hall response and remnant magnetization along the c-axis for T  <  10 K results from a subtle change in domain wall dynamics at this temperature.

The line shape and integrated intensity of a rocking scan is affected by all components of the resolution function, including the out-of-plane resolution. To account for these effects, we assume an infinite correlation length along the c-axis and adopt the following isotropic form for the in-plane correlation function:

The corresponding Bragg peak profile can be obtained analytically by Fourier transformation and the result is isotropic in 2D in-plane q-space:

where I0001 is the integrated peak intensity at Q = (0001).

The experimental peak profile is obtained via convolution with the resolution function defined as:

Here q0 = (q0,z, q0,y, ℏω0, q0,x) is the instrument-targeted energy and wave-vector transfer for each point in the rocking scan passing through Q = (0001).

Reflecting the mirror symmetry of the instrument about the horizontal plane, the structure of M allows us to complete the integration over x:

Here q∥ is the wave-vector within the scattering plane (yz plane). R0001 is the Gaussian resolution function at Q  = (0001). \(U(a,b,z)=1/\Gamma (a)\int_{0}^{+\infty }{e}^{-zt}{t}^{a-1}{(1+t)}^{b-a-1}dt\) refers to the confluent hypergeometric function61. The delta function within the peak profile and condition of rocking scans q0,x  =  0, q0,z ≈ 0 was applied from the first line to the second line of Eq. (4).

The qy integrated intensity is thus given by

This one dimensional integral can readily be evaluated through numerical integration. To duly account for the field dependent correlation length κ, Iob,0001 was used to convert the measured (0001) rocking scan integrated intensity into a full integrated intensity measure of the total coherent staggered magnetization.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed by the ab initio code OpenMX. The generalized gradient approximations (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) were adopted for the exchange-correlation potential. An 8 × 8 × 4 k-point grid was used for the calculation. We employed the valence orbital sets V6.0-s3p3d2, Nb7.0-s3p2d2, and S7.0-s3p3d2f1, and set a cutoff energy of 150 Ry for the numerical integrations. The Wannier functions of the t2g vanadium orbitals and the \({d}_{{z}^{2}}\), \({d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\), and dxy niobium orbitals were constructed from an outer energy window of [−5 eV: 5 eV].

The dynamical mean-field (DMFT) calculation was performed with the finite-temperature exact diagonalization solver, where the dynamical mean field was represented by six bath sites. We chose a reasonable value of the intra-orbital Coulomb interaction U  =  3 eV and Hund's coupling J  =  0.5 eV for V-t2g orbitals; the inter-orbital Coulomb interaction was determined by \(U{\prime}=U-2J\). For the double-counting correction, we subtracted the self-energy in the high-frequency limit of the paramagnetic solution, which corresponds to a static mean-field value with inter-orbital components. The spectral function was obtained with 10 meV energy smearing.

No mention of the flagship Ryzen Threadripper 9995WX, though

Several new Ryzen 9000 Threadripper CPUs have been spotted at trade data aggregator NBD.ltd, thanks to Everest at X. These entries include 64-core, 16-core, and 12-core models, which are reportedly actively being shipped to different facilities, likely for validation and testing. This development does not indicate an imminent launch but rather suggests these CPUs are likely in their final development stages. It's best to approach this leak with some skepticism. Either way, we're still missing a few models, but every leak adds another piece to the Threadripper puzzle.

The Ryzen 9000 Threadripper family, codenamed "Shimada Peak", is set to be built using AMD's latest Zen 5 microarchitecture. As the core and cache configuration per CCD remains consistent with Zen 4, we can infer the flagship will offer up to 96 cores / 192 threads (12 CCDs). This would also mean a total of 384MB of L3 cache (32MB per CCD) and 96MB of L2 cache (1MB per core). There's a usual one-year cadence between AMD's desktop/server and HEDT/workstation counterparts, so Shimada Peak might be set for a reveal at Computex or later in the second half of 2025.

The leaked CPUs we're looking at today are the Threadripper 9985WX with 64 cores, the Threadripper 9955WX with 16 cores, and the Threadripper 9945WX with 12 cores. There is no mention of the premier Ryzen Threadripper 9995WX with (expected) 96 cores, but we'll keep our eyes peeled in the future.

One might find it surprising to see that AMD is offering consumer-level core counts with its top-tier Threadripper family. But this is not new, as similar options have existed in the past as well. These models provide access to high PCIe lane counts, plenty of memory channels, along with enterprise management options, for users who don't need much CPU throughput (like AI), without breaking the bank. You also get the advantage of higher boost clocks; we can see a 200 MHz delta between the existing 7945WX and 7995WX options.

These lower-cost models also make more sense once you factor in the fact that most commercial licenses are billed on a per-core basis.

Like their predecessors, the new 12-core 9945WX and the already leaked 24-core 9965WX are likely to utilize CCDs with several cores disabled (6-active out of 8-total), which can introduce interlink latencies. In this case, the 9965WX might be slower than a theoretical three-CCD option with all eight cores intact.

In terms of compatibility, these products should be drop-in replacements for AMD's in-vogue sTR5-based motherboards. Even though the documents mention SP6, they're likely referring to sTR5: a physically similar but electrically distinct derivative of SP6 featuring 4,844 landing pads. We can expect to hear more about these processors at Computex or later this year.

Humans have found it hard to quit fossil fuels, which is why some argue that we'll soon need to start geoengineering — that is, modifying the atmosphere to prevent catastrophic warming of the planet.

The practice is controversial. Some argue it's the only solution given that we've waited too long to reduce carbon emissions. Others say we shouldn't be running two uncontrolled experiments on the Earth's climate (the first being the global burning of fossil fuels).

That hasn't stopped people from trying. And one approach championed by Make Sunsets has drawn the attention of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

The startup is basically two guys from Silicon Valley who have been releasing weather balloons filled with hydrogen gas and sulfur dioxide particles. When the balloon floats somewhere past 66,000 feet in altitude, it bursts and releases the sulfur dioxide particles, which scatter and reflect sunlight, cooling the Earth a tiny bit. 

The company sells “cooling credits” based on how much estimated warming each balloon release negates. Make Sunsets has raised $750,000, according to PitchBook, and the startup says its investors include Boost VC, Draper Associates, and Pioneer Fund.

Neither founder is a scientist, but the science behind sulfur dioxide and solar reflectivity is sound. Humans accidentally proved the importance of sulfur dioxide in global albedo — the average reflectivity of the Earth's surface — when they slashed the sulfur content of marine shipping fuels in 2020; one prominent climate scientist has argued in favor of the practice.

Still, given the complexity of the global climate, it's not clear what other effects the practice might have. It might seed rainstorms in one region while depriving other areas of rain. Several scientists have urged caution. 

Plus, if sulfur dioxide particles drift closer to ground, they could aggravate people's asthma and cause other respiratory problems. Here, the EPA takes issue with Make Sunsets' approach to geoengineering. Sulfur dioxide is regulated as an air pollutant. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said this week that the agency is investigating the company.

Make Sunsets argues its actions are legal. In an FAQ on its website, the company says, “Yes, our method to cool Earth falls under the Weather Modification Act of 1976 and report yearly to NOAA of our deployments as required.” 

The law is fuzzy here, though. When it was written, the Weather Modification Act was likely intended to cover the practice of cloud seeding, in which particles like silver iodide are shot into clouds to induce rain or snowfall. Most weather modification today is done by entities like ski resorts and irrigation districts in the West. It's not clear how the law applies to climate modification.

Still, while the EPA might be justified in its investigation, it isn't exactly consistent with Zeldin's approach to pollution. 

The agency's efforts to boost coal are likely to generate far more sulfur dioxide pollution than Make Sunsets will release with its balloons. A Make Sunsets balloon released on November 15, 2024, released 1,715 grams of sulfur dioxide. In 2023, U.S. power plants released 650,000 tons into the atmosphere, the majority of which came from coal. That's approximately the same amount as 343,900,000 of the startup's balloons.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is paying software company Palantir $30 million to provide the agency with “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the United States, according to a contract justification published in a federal register on Thursday. The tool would also help ICE choose who to deport, giving special priority to “visa overstays,” the document shows.

Palantir has been an ICE contractor since 2011, but the document published Thursday indicates that Palantir wants to provide brand-new capabilities to ICE. The agency currently does not have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportation in near real-time. The agency does have a tool for tracking self-reported deportations, but Thursday's document, which was first reported by Business Insider, does not say to what degree this new tool may rely on self-reported data. ICE also has “insufficient technology” to detect people overstaying their visas, according to the Department of Homeland Security. This is particularly due to challenges in collecting "biographic and biometric" data from departing travelers, especially if they leave over land, according to Customs and Border Protection.

The agency says in the document that these new capabilities will be under a wholly new platform called the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS. Palantir is expected to provide a prototype of ImmigrationOS by September 25, 2025, and the contract is scheduled to last at least through September 2027. ICE's update to the contract comes as the Trump administration is demanding that thousands of immigrants “self-deport,” or leave the US voluntarily.

ICE and Palantir did not respond for comment.

According to the document, ImmigrationOS is intended to have three core functions. Its “Targeting and Enforcement Prioritization” capability would streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens.” People prioritized for removal, ICE says, should be “violent criminals,” gang members, and “visa overstays.”

Its “Self-Deportation Tracking” function would have “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deporation,” the document says. The document does not say what data Palantir would use for such a system, but ICE says it aims to “accurately report metrics of alien departures from the United States.” The agency stipulates that this tool should also integrate with “enforcement prioritization systems to inform policy” but does not elaborate on these systems or policies.

Meanwhile, the “Immigration Lifecycle Process” function would streamline the “identification” of aliens and their “removal” from the United States, with the goal of making "deportation logistics” more efficient.

In a “rationale” section, ICE claims that it has an “urgent and compelling” need for ImmigrationOS's capabilities. Without them, ICE claims, it would be “severely” limited in its ability to target the gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, and abide by President Donald Trump's executive order to expedite deportations.

Palantir, ICE claims, is “the only source that can provide the required capabilities and prototype of ImmogrationOS [sic] without causing unacceptable delays.” ICE says the company has developed “deep institutional knowledge of the agency's operations over more than a decade of support.”

“No other vendor could meet these timeframes of having the infrastructure in place to meet this urgent requirement and deliver a prototype in less than six months,” ICE says in the document.

ICE's document does not specify the data sources Palantir would pull from to power ImmigrationOS. However, it says that Palantir could “configure” the case management system that it has provided to ICE since 2014.

Palantir has done work at various other government agencies as early as 2007. Aside from ICE, it has worked with the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Internal Revenue Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. As reported by WIRED, Palantir is currently helping Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) build a brand-new “mega API” at the IRS that could search for records across all the different databases that the agency maintains.

Last week, 404 Media reported that a recent version of Palantir's case-management system for ICE allows agents to search for people based on “hundreds of different, highly specific categories,” including how a person entered the country, their current legal status, and their country of origin. It also includes a person's hair and eye color, whether they have scars or tattoos, and their license-plate reader data, which would provide detailed location data about where that person travels by car.

These functionalities have been mentioned in a government privacy assessment published in 2016, and it's not clear what new information may have been integrated into the case management system over the past four years.

This week's $30 million award is an addition to an existing Palantir contract penned in 2022, originally worth about $17 million, for work on ICE's case management system. The agency has increased the value of the contract five times prior to this month; the largest was a $19 million increase in September 2023.

The contract's ImmigrationOS update was first documented on April 11 in a government-run database tracking federal spending. The entry had a 248-character description of the change. The five-page document ICE published Thursday, meanwhile, has a more detailed description of Palantir's expected services for the agency.

The contract update comes as the Trump administration deputizes ICE and other government agencies to drastically escalate the tactics and scale of deportations from the US. In recent weeks, immigration authorities have arrested and detained people with student visas and green cards, and deported at least 238 people to a brutal megaprison in El Salvador, some of whom have not been able to speak with a lawyer or have due process.

As part of its efforts to push people to self-deport, DHS in late March revoked the temporary parole of more than half a million people and demanded that they self-deport in about a month, despite having been granted authorization to live in the US after fleeing dangerous or unstable situations in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela under the so-called “CHNV parole programs.”

Last week, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people as dead, a tactic meant to end their financial lives. DHS, meanwhile, sent emails to an unknown number of people declaring that their parole had been revoked and demanding that they self-deport. Several US citizens, including immigration attorneys, received the email.

On Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's move to revoke people's authorization to live in the US under the CHNV programs. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the judge's ruling “rogue.”

Nintendo announced on Friday that it will open Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. on April 24, following a delay due to the Trump administration's hefty tariffs.

Fans feared the long-awaited console would spike in price due to Trump's export rules on international goods, but Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2 will still cost $449.99 and come out on June 5, as originally announced.

Switch 2 accessories, however, will increase in price due to “changes in market conditions,” Nintendo said in a press release. The company added that other products could also face hikes down the road.

Most of the Switch 2 accessories seem to be getting a $5 price bump. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, which was initially set to cost $79.99, will now cost $84.99. Joy-Cons will cost $94.99, up from $89.99, and the new Switch 2 camera attachment will cost $54.99, up from $49.99.

As far as games go, Nintendo isn't changing the prices of the digital and physical versions of two launch-day heavy-hitters, Mario Kart World ($79.99) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($69.99). 

“We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing,” Nintendo wrote in the release.

Though the changing prices of accessories may concern some customers, they won't find reprieve from other gaming companies. Earlier this week, Sony announced that it would bump PlayStation 5 prices in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand due to shifts in the global economy. Fans expect that similar price adjustments will hit the U.S. eventually, too.

Certain electronics, like smartphones and laptops, are exempted from Trump's tariffs, but not video game consoles.

Nvidia giveth speed, but taketh stability (though the previous take was much larger).

The latest addition to the Nvidia R570 branch of GPU drivers, 576.02, has resolved many stability problems troubling RTX GPUs for the past three months, including crashes and black screens.

Adding to the mix is increased synthetic performance, as reported by ComputerBase, whose data suggests an up to 8% performance bump in 3DMark Steel Nomad. Alas, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, as it appears a new set of stability woes has surfaced with these new drivers, as indicated by user reports.

It is important to understand that improved synthetic performance might not directly reflect real-world tests, such as games and content creation. Either way, with the onset of enablement drivers (R570) for the RTX 50 series in February, a wide range of stability problems affected nearly all RTX GPUs. I personally had to roll back to an older 566.xx release to get RTX HDR working properly. Fast forward to March, and back-to-back hotfixes ironed out most of these quirks for Blackwell.

RTX 40 and RTX 30 GPUs, still plagued by crashes linked with G-Sync and Frame Generation, had to hold out until the latest 576.02 release that is said to fix most of these problems. ComputerBase did some testing and revealed that these drivers also deliver better synthetic performance on RTX 50 GPUs. This is further backed by several user reports at r/Nvidia, though the numbers could vary.

We're looking at uplifts ranging between 6%-8%, depending on the GPU in 3DMark's Steel Nomad benchmark. The most notable performance shifts can be observed with the RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080, while the RTX 5090 remains largely unchanged.



We won't say no to free performance, but user reports still indicate lingering game crashes, black screen issues, stuttering, and other anomalies across the RTX GPU stack. Some of the mentioned game titles include Monster Hunter Wilds, FFVII Rebirth, and Black Myth Wukong, just to name a few. That's to say, there have been mentions of increased gaming performance with several games, so it's hard to draw a decisive conclusion.

The general consensus is that you should update to the latest drivers. In case you face any stability problems, try downgrading to the 572.xx release or 566.xx, but this comes with the trade-off of losing access to certain features.

Nintendo will open pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the United States on April 24, the company announced today. The prices will remain unchanged, with the system starting at $449.99 and a bundle with Mario Kart World for $499.99.US-based pre-orders were delayed shortly after the console's initial announcement "to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." Some Switch 2 accessory prices are going to get pricier. A pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers that was originally set at $89.99 will now be $94.99 and the Pro Controller has bumped from $79.99 to $84.99. The Switch 2 camera, dock set, wheel set, and charging grips are all also seeing increases."Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," Nintendo's announcement reads.The system is still set to launch on June 5.Pre-orders were originally set for April 9, but were delayed as Nintendo dealt with the fact that it announced the system on the same day as President Donald Trump announced a sweeping series of tariffs. On April 9, Trump called for a 90-day pause in many tariffs (with the exception of an increase on tariffs on Chinese goods).Nintendo's titles, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Banaza (launching July 17) are not set to see price changes. They're currently listed at $79.99 and $69.99, respectively.The Switch 2 features a number of improvements over the original system, including a larger display with HDR support, a second USB Type-C port, and a more powerful graphics chip from Nvidia.The $449.99 price tag is quite a bit more than the original Nintendo Switch, which. launched at $299.99, leading some fans to fill Nintendo's streams with calls to "drop the price."Nintendo's announcement included an apology for the delay, and that the company "hope[s] this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing."

Reclaiming minerals could help reduce dependence on China, reduce greenhouse gases by 95%.

While most people enjoy PCs that are powered by SSDs, mechanical hard drives are still king in the datacenter. When these drives reach the end of their useful lives, they are usually shredded, and the key materials they're made of – including several rare earth elements (REE) – end up as e-waste.

At the same time, countries are mining these same materials and emitting a lot of greenhouse gases in the process. And China, a major source of REE, recently announced export restrictions on seven of them, potentially limiting the U.S. tech industry's access to materials such as dysprosium, which is necessary for magnetic storage, motors, and generators.

Yesterday, Western Digital announced that it has created a large-scale hard disk drive recycling program in concert with Microsoft and recycling-industry partners CMR (Critical Materials Recycling) and PedalPoint Recycling. The new process reclaims Rare Earth Oxides (REO) containing dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium from hard drives, along with aluminum, steel, gold, palladium, and copper. The REO reclamation takes place completely within the U.S. and those materials go back into the U.S. market.

Dubbed the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, WD's initiative has already saved 47,000 pounds worth of hard drives, SSDs, and caddies from landfills or less-effective recycling programs. WD was able to achieve a more than 90% reclaim rate for REE and an 80% rate for all of the shredded material.

The drives came from Microsoft's U.S. data centers where they were first shredded and then sent to PedalPoint for sorting and processing. Magnets and steel were then sent to CMR, which uses its acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) technology to extract the rare earth elements.



CMR's ADR process uses a copper salt solution to create a selective leaching that produces 99.5 percent pure REO. The company avoids harsh chemicals that would damage the REO or adjacent materials such as aluminum.

The reclaimed rare earth elements can then be sold back into the U.S. supply system where they can be used to manufacture new tech products. According to WD's whitepaper, the reclaiming process produces 95 percent fewer greenhouse gases than virgin mining of the same materials.

If done at a large scale, the reclaimed materials could take the place of some of the materials the U.S. sources from China. However, of the seven materials China is restricting – samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium – only dysprosium is commonly found in hard drives.

“HDDs are vital to our data center infrastructure, and advancing a circular supply chain is a core focus for Microsoft,” Chuck Graham, Microsoft CVP, Cloud Sourcing, Supply Chain, Sustainability, and Security said in a press release.

To get their recycling program up and running, WD and its partners went through 18 months of testing, with the initial study period beginning in 2023 and ending in December 2024 Now the company is working with more partners.

"Western Digital is currently expanding the HDD rare earth material capture program based on the successful pilot with Microsoft," Jackie Jung, WD's VP of Global Operations Strategy and Corporate Sustainability told Tom's Hardware. "This program is now in development with a number of our hyperscale customers."

The potential need for hard drive recycling is huge and growing. According to the Financial Times, there were 23,000 data centers with 70 million servers as of 2022. Each of these servers has multiple hard drives which reach their end of life, often after just three to five years. The amount of e-waste overall is expected to reach 75 million tons by 2030.

The B580's biggest weakness is older CPUs.

The Intel Arc B580 is considered the cheapest modern GPU on the market today, with Tom's Hardware considering it the $249 GPU champion. However, several reviewers discovered that the budget GPU performs poorly on older processors. Intel has acknowledged the issue and will investigate it.

A moderator on the Intel Community forum started an Intel Arc Graphics and CPU Overhead thread, saying, “Thank you for your patience. We are aware of reports of performance sensitivity in some games when paired with older generation processors. We have increased our platform coverage to include more configurations in our validation process, and we are continuing to investigate optimizations.”

Reviewers first noticed the issue in early January, when they tested the Intel Arc B580 on older and newer CPUs. For example, Hardware Unboxed ran some gaming benchmarks with the GPU using an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and a Ryzen 5 2600. It also used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 as a control, and these are its results.

The Intel Arc B580 performs decently enough when paired with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with the RTX 4060 outperforming it by around 10% on average. However, the performance gap between the two entry-level desktop GPUs widens when paired with the much older Ryzen 5 2600. The RTX 4060 now gets a 22% advantage over the Intel graphics card, with some games returning an unplayable 30 FPS or lower. Note that this doesn't include 1% low numbers, which are much worse for the B580.

Hopefully, Intel can find a fix for this issue sooner rather than later, mainly as it affects the core market of the Intel Arc B580 — budget gamers. You might think that buying the B580 to replace your old GTX 1060, which was still the most popular GPU on Steam as late as 2022, will finally let you play some newer games. But you might be disappointed with this overhead issue, as it will preclude you from playing some game titles without upgrading your CPU.

This might not be too big of a problem if you already have an AM4 motherboard, especially as AMD is still releasing new chips for this socket in 2025. But if you have an AM3+ or older motherboard (or older Intel chips), you'll likely need to spend on a new CPU and motherboard, increasing the cost of upgrading your system to play the latest titles. And with tariffs jacking up prices everywhere, this might mean you cannot afford to play newer games at all.

The Food and Drug Administration has suspended quality control tests for a vital food safety program and is planning to end virtually all routine food safety inspections, according to a pair of reports from Reuters and CBS News. On top of that, NBC News has learned the FDA refused to publicize a recent E. coli outbreak in lettuce that ripped through 15 states. And it's all just the latest batch of bad news for essential government programs courtesy of President Donald Trump and his dipshit conspiracy theorist at the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

First up, the FDA is suspending quality control testing at the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Proficiency Testing Program, according to a report from Reuters. The program tests for parasites like Cyclospora in spinach and the pesticide glyphosate in barley, among other foods. The suspension was announced internally at the FDA on Tuesday, according to Reuters, which cites an email distributed about staff leaving. The program oversees testing at about 170 labs, which will no longer get quality control checks through at least Sept. 30.

The changes to FERN are a direct result of staffing cuts at the HHS, which oversees agencies like the FDA and CDC. Kennedy is overseeing a reduction in force at the agency that's seeing about 20,000 people leave through layoffs and departures.

Second, and perhaps even more troubling, is a report from CBS News that the FDA is currently making plans to end most food safety inspections at the federal level. The theory, if you can call it that, is that food safety is something that should only be done at the local level, and you don't want federal inspectors to just “duplicate” work already done by states.

The plan hasn't been implemented yet, and CBS notes that it's not clear whether the move would be lawful. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections to dozens of states, and the assumption would be an attempt to do that at a much broader scale. CBS News quotes some former workers at FDA who say some “higher-risk” inspections, like baby formula, would probably still be overseen by the feds if Trump and Kennedy went through with the plan.

Third, the FDA closed an investigation into E. coli in romaine lettuce without notifying the public, according to NBC News. The outbreak sickened dozens of people across 15 states and caused some to suffer severe illness, including a 9-year-old boy in Indiana who went into kidney failure. But the FDA didn't notify the public because it assessed that the threat had passed, according to the news outlet.

It's unclear to what extent Trump and Kennedy know what's going on at the FDA, given their ignorance of so many things happening under them right now. Kennedy recently suggested he didn't even know what was being cut at the federal agency when asked about specifics on CBS News. Over $11 billion has been slashed, and Kennedy didn't seem to have a firm grasp on any of it. Possibly because Elon Musk's DOGE is rampaging through government agencies, making cuts without any adults in the room.

But this is where we're at with guys like Trump and Kennedy in charge. They're destroying the U.S. federal government and purging the federal workforce, all while making it much less safe to eat or drink anything in this country. And things are likely to get so much worse, as we slowly learn about new things that get cut, like the CDC's system for tracking things like injuries from drugs and car accidents.

FDA didn't respond to questions emailed on Thursday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back.

It turns out that Silicon Valley's tech bros can't take a joke. Comedian Seth Rogen found this out the hard way this month, when he presented at an awards ceremony for scientific innovation, the Breakthrough Prize, which annually doles out awards of dubious merit to various members of the field's gilded class. Rogan's attempt at a light roast directed at the well-heeled audience, which included the likes of Google co-founder Sergei Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, did not go over well.

Rogen reportedly went off script when he took some shots at the tech bros in attendance who had contributed to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The Hollywood Reporter reports that Rogen said the following: “And it's amazing that others [who have been] in this room underwrote electing a man who, in the last week, single-handedly destroyed all of American science,” Rogen said. “It's amazing how much good science you can destroy with $320 million and RFK Jr, very fast,” the comedian said. THR notes that Edward Norton, who was presenting alongside Rogen, was visibly “uncomfortable.”

The audience of wealthy tech magnates was not impressed. The comedian's “ad-lib landed with a thud,” THR writes, and only received light applause. Worse still, the foundation that hosted the event proceeded to edit Rogen's jokes out of the video that would be posted online a week later. From the report:

Those watching the event on YouTube a week later, though, wouldn't have a clue about Rogen's pointed barbs. The so-called “full video” was subtly edited to make it seem as if Norton's “light applause” comment was a reference to his entrance with Rogen. The stream also cut out a throw-away joke Rogen made a few minutes later in describing the work of the physics prize winner, Gerardus ‘t Hooft of the University of Utrecht. Using the metaphor of a wheel to illustrate the concept of symmetry, Rogen said the wheel could roll either left or right — and quipped that the crowd would “roll right,” according to a source in the audience.

Gizmodo reached out to the Breakthrough Prize Foundation for more information about why they felt this was necessary. In a statement to THR, the foundation said: “This year's ceremony lasted longer than the prior few years, and several edits were made in order to meet the originally planned run time.” It should be noted that the YouTube video in question is quite long, at 139 minutes, but apparently not long enough to include another 30 seconds' worth of material.

Any of the tech dipshits in the audience who supported Trump's presidency very much deserved this. Under Kennedy, the Department of Health and Human Services has gutted federal grants for science research at universities across the country, while also firing droves of officials from critical health agencies like the FDA, the NIH, and the CDC. In the meantime, Kennedy is focused on commissioning a highly questionable study to help determine what can already be considered settled scientific ground: whether vaccines cause autism or not (they don't). Critics maintain Kennedy's changes will derail important scientific and medical research, while potentially putting Americans' lives at risk.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to buy a premium MacBook Air, Amazon's current deal on the 2022 MacBook Air (M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage) is almost too good to be true. At $799 down from $1,119, this great model is now available for 33% off its original price point. It's a discount that brings it to nearly its lowest price ever for this configuration. Such a steep decline on an Apple device is very rare.

See at Amazon

The 2022 MacBook Air introduced the M2 chip and new case design that is almost identical to the latest MacBook Pro line. This model boasts a stunning 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with more than 500 nits of brightness and a billion colors for vibrant images and stunning detail for creative work, watching movies, and everything in between. The all-aluminum unibody looks sleek and contemporary but it is also extremely resilient over the years.

The M2 chip comes with an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, and it is coupled with 8GB unified memory (RAM) and a fast 512GB SSD for the model on sale at Amazon. Together, the set of components delivers more than sufficient performance for the run-of-the-mill user as well as even the heaviest of multitaskers. Browsing dozens of tabs, tweaking pictures and holding video calls—daily habits of ours—all seem fast and effortless due to the high memory bandwidth and design of the chip.

Although Apple has now launched the M3/M4 chips, the M2 remains extremely up to date and powerful for the vast majority of users. For general use—web browsing, office work, streaming, and basic creative pursuits—there is not much functional difference between the M2 and newer chips. The M2's efficiency also yields up to 18 hours of battery life on a single charge so you can play or work all day and not worry about looking for an outlet.

This MacBook Air's appearance is virtually indistinguishable from Apple's latest models with an ultra-slim and lightweight (2.7 pounds) design that is very portable for students or business travelers. The 1080p FaceTime HD camera, three-mic array, and four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio make you look and sound fantastic on calls. Connectivity is also well addressed with a MagSafe charging port, two Thunderbolt ports, and a headphone jack.

Obviously, this MacBook Air is built to last – both in terms of hardware and software. The aluminum chassis resists wear and tear and Apple's commitment to software updates means you'll continue to receive new features and security improvements for years to come. It can easily last 5 to 10 more years. Compatibility with popular apps like Microsoft 365, Zoom, or Opera will also ensure your workflow remains seamless.

With a design and performance capability (for day-to-day tasks) that's nearly the same as the latest releases, and a discount that's barely ever seen for Apple gear, this deal is the best MacBook deal on the market today.

Operatives from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Labor (DOL) have access to systems that house sensitive data pertaining to immigrants, sources tell WIRED. This access comes as President Donald Trump's administration has continued its crackdown on immigrants around the US, and DOGE has played a key role in collecting personal data on them.

WIRED previously reported that Miles Collins, Aram Moghaddassi, and Marko Elez are all DOGE operatives embedded at the Labor Department.

Collins has access to the DOL's National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) system, according to sources with direct knowledge. This program offers funding to organizations that work with migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as organizations working on the state level to support job training for low-income farm workers. Last year, the program disbursed $90 million in grants. Anyone legally allowed to work in the United States and who meets the program's criteria is eligible for support.

“When I say ‘migrant and seasonal farm workers,' that does not mean somebody who just arrived from Venezuela or something. It means essentially people who are authorized to work in the United States,” says a DOL employee familiar with the program. “Maybe there's some misunderstanding even among the DOGE guys.”

According to the source, access to the NFJP's system could provide the Social Security numbers of every person who is a beneficiary of the program, as well as what kind of services a beneficiary received. (Social Security numbers are assigned to US citizens as well as immigrants legally residing and working in the country.)

This kind of data, says the source, is normally “very, very controlled.”

Instructions to grant Moghaddassi access to data from the DOL's Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) reporting system were also viewed by WIRED. FLAG is responsible for a number of initiatives, including wage protections for foreign workers and visa programs for foreign and temporary workers. Data on visa applicants maintained in FLAG systems, sources say, could include names, work addresses, work history, phone numbers, email addresses, and an “alien registration number,” which is an identifier assigned to foreign nationals by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These numbers can be found on green cards, or permanent resident cards, and employment authorization cards. Permanent Labor Certifications (PERM) are also available in the FLAG system. The certification, according to the Labor Department's website, “allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently” in the US.

The instructions to grant Moghaddassi data access to FLAG appeared under a heading that reads “OIG access level,” which likely refers to the DOL's Office of Inspector General. The OIG at the DOL, according to its website, “investigates fraud, waste, and abuse related to the department's programs, including the foreign labor certification programs.” FLAG is the application portal for these certification programs. Larry Turner, the former Inspector General at the Department of Labor, was fired by Trump in January as part of a broader purge of the position across more than a dozen agencies. Trump has since nominated Anthony D'Esposito, a former US congressman from New York, for the job.

DOGE's access at the DOL also encompasses data that, while not directly immigration-related, could be used in conjunction with data that is. Collins, Moghaddassi, and Elez all have access to the DOL's Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program, WIRED has confirmed. This program at the DOL provides funding for people who were incarcerated and supports job training and other employment services.

While the REO database isn't immigration-specific, the data from REO could be cross-referenced with other datasets to figure out the immigration status of formerly incarcerated people benefiting from the program. If DOGE were to find crossover, a source at the agency tells WIRED, this “would fit so neatly with their messaging about immigrants being criminals and abusing government services.” (Despite claims from Trump's administration, there is no evidence that immigrants present threats to “national security” and “public safety” or that they abuse government services—in fact, research shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.)

Moghaddassi, Elez, and Collins did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Department of Labor.

Moghaddassi and Elez have also appeared as DOGE operatives at other federal agencies and have connections to Musk.

Moghaddassi has worked at a number of Musk's companies, including X, Tesla, and Neuralink; according to previous WIRED reporting tracking DOGE operatives, he has also been linked to the Treasury Department and DHS.

Elez, a 25-year-old engineer who has worked at Musk's X and SpaceX, has also appeared at the Treasury and Social Security Administration. While at the Treasury, WIRED reported, Elez had both read and write access to sensitive Treasury systems. Elez briefly resigned from DOGE after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez returned to DOGE after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X.

Elez is also staffed at DHS, according to Politico, as part of the administration's effort to bring together data from a number of government agencies to streamline and systematize DHS enforcement and deportation. Elez, despite his initial resignation from DOGE, has seemingly been tasked with a number of unusually sensitive assignments: He is also part of the DOGE team working on a system to sell the $5 million visas that Trump calls “gold cards.”

Elez is on this team with Edward Coristine, the young DOGE operative known as “Big Balls.” Coristine also has his hands in many agencies and recently appeared at the Labor Department, sources tell WIRED.

Coristine is another key DOGE staffer planted at DHS. He has also appeared at the Office of Personnel Management, the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of Education, the General Services Administration, and the Small Business Administration.

Coristine did not reply to requests for comment.

“This is an administration that is happy to go after people with legal status if it dislikes something else about them,” says Victoria Noble, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It's just one more source of information that allows this administration to target people who are here legally, but target them for deportation or other more advanced investigations.”

You'll be laughing it up like a fuzzball of another kind when you see this trio of Hasbro Star Wars figures up close—all somewhat inexplicably linked by their glorious manes.

In Tokyo, Japan for Star Wars Celebration, Hasbro just wrapped up showing fans what's coming for its Star Wars action figures, and to celebrate, io9's got your first look clean and up close at three of those reveals. Carrying on the Black Series' latest update to the classic A New Hope cast, we've got your looks at the newest Han Solo and Chewbacca figures, with Han featuring a new headsculpt complete with a wonderfully fluffy take on Harrison Ford's hair in the first Star Wars, while Chewie, as always, is covered in the stuff, bringing some new paint decos and updates to Black Series' tried-and-true Wookiee formula.

But perhaps the absolute highlight of the trio comes in a smaller stature… although not by much, all things considered. Continuing on the New Hope vibes in the 3.75″-scaled Vintage Collection, we've got your look at this furry epic: a Tusken Raider complete with Bantha mount. The deluxe set features the Tusken Raider figure with his own gaffi stick and rifle accessories, as well as cloth goods to make it easier for him to mount his fully articulated ride.

The Bantha, buried under all those layers of fur (it's very evocative of the classic Power of the Force Bantha figure from the '90s!), features an articulated head, legs, tail, and ankle joints, and can even open and close its mouth. Of course, it also has a detailed saddle atop its hairy back to place its Tusken rider. Check out all the pictures below!

You won't have to wait too long to get your hands on these figures—all three figures are set to release this summer, with Han and Chewie costing $25 each, and the Bantha and Tusken set costing $70. Pre-orders for each will go live on Hasbro Pulse and other retailers tomorrow, April 18, at 3 p.m. ET, although the Bantha and Tusken will be exclusively available through Pulse initially, before becoming available at Disney Stores at a later date.

Stay tuned to io9 for even more coverage from Star Wars Celebration Japan this weekend!

When news broke that OpenAI was in talks to acquire AI coding company Windsurf for $3 billion, one of the first questions on the mind of anyone following the space was likely: “Why not buy Cursor creator Anysphere instead?”

After all, OpenAI Startup Fund has been an investor in Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, since the quickly growing coding assistant's seed round in late 2023. (Anysphere is often referred to by its product name, Cursor.) It turns out that OpenAI indeed approached Anysphere in 2024 and again earlier this year about a potential acquisition, according to a report from CNBC. The talks failed. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital at about $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.

OpenAI's desire to move on to acquisition discussions with another coding assistant maker signals how important capturing a slice of the code generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. Windsurf is generating about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), TechCrunch reported in February. Meanwhile, Anysphere's Cursor reportedly makes about $200 million on an ARR basis.

While OpenAI's Codex CLI “agent,” which the company released Wednesday, can also write and edit code, its attempt to buy Windsurf suggests the company doesn't want to wait for CLI to gain traction with customers.

The results of a large survey from a diverse patient population revealed cautious support for artificial intelligence (AI) implementation in screening mammography, according to a study published today in Radiology: Imaging Cancer, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Personal medical history and sociodemographic factors influenced respondent's level of trust in AI.

While the diagnostic accuracy of AI systems has drastically improved in recent years, there is still a lack of widespread adoption and acceptance of this technology for a variety of reasons, such as concerns with data privacy, algorithmic bias or even level of knowledge of AI.

One opinion that is frequently overlooked in the conversation surrounding the growth of AI in radiology is that of the patient.

Patient perspectives are crucial because successful AI implementation in medical imaging depends on trust and acceptance from those we aim to serve. If patients are hesitant or skeptical about AI's role in their care, this could impact screening adherence and, consequently, overall health care outcomes."

Basak E. Dogan, M.D., study author clinical professor of radiology and director of breast imaging research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas

To gain a better understanding of patient opinions and concerns regarding the use of AI in screening mammography, Dr. Dogan and colleagues developed a 29-question survey to be offered to all patients who attended their institution for a breast cancer screening mammogram. The optional survey was available for a period of seven months in 2023.

All survey questions were closed-ended and assessed the participants' knowledge and perceptions of AI. The survey obtained demographic information in addition to clinical information, which uncovered a respondent's history with breast cancer, such as whether they had any abnormal mammograms in the past or if they or a close family member has ever had breast cancer.

Of the 518 patients who completed the survey, most indicated support for the use of AI alongside a radiologist's review, with 71% of respondents preferring AI to be used as a second reader. This was despite concerns about loss of personal interaction with the radiologist, data privacy, lack of transparency and bias. Less than 5% were comfortable with AI alone interpreting their screening mammogram.

Because of its large and diverse patient population, the survey uncovered a variety of demographic factors that influence patient perceptions. Respondents with more than a college degree or a higher self-reported knowledge of AI were two times more likely to accept AI involvement in their screening mammogram.

Of note, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black respondents reported significantly higher concerns about AI bias and data privacy, which most likely resulted in a lower acceptance of AI among these patient groups. 

"These results suggest that demographic factors play a complex role in shaping patient trust and perceptions of AI in breast imaging," Dr. Dogan added.

Familial and personal medical history also impacted patient attitudes toward AI. 

Regardless of whether an abnormality was detected by AI or a radiologist, patients who had a close relative diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to request additional reviews. However, these patients exhibited a high degree of trust in both AI and radiologist reviews when the mammogram came back as normal.

In contrast, patients with a history of an abnormal mammogram were more likely to pursue diagnostic follow-up if AI and radiologist reviews conflicted. This was especially the case if it was AI that flagged an abnormality.

"This highlights how personal medical history influences trust in AI and radiologists differently, emphasizing the need for personalized AI integration strategies in mammographic screening," Dr. Dogan said.

The researchers noted that it is important to continue engaging with patients to understand their evolving views of AI technology in health care, as the technology continues to advance.

"Our study shows that trust in AI is highly individualized, influenced by factors such as prior medical experiences, education and racial background," Dr. Dogan said. "Incorporating patient perspectives into AI implementation strategies ensures that these technologies improve and not hinder patient care, fostering trust and adherence to imaging reports and recommendations."

Oxidative stress could be a key process in acyclovir (ACV)-induced nephrotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a water-soluble antioxidant with anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of NAC on ACV-induced nephrotoxicity in adult Wistar rats.

Forty adult male Wistar rats (200–220 g) were used. The rats were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 5/group) and were treated intraperitoneally daily for seven days as follows: Group 1 (Control) was administered water (0.2mL), while groups 2–4 were administered NAC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg). Group 5 was administered ACV (150 mg/kg), while groups 6–8 were supplemented with NAC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) prior to treatment with ACV (150 mg/kg). On day 8, the rats were weighed and euthanized, and blood samples were collected for the assessment of biochemical markers. The kidneys were weighed and subjected to oxidative stress markers and histological evaluations.

ACV had no significant (p > 0.05) effects on the body and kidney weights of rats compared to the control. ACV produced significant (p < 0.001) elevations in kidney malondialdehyde, serum urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels in rats, which differed from the control. There were significant (p < 0.001) decreases in kidney glutathione, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase, as well as serum chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, and sodium levels in ACV-treated rats compared to the control. ACV caused widening of Bowman's space and tubular necrosis in the kidneys of rats. Nonetheless, NAC supplementation abrogated ACV-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Kidney histology was restored by NAC supplementation.

NAC protected against ACV-induced nephrotoxicity. This finding shows that NAC may have therapeutic potential for nephrotoxicity caused by ACV.

PBS News Weekend's Ali Rogin spoke with KFF Health News contributor Michelle Andrews about what some people with missing limbs consider a disparity in health insurance coverage: Though a knee replacement likely would be covered, a prosthetic knee isn't always. A prosthetic device can be subject to cost caps and an amputee may be required to prove medical necessity for coverage. Andrews recently explored these issues in her article "Health Insurers Limit Coverage of Prosthetic Limbs, Questioning Their Medical Necessity."

This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Patients who take the common blood pressure medicine Lercanidipine HCI 20 mg tablets (lercanidipine hydrochloride) from the manufacturer Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited, should, as a precautionary measure, urgently check if they have the batch number MD4L07 with an expiry date of 01/2028 on any packs they have at home. The batch number is printed on the foil of the blister strips.

This follows an error in the strength of the product printed on some of the sides of the pack. The error is limited to one batch of the medicine only.

The packs are incorrectly labelled as 10 mg on some sides of the pack when they are 20 mg tablets. The correct strength (20 mg) is printed on the top of the carton and on the blister strips.

An alert, has been issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) today.

Patients prescribed 10 mg tablets and have received tablets with this batch number should contact their pharmacist or GP immediately.

If the GP or pharmacist cannot be reached, patients should call NHS 111 for advice on continuing their medication.

If a patient cannot speak to a healthcare professional before they are due to take their next dose, they should:

Patients who were prescribed 20 mg tablets should verify the strength of the tablets by checking the information on the foil of the blister strips prior to taking the tablet. Patients should continue to take the tablets as prescribed by their doctor.

Patients should not stop taking their medicine without consulting their healthcare provider. Patients who are concerned about the strength of the medication they have received should check it with their dispensing pharmacy.

Patients concerned they may have accidentally taken a higher dose of the medication than they were prescribed should talk to a pharmacist, their GP or call NHS 111.

Patients who experience side effects or have any questions about the medication should seek medical attention. Any suspected side effects should also be reported via the MHRA Yellow Card scheme.

Patient safety is our top priority. We ask patients to check their medicine packaging and follow our advice.

Healthcare professionals such as pharmacists are also being asked to stop supplying medicine from the affected batch and to return it to the supplier.

Please report any suspected adverse reactions via the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme."

Dr Alison Cave, Chief Safety Officer, MHRA 

The alert was issued after the manufacturer, Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited, informed the MHRA of an error in the strength of the product printed on some sides of the product carton.

Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited is initiating a recall of the specified batches as a precautionary measure.

Bottom line: A subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discontinued immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) continued to experience long-term disease control.

Journal in which the study was published: Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)

Authors: Senior author Mark Awad, MD, PhD, chief of the Thoracic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and first author Federica Pecci, MD, a research fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for NSCLC, offering significant survival benefits in both early-stage and advanced disease. However, by stimulating the immune system, ICIs can cause irAEs, such as pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatitis, which can also lead to permanent treatment discontinuation.

"When immunotherapy activates the immune system, the goal is to selectively target cancer cells. But this activation can also cause inflammation in other organs," Awad said. "Whenever we see these side effects, we question whether we should keep giving immunotherapy or if we need to stop treatment temporarily or permanently."

Between 3% and 12% of patients treated with a single ICI and up to 25% of patients treated with dual ICI combination therapy may need to discontinue treatment due to irAEs, Awad explained. Many of these patients face concerns about whether their cancer will progress or recur if they stop treatment.

How the study was conducted: Awad and colleagues sought to characterize the outcomes of patients with NSCLC who discontinued ICIs. They also evaluated clinical and pathological characteristics that were associated with longer PFS and OS after discontinuation.

Results: In a multi-institutional cohort of 2,794 patients who were treated with ICIs alone or in combination with other therapies, approximately 10% discontinued treatment due to irAEs; among these patients, the median post-discontinuation progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.7 months, and the median post-discontinuation overall survival (OS) was 43.7 months.

"These outcomes suggest that patients can experience prolonged disease control and survival after stopping treatment due to toxicity or if side effects are impacting their quality of life," Pecci said.

Among patients who received treatment before discontinuing for less than three months, between three and six months, and more than six months, the median PFS after discontinuation was 6.2 months, 13.9 months, and 25.8 months, respectively; the median OS after discontinuation was 21.7 months, 42.7 months, and 86.9 months, respectively.

In a multivariable analysis, predictors of longer post-discontinuation PFS included high PD-L1 expression, a complete or partial response (CR/PR) to treatment, and a treatment duration of either three to six months or more than six months before discontinuation. Furthermore, factors associated with prolonged post-discontinuation OS were nonsquamous histology, CR/PR to treatment, and a treatment duration exceeding six months.

The use of steroids or other immunosuppressants to treat irAEs was not associated with a difference in PFS or OS after discontinuation in the study, suggesting that such treatments may not jeopardize the anticancer response.

Author's comments: "We identified clinical and pathological features that can help physicians to better understand which patients can benefit longer without any additional treatment after discontinuing for toxicity," Pecci said. "Our study can serve as a valuable resource to support clinicians in the complex considerations of treatment discontinuation for irAEs."

While discontinuation is clearly warranted in cases of severe irAEs, the management of grade 2 irAEs often presents a more nuanced challenge for clinicians. These findings may help physicians provide patients with a clearer, more individualized assessment of their risk of disease progression, Pecci said, taking into account factors such as treatment duration before discontinuation, response to therapy, and other clinicopathologic characteristics.

Study limitations: Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, which could be hindered by missing or inaccurate data annotations. Additionally, comparisons based on treatment duration before discontinuation may be confounded by an overrepresentation of long-term responders in the longer-duration groups. To mitigate this, landmark analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to help reduce potential biases and enhance the reliability of the findings.

A new study led by researchers at Yale University suggests that early-life exposure to two widespread environmental pollutants- small particle air pollution and outdoor artificial light at night-could increase the risk of pediatric thyroid cancer.

The study-a collaborative effort involving multiple Yale departments and institutions across the U.S.-found a "significant association" between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and outdoor artificial light at night (O-ALAN) and increased risk of papillary thyroid cancer in children and young adults up to 19 years old. The exposures occurred during the perinatal stage of life, typically defined as the time from when pregnancy occurs up to a year after birth.

These results are concerning, especially given how widespread both of these exposures are. Fine particulate matter is found in urban air pollution due to automobile traffic and industrial activity, and artificial light at night is common, particularly in densely populated urban areas."

Dr. Nicole Deziel, PhD, MHS, environmental epidemiologist with the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) and study's lead author

The research team analyzed data from 736 individuals diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer before age 20 and 36,800 matched control participants based on birth year. Using advanced geospatial and satellite modeling, the team assessed individual-level exposure to PM2.5 and O-ALAN based on residential location at birth. All of the study participants were from California.

The findings showed that for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 exposure, the odds of developing thyroid cancer rose by 7% overall. The strongest association between exposure and thyroid cancer was found among teenagers (15–19 years of age) and Hispanic children. Similarly, children born in areas with high levels of exposure to outdoor light at night were 23–25% more likely to develop thyroid cancer, according to the study.

"Thyroid cancer is among the fastest growing cancers among children and adolescents, yet we know very little about what causes it in this population," said Deziel, an associate professor of epidemiology (environmental health sciences) and co-director of the Yale Center for Perinatal, Pediatric, and Environmental Epidemiology. "Our study is the first large-scale investigation to suggest that these exposures early in life-specifically to PM2.5 and outdoor light at night-may play a role in this concerning trend."

In addition to Deziel, the research team included experts from Yale's Departments of Biostatistics, Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and Pediatrics, as well as researchers from the University of Southern California, UC Berkeley, and the American Cancer Society. Deziel and several of the study's authors are affiliated with the Yale Cancer Center. The team's collective expertise ranged from environmental exposure modeling and biostatistics to pediatric endocrinology and cancer epidemiology.

The impact of papillary thyroid cancer on children can be extensive.

Compared to adults, children are often diagnosed with thyroid cancer at more advanced stages with larger tumor sizes. Pediatric survivors of thyroid cancer can suffer aftereffects ranging from temperature dysregulation and headaches to physical disabilities and mental fatigue. The disease can interfere with important life milestones such as education, employment, and raising a family and it can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression.

Both PM2.5 and O-ALAN are considered environmental carcinogens that have been shown to disrupt the body's endocrine system, including thyroid function, in animals and adults. The particles associated with PM2.5 pose a threat because they are small enough to enter the bloodstream and can interfere with hormone signaling, including those involved in regulating cancer pathways. Outdoor artificial light at night has been shown to suppress melatonin and alter circadian rhythms, which can also influence hormone-regulated cancer pathways.

The current research raises important environmental justice concerns. Communities of color and lower-income populations are often disproportionately exposed to both air pollution and light pollution-inequities that may contribute to the higher thyroid cancer burden observed in Hispanic children.

The researchers emphasized that more work is needed to replicate and expand on their findings, ideally using improved exposure metrics and longitudinal designs.

"In the meantime," Deziel noted, "our results point to the critical importance of addressing environmental factors in childhood cancer research. Reducing exposures to air pollution and managing light pollution could be important steps in protecting children's health."

The study appears online in Environmental Health Perspectives.

In an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, a team led by researchers from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH) say public ignorance and apathy towards bird flu (highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI) could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a larger-scale public health crisis.

The authors, including CUNY SPH Assistant Professor Rachael Piltch-Loeb, Associate Professor Katarzyna Wyka, Professor Jeffrey V. Lazarus, Senior Scholar Kenneth Rabin, Distinguished Lecturer Scott C. Ratzan, and Dean Ayman El-Mohandes, conducted a population representative survey of U.S. residents from August 5 to 15, 2024, which used an in-depth sampling framework and intentional oversampling of rural populations.

The results suggest many respondents were unaware of simple food safety practices that could reduce the risk of HPAI infection. Over half (53.7%) did not know that pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, although almost three of four respondents (71.3%) did understand that cooking meat at high temperatures could eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses like H5N1.

Over a quarter (27%) of respondents said they were unwilling to modify their diet to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, and more than one in four respondents (28.7%) expressed reluctance to take a potential vaccine for H5N1, even if advised by the CDC to do so.

Participants who described themselves as Republicans or Independents were significantly less likely than Democrats to support either vaccination or dietary modifications.

Rural Americans, many of whom are more likely to work or live in or near livestock industries, were less likely to accept public health measures, including vaccination and dietary changes, compared to their urban counterparts.

"These attitudes could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a major public health crisis," says Piltch-Loeb, the study's lead author. "The fact that responses vary significantly by political party and geography emphasizes the need for a carefully segmented health communications strategy to address the issue."

Rabin, who has been engaged in health communications campaigns for more than four decades, adds that, "Working closely with agricultural leaders, farm communities and food processing companies will be critical, and the fact that most of the agricultural workers who are at direct risk of exposure to the bird flu virus may be undocumented could seriously jeopardize efforts to track and control the spread of infections."

Emmarie Huetteman KFF Health News Emmarie Huetteman, senior editor, oversees a team of Washington reporters, as well as "Bill of the Month" and KFF Health News' "What the Health?" She previously spent more than a decade reporting on the federal government, most recently covering surprise medical bills, drug pricing reform, and other health policy debates in Washington and on the campaign trail. 

The secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contradicted his agency's researchers this week with unsubstantiated or outright false claims about autism spectrum disorder and those with the condition. His public remarks were not the only recent example of Kennedy speaking against his employees; during an introductory appearance at the FDA, Kennedy said the staff — reeling from the layoffs of 3,500 colleagues — had become beholden to the industries they regulate.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices as his administration signaled that tariffs on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients could be on deck. And new data shows that the number of abortions performed nationwide increased slightly last year, as travel and telehealth prescribing maintained access for some patients in states with abortion bans.

This week's panelists are Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News, Jessie Hellmann of CQ Roll Call, and Shefali Luthra of The 19th.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Julie Rovner of KFF Health News interviews Krista Harrison and Robbie Zimbroff, health policy researchers at the University of California-San Francisco. They share some background on a case before the Supreme Court next week, Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, which challenges the ability of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to make expert recommendations for American health.

Plus, for "extra credit," the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too:

Emmarie Huetteman: KFF Health News' "States Push Medicaid Work Rules, but Few Programs Help Enrollees Find Jobs," by Sam Whitehead, Phil Galewitz, and Katheryn Houghton.

Anna Edney: ProPublica's "Unsanitary Practices Persist at Baby Formula Factory Whose Shutdown Led to Mass Shortages, Workers Say," by Heather Vogell.

Jessie Hellmann: The Hill's "Military's Use of Toxic 'Forever Chemicals' Leaves Lasting Scars," by Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin.

Shefali Luthra: The 19th's "Trump's Push for 'Beautiful Clean Coal' Could Lead to More Premature Births," by Jessica Kutz.

Since coming to Major League Soccer, Lionel Messi has done much of his talking on the field of play. Getting Messi in front of a camera for a casual chat about life, past successes or why he can't go back to FC Barcelona has been hard to come by.

When Messi has spoken exclusively, it has been through one of his brand partnerships or with a trusted journalist. This week, Messi sat with veteran broadcaster Quique Wolff of Simplemente Fútbol for a rare look into the mind of the recent World Cup winner.

Shot at Inter Miami's training facility in Fort Lauderdale and wearing his club's pink-and-black colors, Messi reminisced about the highs and lows of Argentina's title run at the 2022 World Cup. The shock loss to Saudi Arabia, the nerve-wrecking clash against Mexico and the spectacular final against France.

The juiciest comments? The ones about Mexico.

In Mexico, Messi's remarks about a supposed World Cup rivalry with the North American country have dominated social media, and rekindled the spice that exists between the two countries. In Doha before the pivotal World Cup Group C match, Mexico's supporters were relishing the opportunity to defeat Argentina and knock the then-two-time World Cup champion, and Messi, out of the tournament. Messi would lead Argentina to a 2-0 win that electrified their fans and Lionel Scaloni's side, and jump-started their campaign.

“Mexico always has support at every World Cup, every tournament. It was the first game (in Qatar) where it felt like, I don't know if there were more Mexicans than Argentines, but it was very even,” said Messi.

Since then, Messi has traveled to Mexico with Inter Miami for official matches against Liga MX sides, in addition to facing Mexican clubs in the U.S. During a friendly against Club América in Las Vegas in January, Messi responded to hecklers by raising three of his fingers before making a zero on the other hand. The message: Argentina has three World Cup trophies. Mexico, nil. It divided support for Messi in Mexico.

“Honestly, I don't know what happened with the Mexicans, or when that rivalry or displeasure started,” Messi said. “They have positioned themselves as one of (Argentina's) rivals and that doesn't actually exist. There is no comparison between Argentina and Mexico and I don't know where that started.”

Looking back at the World Cup triumph, Messi looked comfortable and relaxed, and clearly enjoyed reminiscing about the ultimate moment in a career filled with trophies and accomplishments.

“It's a tournament that has moments that at some point, luck will be on your side,” he added. “We were so good (at the World Cup), but things would happen to us that we couldn't believe because of how we had played earlier in those games.”

On the final against France, which Argentina won on penalties, Messi referred to France's comeback as “crazy,” and said that had Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez not made a kick save in the second half of extra time, the result would have been “terrible.” “But like I said, eventually you have luck,” he said. On Kylian Mbappe's hat-trick performance in that final — plus a successful shootout strike — Messi responded, “Well, he can stay relaxed because he won the 2018 World Cup,” Messi added, “but it's wild to have scored four goals in a final and not be crowned champion.”

Fewer than 500 days from the next World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and after The Athletic reported last week that Messi is expected to extend his contract with Inter Miami, the ongoing question about whether he'll play in his sixth World Cup, was also discussed on Thursday.

“The truth is that when you start thinking about it, it's a long time away but at the same time it's going to pass quickly,” Messi said.

Argentina is already qualified for the World Cup with four matches remaining in South America's qualifying tournament. Scaloni has leaned on a number of attacking players to help his side cope without Messi, who has missed several national team matches through injury since coming to America in 2023. Even without Messi, Argentina has thoroughly separated itself from the rest of South America as the best team on the continent.

It will be interesting to see how Messi juggles his desire to continue to play for his country, and possibly win back-to-back World Cup finals, with his contract obligations for major brands that will receive a massive boost if he's the face of a U.S.-co-hosted World Cup.

“It's a long season,” Messi said. “It's started now and runs through December without a break in June, on top of that we have the Club World Cup in June as well, another competition. There are lots of games.

“I think about it and wait and see but I don't want to set that goal either. I'll take it day by day and see how I feel physically above all else, and be honest with myself too.

“I'm having fun and there's nothing else that I can ask for. Wanting to win will never leave me. It's my essence and I was raised that way. I like to win and to compete, but the World Cup (…), like I said after that final, ‘That's it.' We won everything. There's nothing left.”

Additional highlights from the interview include Messi describing his time under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona as “a master's degree in tactics” and that he grew immensely as a player under the Spanish manager. Now it's Lamine Yamal, the 17-year-old phenom who has become one of the most promising players of the last 25 years.

“It's so impressive what he shows and what he has already accomplished. He is a champion with Spain,” said Messi. “He'll continue to grow, will add things to his game. He started on the right like me. Maybe in a few years, he'll be playing differently, as well. He's already among the best players in the world.”

Messi is clearly happy with life in the U.S. He laughed that his three sons, all youth players for Inter Miami, play American football in the family's backyard, and that attending the Super Bowl in New Orleans in February was “a beautiful experience because (my kids) enjoyed it. They know all about all of the players.”

Regarding his future, Messi remained steadfast during the interview that extending his playing days or committing to Argentina for the 2026 World Cup, will come down to how he feels physically.

“This year is going to be important (for the World Cup), to be able to play with continuity, to feel good. To be able to play and find my form (…) obviously one thinks about things but I live day-to-day and value how I feel. I have to be honest with myself about whether I'm capable of being there or not.”

In the meantime, Messi's celebrity continues to grow, while the rest of the world ponders football's future without one of the best of all time.

Real Madrid's elimination from the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Arsenal has led to tight scrutiny over the coach and some of the players.

Everything suggests there might be a big overhaul in the coming summer, with multiple stars likely to leave the club.

One of the players facing an uncertain future at Santiago Bernabeu is David Alaba, who has barely played for the club on account of injuries.

The Austrian defender is under contract until 2026, but his long-term cruciate ligament injury has raised doubts about his ability to return to his best.

After missing more than a year of football, Alaba returned to the pitch for the Champions League quarter-finals, but his performances left questions instead of answers.

According to a recent report from journalist Sergio Gomez, there is uncertainty creeping in as far as Alaba's future at Real Madrid is concerned. However, any decision on the defender's continuity will be made only after the FIFA Club World Cup.

The camp admits that Alaba's physical decline has been evident and a cause for concern. His high salary also puts him in a delicate spot, especially as the club look to make room for potential new signings in the summer.

Although the club still acknowledge what Alaba has done for the club in recent past, the feeling at Valdebebas is that the club might have to make a difficult decision.

With the team planning changes and considering reinforcements, especially in defence, Alaba's place in the squad is no longer secure. His contract, expiring in 2026, as well his high wages, are also a factor.

Alaba's potential exit could spark the start of a new era in the Real Madrid defence, as the club look to put more focus on younger alternatives.

However, a decision on his future will not be made in a hurry and the club will wait until after the FIFA World Cup to take a call on his continuity.

The international soccer association FIFA is searching for volunteers to help organize this summer's Club World Cup, which includes several matches held in New Jersey during the month-long tournament.

Volunteers perform a variety of roles during the competition, from assisting teams and officials on game days to supporting the media and welcoming fans to each event. While the positions are unpaid, they provide a unique opportunity to be part of a worldwide initiative and interact with famous soccer players and representatives.

"As a volunteer at a FIFA event, you're at the heart of the team," the association said on its website. "It's a chance to develop skills, make global connections and create unforgettable memories!"

Anyone interested in applying is encouraged to do so by visiting volunteer.fifa.com/invite/FCWC2025. No prior experience is necessary, and applicants can indicate their preferred city on the form.

Volunteers must be 18 years old as of Jan. 1, 2025 and be a United States citizen or permanent resident. They must also speak English (though knowledge of additional languages is a plus); be available for the entire tournament, including pre-event training sessions; and have a positive attitude that includes a passion for soccer.

If selected, volunteers must attend training sessions to prepare for the Club World Cup. The tournament begins Saturday, June 14, and culminates with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford Sunday, July 13.

MetLife is one of 12 venues throughout the country selected to host matches during the tournament. The stadium will be the site of five group stage matches in the tournament, one quarterfinal and both semifinals in addition to the final.

The FIFA Club World Cup features 32 club teams representing six continents. This year's participants include European teams like Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid, as well as Major League Soccer clubs Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami.

The Club World Cup was first organized in 2000 and took place annually from 2005 to 2023. Starting with this year, the tournament will be held every four years like the World Cup, which is contested among national teams.

The FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will take place next summer. MetLife Stadium will also be the site of that tournament's final on July 19, 2026.

Inter Milan and Juventus are among the clubs who could face a hefty tax bill from prize money at the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

This according to UK outlet The Guardian. They report that there is still not agreement exempting the winnings from tax to US federal and state governments.

Inter Milan and Juventus will be participating in the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. They will be the two teams representing Serie A.

There will be 32 teams at the tournament in total.

And the prize money for the competition will be very high indeed.

On top of hefty revenues just for participating, the Nerazzurri, the Bianconeri, and the rest of the clubs in the Club World Cup will compete for significant further prize money.

The Guardian noted that FIFA will dole out more than €1 billion in prize money in total.

That is certainly a major incentive for the participating clubs.

The winner of the final would take home over €125 million in total.

However, The Guardian notes, that could come with a significant tax bill eating away into the revenues.

That is because the organizers of the tournament have yet to reach an agreement with US state and federal government regarding taxation.

Therefore, the winnings could be subject to the full state and federal taxes applicable in the US. That would be in addition to the taxes that Inter or Juventus would pay on prize money in Italy.

            It has not been the easiest of times supporting the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) for former captain Clint Dempsey.
    


            After crashing out of the group stage at last summer's Copa América, the US was stunned by Panama at the CONCACAF Nations League and then lost to north-of-the-border rival Canada in the third-place match.
    


            Mauricio Pochettino's record since he took over the reins as head coach in September 2024 makes for difficult reading: five wins in eight matches with no draws and three defeats – those victories, though, coming against teams ranked well below the US in the FIFA rankings.
    


            So, how concerned is the ex-Premier League forward on a scale of one to 10? “I'm probably like a six or seven right now” Dempsey tells CNN Sports.
    


            “We're the first host country to not get out of Copa América in the group stage and the way that we lost CONCACAF Nations League (is concerning, but) I still believe in this team, and they have a lot of quality, and I think they can turn things around, especially with the coach Pochettino being in charge and what he did at Southampton and Tottenham.”
    


            While Dempsey has faith in the team's ability to get back on track, he recognizes some players might feel unsettled after the Argentine manager's recent interview where he revealed a desire to manage Spurs again one day.
    


            “I'm not in the dressing room, but at the end of the day, like when I was growing up, my dream was always to represent my country, it didn't matter who the manager was.
    


            “It is unfortunate that there might be question marks around (Pochettino), but at the end of the day, it's on the players to go out there and perform and represent their country and take pride in that,” Dempsey adds, speaking as an ambassador for American Airlines, an official partner of next year's World Cup.
    


            Joint USMNT top scorers Dempsey and Landon Donovan have not shied away from criticizing the current crop of players publicly. They've even gone so far as questioning squad members' commitment to the US badge.
    


            Dempsey recognizes his critiques come with an asterisk; the last time he played for the USMNT was a nightmare 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago that resulted in the US failing to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1986.

The world is coming to America for next summer's World Cup. There are big concerns over whether the US is ready



            “I've been a part of failures. I mean, 2018, we didn't qualify for the World Cup. It was a huge failure. It was a huge step backwards in the wrong direction, and all you can do is what the players did.”
    


            That failure triggered the influx of many of today's squad with only Christian Pulisic and Tim Ream remaining from the team that was humbled at the hands of the Caribbean nation.
    


            It was that wave of new talent and fresh faces that left some fans calling them “The Baby Eagles.”
    


            The team now boasts a plethora of players who ply their trade at European clubs and who experienced the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup together.
    


            “They fought hard. They qualified for the World Cup (in Qatar). They performed well in the last World Cup, got out of the group, and it looked like a team that was starting to build towards something. But since that World Cup, it looks like we've kind of taken another step back.
    


            “There's been players who are doing really well in Europe. You got Antonee Robinson at Fulham, who's having a great season. You have Christian Pulisic, AC Milan, who's having a great season. You have players like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie.
    


            “I want people to fight for each other. I want there to be competition for spots in the team and maybe things need to be shaken up a little bit in terms of who that starting 11 needs to be,” he tells CNN.
    


            While household names abound, the USMNT's historically deep squad no longer exists and a quick fix is difficult.
    


            “I think when you look back at the history of US men's national team, you normally had a goalie that was playing consistently week in and week out in Europe, whether it was Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. That's not the case for us at the moment.
    


            “(Also) when you think back, we had a number 9 that was solidified (at) that position and could score goals. We don't really have that in our team at the moment.”
    


            While the Texas native hasn't been afraid to voice his concerns, he does, however, push back on the idea that Pulisic's captaincy is one of the problems. The AC Milan winger has increasingly faced scrutiny that he may not be the right type of leader for the Stars and Stripes.
    


            Former manager Gregg Berhalter preferred to rotate the captain's armband among a leadership group – something that came under scrutiny as performances dipped before his dismissal. And despite Pulisic's “Captain America” nickname, Tyler Adams was ultimately named captain for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
    


            Dempsey, however, sees the merits in multiple locker-room leaders: “I think the team is not just one person who is a leader. I think there's multiple people on that team that are leaders.”
    


            He compares the current debate to his experiences at the 2014 Brazil World Cup, saying, “Tim Howard was on that team, and even though I was a captain, I saw him as one of the captains. He was one of the leaders as well, so it takes more than one captain to kind of step up and get everybody on track.”
    


            Despite lethargic performances against the likes of Panama, Canada and traditional rival Mexico, Dempsey believes the biggest problem facing the USMNT in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup is its strength of schedule.
    


            “I mean, Copa América, that's a big competition… and no disrespect to the CONCACAF Nations League, but it's kind of a new tournament that's been made up in the last few years.
    


            “I think the Nations League is kind of hurt. Around the world in terms of even, you know, the European Nations League, it's just the same teams playing each other over and over again. So (for) me as a fan, I think there would be more excitement around seeing other teams.”
    


            No need to start panicking yet, though, USMNT fans. Despite the laundry list of concerns – mentality and passion, Pochettino's potentially wandering eye, a lack of an elite goalkeeper and center forward, and the strength of opponents – Dempsey is adamant “it's not all doom and gloom.”
    


            “There's quality in the side; it's just getting the best out of them. And when your back's against the wall, just kind of fighting for each other.”

            It has not been the easiest of times supporting the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) for former captain Clint Dempsey.
    


            After crashing out of the group stage at last summer's Copa América, the US was stunned by Panama at the CONCACAF Nations League and then lost to north-of-the-border rival Canada in the third-place match.
    


            Mauricio Pochettino's record since he took over the reins as head coach in September 2024 makes for difficult reading: five wins in eight matches with no draws and three defeats – those victories, though, coming against teams ranked well below the US in the FIFA rankings.
    


            So, how concerned is the ex-Premier League forward on a scale of one to 10? “I'm probably like a six or seven right now” Dempsey tells CNN Sports.
    


            “We're the first host country to not get out of Copa América in the group stage and the way that we lost CONCACAF Nations League (is concerning, but) I still believe in this team, and they have a lot of quality, and I think they can turn things around, especially with the coach Pochettino being in charge and what he did at Southampton and Tottenham.”
    


            While Dempsey has faith in the team's ability to get back on track, he recognizes some players might feel unsettled after the Argentine manager's recent interview where he revealed a desire to manage Spurs again one day.
    


            “I'm not in the dressing room, but at the end of the day, like when I was growing up, my dream was always to represent my country, it didn't matter who the manager was.
    


            “It is unfortunate that there might be question marks around (Pochettino), but at the end of the day, it's on the players to go out there and perform and represent their country and take pride in that,” Dempsey adds, speaking as an ambassador for American Airlines, an official partner of next year's World Cup.
    


            Joint USMNT top scorers Dempsey and Landon Donovan have not shied away from criticizing the current crop of players publicly. They've even gone so far as questioning squad members' commitment to the US badge.
    


            Dempsey recognizes his critiques come with an asterisk; the last time he played for the USMNT was a nightmare 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago that resulted in the US failing to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1986.

            “I've been a part of failures. I mean, 2018, we didn't qualify for the World Cup. It was a huge failure. It was a huge step backwards in the wrong direction, and all you can do is what the players did.”
    


            That failure triggered the influx of many of today's squad with only Christian Pulisic and Tim Ream remaining from the team that was humbled at the hands of the Caribbean nation.
    


            It was that wave of new talent and fresh faces that left some fans calling them “The Baby Eagles.”
    


            The team now boasts a plethora of players who ply their trade at European clubs and who experienced the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup together.
    


            “They fought hard. They qualified for the World Cup (in Qatar). They performed well in the last World Cup, got out of the group, and it looked like a team that was starting to build towards something. But since that World Cup, it looks like we've kind of taken another step back.
    


            “There's been players who are doing really well in Europe. You got Antonee Robinson at Fulham, who's having a great season. You have Christian Pulisic, AC Milan, who's having a great season. You have players like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie.
    


            “I want people to fight for each other. I want there to be competition for spots in the team and maybe things need to be shaken up a little bit in terms of who that starting 11 needs to be,” he tells CNN.
    


            While household names abound, the USMNT's historically deep squad no longer exists and a quick fix is difficult.
    


            “I think when you look back at the history of US men's national team, you normally had a goalie that was playing consistently week in and week out in Europe, whether it was Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. That's not the case for us at the moment.
    


            “(Also) when you think back, we had a number 9 that was solidified (at) that position and could score goals. We don't really have that in our team at the moment.”
    


            While the Texas native hasn't been afraid to voice his concerns, he does, however, push back on the idea that Pulisic's captaincy is one of the problems. The AC Milan winger has increasingly faced scrutiny that he may not be the right type of leader for the Stars and Stripes.
    


            Former manager Gregg Berhalter preferred to rotate the captain's armband among a leadership group – something that came under scrutiny as performances dipped before his dismissal. And despite Pulisic's “Captain America” nickname, Tyler Adams was ultimately named captain for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
    


            Dempsey, however, sees the merits in multiple locker-room leaders: “I think the team is not just one person who is a leader. I think there's multiple people on that team that are leaders.”
    


            He compares the current debate to his experiences at the 2014 Brazil World Cup, saying, “Tim Howard was on that team, and even though I was a captain, I saw him as one of the captains. He was one of the leaders as well, so it takes more than one captain to kind of step up and get everybody on track.”
    


            Despite lethargic performances against the likes of Panama, Canada and traditional rival Mexico, Dempsey believes the biggest problem facing the USMNT in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup is its strength of schedule.
    


            “I mean, Copa América, that's a big competition… and no disrespect to the CONCACAF Nations League, but it's kind of a new tournament that's been made up in the last few years.
    


            “I think the Nations League is kind of hurt. Around the world in terms of even, you know, the European Nations League, it's just the same teams playing each other over and over again. So (for) me as a fan, I think there would be more excitement around seeing other teams.”
    


            No need to start panicking yet, though, USMNT fans. Despite the laundry list of concerns – mentality and passion, Pochettino's potentially wandering eye, a lack of an elite goalkeeper and center forward, and the strength of opponents – Dempsey is adamant “it's not all doom and gloom.”
    


            “There's quality in the side; it's just getting the best out of them. And when your back's against the wall, just kind of fighting for each other.”

With just 15 months to go until the biggest World Cup ever, the USMNT is arguably in crisis. A torrid start to 2025 saw them lose all three games in the CONCACAF Nations League Finals with the pressure building on an underperforming set of players and Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino. The team's all-time joint scorer couldn't hide his concern at the team's recent performances but believes that eventually this squad can come good.

Eder Militao has had a difficult couple of seasons, having suffered back-to-back ACL injuries in 2023 and 2024, that have kept him out on the sidelines for extended period.

The Brazilian ruptured his ACL in November last year, during the game against CA Osasuna. Having undergone surgery, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season given the severity of the injury.

But things have been progressing well with his rehabilitation, and now MARCA reports that Militao is in the final stretch of his recovery.

Indeed, the 27-year-old is getting closer to returning to action for Real Madrid, having been working relentlessly on his recovery. In fact, all signs now point to him being available for Los Blancos' debut in the FIFA Club World Cup on 18 June.

The coaching staff are closely monitoring his progress and are determined not to take unnecessary risks.

However, Militao's recovery has been so positive that his return for the final stretch of the season is no longer a distant hope, it is becoming a realistic objective.

Barring any setbacks in the coming weeks, Real Madrid believe he will be ready to bolster the squad for a tournament they consider prestigious and highly important.

Beyond the physical recovery, Militao has remained emotionally invested in the group. In recent weeks, he has been ever-present around the team, offering support during key matches, celebrating victories, and sharing in the lows as if he were on the pitch.

The centre-back's continued presence has been a quiet but powerful boost inside the dressing room, reinforcing his role as a vital part of the squad.

Carlo Ancelotti and his staff regard the 27-year-old as a key figure in the defensive structure. His return would inject much-needed quality and experience into the side.

While the club will not rush him back under any circumstances, if all goes according to plan, his presence in the United States will be considered a major asset – almost like a new marquee signing ahead of the Club World Cup.

Players' union FIFPRO, Spain's LaLiga and the European leagues' group filed a joint complaint to European Union antitrust regulators earlier in October, accusing FIFA of "calendar abuse".

Critics argue FIFA's revamped quadrennial 32-team Club World Cup and other expanded tournaments will increase the number of matches each season and leave players with little time off between campaigns.

Infantino told CNN that the Club World Cup's impact on player welfare would be limited.

"It is a competition which takes place once every four years. The winner plays seven games, which is like one game and a half, almost, more a year, so it doesn't have a big impact," he added.

"What happens in world soccer is that there are many games for very few teams, very few players. Those who reach maybe the final stages of all competitions, which again is very rare ... So all in all, it balances itself out quite a bit.

"But we're very careful about the calendar and about the health of the players. I mean, we want to do everything for the players to be in the best conditions to perform in the best way ...

"That's what many players tell me as well, what you want is to play rather than to train, right?"

Infantino also said the FIFA taskforce, led by former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, was analysing the impact of the Club World Cup on player welfare.

The Red Devils came back from the dead at Old Trafford on Thursday night but is the 5-4 win over Lyon their finest ever fightback?

"Football, bloody hell!" - What is it about Manchester United and epic European nights? When it comes to the Red Devils, one should always expect the unexpected. Even by United's incredibly high standards, though, what unfolded at Old Trafford on Thursday night was beyond belief.

With Ruben Amorim's side trailing Lyon 4-2 with six minutes of extra time remaining, Rio Ferdinand said on commentary for TNT Sports that his old side needed "more than a miracle". Remarkably, that's exactly what they delivered. United scored three times during a ridiculously chaotic conclusion to triumph 5-4 on the night, and 7-6 on aggregate, to progress to the semi-finals of the Europa League.

It was pure madness.

With the next FIFA World Cup about a year away, American Airlines has bagged an important partnership deal with the tournament, joining as the Official North American Airline Supplier of the event. The carrier says that it is excited to carry fans across North America to experience the excitement of the tournament.



American already flies thousands of daily flights to the host cities of the 2026 event, which will be jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The airline is collaborating with Qatar Airways, which will be FIFA's Global Airline Partner, for several more years.

 American Airlines

 has announced that FIFA has made it the Official North American Airline Supplier of the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Canada, Mexico, and the USA. This is a significant partnership deal for the airline, as the FIFA World Cup is among the most-watched global sports events. American says that the agreement will strengthen the tournament's ties to North America and ensure world-class travel experiences for fans and teams across the USA.    


Dallas, which is the headquarters of American Airlines, is also one of the host cities of the tournament, and the agreement also marks an important collaboration of American Airlines with                             Qatar Airways

 to ensure seamless international and domestic connectivity for all stakeholders throughout the competition. Coincidentally, American is also celebrating its 100th anniversary next year. Caroline Clayton, Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President of Communications of American Airlines, commented,    

“We are proud to partner with FIFA and look forward to connecting fans to all FIFA World Cup 26™ matches. As the home team for this historic event, we look forward to flying fans across North America to experience the passion, energy and diversity of the beautiful game.”

As one of the big three US airlines, American Airlines has a huge network in the country and a significant presence in Mexico and Canada. The FIFA World Cup 26™ tournament will be played in June and July and, for the first time, will involve 48 teams. It will include 104 matches and is expected to be the most attended and watched sporting event in history.

American says that this partnership underscores FIFA's commitment to working with industry leaders to ensure that the FIFA World Cup 26™ sets new standards in terms of access, scale, and fan experience. The carrier also notes that it has more than 2,200 daily flights to the FIFA World Cup 2 host cities currently.

American is also offering loyal AAdvantage® members the opportunity to get tickets to matches through ongoing sweepstakes. Anyone who is 18 and over can sign up once daily on the American Airlines website to try their luck at winning a ticket. Spread across three countries, the tournament will be played at the following locations:

United States

Mexico

Canada

Atlanta

Guadalajara

Toronto

Boston

Mexico City

Vancouver

Dallas

Monterrey

Houston

Kansas City

Los Angeles

Miami

New York/New Jersey

Philadelphia

San Francisco Bay Area

Seattle

Airports across America are already making preparations for the festival of football.

Qatar Airways is the Global Airline Partner for FIFA through 2030. Speaking about the current deal with American Airlines, Qatar Airways' Chief Commercial Officer, Thierry Antinori, said that together, through their expansive networks and world-class loyalty programs, both airlines can offer millions of travelers seamless and convenient travel options during the FIFA World Cup 2026.


Qatar has been a FIFA partner since 2017, and in 2023,     

        
the airline extended its partnership
 about a year after the FIFA World Cup opening game in Qatar in 2022. The deal allowed Qatar to cover several FIFA events, including the two FIFA World Cups (the United States, Mexico, and Canada in 2026 and another in Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, and Uruguay in 2030), as well as all youth men's and women's tournaments.    

While Qatar's partnership with FIFA will run until 2030, other airlines, too, would be keen on partnering with the prestigious sports governing body. The 2034 FIFA World Cup will be held in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps one of the Saudi Arabia-based airlines could become FIFA's next Global Airline Partner.

Real Madrid are reportedly considering three managers to lead their Club World Cup campaign should Carlo Ancelotti leave ahead of the tournament.

Ancelotti's future at the Bernabeu is in doubt following Real's 5-1 aggregate defeat to Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday night.

The 65-year-old is being strongly linked with the Brazil job after Dorival Junior was sacked in the wake of his country's 4-1 humiliation at the hands of rivals Argentina in World Cup qualifying last month.

Reports have claimed Ancelotti could leave Madrid as early as April 26 after the Copa del Rey final. 

Intermediaries have held talks with the Italian with Brazil are keen to install a new coach before the next international window in June rather than waiting until August.

Spanish newspaper Marca have reported that Real Madrid hierarchy are exploring managerial options for the Club World Cup, with the tournament seen as a priority for club president Florentino Perez.

The Spanish giants are claimed to have made Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso their top target for the role on a permanent basis, with the club's former star favourite to return to Madrid in the summer.

While Real Madrid are reportedly considering activating Alonso's release clause, there are doubts over whether the Spaniard would take charge in June.

Alonso would have minimal time with the players ahead of the tournament if he took charge, with La Liga's season ending on May 25 and Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign starting on June 18.

Several Real Madrid players would also feature in international fixtures ahead of the tournament.

Real Madrid chiefs are said to be weighing up whether to place club legend Raul or Santiago Solari in charge on an interim basis as an alternative.

Raul, who scored 323 goals in 741 appearances for Real Madrid, has served as the head coach of their reserve team since 2019.

Solari has been working as Real Madrid's director of football since December 2023, having returned to the club the previous year after being sacked as manager of Mexican side America.

The Argentine, who played 208 times for the club, previously served as Real Madrid manager for five months during the 2018-19 season.

Solari was sacked following a 4-1 home defeat to Ajax which saw the club crash out of the Champions League. 

Real Madrid have won the Club World Cup a record five times in its previous guise, with the summer's tournament in the United States the first under FIFA's expanded 32-team format.

Los Blancos will face Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, Pachuca from Mexico and Austria's Red Bull Salzburg in the group stages.

Fifa is facing complex negotiations with the US authorities before the Club World Cup after failing to secure tax exemptions for the 32 competing clubs.

The world governing body announced a huge prize fund for the tournament of $1bn (£754m) in March, including up to $125.8m for the winners, but without tax agreements clubs could be left with bills of tens of millions of dollars to the US tax authorities on top of tax payable in their home countries. At least 29 clubs from outside the US, including Chelsea and Manchester City, will be competing.

Fifa has obtained exemptions from a range of taxes for the 2026 World Cup games in the US, with competing nations exempted from many city, state and ticket-sales taxes, but with the schedule for the Club World Cup put together at shorter notice it has been unable to secure similar dispensation. The 12 venues were announced only in late September, less than nine months before the tournament.

Fifa is also grappling with other complexities, such as the differing tax rates between states, which could result in clubs losing out by virtue of where they have played. For example in Florida, home to two Club World Cup venues in Miami and Orlando, there is no state income tax. Most other cities which will stage matches are subject to a state income tax, although the rates vary from 3% in Pennsylvania to 7% in California.

Paris Saint-Germain play two of their three group games in Los Angeles so could end up the worst affected. Manchester City could also cash in because their final group fixture is against Juventus in Orlando, whereas Chelsea's group matches are in Pennsylvania and Atlanta, where income tax is 5.5%.

In another complication some US states do not recognise the federal government's “double taxation treaties” with other countries, which prevent individuals and companies being taxed twice for their earnings by different regimes. This anomaly could lead to certain clubs being hit financially but not others. Fifa is pressing for a solution which ensures they are all treated fairly.

It is understood to be confident of achieving that, having made great efforts in recent months to get close to important US decision makers. Gianni Infantino met Donald Trump twice in March and took the new Club World Cup trophy to the Oval Office, and last week Fifa's president visited the FBI.

Fifa declined to comment but sources with knowledge of the negotiations said it was supporting the competing clubs while complying with US tax rules.

Although the size of the prize pot, funded by a global TV deal with the streaming company Dazn, has led to concerns that the money could destabilise domestic leagues, Fifa is confident this will not prove to be the case. A significant proportion of the prize money will be swallowed up by tax bills, player bonuses and other operational costs, and for the biggest earning European clubs their Club World Cup income is replacing revenue they would have made from summer tours.

Fifa is allocating appearance and prize money according to a complex formula based on each club's historical performances and the size of their local market, but essentially the biggest European clubs will get paid most.

Chelsea and City will receive $38.19m before tax and expenses just for turning up, and clubs will get $2m for each group-stage win, $7.5m for reaching the last 16, $13.1m for reaching the quarter-finals, $21m for getting to the semi-finals and $40m for winning the final, with $30m for the runner-up.

Fifa has committed to assigning $250m of the $1bn Club World Cup fund to solidarity payments to clubs across the world not taking part. It is also paying $1m to each of the 11 host cities as a legacy payment.

Breaking news for everyone's consumption

Scientists have described the types of illness suffered by people who sought medical care during the latest soccer world cup in Qatar.

Researchers retrieved stool testing data from attendees of the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as long-term residents and Qatari nationals.

Qatar hosted the FIFA World Cup from Nov. 20 to Dec. 18, 2022. During this period, 1.4 million visitors arrived in the country. Scientists used stool testing data from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, that covered people who went to any health care facility with gastrointestinal illness.

Among 2,179 samples tested, one or more organisms were identified in 424 cases. The most frequent bacteria detected were Salmonella and E. coli.

Transmission pathwaysAccording to the study published in IJID Regions, an official journal of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID), the most common reasons for testing were acute diarrhea/gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, screening/surveillance of contacts, and fever.

Researchers did not investigate the routes of infection acquisition so it is unclear whether positive findings are because of eating behaviors or direct or indirect physical contact.

In a separate commentary on the study, two other researchers said the work lacks an in-depth analysis of food safety measures implemented during the event.

“Given the high volume of international attendees consuming food from various sources, including vendors and official catering services, a detailed assessment of food hygiene standards and possible contamination points should have been included,” they said. 

The main study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar, which was the national reference laboratory for microbiology testing.

HMC had rapid medical evaluation units at the eight stadiums where matches were held. Additional units were set up at multiple fan zones, which were publicly accessible areas hosting activities throughout the tournament.

Main agents detectedMedian age of tested individuals was 31 with a range of 5 to 45 years old, 59 percent were males, and 1,616 were non-Qatari nationals. Three-quarters of the people who underwent stool testing were not from Qatar.

A total of 424 samples tested positive for at least one organism by culture or PCR, with at least one bacterium identified in 393, virus in 33, and parasite in 12 of the individuals.

Of the 463 bacterial isolates, the most common organisms included Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Salmonella was found 185 times, E. coli 119 times, and Shigella on 41 occasions.

Among the viruses detected, the most common were norovirus 13 times, Sapovirus eight times and Astrovirus seven times. Of the 12 parasites found, seven were Cryptosporidium and five were Giardia. Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis is often self-limited, which may have led people to not seek medical care, said scientists.

“In summary, the number of individuals who sought care and underwent stool testing during FIFA 2022 was low. During the entire event, a total of 2,179 individuals underwent stool testing of the 1.4 million visitors who entered Qatar during that period. It is possible that some individuals with mild or moderate symptoms may not have sought care and recovered without any formal medical intervention. It is also possible that stool testing was not ordered for some individuals who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Bacteria were more frequently isolated than viruses,” said researchers.

Griekspoor previously sent Zverev packing in his opening BNP Paribas Open match last month, a significant moment for the 28-year-old who put an end to his 0-18 record against Top 5 opponents.In the opening set of their Munich showdown, Griekspoor denied the two-time champion a chance to serve it out when he saved two break points at 5-5. Having closed out the tie-break on his third opportunity, the world No. 37 then seized the first break of the contest to launch the second set.Griekspoor eventually put himself in position to cross the finish line, but blinked with the match on his racquet as Zverev broke back at 15 to level for 5-5. He had a chance to regain control early the decider, before the top seed staved off four break points to hold for 2-2. Zverev broke three games later and though Griekspoor would save three match points to reach 4-5, the home favorite had no problem wrapping up the comeback win.“Extremely happy with how I hung in there, especially in the third set being 0-40 down in my second service game. Proud to win this match.”

World No 2 Carlos Alcaraz will face Arthur Fils in semi-finals of Barcelona Open after overcoming Alex de Minaur; Fils progresses after injury retirement of Stefanos Tsitsipas; watch the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Friday 18 April 2025 17:50, UK

Carlos Alcaraz is through to the semi-finals of the Barcelona Open after defeating Australia's Alex de Minaur in straight sets 7-5 6-3.

A two-time winner of the ATP Tour 500 event in 2022 and 2023, Spaniard Alcaraz will face 20-year-old Frenchman Arthur Fils for a place in the final, after Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas was forced to retire from their semi-final later on Friday at 2-0 down in the first set.

Denmark's Holger Rune and Karen Khachanov of Russia will contest the other semi-final ahead of the final on Sunday at the Pista Rafa Nadal, live on Sky Sports Tennis. 

Rune defeated Norway's Casper Ruud 6-4 6-4 to make the last four, while Khachanov beat Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4 7-5.

"I started quite badly with the serve, I was struggling a little bit mentally with it," said Alcaraz, who won 57 per cent of first-serve points in the opening set.

"It was just the first few games with my serve, then I think I improved a lot. I calmed myself down and started to think positively again.

"Alex started strong, playing aggressively, and the first set was really tight.

 The BMW Open by Bitpanda may have taken a big step forward in 2025, but that does not mean the clay-court event is ready to forget its roots. 

 The tournament, which is being held as an ATP 500 for the first time this year, remains in its long-term home, Munich's Iphitos Tennis Club. The expansion of club-based events often presents significant challenges, especially when it comes to maintaining the ‘up-close-and-personal' atmosphere that often makes them so beloved. Yet tournament director Patrik Kuhnen believes he and his team have struck a healthy early balance with the new-look BMW Open by Bitpanda. 

 “Our ‘DNA' for the past years being a 250 tournament was always ‘touch-and-feel' tennis for the fans and players,” Kuhnen, a former No. 43 in the PIF ATP Rankings, told ATPTour.com in Munich. “For the fans to really have a chance to watch practice sessions, be really close to the players, and get a sense of the emotions and how the players practise. Also to be close to the matches and to have this experience on a very unique club atmosphere level. 

 “Even with a new category, we want to maintain that atmosphere as well as possible. I think for this year, what I have heard from spectators is that we have managed to keep our spirit or ‘vibe' of the tournament also in the 500 category.” 

 

 The BMW Open by Bitpanda is one of three former ATP 250s (also Dallas and Doha) that have been upgraded to ATP 500 level as part of the ATP's OneVision strategic plan. According to top seed, home favourite and defending champion Alexander Zverev, the efforts made by Kuhnen and his team to justify that change are clear to see. 

 “I think they've done an amazing job,” said Zverev. “They've upgraded centre court, and the players' village is amazing. They're also going to build a completely new centre court with a roof in a couple of years' time. So they're really taking care of it. They really took it seriously, the upgrade. And it's definitely nice to see.” 

 Upon entering the tournament grounds, it does not take long to see the biggest element of the new-look Munich set up. A temporary 6,500-seat stadium court has been erected in front of the clubhouse, contributing to the feeling of traditional infrastructure being blended into a world-class event. 

 “The centre court is beautiful,” said Zverev. “It's bigger, it's much bigger, and it's a different place. Before, it was nice. It was small and very family-like. But the tournament has been sold out over the past few years, and it's sold out again with the bigger stadium. So the upgrade was definitely a positive thing.”

 Kuhnen explained that the new location of centre court was at the heart of the tournament upgrade, while there have also been some key improvements for players, including an expanded warm-up area and a spacious pop-up dining area with a wooden façade inspired by traditional Bavarian architecture. 

 “Having the centre court in the heart of the club, that's what we wanted, and that's what we needed,” he said. “We now also have four match courts and many practice courts as well for the players to prepare, which is not new, but for the players, the whole dining area, the dining experience has changed. A new location. We used to have a two-storey tent. Now we have created a whole new VIP player-dining experience and it is a huge upgrade. We have gone through the standards required and I think we ticked many boxes.” 



 Plenty of debutants came to Munich for the tournament's ATP 500 debut, including Ben Shelton and Francisco Cerundolo, both of whom are through to the semi-finals. Others, such as German doubles star Kevin Krawietz, are more familiar with the event. 

 “Munich always feels like home because I live here,” said Krawietz, a former champion in the Bavarian city who is competing this year alongside Tim Puetz. “I think the new stadium is unbelievably nice. For me, when they said, ‘We are building a new stadium', I was worried it might lose the flair, but they did it well. Also the players' restaurant has a little bit of Bavarian tradition, done in the style of a wooden house. I think it's awesome.”

 There is more to come from the BMW Open by Bitpanda, too. Plans are already being made for a new, permanent stadium, complete with a retractable roof. It is a further significant step for an event that this year sold out for all nine days, including two days of qualifying. 

“We have more spectators this year, and to integrate this into the club atmosphere, transitioning to a 500 tournament, was kind of a challenge," said Kuhnen. "But it was a challenge we liked and wanted to have, obviously. We had to create some new ideas, a new look into where we want to go. But so far so good. Everything I hear from spectators and players so far is only very positive.”

 Serena Williams  dropped the first set 5-7 against compatriot Caty McNally in the second round of the 2019 US Open. But Williams, as expected, turned the table, restricting McNally to four games in the next two sets.

McNally, the two-time US Open finalist in doubles, recently participated at the Charleston Open. After playing in the qualifying round, she came from a set down to knock out  Anhelina Kalinina  but fell in straight sets to 14th seed  Anna Kalinskaya .

McNally, during the Inside-In Tennis Podcast, recalled the lone match she played against the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. She said that the crowd backing her over Williams made her throw her arms up in the air upon winning the first set, which she regretted.

Yeah, I won the first set, I think I like threw my arms up. I don't even know why I threw my arms up. I think I was just like, it was just pure adrenaline. I shouldn't have done that.

McNally now hopes to tell her kids in the future that she was successful in defeating Williams in a set, as it was one of the memorable moments of her career. Williams, after beating McNally was making bid stride toward her 24th Grand Slam singles title. She reached the summit clash but was unsuccessful in clinching the title as Canada's  Bianca Andreescu  beat her in straight sets.

Serena Williams made a surprising appearance at the Super Bowl LIX. She performed the crip walk to  Kendrick Lamar  ‘s Drake diss track Not Like Us. During the match between Philadephia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs,  Taylor Swift also was cheering for her boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.

Williams, who showed her support for Swift after the American popstar was booed by a section of the fans, did not meet the 35-year-old. She, along with husband Alexis Ohanian were eager to meet Swift to get her autograph for their seven-year-old daughter Olympia.

I'm such a mom. I was ready to go in here myself and be like, ‘Taylor, come get this girl'. It's hard when your team is losing. I totally get it.

Chiefs lost the match 22-40. Williams' performance garnered both praise and criticism as many believed she performed the dance to take a dig at Drake, who she reportedly dated.

Jannik Sinner received a three-month doping ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) after both parties reached the case resolution. Serena Williams, during the same interview with TIME, said she has no doubts about Sinner's innocence and suggested that the anti-doping agencies would have banned her had she become a victim of accidental contamination.

If I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let's be honest.

Sinner, tested positive for clostebol twice last year, and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) gave a no-fault or negligence verdict, shocking the entire tennis world, for many were convinced that Sinner voided a ban because he is a top player. Then WADA interfered and approached the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to demand a ban of between one to two years.

After Sinner's victory at the Australian Open this year, WADA announced that they withdrew their appeal and handed Sinner only a three-month ban. The three-time Grand Slam champion, who started his training in Monte Carlo, will make his comeback at the Italian Open, which starts on May 7. Sinner is prohibited from official tournaments till May 4.

Carlos Alcaraz, the rising star of tennis, is gearing up for an action-packed schedule leading up to Wimbledon. The Spanish sensation has his sights set on defending his title at Roland Garros after an impressive victory in 2024, where he showcased his remarkable talent and resilience on the court.

Following the Barcelona ATP 500, Alcaraz will be showcasing his skills at the Mutua Madrid Open and the Rome Masters 1000 before heading to the French Open. The young ace will face the pressure of defending his championship title at Roland Garros, where he emerged victorious in a thrilling final against Alexander Zverev last year.

Not one to shy away from a challenge, Alcaraz has also confirmed his participation in the prestigious Queen's Club tournament. This will be his third appearance at the tournament, with his previous victory in 2023 propelling him towards his first Wimbledon triumph.

Despite facing setbacks in the past, including an early exit at Queen's last year, Alcaraz remains undeterred and is determined to make his mark once again on the grass courts. The Queen's Club serves as the perfect platform for Alcaraz to fine-tune his game ahead of Wimbledon, a tournament he has his eyes set on for further success.

Analysts have been impressed by Alcaraz's versatility and talent, drawing comparisons to tennis greats like Rafael Nadal. The young Spaniard has defied expectations and continues to impress with his exceptional skills on both clay and grass courts, solidifying his position as a formidable force in the world of tennis.

Mouratoglou believes that Carlos Alcaraz's ability to win when not at his best is one of the Spaniard's best qualities 

Carlos Alcaraz was without a title since Wimbledon 2024 – that was until the 2025 Monte-Carlo Masters, where he defeated Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in the final.

Patrick Mouratoglou believes that the Spaniard's ability to be victorious when not at his best is one of Alcaraz's best qualities, and is one which puts him at the top of the men's game.

“The victory of Carlos Alcaraz is very interesting for many reasons,” states the renowned coach. “He was struggling big time, missing so much, but he dug incredibly deep to win that one. It's one of his best qualities that no one names.”

Sixth seed Holger Rune produced the type of ‘explosive' performance he was looking for Friday to oust defending Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell champion Casper Ruud, 6-4, 6-2, in the quarterfinals.Rune jumped out with the first four games before Ruud settled into the contest. But after serving out the opening set, the Dane once again surged to a double-break lead in set two for a decisive 88-minute victory.

Rune jumped out with the first four games before Ruud settled into the contest. But after serving out the opening set, the Dane once again surged to a double-break lead in set two for a decisive 88-minute victory.

It cemented Rune's second win in eight career meetings with his Scandinavian counterpart, a stat he thanked for being played up going into this latest encounter.“It's no secret that ATP made a big deal about it on social media, our head to head. So thanks for that,” Rune told ATP Media on court afterwards.“But I just saw it as another match. Casper, I have bunch of respect for him, He's a great player and I'm very happy to be able to beat him today. I think I played on my terms. I was very explosive and this is the way I want to play.”

Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have cracked the code to tennis longevity in a way previous generations could only dream of. These three legends of the sport have revolutionized the game with a “hack” that has kept them dominating well into their 30s and beyond.

Jim Courier, a former world No 1, delved into the secret during an interview, shedding light on how Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic strategically managed their schedules to ensure peak performance and extended careers. While players like Pete Sampras, Courier himself, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, and Jimmy Connors pushed relentlessly without breaks, the Big Three approached their careers with a different mindset.

Federer, who retired at the age of 41 after an illustrious career, set the standard for scheduling breaks to recharge and avoid burnout. This approach allowed him to stay competitive and enjoy a prolonged tenure in the sport. Nadal, at 38, bid farewell to his professional career after 23 years, while Djokovic, nearing 38, continues to excel and is ranked fifth globally.

The concept of strategically skipping tournaments to prioritize rest and recovery has been a game-changer. By understanding the importance of balancing physical and mental well-being, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic have rewritten the rules of tennis success. Their ability to listen to their bodies and minds has propelled them to new heights and prolonged their careers in ways unprecedented in previous eras.

While Sampras called it quits at 31, Courier retired at 29, highlighting the stark difference in approach between the past and current tennis superstars. The Big Three's method of self-care and selective tournament participation has not only prolonged their careers but also elevated the level of competition and inspired future generations of players.

The legacy of Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic extends beyond their numerous titles and records; it's a testament to their strategic brilliance and foresight in managing their careers. As the tennis world marvels at their continued success, one thing is clear – the hack they've discovered has forever changed the game.

Jannik Sinner's three-month suspension is almost over. The world No. 1 is set to return to action this May at the Italian Open and is already back on the practice courts in Monte Carlo. However, the controversy surrounding his case continues to spark debate. It was Serena Williams who reignited the conversation in a recent interview with Time Magazine, and her comments quickly went viral.

On one hand, she praised Sinner's talent and his importance to men's tennis; on the other, she strongly criticized the way the case was handled–igniting heated discussion among fans and raising broader concerns about fairness and consistency in professional sport.

In her interview, Serena Williams was candid. While she expressed admiration for Sinner, she didn't hold back in pointing out what she sees as a double standard:

“I love the guy, I love this game. He's great for the sport. But if I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let's be honest. I would have had Grand Slams taken away from me.”

Her words highlighted long-standing frustrations over how disciplinary actions can vary drastically depending on an athlete's status, gender, or history.

Williams also mentioned former rival Maria Sharapova–who was suspended for 15 months in 2016 after testing positive for a banned substance–as an emotional comparison:

“Just weirdly and oddly, I can't help but think about Maria all this time. I can't help but feel for her.”

Sharapova was banned after testing positive for Meldonium, a drug she said she had been using for years and didn't realize had been added to the banned list. The reference adds emotional weight to Serena's remarks and draws attention to how similar cases can result in very different outcomes.

Of course, the two situations are very different: Sinner did not intentionally use Clostebol, while Sharapova claimed she was unaware of the rule change. Still, both athletes proclaimed their innocence–and both have become central figures in the ongoing conversation about equality and accountability in sport.

Serena Williams was actually not the first athlete to comment the Clostebol case and how it was handled. Italian Olympic swimmer Federica Pellegrini had already voiced her concerns earlier in an interview with La Repubblica, stating:

“Sinner was treated differently from 99% of other athletes. Jannik is much loved and therefore defended in every aspect. But… it becomes my responsibility if a physio uses a cream and I test positive. That applies to everyone.”

Jannik Sinner's former coach Riccardo Piatti has predicted that the world No 1 will turn the “very unpleasant” situation of his doping ban into “something positive.”

Piatti played an integral role in Sinner's development as a player, having coached the Italian from the age of 13 until 20. Sinner chose to end the collaboration in February 2022.

Sinner has been unable to play since defending his Australian Open title in January due to a three-month doping suspension that started on February 9 and runs until May 4.

The Italian tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol twice in March 2024 — during and after the Indian Wells Masters.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed in August that Sinner would not serve a ban after an independent tribunal ruled he carried “no fault or negligence.”

Sinner explained that the substance had entered his body when receiving a massage from his former physio, Giacomo Naldi, who had used a spray containing the steroid to treat a cut on his own finger.

However, WADA appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the verdict in September as they initially sought to impose a ban of between one and two years on the world No 1.

The appeal was set to be heard at CAS in April, but WADA announced in February it had reached an agreement with Sinner's legal team for him to serve a three-month ban.

The 23-year-old has missed tournaments in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, while he will also be unable to play the upcoming Madrid Open.

The Italian is set to make his comeback on home soil at the Masters 1000 tournament in Rome, which will begin on May 7. Sinner has also added the ATP 500 in Hamburg to his schedule prior to the French Open.

Speaking to SuperTennis TV, Piatti suggested Sinner has a plan to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam by winning the remaining three majors in 2025.

“This whole situation has been very unpleasant for Sinner, but I'm sure he'll turn it into something positive,” said Piatti.

“I think Jannik has a very important card up his sleeve in the coming months to win Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open.”

The Italian added: “I'm sure that during these months of hiatus, Jannik hasn't stopped.

“During the pandemic, for example, it was one of the most important moments of growth for him. He trained physically three times a week and played tennis every day.”

The 31-year-old Frenchwoman skipped this week's Rouen Open after second round defeats in Indian Wells and Miami and is also a doubt for the Rome event during the build-up to the year's second Grand Slam from May 25 to June 8.

Garcia, who won the WTA Finals in 2022 and reached the US Open semi-finals that year, has often carried French hopes for a home-grown women's singles champion at Roland Garros, but she has not crossed the quarter-final hurdle at the major.

"After more tests on my back, it's clear I won't be able to play in Madrid," Garcia wrote on social media on Friday.

"I need to take some time for treatment and recovery. I'll do everything I can to be ready for Rome, but the main goal is to arrive strong and healthy for Roland Garros."

Garcia had prematurely ended her 2024 season in September due to anxiety and panic attacks. The world number 99 said being injured early in the current campaign was difficult to accept.

"After the break last year, I came back feeling happier, clearer and more motivated. The results weren't there yet, but I truly believed in the path I was on. This setback hurts - but I'll use it to come back stronger," she added.

"Right now, it's about controlling what I can, keeping perspective and finding ways to embrace the journey - even on the hard days.

"Paris is still the dream... I'll keep fighting for it."

Carlos Alcaraz has asserted that the one-week Masters 1000 tournaments are “better for tennis” as he questioned the ATP's move away from the original format.

In 2023, the ATP Tour extended the Masters 1000 events in Madrid, Rome and Shanghai to two weeks (12 days) and increased the number of players in the singles draws to 96.

Last year, the same expansion was applied to tournaments in Indian Wells, Miami and Shanghai, while it will also be introduced at the 2025 editions of the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open.

Prior to the changes, seven of the nine Masters tournaments were played over a week and featured 56-player singles draws, with Indian Wells and Miami each lasting 10 days.

The Masters events in Monte Carlo and Paris are the only two tournaments in this category that will retain the single-week format.

Alcaraz won the title in Monte Carlo last week to conclude what was arguably the most entertaining event on the ATP Tour so far this year.

Some felt that the tournament was a reminder that the one-week Masters format provides a superior spectacle, with higher-quality matches contested from the opening round. There was a similar sentiment expressed during the 2024 Paris Masters.

Conversely, many players and fans have been critical of the new Masters 1000 schedule, with Alcaraz the latest to weigh in.

Speaking in his press conference after reaching the Barcelona Open quarter-finals, Alcaraz was asked about the debate over the different Masters formats.

“The one week ones are better. Some will think that in two weeks there are days of rest, but that is not the case,” the four-time major winner said.

“You train, you have to mentally prepare for the game, prepare for it… you're not resting, really. It's two full weeks. That's why I prefer the one-week Masters 1000. For me, it's better for tennis.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas has been the most outspoken critic of the two-week Masters 1000 format.

In a post on X after the Paris Masters last year, the Greek wrote: “The two-week Masters 1000s have turned into a drag. The quality has definitely dropped.

“Players aren't getting the recovery or training time they need, with constant matches and no space for the intense work off the court.

“It's ironic that the @atptour committed to this format without knowing if it could actually improve the schedule, but the quality likewise. Paris got it right, done in a week. Exciting and easy to follow. Just how it's supposed to be.

“If the goal was to ease the calendar, extending every 1000 to two weeks is a backwards move. Sometimes, it feels like they're fixing what wasn't broken.”

       Casper Ruud spoke about his chances of winning Roland Garros following Rafael Nadal's retirement. The Spanish legend won an astonishing 14 titles at the French Open – the most by any player at a single Grand Slam – and holds a near-perfect 112–4 record (97%) at the tournament.  


      Nadal won his 14th Roland Garros title in 2022 (also the last major of his career), defeating Ruud in the final with a dominant 6–3, 6–3, 6–0 scoreline. That was the Norwegian's first major final out of the three he's reached so far, although he's still chasing his maiden Grand Slam title.  


      Ruud has 12 career titles, 11 of them on clay, including his biggest win last year at the ATP 500 Barcelona Open – where he is now the defending champion. This week, he has already scored wins over Daniel Elahi Galán and Hamad Medjedovic to reach the quarterfinals.  


      In an interview with Marca, the former world No. 2 shared his thoughts on possibly lifting the Roland Garros trophy. With two finals and one semifinal in the past three editions (17–3 record since 2022), Ruud is considered one of the favourites this year. But does Nadal's absence make his path easier?  


      "Yes and no. I don't know what it feels like to win Roland Garros, but I've played two finals and I know it's going to be tough whether Rafa is there or not," said the Norwegian. "Obviously, statistically speaking, it should be easier to win in Paris without Rafa, because he won it 14 times. We all lost to him at some point. Alcaraz won it last year and could win it again. Zverev and Tsitsipas have been finalists, Sinner will be back... There are many who can win, and I hope to be one of them."  


      Ruud will face Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open quarterfinals on Saturday as he looks to defend his title and stay inside the top 10. However, Ruud himself admits he's not obsessed with rankings: "It's better not to think about it too much. I know rankings go up and down.   


      "I've been in the top 10 for most of the last three years. I know if I don't win in Barcelona, I'll drop out of the top 10. But I still have chances in Madrid or Rome. I'm not stressed about the ranking — if I fall out of the top 10, my life won't change."

Novak Djokovic is one without doubt one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and he's enjoyed a magnificent career. 

The Serbian player has won 24 Grand Slam titles to date, and he's currently in pursuit of a 25th, and it's impossible to rule him out of the reckoning whenever a major tournament comes to town. 

Djokovic lost to Alejandro Talibo in Monte Carlo last week and has chosen not to play in the Barcelona Open, which is taking place this week ahead of the Madrid Open next week. 

Djokovic claimed his first Grand Slam title way back in 2008 when he was crowned the Australian Open champion, and it's quite remarkable just how long he's managed to sustain a place in the higher echelons of the sport. 

Tsonga burst onto the scene in 2008 when he reached the final of the Melbourne-based Grand Slam, where he came up against Djokovic who had also never won a major crown. 

Before the final, Djokovic was quizzed on the Frenchman. He was a new kid on the block in tennis terms and had never really made waves at a Grand Slam before that year. 

The Serb was in the mood to praise his fellow finalist and compared him to one of boxing's most decorated legendary figures

Djokovic said in his press conference: “Well, you know, I think everybody's surprised with the way he plays. 

“And I think – I knew that he's a good player with a lot of potential and a lot of talent. He's been struggling with some injuries. But he's coming back big time, really. 

“He reminds me of Muhammad Ali in his best days. And he looks like him, actually.

“But he's been playing some great tennis, really. And he's a really nice guy, so I'm happy for him.”

This was as good as it got for the Frenchman when it came to the four big events on the professional circuit. 

At the 2008 Australian Open, Tsonga came through a tough match against Rafael Nadal in the last four and perhaps he will view this major as the one that he simply had to win. 

Tsonga was beaten 6-4, 4-6, 3-6, 6-7 by Djokovic and although he reached the semi-final of a major on five further occasions, he never managed to get himself back into a final. 

Tsonga playing in a different generation might have won several of the game's top titles, but playing alongside the big three in their pomp made life incredibly difficult for him as it did many other players. 

Still, not many tennis stars can claim to have been compared to an icon like Ali and those words must have made Tsonga feeling like he could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.

The world number two stepped up a gear from his first-round win over Ethan Quinn to dispatch his 80th-ranked opponent on the Catalan clay as he prepares for his French Open title defence.

Alcaraz, who triumphed at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, has had an inconsistent start to the year and in March fell at the first hurdle in the Miami Open.

Home favourite Alcaraz saved both break points he faced in a first-set stroll, with Djere unable to produce a single winner, to the Spaniard's eight.

The four-time Grand Slam winner won five games straight to claim a 5-1 first-set lead and sealed it with his second set point.

In the second set, Djere offered more of a fight and even broke for a 4-2 lead, but Alcaraz bounced back quickly.

Djere could not handle the Spaniard in full flow and crumbled away as Alcaraz won the final four games to triumph, sealing his win when the Serb pushed a shot into the net.

"After going 4-2 down in the second, I played a bit more like what my level is," said Alcaraz.

"I am very happy that I could step up my level, and seem more like my best, and I want to continue."

Alcaraz will face world number seven Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Friday. The Aussie eased past Briton Jacob Fearnley 6-1, 6-2 later on Thursday.

Earlier, in-form Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated world number eight Andrey Rublev 7-5, 6-4.

The Spaniard, ranked 30th, had never beaten the Russian before but triumphed at the sixth time of asking in straight sets.

Monte Carlo Masters semi-finalist Davidovich Fokina broke three times in a topsy-turvy first set, with Rublev twice reacting before the Malaga native held to love in the 12th game.

Rublev went a break down in the first game of the second set, but despite securing one of his own for 2-2, he was once again broken as Davidovich Fokina took a 5-4 lead and then served out for the match, again to love.

Spain's Jaume Munar came up short against Karen Khachanov, who also won 7-5, 6-4, and will face Davidovich Fokina in the next round.

The Russian, who trains in Barcelona, only converted four of 15 break points but eventually put the battling Munar to bed.

Rafael Nadal is to be honoured for his achievements at the French Open with a ceremony at this year's tournament.

The 38-year-old Spaniard, a 14-time Roland Garros champion, retired in November last year.

Organisers confirmed on Thursday that a ceremony will be held on the Philippe-Chatrier Court on the opening Sunday, May 25, after the day's matches have been completed.

Gilles Moretton, the president of the French Tennis Federation, also revealed plans for Nadal to take up an ambassadorial role at Roland Garros.

"Here we announce something that seemed a priority to us, to first pay tribute to Rafael Nadal," he said.

"It's a love story. I think it's important to talk about a love story because he has deep respect for the tournament, for clay, and we have the same respect for the player, for the ambassador he can become for Roland Garros and for the federation."

Nadal won the last of his 22 Grand Slam titles at Roland Garros in 2022.

His final appearance at the Paris tournament was last year when, as an unseeded player, he was unlucky to draw the then world No4 Alexander Zverev in the first round and was beaten 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.

Zverev became only the third player, along with Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic (twice), to beat Nadal at the French Open, with his incredible win-loss record standing at 112-4.

Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo said the precise details of the tribute are being kept under wraps.

"Rafa has of course marked the history of Roland Garros in many different ways and his 14 titles will perhaps remain unequalled in a Grand Slam tournament," she said.

"He will not be playing this year at Roland Garros, but he will be very present by our side for this 2025 edition.

"Rafa has an important bond with Roland Garros. We want it to be a surprise."

Mauresmo also confirmed there will be tributes paid to Mary Pierce to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her victory, and to another French player, 38-year-old Richard Gasquet, who will retire after the tournament.

Speaking at the annual pre-tournament press conference at Roland Garros, Mauresmo revealed the prize money this year has increased by just over five per cent to €56.3million (£48.36m).

It was confirmed the tournament will persist with using line judges rather than the electronic line calling used at the other three Grand Slams.

Mauresmo also revealed a fan zone for 5,000 people will open on the Place de la Concorde from June 4 to June 9, from the quarter-finals to the finals.

Jannik Sinner will return to tennis next month at his home tournament in Rome.

World number one Sinner was banned from tennis for three months earlier this year, forcing him to skip several big tournaments.

The Italian won the only event he played before receiving the ban, as Sinner beat Alexander Zverev in the final of the Australian Open.

Sinner will return to action at his home Italian Open next month, where he will compete as the number one seed.

Ahead of his return to competition, Sinner trained with one of his fellow top-ten ATP stars in Monte-Carlo.

World number one Sinner trained in an indoor clay court facility with British star Jack Draper on Thursday, as he prepares to return to action.

The pair have become friends over recent years, with Draper defending Sinner when he received his ban from tennis in February.

“I know Jannik [Sinner], he is a good friend, I know with this whole thing, I am sure he would not have done something intentional,” said Draper in an interview with Sky Sports.

“I do not think it is good for the sport that the number one player in the world and someone who is doing incredible things is having a ban, but he will be back shortly, and I wish him all the best and hope he is going to be okay.”

Sinner and Draper have played twice before on the ATP Tour, with the head-to-head level at 1-1.

At last year's US Open, Sinner beat Draper to advance to the final at Flushing Meadows, as the Brit suffered from illness throughout the match.

It was Draper who came out on top three years earlier when the pair battled it out on the grass at the Queen's Club Championships.

Sinner's lead at the top of the world rankings is a sizeable one, currently heading his closest challenger, Carlos Alcaraz, by 2,210 points.

That gap could yet close, however, as the Spaniard continues to impress on the clay courts, having won the Monte-Carlo Masters last week.

If Alcaraz were to win both the Barcelona Open and Madrid Open, tournaments he has had success at before, he would narrow the deficit to Sinner to just 710 points.

Therefore, in this hypothetical scenario, Sinner could potentially lose the world number one ranking if the Spaniard were to win the Italian Open.

The likelihood of Alcaraz winning three consecutive tournaments is, of course, slim, and even if he were to become world number one, he would be up against it trying to hold onto the top spot.

Winning the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments last summer, Alcaraz accumulated 4,000 points, leaving him a lot to defend in 2025.

Only time will tell if we will see Alcaraz reclaim the number one ranking from Sinner in 2025, but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Alcaraz and Sinner will take to the court in Rome for the Italian Open, which begins on May 7.

Spain has long been a tennis powerhouse, producing legends like Manuel Santana, Carlos Moyá, and Albert Costa. Rafael Nadal stands as the crown jewel of Spanish tennis, with a career that rewrote the sport's history. Today, young sensation Carlos Alcaraz carries the torch, aiming to cement his place among the all-time greats. Yet, among the stars, there's a story often overlooked—that of Roberto Carretero, a talented player whose career was derailed by injuries.

Carretero, who captured the junior title at Roland Garros in 1993, was hailed as a future clay-court star. However, injuries and mental health struggles forced him to retire at just 26 years old. Despite his abbreviated career, Carretero remains connected to the sport, contributing as a broadcaster and staying active in the tennis community.

Roberto Carretero first made headlines in 1993 when he won the Roland Garros junior title, a moment he described as life-changing. “That moment changed my life,” Carretero told Relevo in 2024. “Until then, my parents had financed my career. Winning Roland Garros at 17 transformed everything, both financially and professionally. I wasn't even the favorite, but I went there and won”.

Transitioning to the professional circuit proved more challenging. By 1996, Carretero achieved his lone ATP title, winning the Hamburg Masters 1000 in a surprising run. “The transition from junior to pro wasn't easy,” he explained. “It took longer for me than for players like Albert Costa or Marcelo Ríos. Hamburg came out of nowhere—I wasn't even a favorite. I played qualifiers and went on an incredible run”.

Carretero's career was plagued by injuries, particularly recurring shoulder issues that required four surgeries. The constant setbacks left him ranked no higher than 53 in the ATP standings and eventually led to his early retirement. Reflecting on his struggles, Carretero shared, “I've had shoulder problems since I was 13, and in this sport, if you don't have continuity, it's incredibly tough”.

He also opened up about the mental health challenges he faced. “What today is diagnosed as mental health issues wasn't even recognized back then. People just said, ‘What's wrong with this guy?' But I was dealing with something very real. I started doubting myself, thinking I wasn't cut out for this, even though I had top-ten potential. That's a hard thing for a 20-year-old to handle”.

Despite an 11-year age gap, Carretero and Rafael Nadal share a close bond. “Rafa is a great person and a great friend,” Carretero said. “I've known him since he was 14. We've shared a lot of moments together. As a tennis player, he's a true example at every level. If we're talking about role models, he's possibly the greatest”.

Carretero also explained why he places Nadal above Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in tennis history. “Federer is flawless on the court, but given how good he is, he's won relatively little. Djokovic never misses, never gets injured. But Rafa? He's had to overcome so much—injuries, adversity, and more. He's had to be more strategic and work harder than anyone to reach the top. For me, that puts him above the rest”.

Since retiring in 2001, Carretero has stayed deeply involved in tennis. He transitioned into media, working as a commentator for Movistar+. A regular presence at major tournaments worldwide, Carretero has also embraced social media, sharing photos with past and present stars, including young phenom Carlos Alcaraz.

While his playing days ended prematurely, Carretero's contributions to the sport endure—whether in the broadcast booth or through his enduring friendship with Nadal. A player who once showed immense promise, Carretero remains a respected voice in the tennis world and a proud ambassador for Spanish tennis.

Serena Williams enjoyed a legendary tennis career, enjoying particular success at Flushing Meadows.

America's Williams won her first Slam at the US Open in 1999 as a teenager, becoming the sixth youngest woman to win a Major title.

She added five more US Open titles to her collection throughout the remainder of her professional career.

Dominating in New York during her time on the WTA Tour, players, young and old, dreaded seeing the 43-year-old appear in their section of the draw.

One young star faced the Williams test in 2019, as she now reveals the big mistake she made during their second-round match.

Speaking on the Inside In Tennis Podcast, doubles star Caty McNally shared her thoughts on her battle with Williams at the 2019 US Open.

“Yeah, I mean I just tried to keep my head down,” she said.

“I think I told myself before the match, just keep your head down.

“Don't look up at her because the second you look up at her, you're going to be like holy s— you're playing Serena Williams. Like, this is insane.”

McNally won the first set 7-5 and threw her arms up in celebration, a move she regrets six years later.

“Yeah, I won the first set, I think I like threw my arms up,” she said.

“I don't even know why I threw my arms up. I think I was just like, it was just pure adrenaline.

“I shouldn't have done that.”

The crowd was with the 17-year-old throughout the contest, something she was thankful for.

“You know, that was probably part of the reason why I threw my hands up, the crowd was loving it,” said McNally.

“They were supporting me, which was a lot of fun, you know, to not play against Serena and the whole crowd.”

Williams eventually prevailed to win in three sets, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, in what McNally still considers to be one of the ‘greatest moments' of her career.

“I think midway through the second set is when she started to run away with it,” she said.

“She started to play really well, and it was just, it was just an amazing experience, and yeah, it's always crazy to talk about it.

“It seems like it was so long ago but I mean this story will be one I can tell my kids one day.

“You know, I played Serena Williams, I won a set off her, not a lot of people can say that.

“So yeah, definitely one of the best moments of my career so far.”

Williams won her sixth US Open title in 2014, but had failed in her bid to add a seventh in her previous three visits to Flushing Meadows.

A losing finalist in 2018, Williams was determined to go one better in 2019, and looked in good shape to do so, having battled past McNally in the second round.

Standing between Williams and a seventh US Open title was Canadian debutant Bianca Andreescu, who was appearing in just her fourth Major tournament.

Andreescu started strongly in the final, taking the first set 6-3 against her more experienced opponent.

An early break for Andreescu in the second extended her advantage before Williams immediately broke back.

The Canadian failed to convert a match point at 6-3, 5-1, 40-30, as Williams began to mount an unlikely comeback.

Winning the next four games, Williams tied things up at 5-5 before Andreescu regained control of her serve, taking the lead once more at 6-5.

Running out of steam, Williams was unable to take the second set to a tiebreaker, falling to a devastating 3-6, 5-7 defeat on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Williams never returned to a Major final, retiring from tennis in 2022 as a 23-time Grand Slam champion.

Her legacy at the US Open still remains untouched, winning a record six titles during the Open Era.

Harmony Korine is hard to pin down: Stylistically, ideologically, and even rhetorically. While leading a Q&A with him before a mostly teenage and 20-something crowd at the Ringling College of Art and Design at the Sarasota Film Festival on April 12, that quickly became apparent. 

Like he was once again appearing on “The Late Show with David Letterman,” as he did frequently in the 1990s, Korine gave some amusing answers — maybe non-answers.




			Popular on IndieWire		






What inspired his latest film, “Baby Invasion“? “I'd seen this Phil Collins video, and I just remember watching it, and I had been drinking Mountain Dew and eating Skittles, and I was playing a lot of Tetris, and the movie just came to me.”

What made him fall in love with Florida, where he's made his recent movies and has headquartered his company Edglrd? “Strip malls. I was investing in this company that just builds strip malls, and this state has the best ones, plus the best massage parlors and palm trees.”

But get him talking about the state of cinema, and he turns thoughtful, if still playful. When he called Ron Howard's “Cocoon” — filmed in Florida — “one of the greatest movies ever,” this writer pressed him on whether he sees much difference between that movie, fairly conventional by any standard, and his own work, often thought to be taste-shattering, boundary-pushing provocations.

“I've never seen a Stan Brakhage movie ever,” Korine said. “I never want to watch a movie where someone tapes a moth to a piece of film. I don't really know anything about it. I just like what I like. I was really trying to make blockbusters. Mostly just the biggest films imaginable, but it doesn't work out.”

Stop and look at some of his recent movies, and you can see a bit of a blockbuster ethos. “Spring Breakers” was certainly the definition of an indie blockbuster, all but putting A24 on the map when it hit theaters in 2013. His follow-up, “The Beach Bum,” shares some DNA with two other movies Korine name-drops in our interview as personal favorites: “Porky's” and “Caddyshack.” Even his latest, “Baby Invasion,” draws heavily from videogame aesthetics — and the biggest videogame hits dwarf the grosses for Hollywood's biggest blockbusters by a mile.

Maybe Korine is secretly a popular — or populist — filmmaker in disguise. He certainly has thoughts about the existential crisis hitting Hollywood: why it simply is that so few movies seem to break through and dominate the zeitgeist the way they once did.

 










“I think it's just because they suck,” Korine said. “Yeah, most of them just are not good. And movies were the dominant art form for so long, and for better and for worse, I don't think they're the dominant art form anymore.”

Why?

“I think life happened,” Korine said. “Radio was the dominant form, then television and movies. I think you have a period of time where things are the dominant, perfect art, and then something comes along. And it's not just technology, but it's people, syntax, the way that they view things, the way that they feel about the world, their internal rhythms and the cadences and the vernacular, the imagery of sight and sound, and it changes. It evolves or devolves. I don't think movies are going away. I just don't think that they're the dominant form anymore.”

Just as language itself evolves, so does cinematic grammar. Is the vernacular that Hollywood uses out of step with a cinematic grammar kids relate to? Watching the effect that Korine has on this crowd of college-age youths — the demo that everyone from politics to Hollywood is trying to reach — is truly something. It's a niche crowd, but one he owns. Two kids present him with a skeletal effigy they've designed and hope he “casts” in a movie. (“It even has a huge weiner,” Korine says of the mannequin.) Another attendee has dressed like Matthew McConaughey in “The Beach Bum.” One barely drinking age guy says, “I don't usually fuck with movies, but you're my fucking hero.”

 










The past 15 years or more of Hollywood have been defined by 40- or 50-something white guys trying to impose their favorite things from when they were kids (Marvel, DC, “Star Wars,” Transformers) onto the kids of today, excavating 40-year-old IPs in the process. Korine is meeting today's kids where they are: “Baby Invasion” draws from videogame aesthetics just the way “A Minecraft Movie” has, a smash hit that's almost shaken Hollywood to its foundations with an “oh, this is what kids are really into” kind of revelation.

Movies are going to keep evolving, and Korine plans to keep up with them. What comes next?

“What comes after conventional movies is, for me, something that is closer to an experience or a trance or something that's beyond a simple articulation,” Korine said. “But it's also me just having fun, enjoying the medium, playing with things. There's people who get really upset. You get people that get really angry, and they're always trying to tell you, ‘You shouldn't be making this. You should be making what you made 10 years ago,' and then they hated what I made 10 years ago. So people are always trying to tell you what to make, what they think that you should make, and so this is what I want to make.”

	The Donald Trump administration's unlawful removal of hundreds of migrants to a gulag in El Salvador — and their subsequent legal battle to keep them there — have showcased the president's clear disregard for human rights and the United States court system. They are planning to do it again. 


	Most of the Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants that were dumped by the Trump administration in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a notorious mega-prison accused of grave abuse against inmates, had no criminal record. Notable cases like that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — who the Trump administration admitted was deported due to an “administrative error” — have become flashpoints for the White House's attempts to skirt immigration law through the reinterpretation of archaic legislation like the Alien Enemies Act. 


	Earlier this week, two Venezuelan men filed a habeas petition challenging a renewed attempt by the Trump administration to invoke the Alien Enemies Act in order to transfer them into custody of the Salvadoran prison system. One of Trump's first acts as president was to declare Central American gangs such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organizations. In the government's view, anyone they accuse of membership to one of those gangs is liable to be detained and deported as an enemy combatant without due process. 

	











	As battle over the first wave of deportees continues to move through the court system, a contingent of migrants who have been accused of gang membership have submitted a class action lawsuit challenging the government's claims against them, and demanding they be given a chance to contest the accusations in court. 


	One individual in the lawsuit is a teenager, referred to in court documents as “Y.S.M.” According to filings from the ACLU, Y.S.M. was born in 2006 in Venezuela — making him 18 or 19 years old. The court record claims that the teenager was detained by immigration agents who accused him of being a member of Tren de Aragua after seeing a Facebook photo of him featuring what they alleged to be a pistol — but was actually a water gun.

	“The agents stated that the photograph, found on Facebook, proved the Y.S.M. was a member of Tren de Aragua and that one of the persons in the photograph had a gun. Y.S.M. pointed out to the agents that the gun in question was in fact a water pistol. I have seen and reviewed the Facebook photograph in question and have confirmed that the gun in question is a water pistol,” says a filing from Y.S.M.'s lawyer.

	











	The same filing adds: “On April 11, Y.S.M. was told by staff at the detention facility that he needed to attend a medical checkup. Once Y.S.M. arrived to the checkup, he was met by agents who began interrogating him about his ties to Tren de Aragua and pressured him to admit that he was a member of Tren de Aragua.” The sworn statement adds that the tenager was asked to sign a document attesting that he was a member of the gang, and that he refused. 


	Y.S.M. was detained along with his father and other members of his family. In a horrific twist, his lawyers wrote that they received notice from Y.S.M.'s father on Thursday that his son had been taken away. “As he passed by, Y.S.M.'s father could see through a window that Y.S.M. was crying. As Y.S.M. and the agents were passing, Y.S.M. held up a paper to the window. Another detainee who spoke English was able to read that the paper said ‘deportation.' The country of removal was not visible. Because he has no final immigration order, the government could only be seeking to remove him under the AEA, not the immigration laws,” attorneys wrote.

	Y.S.M. is not the only teenager sent abroad with little due process and even less recourse for their families to contact them. Nineteen-year-old Merwil Gutiérrez was one of the hundreds of detainees sent to CECOT last month. The teenager has no criminal record. ““I feel like my son was kidnapped,” his father told Documented earlier this week. “I've spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.”

	Trump has long insisted that countries like Venezuela are intentionally sending criminals and gang members into the United States in order to purge themselves of criminal elements while harming the United States. On Friday, a U.S. intelligence report contradicted the assertion. The assessment, conducted in secret, determined that while contact with gang members and low-level officials was not uncommon, there was no evidence of a central, organized government push by the Venezuelan government to move gang members into the United States.

	Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) traveled to El Salvador this week to get answers about the status of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man Donald Trump's administration illegally sent to a mega-prison in the Central American nation and is now refusing to bring back to the U.S. despite a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” his return.


	Van Hollen was able to meet with Abrego Garcia on Thursday. “I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,” he wrote on X, attaching a photo of himself sitting with Abrego Garcia. “Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”


	Trump and his administration, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, and MAGA commentators online have been mocking Van Hollen for checking on Abrego Garcia's welfare.


	“Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone,” Trump wrote Friday on Truth Social. “GRANDSTANDER!!!”

	The White House piled on later Friday morning, posting a screenshot of a New York Times headline that read: “Senator Meets With Wrongly Deported Maryland Man in El Salvador” — but crossing out “Wrongly,” replacing “Marylan Man” with “MS-13 Illegal Alien,” and tacking on “Who's Never Coming Back.”


	Abrego Garcia was undocumented when he came to the United States at the age of 16. He fled gang violence and threats, which is why a federal judge imposed a “protection from removal” order that prohibits the U.S. from deporting him to El Salvador. The Trump administration even admitted in a court filing that it was wrong to deport him, chalking it up to an “administrative error.” There is no credible evidence that he is an MS-13 member, or that he is a dangerous “criminal,” as officials have repeatedly alleged.


	It's unclear whether he will be brought back to the United States. The Supreme Court last week ruled 9-0 that the administration must “facilitate” his return, but Trump and his top administration figures have falsely claimed the court actually ruled in its favor, and that it only needs to return Abrego Garcia if El Salvador first decides to release him. The U.S. is paying El Salvador millions of dollars to detain him as well as several hundred Venezuelan migrants.

	The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the administration's request to avoid complying with the court's demand on Thursday, calling the administration's arguments in Abrego Garcia's case “shocking” and “lawless.”


	Bukele has insisted he will not give up Abrego Garcia, first while meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, and again while mocking Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia. “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody,” the Salvadoran president wrote on X, replying to his own post that read: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' & ‘torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!”


	The Times reported that a Bukele aide placed two glasses with cherries and sugared rims on the table to make it seem like Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia were enjoying tropical drinks. Bukele is mocking that people have described CECOT, the mega-prison to which Abrego Garcia was sent, as a torturous death camp, but it certainly fits the bill. 


	Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a leading human rights organization that has represented victims and the families of those internally displaced and disappeared in Central America for more than 20 years, described the nation's prison system to Rolling Stone as a “judicial black hole” where inmates are “subjected to systematic torture,” and where “hundreds — probably more like thousands — have been killed.”

	Bukele has also reposted a torrent of right-wing commentators making fun of Van Hollen and praising Bukele for “trolling” the media. “I love chess,” Bukele wrote at one point, apparently of the belief that dressing up Abrego Garcia in a collared shirt and Kansas City Chief Super Bowl hat and planting drinks on the table where he met Van Hollen marked some sort of checkmate against Americans who have been crying foul over the Trump administration's illegal handling of the situation.


The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Bukele is planning on doubling the size of the maximum-security facility where El Salvador is holding U.S. deportees. Trump, meanwhile, has openly mused about sending “homegrown” American citizens to the nation — which would be blatantly illegal — and, as Rolling Stone recently reported, his administration has been working behind the scenes on plans to make it happen.

Tyriq Withers also stars in director Justin Tipping's horror movie that hits theaters later this year.

Marlon Wayans has a unique training regimen for an upstart football player in the first trailer for the Jordan Peele-produced horror movie Him.


Universal Pictures releases director Justin Tipping's feature in theaters Sept. 19. Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies, Akeem Hayes and Tierra Whack round out the cast for the movie that debuted its first footage at CinemaCon earlier this month. 




Him follows an on-the-rise quarterback (Withers) who is invited by an aging player (Wayans) to learn about his perilous journey to achieve success at any cost. The script from Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie was previously included on the Black List. Producers for Monkeypaw include Peele, Ian Cooper, Win Rosenfeld and Jamal Watson.

	“Talent is how hard you're willing to work,” Wayans instructs Withers in the trailer that includes scenes teasing ritualistic violence. “‘I'm never good enough' — that's how great people think. So you're going to have to ask yourself, ‘What am I willing to sacrifice?'”


	Withers and Wayans took the stage during Universal's CinemaCon presentation on April 2 to introduce the film's footage. Wayans jokingly likened their project to a wholesome 1990s sports drama: “It's kinda like Rudy.” This led Withers to fire back, “It's nothing at all like Rudy.” Withers added that the film is “something that burrows under the skin.”


	Wayans posted the trailer to Instagram with the cryptic caption, “Bro… it's different.” He is also set to co-write and star in the sixth installment in the Scary Movie franchise, which hit theaters in summer 2026.


	Withers also appears in the forthcoming sequel I Know What You Did Last Summer and is set for a role in Reminders of Him.

What are you willing to sacrifice to be a star? The haunting teaser for the Jordan Peele-produced “Him” shows the blood, sweat, tears, and religious imagery apparently required to give one's body and soul as a professional athlete.

“Him” stars real-life former college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers as fictional rising-star quarterback Cameron Cade, whose career is sidelined after a violent attack. Cade's only hope appears to be Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), an NFL megastar who offers to train the recovering player. Yet, there is a price to pay for Isaiah's help…

 










The official synopsis for the film reads: “Cameron Cade (Withers) is a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life and identity to football. On the eve of professional football's annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma. Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah's isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox). But as Cam's training accelerates, Isaiah's charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.”

Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies, MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene, hip hop artist Guapdad 4000, and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack co-star. Justin Tipping directs from Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie's Black List screenplay; Tipping is also credited as a co-writer on the final version. 

Oscar winner Peele and his Monkeypaw Productions are producing “Him,” along with Ian Cooper, Win Rosenfeld, and Jamal M. Watson. David Kern and Monkeypaw's Kate Oh executive produce. Universal announced a five-year deal with Peele and Monkeypaw in 2019.

Peele's fourth feature is in the works, with the director teasing that it's his “favorite movie” yet. “I do feel like my next project is clear to me,” Peele said during podcast “Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend” in 2024, “and I'm psyched that I have another film that, you know, could be my favorite movie if I make it right.”

Peele added that it's key to have a “grounding character” in all of his horror films, as well as past comedy sketches. “Just like the comedy, the heightening, the pushing, the fantastical and the imagination, that becomes a certain type of project and exercise, but the exercise of grounding it is always what makes it work,” he said. “That to me, in horror especially, is the hardest part.”

 










“Him” will hit theaters on Friday, September 19 from Universal Pictures. Check out the teaser below.

EXCLUSIVE: Following her directorial debut on Blink Twice, Zoë Kravitz looks to have found her next helming gig. Sources tell Deadline that she is in talks to direct How to Save a Marriage for Sony Pictures. Ross Evans penned the script, and Robert Pattinson is producing with partner Brighton McCloskey via their Icki Eneo Arlo banner along with Geoff Shaevitz and Evan Silverberg via Entertainment 360.


	Plot details are being kept under wraps, and studio sources say the project is still in early development. Evans will also exec produce. As of now, Pattinson, who starred with Kravitz in 2022's The Batman, is only producing the pic.

	











	Sony is high on the project and was aggressive in pursuing it when it hit the market last year. The deal marked a huge sale to a major studio for Evans and at the time showed studios' interest in high-profile packages following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.




			Watch on Deadline		







	While plot details are unknown, sources say Marriage has edgy undertones similar to Blink Twice that made that film work, and helped inform the execs' decision to tap Kravitz as director. While still busy on the acting front, she showcased her helming talent with the thriller, released in August 2024 and starring Naomi Ackie and Channing Tatum. The Amazon MGM Studios film earned strong reviews and put Kravitz on the map as a director.


	On the acting front, Kravitz can be seen next opposite Austin Butler in the Darren Aronofsky thriller Caught Stealing, which bows this fall.


	She is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment.

	Earlier this year, Justin Bieber posted an earnest Instagram story about his feelings of impostor syndrome, and another describing how he felt like he was “drowning” in pent-up hatred from his past. This, coupled with paparazzi photos over the past few months where Bieber appeared somewhat disheveled, spurred rumors about drug use that his camp quickly shut down. Even so, those rumors briefly escalated after Bieber went live on Instagram late last month, previewing a potential new musical direction seemingly inspired by the sensibilities of SoundCloud rap. The raw-sounding recordings had the energy of early Lil Pump mixed with Gen Z acts like Osamason, replete with trembling, maxed-out drums nearly drowning out the kind of soft, treacly guitar melodies you'd expect from an earlier era in Bieber's career, almost like his new sound was obliterating his past work in real time. 


	The flurry of posts coming from the Grammy-winning musician this year is so beyond what you'd expect from a polished pop star that many of Bieber's former associates are apparently worried about the superstar musician. In a new report from The Hollywood Reporter this week, former insiders suggested that Bieber's finances were in distress. Bieber's reps have denied the claims. 

	











	But the musician's recent activities do indicate something else: He has good taste, specifically in the current generation of hip-hop. Just this past week, Bieber and his wife, Hailey, were seen in the front row during Yeat's performance at Coachella. That same night, he was seen chatting with Twitch streamer Plaqueboymax, who is quickly becoming the voice of the new vanguard in rap. In recent weeks, he has posted photo dumps to Instagram featuring songs by rising rappers, including 1900Rugrat, one set to “The Truth” by Nine Vicious, another set to Ken Carson, and most recently, a post featuring sneakers from his new brand, Skylrk, set to Babytron. In other posts, he's seen linking up with noted Opium affiliate Burberry Erry. This past weekend, he was seen turning up at Sexyy Red's birthday party in Los Angeles. Assuming the rumors of distress and drug use are indeed false, and that Bieber's health isn't in doubt, it would appear that he is doing all he can to shed himself of the past and chart a new, rather drippy, future.

	Speaking of drip, the clothes he's been previewing are unironically very good. It's a cross between the playful color-driven ethos of popular streetwear brands like Cactus Plant Flea Market, mixed with the elevated design sense of YZY. The marketing is on point, too. This week, Bieber released a teaser featuring Gunna and Kai Cenat. Out of all of the celebrities currently trying to make clothes, Bieber's latest effort feels like the best we've seen since before Ye lost his mind.

	It's also worth noting that Bieber has long dabbled in the world of hip-hop; let's not forget his freestyle on Power 106 back in 2011. Lately, however, he's proven to be deeply tapped into the current generation of rappers whose music exists in stark contrast to mainstream sensibilities. It even explains the more unvarnished approach to posting he's taken recently. The 31-year-old Justin Bieber, who became a father last year, is on the cusp of two generations and possibly sees the writing on the wall for how fans want to engage with music going forward.


	Like the new class of internet-born rap stars he posts, there's a rejection of the prim and polish we've come to expect from celebrities. Fans would rather see screenshots of your FIFA matches and unflattering angles of you sitting on the couch than the umpteenth brand collaboration or photo shoot. In fact, it's become so common for big-name acts to try and shed the sheen of their celebrity lately, one wonders why Bieber hasn't opted for a private finsta account for these latest musings.

	Still, it makes sense that Bieber's fan base doesn't quite know how to take this new direction. Bold moves tend to take time to metabolize in the public consciousness. The snippets he shared on Instagram Live were surprising at first, but also kind of brilliant, full of the raw, emotive energy of Playboi Carti or Young Thug, artists who can evoke a world of feeling with a grunt unfurled from deep within their psyche.


	Bieber's turn toward internet rap comes as acts like Carti dominate the charts, proving that the maximalist sound of the younger generation is likely here to stay. More than calculated maneuvering, something about Bieber's latest posts seems more like a private affinity finally being made public. Up until now, the world was only ready for small doses of rapper Bieber (his feature on Travis Scott's “Maria I'm Drunk” remains a classic), but in 2025, it seems like we might be ready to see him go all the way.

Talk show host and “American Idol” alum Jennifer Hudson's jaw hit the floor when Jelly Roll confessed his most embarrassing concert moment during a Q&A segment on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” airing on April 18, 2025.

Jelly Roll and fellow country star Luke Bryan appeared on the talk show together, promoting season 23 of “American Idol,” where Bryan is in his eighth season as a judge and Jelly Roll is serving as the show's first-ever “artist-in-residence,” mentoring contestants throughout the season. 

Hudson selected a random question from a batch sitting on her set's coffee table, asking the duo to name “the most embarrassing thing that's happened to you while performing,” Jelly Roll immediately blurted out, “I pooped myself one time” — and it was clear the “Amen” singer immediately regretted his answer. 

Hudson and Bryan could not hide their shock over Jelly Roll's answer, their mouths both agape as the audience gasped. They then crumpled into laughter as Jelly Roll apologized. 

“I'm sorry,” he laughed. “Listen, it was what they call a shart. I didn't know! I was confident it was all air, it was not. I watched this crowd go from loving me to just being completely out!”   

“That's why we love him, right there,” Bryan said, putting his arm around Jelly Roll. 

“I overshared again,” Jelly Roll laughed, covering his face in his hands. 

Bryan then quipped, “My problem is I didn't really get embarrassed about it when I did it!” 

As Hudson tried to move on, Jelly Roll asked her, “Are you saying you've never pooped yourself?” 

“Noooo, noooo! Oh my god, this is hilarious,” she replied, clearly flustered as she searched for another question to ask. 

After Hudson found a new question, she asked, “Okay, y'all ready for the next one?” and Jelly Roll hilariously quipped, “No!” 

Reading the question, Hudson noted that both men are married and asked what about them drives their wives “absolutely crazy.” Bryan has been married to his college sweetheart, Caroline Boyer Bryan, for nearly 19 years, while Jelly Roll has been married to Alyssa DeFord, known as BunnieXO, since 2016. 

At first, Bryan said that his snoring drives his wife crazy. But he later changed his answer to a habit in the kitchen that he said always sends Caroline reeling. 

“I gotta go with the simplest thing,” he told Hudson. “If I put the creamer in my coffee, stir the spoon and put the spoon down on the countertop … without a proper paper towel to absorb? It's worst than snoring, now that I think about it 'cause you can cure the snoring with a CPAP machine.” 

“Or less alcohol, but I'm not here to judge,” Jelly Roll laughed. 

The “Hard Fought Hallelujah” singer revealed that the thing he does that drives BunnieXO nuts is a habit he's trying to break. 

“I leave a trail of clothes from the front door to the shower,” he admitted as he looked at the audience. “Everybody's like, ‘We hate you!' I just heard women shaking their fists at me up there! I know! And I've been trying to break this habit, y'all, but it annoys her to no end.”

Check local listings for the April 18 airing of “The Jennifer Hudson Show.” Meanwhile, “American Idol” airs a three-hour “Songs of Faith” episode on April 20, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Warner Bros‘ $90 million+ period vampire movie Sinners chalked up $4.7 million in Thursday night previews that began yesterday at 3 p.m. Out of the gate with preview-night audiences, Sinners gets 5 stars on PostTrak with 80% definite recommend, an excellent exit that could bode well for over-indexing, knock on wood. Rotten Tomatoes is also high on the Ryan Coogler-Michael B. Jordan reteam, with reviews at 97% certified fresh and exits at that level as well.


	The diversity demos last night were 46% Black, 30% Caucasian, 15% Latino and Hispanic and 5% Asian. 


Sinners in its preview take is under that of genre comps like 2022's Nope ($6.4M Thursday night, $44.3M opening) and 2019's Us ($7.4M, $71.1M).

	











	The miracles of Good Friday at the box office, with 72% of K-12 schools and a close to a third of colleges on break, were already in effect last night, with Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie shooting up in its daily take by 21% over Wednesday with $6.5M, sending the Jared Hess movie past the three-century mark at the domestic box office with $303.3M. A Minecraft Movie pulled off the feat in 14 days, three days slower than Illumination/Nintendo/Universal's Super Mario Bros which took 11 days to cross $300M. That movie ended its U.S.-Canada run at $574.9M. A Minecraft Movie ends its second week with $102.9M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	One of the two movies will wind up as No. 1 during the Easter holiday frame with respective weekend takes of $40M+. Who can ding a studio for owning the top two slots over a holiday weekend? Good on Warner Bros.


Sinners is booked at 3,308 theaters including premium auditoriums of Imax 70MM, Imax digital, 70MM, Dolby, PLFs and motion seats.

	Also opening this weekend is Bleecker Street's remake of the Ang Lee movie The Wedding Banquet starring Bowen Yang and Lily Gladstone at 1,133 theaters. The movie gets 3 stars from PostTrak audiences and a 50% definite recommend.


	The rest of the week is as follows:


	2.) The King of Kings (Angel) 3200 theaters, Thu $2.4M (+15% over Wednesday), Total $28M/Wk 1


	3.) The Amateur (20th/Dis) 3,400 theaters, Thu $1M (-6%), Total $20.1M/Wk 1


	4.) Warfare (A24) 2,670 theaters, Thu $891K (-6%) Total $12M/Wk 1 

	











	5.) Drop (Uni) 3,085 theaters, Thu $617K (+2%) Total $10.1M/Wk 1

Artificial or not, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has some ideas on how artificial intelligence could make films “better.” During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Sarandos said (via Deadline) that AI could help films be “10 percent better,” not just “50 percent cheaper.” Sarandos cited James Cameron‘s recent comments about how the technology could cut production costs in half.

“There's a ton of excitement about what AI can do for content creators,” Sarandos said. “I read the article too about what Jim Cameron said about making movies 50 percent cheaper. I remain convinced that there's an even bigger opportunity to make movies 10 percent better. So, our talent today is using AI tools to do set references, pre-vis, VFX sequence prep, shot planning, all kinds of things today that kind of make the process better.”

He added, “Traditionally, only big-budget projects would have access to things like advanced visual effects such as de-aging. Today, you can use these AI-powered tools to enable smaller-budget projects to have access to big VFX onscreen.” 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Sarandos pointed to Martin Scorsese's 2019 film “The Irishman” as an example of what AI could achieve. The film used VFX de-aging effects for its central characters, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, across decades. Sarandos explained that if the feature was made today, AI could have enhanced (and eased) the process for a fraction of the budget, and have had an “improved” result onscreen. 

“If you remember that movie, we were using very cutting-edge, very expensive de-aging technology that still had massive limitations, still created a bunch of complexity on set for the actors,” Sarandos said. “It was a giant leap forward for sure, but nowhere near what we needed for that film.”

“The Irishman” cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto later made his directorial debut with “Pedro Páramo,” which used “AI-powered tools” to de-age its stars. According to Sarandos, the effects cost a “fraction” of the tech for “The Irishman.” 

“In fact, the entire budget of the film was about what the VFX cost on ‘The Irishman,'” he said. “So, same creator using new tools, better tools, to do what was impossible five years ago — that's incredibly exciting. So, our focus is simple: Find ways for AI to improve the member and the creator experience.”

 










“Avatar” director James Cameron previously said during the “Boz to the Future” podcast that AI will be key to minimizing costs for films, and also make for shorter development time. “If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I've always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see — ‘Dune,' ‘Dune: Part Two,' or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films — we've got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half,” Cameron said.

He added, “Now that's not about laying off half the staff and at the effects company. That's about doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things, right? That's my sort of vision for that.”

	The Department of Health and Human Services was by no means spared the hatchet job by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE), and big changes are coming to food safety standards and communications over public health risks — and not in a good way. 


	According to a Thursday report from NBC News, in February the Food and Drug Administration — a subsidiary of HHS — quietly closed an investigation into a multi-state E. Coli outbreak that killed one person and sickened dozens in November. An internal report obtained by NBC showed that the FDA engaged in “no public communications related to this outbreak.” The internal report did not name the suppliers and distributors involved in the sale of the contaminated produce, which caused infections across 15 states. In short, the outbreak would have remained out of the public record had it not been obtained by NBC — a stark reversal from recent transparency efforts implemented 


	Hours after NBC's report dropped, CBS News released their own reporting indicating that the Food and Drug Administration is planning to end most of their food inspection and safety operations, and transfer those functions to individual state agencies. A spokesperson for the FDA denied the report.

	The FDA already contracts out a significant amount of inspection work on low-risk food categories, and it's not the first time shifting food-safety enforcement responsibility to the states has been a topic of discussion within HHS. But the talk of ending routine safety inspections is enough to raise concerns among consumers when the administration is also quietly shelving a report on a deadly E. Coli outbreak and discussing ending routine safety inspections weeks after firing thousands of its employees. Earlier this month, the FDA also announced that it would be suspending quality control programs at food testing laboratories, citing the recent reduction in staff as the primary cause of the cutback. .

	Food safety is not the only imperilled function of the FDA. Known vaccine conspiracy theorist and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made the FDA a prime target of his crackpot reforms at HHS. In his few months at the helm, the health systems under Kennedy's control have yanked funding for influenza vaccine promotion, made moves to remove fluoride from drinking water, canceled critical vaccine development planning meetings, and bungled the federal response to a deadly measles outbreak in Texas.

	Americans are at the precipice of major institutional changes that could make them less healthy, less safe, and eliminate accountability for companies pushing unsafe products into the marketplace. The gutting of services and protections isn't limited to the Department of Health and Human Services. The mass firings of federal employees across all sectors of the government will affect everything from Social Security, to education, to even the daily weather report. According to a Thursday report from The Los Angeles Times, forced layoffs at the National Weather Service are decimating meteorologists' ability to gather data and produce timely, accurate forecasts. 


	“The cracks are really now starting to show,” one climate scientist told the Times.

	At times of political and cultural upset, literature has often been a way for society to process, understand, and push back against unethical policies or administrations. Many of the most well known books are direct political statements, like Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Octavia Butler's Kindred, and Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. These works easily break down some of the biggest political challenges Americans faced at the time of their publication. Books have power — and sharp authors aren't afraid to wield that. But what's just as important and often ignored is a book's ability to remove the reader from the real world entirely.


	Let's be honest — the nation feels like it's in absolute shambles. Ever since President Donald Trump's inauguration, opening any news app or website has felt like a nonstop barrage of blunt force trauma to the head. Being informed is important, but an oversaturation of constant bad news can make engaging with meaningful, political books difficult to stomach. Luckily, there's genre fiction, which not only holds endless opportunities for entertainment but a perfect distraction during times of disarray. What better way to forget about the political situations you can't change than with books practically steeped in magic, fantasy, love, horror, and mystery? So instead of picking up your phone for yet another doom scroll, here are five options that will get you onto the page and, hopefully, out of reality for a bit.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Vampires! Dark Academia! Secret Society! Kissing! A young Black author's debut! Immortal Dark is like a beacon of distraction practically calling from a bookstore near you. Kidan Adane already has enough problems. She's an orphan, living a life completely estranged from the rich vampire/human society she should rightfully be a part of. But when her sister goes missing, Kade is convinced she knows the exact blood sucker who took her: Susenyos Sagad.

	Finding her sister doesn't just mean setting off on an adventure. It means returning to the world she thought she'd left behind forever. Her mission requires her to infiltrate the secretive and exclusive Uxlay University, in the hopes that time at the vampire school will not only help her find her sister, but give her the perfect opportunity to kill Susenyos. 

	











	For new readers, diving into these kinds of fantasy-driven romances (“romantasy,” if you will) can be a fully engaging process. Knowing what city you're in might require a quick flip to the index. Other times, dense prose or consonant heavy character names require undivided attention to maintain reading momentum. You're not only meeting the new personalities that fiction can bring, but you also have to learn new vocabulary, rules, and a lot of interesting spelling. That'll keep you off your phone for at least two hours. 


	Need something a little lighter? In A Gentleman's Gentleman, TJ Alexander's frothy queer regency romance, Lord Christopher Eden was pretty confident he'd live his entire life free from the gossip, attention, and downright nosiness of British high society. But when he finds out that his inheritance hinges on him marrying, he's forced to head to London for the season. Sure, he's gay and isn't attracted to women. He'll have to do his hardest to fake it. But when he strikes up a deep friendship with his new valet James Harding, Christopher has to contend with his actual desires and the duty that will keep him from ending up on the street. What's better than countless scenes of two people putting on extremely fussy clothing and maybe falling in love? There's just so many buttons!


	Maybe scary times call for an ever scarier read. In Diavola, author Jennifer Marie Thorne takes the quintessential setting of a spooky haunted house and crashes it into the humorous tensions and anxieties of a family vacation. The Pace family are trying to relax in the Tuscan town of Monteperso. Siblings Anna, Benny, and Nicole have separate lives, and even more disparate personalities, which makes it hard for them to connect. Their time at a villa with their parents is supposed to be the answer, but the town is remote. The villagers are cryptic. And the house they're staying in can't protect them from strange sounds at night.

	Horror might seem counterintuitive to forgetting about the actual scary events going on outside your front door. But there are some instances when leaning into the dread of someone's else's bad week can offer a much needed distraction. There's also the personal draw: Not everyone has experienced a haunting, but complicated family dynamics are depicted so often in media that the setting feels both funny and heart racing. Diavola makes you linger in dread, but its international bent is more than enough to keep bad thoughts at bay. 

	











	Kate Fagan's newest work could technically be considered two books in one, since The Three Lives of Cate Kay is centered around a novel within the novel. The book in question is The Very Last, a pop culture success in the fictional world that has spawned on-screen adaptations and turned author Cate Kay into a household name. But Cate Kay doesn't exist. It's a pseudonym, one that has let the author live anonymously while experiencing massive fame and success. But when she finally decides — under slight duress from her agent — that she's ready to reveal herself in the form of a celebrity memoir, Cate has to revisit the story of her life that no one else knows. The Three Lives of Cate Kay gives readers a 360 view of the world Fagan has created, complete with the actress playing the lead role in The Very Last's films, the fans, and the friendship that brought Cate to the book in the first place.

	It's a whiplash of settings, from a crowded Hollywood season to a calm cross-country road trip, which makes it hard for readers to do anything but follow the threads of the story. This is a contemporary read and takes much of its inspiration from today's celebrity obsessed society, but places readers in such a compelling mystery that any nods to real life will be swiftly forgiven.


Deep Sky author Yume Kitasei's latest book The Stardust Grail takes the academic treasure hunting and style of Indiana Jones to new, space-inspired heights. Readers are introduced to Maya Hoshimoto, a former art and antiquities thief determined to leave her space travel days behind and finish her graduate degree in anthropology at an Earth university. But when her close friend Uncle — part of a nearly extinct alien species Frenro — tips her off that there might finally be a way to snag her most elusive and world saving artifact, she leaves her coursework behind for one last ditch effort to solve a galaxy-sized mystery. One of the best ways to fully escape from a convoluted world is to dive headfirst into a new and strange one, leaving the planet behind entirely. And doesn't that sound nice right now?

	After reviewing the body camera footage from his recent arrest, Haley Joel Osment has apologized for his use of “disgraceful language” — including antisemitic language — when being detained for alleged public intoxication and possession of an unidentified controlled substance at a California ski resort.


	“I'm absolutely horrified by my behavior. Had I known I used this disgraceful language in the throes of a blackout, I would have spoken up sooner,” Osment shared in a statement to the New York Post. “The past few months of loss and displacement have broken me down to a very low emotional place. But that's no excuse for using this disgusting word.”


	In the footage of the arrest, Osment can be heard stating, “I've been kidnapped by a fucking Nazi,” and accusing the police officers of “torturing me.” In one instance, he refers to one officer using a particularly offensive slur against the Jewish community. “From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to absolutely everyone that this hurts,” he continued in his statement. “What came out of my mouth was nonsensical garbage — I've let the Jewish community down and it devastates me.”

	Earlier this year, Osment lost his home in the Eaton wildfire that ravaged neighborhoods in California. His previous run-ins with the law include a 2006 charge for a DUI and marijuana possession after being involved in a car crash. He was sentenced to three years' probation at the time. Years later, in 2018, the actor was involved in a verbal altercation at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Police were called about an “unruly passenger.” When he was arrested this week at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area by the Mammoth Lakes Police Department, he was referred to in the call as an “unruly skier.”


	Concluding his statement, Osment shared: “I don't ask for anyone's forgiveness, but I promise to atone for my terrible mistake.”

We've seen horror director Eli Roth split open skulls before, but the jack-of-many-trades and (surprise!) stop-motion animator has never been stuck in your head like he will be with “The Rotten Fruit.” Catchy bordering on torturous, the theme song for Roth's latest archival release goes a little something like… 

♫ Rotten Fruit… We're The Rotten Fruit… The most popular band in the wooorld! ♫

Celebrating its 25th anniversary by finally making its streaming debut on the platform WeShort today, April 18, “The Rotten Fruit” is a cult classic web series co-created by Roth and Noah Belson. A childhood friend of the gonzo filmmaker, better known to genre fans for his credit as Guitar Man in “Cabin Fever,” Belson grew up making movies with Roth in Newton, Massachusetts. While living in L.A. trying to break into the industry together, the pair developed “The Rotten Fruit” for the now-defunct Z.com in 2000.

Despite a lofty goal to become “the HBO of the internet,” Z.com released just three of the eight episodes Roth, Belson, and their animation crew made on a shoestring budget. The other five installments have either never been released or remain completely unseen, until now. By the time these so-called “new” episodes were posted online, the duo told IndieWire, the site had gone completely bankrupt.

“Even though it was limited in terms of who saw it, we had a lot of people contacting us asking about more episodes,” Roth told IndieWire. The director not only wrote, animated, and edited on the project but also composed and performed its outrageous songs; Belson and Roth voiced the shorts' cast together.

“We had a mailing list with thousands of people on it who were constantly asking, ‘When are more ‘Rotten Fruit' episodes coming out?'” Roth said. “Now, it's like, ‘We're working on it. Really.”

“Give us 25 more years, maybe,” Belson joked. “But we'll get you some more.'”

Speaking with IndieWire over Zoom, the reunited collaborators shared their hopes to revive “The Rotten Fruit” as a modern satire soon. They also reflected on the ridiculousness of the original production — a “crazy” quintessential SoCal summer that, for good or bad, sounds like the plot of its own movie. From the pitfalls of early web financing to a backyard pool filled with alligators, “The Rotten Fruit” got as rock-and-roll behind the scenes as its edible punk musicians look getting sliced and diced on stage.

 










Running roughly three minutes each, all eight “Rotten Fruit” episodes are free for anyone to watch during the raunchy (or should we say ranchy?) comedy's first week streaming on WeShort. The short film service is working in partnership with Roth's fan-owned media company and genre brand, The Horror Section. The following episode descriptions were provided to IndieWire:

	A batch of letters and notes gives a glimpse into the lives of Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa, which have been released as part of the investigation into their tragic deaths earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reports.


	At the time of his death, Hackman had been battling Alzheimer's disease, and Arakawa was his primary caregiver. The notes between them offer not only a window into the relationship of a long-married couple (they wed in 1991), but also gesture towards the challenges of Alzheimer's, both for those living with it and those of their caregivers. 


	Arakawa, for instance, reportedly wrote detailed notes on Hackman's medication and doctor appointments. She also frequently left Hackman notes around the house, telling him where she was or what she was doing (such as taking one of their dogs to an obedience class, or doing yoga).




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The notes from Hackman, meanwhile, show that the actor seemed to retain a sense of humor that was light-hearted and occasionally self-deprecating. Of a doctor's visit, for instance, he told Arakawa — often referred to as “Lovely girl” — he was “off to see the wizard, the wizard of achievement pokie. She stabs me here, she stabs me there, she stabs me almost everywhere. But I'll survive, because after [all] I'm still alive. (But sometimes just barely).” 

	











	In another letter, Hackman even seemed to acknowledge, and make light of, his waning memory. “I'm going down to that building out past the hot water place where you sit and do whatever it is that people are supposed to do in such a building — maybe I'll remember once I get down there,” he wrote. 


	While frequently Hackman signed his letters “Love G,” he signed this one, “Love what's his name.” 


	Still, his notes occasionally hinted at more difficult moments, like when he wished Arakawa a belated happy birthday and wrote her, “Sorry still about the dinner and having to ask for your help, although it was appreciated.”

	Along with the letters, Santa Fe authorities investigating the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa released new photos of the couple's home, police body camera footage, and an environmental assessment. Hackman's estate had previously secured a temporary order to seal any records related to the investigation, but a judge later overturned that ruling on the condition that no photos or videos showed the couple's bodies. 

	











	Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home in February, with a medical examiner ultimately ruling that they died about six days apart. Arakawa likely died on Feb. 11 from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but fatal respiratory disease spread by rodents (the environmental assessment released this week revealed that rodent feces, nests, and dead rodents were found on the couple's property, but not the main home). Hackman died on Feb. 18 from heart disease, with his advanced Alzheimer's also a contributing factor.

	According to a press release from the Riverside Sheriff's office, Seiders was arrested after officers were dispatched to investigate a report of suspicious activity on April 7 at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant, where an 11-year-old boy told officers that an unknown man had recorded him on a cell phone while he was using the bathroom. Two days later, police said an employee at the same restaurant reported that the man was seen entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males.

	“Believing the male was the suspect from the previous incident, law enforcement was contacted. Upon arrival, deputies located the suspect, identified as 44-year-old Joseph Seiders of Palm Desert, and took him into custody,” read the release. After an investigation, officers served search warrants on Seiders' residence, vehicle and cell phone, where they reportedly found evidence implicating Seiders in both incidents and “additional crimes,” which they said included possessing child pornography. 


	Seiders was booked into the John Benoit Detention Center in Indio, CA for possession of child pornography, annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy. 


	In a statement on Instagram, the band wrote, “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders — and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.” When asked for further comment, a spokesperson for the band's management referred Billboard to the group's official statement.


	Seiders joined the Canadian indie power pop supergroup — which formed in Vancouver in 1997 — in 2014, joining charter members singer Neko Case, singer/guitarist Carl Newman and bassist John Collins. He appeared on their 2017 album Whiteout Conditions, as well as 2019's In the Morse Code of Brake Lights and 2023's Continue as a Guest, as well as their recent single “Ballad of the Last Payphone.” The drummer is being held at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility with bail set at $1 million and is scheduled to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday (April 22).

A native of the Philippines — he and his family were imprisoned during World War II — he guest-starred on ‘The Brady Bunch' and, mentored by Gene Kelly, danced on ‘Hullabaloo.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Patrick Adiarte, the Philippines-born dancer and actor who appeared in The King and I and Flower Drum Song on Broadway and the big screen and had a recurring role on M*A*S*H, has died. He was 82.


	Adiarte died Tuesday in a Los Angeles-area hospital of pneumonia, his niece, Stephanie Hogan, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	When The Brady Bunch went to Honolulu for a family vacation in a three-part episode that kicked off the fourth season of the ABC series in 1972, Adiarte played a construction gofer who gives the kids a tour before they meet with all kinds of chaos after Bobby (Mike Lookinland) discovers a small tiki idol that could be cursed.

	Adiarte also was a popular dancer on the 1965-66 NBC musical variety series Hullabaloo, where he began a short-lived singing career with the pop tune “Five Different Girls.”

	In 1952, Adiarte joined the Broadway cast of Rodgers & Hammerstein's fabled The King and I, starring Yul Brynner and Gertrude Lawrence, as one of the royal children, then toured with the production across America.


	When the musical was adapted by 20th Century Fox in 1956, he graduated to the role of Prince Chulalongkorn, the son of Rita Moreno's Tuptim. Brynner starred in the film as well, and Adiarte would consider him a surrogate father.


	For Flower Drum Song, also from Rodgers & Hammerstein and directed by Gene Kelly, Adiarte was cast in 1958 as the wise-cracking, Americanized second son Wang San, and he sang “You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll” with Pat Suzuki as the nightclub performer Linda Low. He then returned for the 1961 Universal film that starred Nancy Kwan and James Shigeta.


M*A*S*H fans know Adiarte as Ho-Jon, the orphaned Korean houseboy who assisted Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) and Trapper John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) on seven episodes of the first season (1972-73) of the CBS series. His character presumably leaves to attend medical school in the States.


	Patrick Robert Adiarte was born in Manila on Aug. 2, 1942. He, his sister, Irene, and their mother, Purita, were imprisoned by the Japanese on the island of Cebu in February 1945 during World War II. Irene, then 5, and Patrick, then 2, were burned when the Japanese lobbed grenades at them when the family tried to escape.

	











	A month later, their father, working as a captain for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was killed.


	In June 1946, the family came to New York through Ellis Island so that Irene could have what would be the first of several surgeries to remove the extensive scars on her face caused by the grenade fire.


	While the Adiartes faced threats of deportation, Patrick (and his mom, as a dancer) would wind up in The King and I. (With the help of Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy, Congress finally granted the three American citizenship In February 1956.)


	After his stage work in The King and I, Patrick studied at the Professional Children's School, where his classmates included Liza Minnelli and Marvin Hamlisch.


	While promoting Flower Drum Song in 1958 with an appearance on the NBC variety show Omnibus, he and Kelly demonstrated how tap dancing had evolved over the years, with Kelly proclaiming, “If there's gonna be another Fred Astaire, I think it might as well be Pat.”


	Kelly also helped him get a job dancing on Italian television for about a year.


	Adiarte played the college student T.J. Padmanagham in the Blake Edwards-directed back-to-school comedy High Time (1960), starring Bing Crosby, Fabian and Tuesday Weld, then was another prince in a 1961 ABC adaptation of The Enchanted Nutcracker, starring Robert Goulet and Carol Lawrence.


	Later, he would show up in the Shirley MacLaine-starring John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1965) — he portrayed a Middle Eastern Prince and son of Peter Ustinov's character — and on episodes of It Takes a Thief, Ironside, Bonanza, Hawaii Five-O and Kojak. More recently, he taught dance, including at Santa Monica College.

	











	Adiarte was married to singer-actress Loni Ackerman from 1975 until their 1992 divorce. His sister died in 2016. In addition to his niece, survivors include his nephew, Michael.

'Star Wars: Starfighter' will open in the summer of 2027.



		By Borys Kit, Patrick Brzeski 

	April 17, 2025 6:27pm	




The Star Wars feature project that teams Ryan Gosling with director Shawn Levy has a name and a release date.


Star Wars: Starfighter will open May 28, 2027. That's just three weeks after fellow mega-Disney title, Avengers: Secret Wars, which bows May 7, 2027.




	The announcement was made at a packed Star Wars Celebration panel in Tokyo, at the biennial convention that fetes all manner of things related to Jedis, Siths and other creations from the galaxy far, far away. It's unclear if the title has any connection to the 2001 computer game of the same game.

	“The reality is that this script is just so good. It has such a great story with great and original characters,” said Gosling from the stage. “It's filled with so much heart and adventure, and there just really is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn.”




			Popular on THR		







	After Gosling, wearing a “never tell me the odds” Hans Solo-quote hat, took the stage, a picture flashed on the screen of his childhood Star Wars bedsheets, which were sent in by his mom.


	“She still has them, obviously,” Gosling joked. “Naturally, she thought that it might be something that the fans would appreciate, but I suspect that she just sort of wants to justify years of hoarding.” He added: “As you can see from the picture, I guess I was probably dreaming about Star Wars before I even saw the film. And it's probably framed my idea of what a movie even was.”


	Levy has been developing the Star Wars feature since 2022 and Jonathan Tropper, who collaborated with Levy on films such as This Is Where I Leave You and The Adam Project, wrote the script.


	It would take an IT-O interrogation droid to coax any plot details from the pair, but the movie has been heating up in Hollywood casting circles in recent weeks. While many names have bubbled up only to prove to be incorrect, there does seem to be a search for a teenage actor to play opposite Gosling's mystery man and for a male and female villain.


	The film is a stand-alone movie that will be unconnected to the so-called Skywalker Saga, the stories centered on well-established and beloved characters Luke Skywalker and his father, Anakin. The events of Starfighter take place approximately five years after the events of 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. 












	“This is a stand-alone. It's not a prequel, not a sequel. It's a new adventure. It's set in a period of time that we haven't seen explored yet,” said Levy. He added that production starts this fall.


	There is high interest in the Levy-Gosling project as it will be only the second feature made since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, a movie whose reception threw the Star Wars movie plans into disarray. The first movie since Skywalker will be The Mandalorian & Grogu, a spinoff based on the popular Disney+ series The Mandalorian. That movie is in postproduction and is scheduled for a May 22, 2026 release.

Morgan Wallen and Post Malone have teamed up for a new collaboration.


													By
												

	Jessica Nicholson



Morgan Wallen and Post Malone are teaming up again, with their just-released second collaboration, “I Ain't Comin' Back.”


	The two artists previously earned a towering hit last year with “I Had Some Help,” which topped charts in both pop and country formats, spending six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and four weeks atop Country Airplay. The song, which was featured on Post Malone's country album F-1 Trillion, was also No. 1 on Billboard‘s 2024 Songs of the Summer chart.


	Now, they are looking at potentially dominating the charts again with their new collab. They co-wrote the song with Louis Bell, HARDY, ERNEST and Ryan Vojtesak.


	“I Ain't Comin' Back” will be included on Wallen's upcoming album I'm the Problem, out May 16 via Big Loud/Mercury. Earlier this week, Wallen confirmed several collaborators on the album. In addition to the new song with Post Malone, the 37-track project will feature Tate McRae (on”What I Want”), Eric Church (“Number 3 and Number 7”), HARDY (“Come Back as a Redneck”) and ERNEST (“The Dealer”).

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Wallen is a co-writer on 22 of the songs on the new album, and fans have already gotten an early glimpse into the project through the handful of songs that have been released, including “Love Somebody” and “Lies Lies Lies.”


	Meanwhile, Post Malone recently played a headlining set at Coachella and told Billboard he's working on a new project in Nashville, noting that he's “made probably 35 songs; it's just a matter of which ones rock and which ones sock.” He's also gearing up to head out on the Big Ass Stadium Tour alongside Jelly Roll.

The 17-track project includes collabs with Victoria Monét, Becky G and more.

Davido released his fifth studio album, 5ive, on Friday (April 18) via Davido Music Worldwide, RCA Records and Sony Music UK.


	The 17-track project includes previously released singles “Awuke” with YG Marley, “Funds,” featuring Odumodublvck and Chike, and “Be There Still,” and it includes more collaborations with Victoria Monét (“Offa Me”), Shenseea and 450 (“R&B”), Musa Keys and Victony (“Holy Water”), Chris Brown (“Titanium”), Becky G (“Tek”), Tayc and Dadju (“Lover Boy”) and Omah Lay (“With You”). 


	“This 5ive album? Man, it means everything to me. It's more than just a number — it's a statement of where I stand, five albums in,” the Afrobeats icon said in a press release. “Getting to work with artists that I love and respect from all over the world on this project was a blessing. Different sounds, different cultures, but one vibe! This one right here shows my growth, my journey and where I am now in my life and my artistry.”

	











5ive arrives two years after his last studio album, Timeless, which reached No. 2 on Billboard‘s World Albums chart and No. 37 on the Billboard 200. It was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards, while its Musa Keys-assisted hit single “Unavailable” hit No. 3 on U.S. Afrobeats Songs and was nominated for best African music performance. Davido was nominated in the best African music performance category again this year with Brown's “Sensational,” also featuring Lojay, which marked both Davido and Lojay's career-first entries on the Billboard Hot 100 last year when the song debuted at No. 96 (and later reached No. 71).

Joe Seiders, who played drums and keyboards in the New Pornographers, has been arrested for possession of child pornography, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. According to online records, Seiders was arrested on April 9 and remains in jail with his bail set at $1 million.

In a statement shared with Pitchfork, a spokesperson for the New Pornographers said: “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified, and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders—and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.”

According to the news release and online records, police officers responded to “a suspicious circumstance” at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Palm Desert, California, on Monday, April 7. An 11-year-old boy told the officers that “an unknown male adult recorded him on a cell phone while he was using the restroom at the location.”

Two days later, police responded to an incident at the same restaurant, where an employee said that “a male was entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males at the business.” The man was identified as Seiders, and he was apprehended by police and taken into custody.

Following Seiders' arrest, officials searched his residence, vehicle, and cell phone and found evidence implicating him in the two Chick-fil-A incidents and additional crimes, according to the news release.

In addition to the felony charge of possession of child pornography, Seiders was booked on misdemeanors charges of annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy. Records show that he has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is due in court on Tuesday, April 22.

Joe Seiders joined the New Pornographers after the release of their 2014 album Brill Bruisers, replacing longtime drummer Kurt Dahle. He played on 2017's Whiteout Conditions, 2019's In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, 2023's Continue as a Guest, and the recent single “Ballad of the Last Payphone,” and he toured with the band consistently until his dismissal.

The action-packed first look for the Disney+ series spin-off returns 'Star Wars' to theaters and includes several familiar characters. 



		By Patrick Brzeski, Abid Rahman, James Hibberd 

	April 17, 2025 6:49pm	




	The debut footage for the first Star Wars movie in seven years has now been seen by fans.


Lucasfilm and Disney revealed the first-look at The Mandalorian & Grogu, the Star Wars film spun off from Disney+'s The Mandalorian TV series, at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan. Jon Favreau, who directed the movie and co-wrote it with Star Wars guru Dave Filoni, were on hand to introduce it.




	In the action-heavy footage, the audience sees snowtroopers inside an AT-AT preparing to engage in battle. Then, in what appears to be a sort of homage to the opening of the original 1977 movie, in which Rebels prepared for, and then were massacred by, invading stormtroopers, the Mandalorian cuts open into the hull of the AT-AT, then, in one continuous take, blasts, stabs, pyros, and fights his way through the snowtroopers, making his way through the hull and then hallway, ending at the door of the cockpit, which quickly closes.

	The sizzle reel also showed the mystery character played by Sigourney Weaver speaking to Mando and Grogu, reminding Mando that he works for her. Several grandly staged battle scenes followed — an AT-T falling off the side of a snowy cliff, Grogu using his powers, Grogu swimming underwater. The reel concluded with a brief look at Jeremy Allen White as Rotta the Hutt, the son of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, raising his hands in triumph in some sort of fighting arena, and then cutting to Grogu in the stands and eating what passes for the Star Wars version of popcorn.


	Stars Pedro Pascal and Weaver, both of whom were received by standing ovations (a very fashionable Pascal's entrance was greeted with ear-splitting screams), joined filmmaker Favreau on stage, who welcomed some small, surprisingly life-like animatronic BDX Droids to the stage.


	Favreau spoke about the significance of holding this event in Japan.


	“When I think about Star Wars and what inspired Star Wars, it's so inextricably tied to Japanese cinema, Japanese culture and tradition. George Lucas was very inspired by the filmmakers of Japan and to come back here, it feels like a homecoming,” he said.


	Pascal looked back at the beginning of his involvement in the franchise, recalling his first creative meeting about the project. “I'll never forget the first day that I got to sit down with Jon and Dave in the writers room, and they showed me, wall-to-wall story illustrations of the first season of Mandalorian, without me even understanding who they expected me to play. And I remember just seeing the greatest visual storyboards that I had ever seen, and knowing that people were going to lose their minds.”

	











	Weaver noted her journey on the film began with a Zoom call with Favreau, and included the director and Filoni giving her some homework: watch the TV show.


	“When I watched it, I fell in love with all the characters, but especially this man,” she said, putting her hand on Pascal's shoulder. “There's somebody else I fell in love with. May I just say that, of course, Grogu stole my heart. And you know, I just saw him in the green room. He looks a little nervous, but I bet he'd like to come out here.”


	A tiny animatronic Grogu then took the stage to rapturous applause and waved tentatively to the crowd.


	There's no official word as to when the footage will be released online, but Star Wars Celebration is scheduled to be covered by ABC's Good Morning America on Friday morning, so it's possible the footage could drop during the telecast. If that happens, we'll update this post with the footage, so keep checking back.


The Mandalorian & Grogu marks the first big screen effort by the franchise since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and is expected to include characters from other Disney+ Star Wars series, such as Ahsoka and Star Wars: Rebels.


	The project represents an interesting twist in Disney's handling of the franchise. The company proved that Star Wars storylines can be successfully extended to the small screen, starting with the launch of The Mandalorian in 2019. But can this also work in reverse — taking TV storylines and shifting them to a theatrical release?

	











	Once again, Pascal reprises his role as Din Djarin, the helmet-wearing rogue Mandalorian who travels the galaxy with his adorable Jedi-powered ward, Grogu (who is known pretty much everywhere as Baby Yoda).


	The cast also Jonny Coyne as an Imperial warlord. The rest of the cast has been kept under wraps.


	Originally, Favreau and Filoni had done some work on a fourth season of The Mandalorian, which was delayed due to the Hollywood strikes. During this period, Disney reportedly decided to opt for a Mandalorian film instead and announced the project in January 2024.


	Neither Favreau nor Filoni have said much publicly about the film. But last year at D23 Favreau said on the red carpet, “To come back together and have the scale and scope of the big screen to tell a story with characters people already know in a brand-new adventure that can … part of what we've set out to do is something that rewards people who have been with the show since the beginning, who have been with Star Wars since the beginning. But since we're on the big screen, it's an opportunity to reach out to a whole new audience with a whole new adventure and certainly with Grogu — certainly all the kids know who that is, and this is an opportunity to bring them to the theater.”


	The news comes as Disney+ prepares to release its highly anticipated second season of another Star Wars project, Andor, which returns April 22. Other Star Wars films in development include Ford v Ferrari filmaker James Mangold's Dawn of the Jedi movie, a new Star Wars trilogy from X-Men franchise writer Simon Kinberg, and Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy's stand-alone Star Wars film that was given and date and title at Star Wars Celebration. 












The Mandalorian & Grogu will be released on May 22, 2026.

	Director Jon Favreau, Pedro Pascal and Sigourney Weaver took the stage at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo today to show off more footage from their upcoming The Mandalorian and Grogu.


	For some time, all we knew is that the new movie will bring the bounty hunter and baby Yoda on a standalone mission.


	In the new footage, Weaver's character is teased, along with some action-packed battle scenes against stormtroopers. Fans also get a first glimpse at Jeremy Allen White as Jabba's son Rotta the Hutt.


	The last time we caught footage of movie which isn't due for release until May 22, 2026 was at D23 in Anaheim back in August. That clip showed the return of The Empire Strikes Back‘s AT-ATs stomping in the snow, the crazy voiced tiny alien tech Babu Frick from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and red alien, pointy eared Zeb from Filoni's animated series Star Wars: Rebels.

	











The Mandalorian and Grogu is the first Star Wars feature since Rise of Skywalker six years ago. Originally Lucasfilm had a plan to do standalone movies based on core canon characters, but with the tanking of Solo: A Star Wars Story, they pivoted, expanding the Star Wars universe on Disney+ and significantly taking a more patient approach to developing future Star Wars movies.

	Director Shawn Levy and Ryan Gosling took the stage today in Tokyo, Japan for Star Wars Celebration, officially announcing their upcoming project Star Wars: Starfighter. 


	Set five years after The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the new installment is set to go into production this fall and premiere May 28, 2027 exclusively in theaters.


	Said Levy, “There are many rumors, some true, some not. … This is not a prequel, this is not a sequel. It's a new adventure.”


	Gosling praised the installment as “such a great story with great and original characters,” as well as “so much heart and adventure,” adding: “There is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn.

	Until now, the project which is being written by Jonathan Tropper for the last two years, has been under wraps. It's a standalone movie outside the Luke Skywalker core canon. While Disney's Lucasfilm has multiple Star Wars features in development with James Mangold, Simon Kinberg, and a Rey post Episode IX movie with Daisy Ridley returning and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy directing, the Levy Star Wars project is known to be in tip-top fastrack shape.

	It was recently reported that Anora Oscar winner Mikey Madison passed on a supporting role offer in the new Levy directed Star Wars movie. 


	Levy is a cornerstone filmmaker for Disney having delivered them the highest grossing R-rated movie of all-time with Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine which minted $1.33 billion worldwide.


	Levy's Star Wars movie would be the second after next year's The Mandalorian and Grogu to hit the screen following 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker which minted $1.077 billion.

The ABC show killed off a major character in Thursday's episode.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers for the April 17 episode of 911, ‘Lab Rats.']


	For the first time in eight seasons, 911 has killed off a member of its core cast.




	In the ABC drama's April 17 episode, titled “Lab Rats,” L.A. Fire Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause) sacrifices his own life to save members of his crew. Bobby shares a final moment with his wife, LAPD Sgt. Athena Grant-Nash (Angela Bassett), before succumbing to a deadly virus he and his fellow firefighters had been trying to contain.

	In a long statement about his departure from the show, Krause acknowledges that long-time viewers of the show may be “upset by this loss, and they have a right to be. It is a loss.” But he also defends the decision by co-creator and showrunner Tim Minear, who told The Hollywood Reporter that “It makes sense for his character to have a tragic sacrifice as a conclusion of his entire journey in the show. And also, if there's a character whose death is going to affect the most characters, who would that be?”

	











	Krause says in his statement, “It was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them.”


	Krause also thanks his castmates, the show's executive producers, crew and technical adviser, and the real-life first responders who do the work he has portrayed on 911 for the past eight seasons. His full statement is below. 


I would like to thank Dana Walden, Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear for entrusting me with such a complex character over these nine years. It has been my honor to portray Captain Bobby Nash. 


In October 2017, through him, we began tackling topics such as grief, guilt, anger and addiction while exploring his relationship with a higher power, forgiveness and grace. On his path of healing, we watched him join and embrace both his new family at the firehouse and his new family with Athena Grant where he found love and acceptance. We also had plenty of fun along the way. It was a joy.


Humbled by working in step with our technical advisor, Chief Mike Bowman, and real firefighters, I wish to thank you all for helping me bring a sense of dignity and realism to the character in our larger-than-life emergency landscape. Your kind and complimentary words have meant the world to me. 












I've heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be.  It is a loss. That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them. We at 911 salute all the incredible men and women who do these dangerous jobs and strive to keep us safe.


Our show is incredibly difficult to make at times with long hours, challenging stunts and elaborate disasters. We couldn't do it without each other.


I wish to thank everyone in every department and all those at ABC, 20th Television and Fox. We are a sprawling team.


I will miss all my 911 family. Our incredible crew whose professional excellence is second to none. All the writers who keep pulling rabbits out of hats. All the directors tasked with the same. All the incredible guest cast over the years as well as Jennifer Love Hewitt and the cast in the call center.


I will miss my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.


Tim Minear and Brad Buecker, you've been my pillars and are two of the best in the business. I will miss you both.


Finally, I will miss my beloved and unruly children of the 118. Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody: this is a tough goodbye. Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other. That's how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.












This has been one wild adventure. I thank you all, with all my heart.

Things are looking up for longtime HGTV star Page Turner, who will take over for Hilary Farr on the new season of “Love It Or List It,” premiering on April 21, 2025. 

In addition to her new role on the iconic show, Page revealed during her April 15 appearance on “The Jennifer Hudson Show” that she also has a “new man.” Fans were thrilled to get a romance update from the designer, who co-starred with her ex on “Flip or Flop Nashville” for two seasons before hosting “Fix My Flip.”

Turner's admission about being in a new relationship came as Hudson teased her about getting to meet  hunky actor Aaron Pierre, who had the starring role in Disney's 2024 live action “Mufasa: The Lion King.”

As Turner demonstrated some DIY spring crafts on the talk show, Hudson said, “Did you show this to Aaron Pierre? Because I heard you met him at the Black American Film Festival?”  

“Who's that, Mufasa?” Turner teased as members of the audience squealed with delight. 

“Yes, Mufasa!” Hudson replied, and she and Turner danced in unison for a moment. 

“Oh sorry, I lost myself,” Turner joked. “Um, I didn't know whether to call him Aaron or Mufasa, to tell you the truth. And he's so tall. I had a whole hot flash.” 

Laughing, Hudson walked away and Turner said, “Wait, Jennifer! Don't leave! Ok, I'm having a hot flash again.” 

She then turned to the audience and exclaimed, “I have a man now, so I shouldn't have told all of my inside secrets. I have a man now!” 

Nevertheless, she whipped the crowd into a frenzy when she told Hudson that when she met Pierre, her girlfriend asked him whether he watched Turner's show on HGTV, and he responded, “No, but I will now!” 

A post shared by Page Turner (@pageturnerunlimited)

When Hudson's show posted a social media clip of her and Turner's funny moment of swooning over Pierre, fans and friends flooded the post with comments, thrilled to hear that the interior designer is in love. 

One person exclaimed, “Page got a man !!!!!!! 😂🥰❤️” and Turner replied, “Tell 'em bestie, I tried to 😂”

Another quipped, “Ok man now 😍 Mufasa is missing out!”

Someone else demanded, “Who is this man??? That's what I want to know! 🔥❤️”

Although Turner did not identify her new man on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” she gave her followers a glimpse of what one called his “anonymous shoulder” when she posted a video from a day on the beach in late March. 

Turner tagged FOX Sports and ESPN commentator Mike Hill as the person who photographed her playing in the ocean and wrote, “This joy. This peace. This love…. The world didn't give it to me .. and FOR SURE can't take it away!”

Turner and Hill have exchanged sweet notes with each other in their social media comments since then, including on April 3, when he posted a photo of himself by the beach. 

In the comments, she wrote, “Sooooo Blessed AND Highly Favored!! 🔥🔥🔥” and Hill replied, “so thankful for those blessings!! Especially the ones I've received over the last month or so!! ❤️😍🙏🏾”

In 2018 and 2019, Turner co-starred with her ex, former NFL player DeRon Jenkins, on “Flip or Flop Nashville,” a spinoff of HGTV's popular “Flip or Flop” series. Before the show's premiere, Turner told Us Weekly that they'd been together “for a long time” but found they worked better together as business partners rather than romantic partners. 

Turner has three daughters from a previous relationship, per Closer Weekly — Zaire, Qai, and Quincy. Hill, meanwhile, has two daughters from a previous marriage, per Page Six. He was married from 2020 to 2022 to “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Cynthia Bailey, the outlet reported.

Josh Groban brings his wealth of experience to “American Idol” season 23 as a guest mentor. The talented singer shared what he loves most about imparting his vast knowledge to the young hopefuls.

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

In an April 2025 interview with Billboard, Groban shed some light on what it was like to mentor the “American Idol” hopefuls.

For Groban, it was a no-brainer to join the show. “They didn't even mention Hawaii before I said yes,” he explained. “I've done it before, whether it's on ‘Idol' or through my foundation, working with after school programs or kids that are just in need of that push and advice.”

He continued, “My favorite thing about having a platform is being able to impart some small amounts of wisdom that maybe will help them escape some of the trappings that I had to learn the hard way.”

Groban shared that making a show involves a lot of behind-the-scenes efforts that aren't seen. “The talent is genuine and the notes we give are genuine,” he noted. “I wish that audiences could see us when the cameras aren't rolling — working with Jelly [Roll] and the way we're talking about what the contestants need to do.”

He also provided some insight into how they are really “invested” as mentors. “We really care. It's not just for TV. Because we've been there and we know how special this is for them and we also know that these are notes that will travel with them beyond the competition,” Groban explained.

The singer pointed out that, although there's only one “Idol” winner, their guidance as mentors extends beyond the show.

“They may decide to not continue with music, but we can also note that having this experience will be a foundation of confidence for them for the rest of their lives and we want to make sure that the things we instill in them allow them to have that for whatever they do,” Groban added.

While Groban may have been mentored by music industry heavy-hitters like David Foster when he started his career, he also received valuable mentorship in school.

“I also want to give a huge shout out to my teachers,” Groban shared. “The unsung heroes were my choir teachers in junior high and high school, when I was at my most insecure. They were essential in helping me find my voice, find myself.”

He added, “And it just so happens that I went into it professionally, but even if I hadn't … it helped me as a human being. It helped me as somebody who was a little lost inside myself to realize that my voice had a place in this world and if I'd gone into veterinary medicine, which was my other dream, it still would've followed me.”

The departed actor says the character “was built for this,” as Tim Minear and Angela Bassett speak to The Hollywood Reporter about the immense loss on the ABC drama.


							By 

	Max Gao



[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from season eight, episode fifteen of 911, “Lab Rats.”]


911 co-creator and showrunner Tim Minear is afraid the rumors are true: Robert “Bobby” Nash (Peter Krause), the beloved fire captain of the LAFD's Station 118, has just answered his last call.




	“Bobby's dead,” Minear confirms to The Hollywood Reporter in an interview about the biggest creative swing he has ever taken in his three-decade career. Some viewers will want to believe that Bobby's death is a fakeout — after all, this is a show known for pulling its main characters back from death's door time and again — but the steward of the 911 franchise insists that he just killed off his male lead: “The body bag didn't convince you?”

	“I've heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be. It is a loss,” Krause said in a statement about his departure from the series (read it in full here). “That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them. We at 911 salute all the incredible men and women who do these dangerous jobs and strive to keep us safe. …


	“I will miss my beloved and unruly children of the 118. Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody: this is a tough goodbye. Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other. That's how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.”


	It's a seismic shift that will completely shake the foundations of the ABC first-responder drama, which earlier this month was renewed for a ninth season. In eight seasons, 911 had never killed off a member of the main cast — a rarity for a long-running procedural — but Minear admits that the thought had been lingering in the back of his mind for years.


	Once he devised his plan for a midseason, two-part thriller, which finds some members of the 118 injured in a lab explosion and trapped with a lethal strain of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Minear knew he needed to pull the (metaphorical) trigger on one of his characters. “Otherwise, the next time I turn over a cruise ship, or land a plane on the freeway, or take a city out with a tsunami, you're just going to be like, ‘Oh, everyone's going to be fine,'” he explains. “So it was time for there to be some real tragic fallout from a story.”

	











	Minear fittingly describes Thursday's episode as a knife in the heart. While attempting to keep three of his team members alive — Chimney (Choi), who had contracted the fatal strain of CCHF; Hen (Hinds), who had to get a makeshift chest tube to prevent her lung from collapsing; and Ravi (Pisharody), who collapsed due to a lack of oxygen — Bobby discovers a hole in the air supply line in his breathing apparatus.


	Accepting his own fate, Bobby makes sure the rest of his team is taken care of. When his wife, Sgt. Athena Grant-Nash (Angela Bassett), arrives with the single dose of antiviral that she seized from the mad scientist Moira Blake (Bridget Regan), Bobby chooses to give the medication to Chimney, who quickly recovers. After the rest of his team is extracted from the lab, Bobby, much to the horror of Buck (Stark), locks himself inside the lab and takes off his protective gear. It isn't until Bobby comes face-to-face with Athena through a glass wall that he reveals he began to feel the effects of the virus hours ago.


	“I'm not choosing to leave you. I chose to save my team because it was the right thing to do. It was never because I wanted to go. I don't want to go. If I could choose, I would stay with you. Always,” Bobby tells Athena through tears. “We don't have any more time. Mine was always borrowed. L.A. was supposed to be my penance, not my home. Then you said yes to a dinner invitation, and I started to live again.”


	Athena stays with Bobby as he takes his last breath while kneeling in a prayer position over a table, and Bassett herself made the decision for Athena to shriek in agony. “It was incredulous to me that it was Bobby, so it was just very surprising,” Bassett tells THR of her reaction to losing her character's other half. “Sometimes, you're just struck dumb — and that's one of those moments, because their bond has been so wonderful and so strong these past four or five years. I didn't see that coming. None of us saw that coming.”

	











	In his statement, Krause said of Bassett, “I will miss my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.”


	Bassett and Minear, who both serve as executive producers of 911, spoke with THR on Wednesday in separate conversations. Their chats have been edited into the conversation below.


Peter Krause has always talked about how much he enjoyed working on this show, so this storyline came as a real shock to longtime viewers like myself. Tim, given that Peter is the male lead and an executive producer, was it ultimately his decision to leave, or did you decide to write him off? Are there any specific reasons that led to your decision to kill off Bobby at this point in the show's run?


TIM MINEAR I would say it was our [collective] decision, but it was my decision because I felt like creatively, if the show became too inert, it would just die of inertia, right? So I felt like it just needed to happen. Otherwise, the next time I turn over a cruise ship, or land a plane on the freeway, or take a city out with a tsunami, you're just going to be like, “Oh, everyone's going to be fine.” So it was time for there to be some real tragic fallout from a story.


	Once I started thinking that somebody had to die, then the choice was, who? And the only choice that I thought made sense was Bobby. It makes sense for his character to have a tragic sacrifice as a conclusion of his entire journey in the show. And also, if there's a character whose death is going to affect the most characters, who would that be? So, go big or go home.

	











	Bobby's death gives new life to every single character's story. It changes everything. It's not a shock moment. It's not a superficial thing. It is a potentially game-changing thing. Is it a skinny branch I'm crawling out on? Maybe. But I will never be convinced that it wasn't the right creative move. So, no, it's not because Peter wanted to leave. I don't think he wanted to leave. We're great friends. He's fantastic on the show. He's so good that it made [the decision] a terrifying choice on my part, which is why I felt like, “OK, well, maybe that's the right choice. Do the scary thing.”


When exactly did you and Peter begin discussing his exit from the series?


MINEAR We had talked about Bobby dying for a while — and I had been thinking about it this year. I'd been thinking about a major character death, let's put it that way. At one point, it was this character, maybe it was that character, or possibly this character. I had been thinking about it, but I really had been thinking about Bobby because I wanted it to open up an opportunity for stories for all the characters.


	[Writer's note: In the first half of season eight, Bobby served as a firefighting consultant for a fictional show-within-a-show called Hotshots. That fake show's captain was played by an actor named Brad Torrance, who was, in turn, played by Callum Blue.] If you look at the episode where Brad Torrance is saying that his captain [character] is not going to wake up, and a fan of that show says, “You can't kill off Brad! You can't kill off that character. He's what holds the fire family together.” That was a little hint that that's maybe where I was going to go this year. But it wasn't until I was breaking this lab leak story that I realized I'm never going to probably have another opportunity for the kind of epic death that I think this story could give me. And then it just felt like it's time to jump out of the plane.

	











What was the rest of the cast's reaction to Bobby's death? Did you and Peter break the news together, or did you do it on your own?


MINEAR They were shocked. Peter and I had been talking about it for probably three weeks to a month before I let anyone else know. I had to clear it with the network and the studio. I had to pitch them out the whole story. Everyone was very nervous. And once I got everybody on board, I talked to [co-creator] Ryan Murphy about it, and once everybody was on board and Peter was on board, then I had to start calling the cast one by one. Each of those calls was a little bit different, and none of them were quick because practically nobody believed me. They all thought I was punking them. Aisha Hinds — it probably took me 15 minutes to convince her that I was not joking.


	I know I killed off a lot of characters on Angel, Buffy or whatever, but in this instance, we had never done it in eight years. Look, I've been on a lot of [shows] – geez, on American Horror Story, how many people got murdered? But that sort of doesn't count. This is a procedural, and characters die on network TV, except we had never done it before. So this was the most fraught version of killing off a character that I've ever been involved with. It literally felt like somebody that you loved was dying. We all felt that way. I know Kenny [Choi] just kept calling me, and he's like, “Can't his mother come back and bring him back to life with her faith healing skills?” Everybody was kind of trying to bargain with God. In this case, I would be God, and I am a just God and I am a benevolent God — but he died.

	











Angela, what was your reaction when you got that unexpected phone call? How did you react to the news that you would be losing your other half on the show?


ANGELA BASSETT Tim did pull Peter first and let him know. Then he pulled me and he gave me a call and was like, “OK, Angela, this is a big change in the season. We gotta do something really dramatic — and someone's going to die.” And then there's a pause, of course. And I said, “Is it … Athena? Is it me?!” He was like, “No.” And then I started going through the list: “Is it Hen? Is it Chimney?” And I think finally, after about three or four names, I was like, “What?!” — because it was inconceivable to me that it was Bobby. It was incredulous to me that it was Bobby, so it was just very surprising. Sometimes, you're just struck dumb — and that's one of those moments because their bond has been so wonderful and so strong these past four or five years. I didn't see that coming. None of us saw that coming.


	So I think [I got the call] maybe about a week before I actually saw Peter on set. He was doing a scene and I was doing a different scene, but we were on the same location, same set. And I just remember coming to set and asking everyone, “Where's Bobby? Where's Bobby?” “He's upstairs.” “OK. I'll get to this later, but let me find my man.” [Laughs.] And we just looked at each other. You know when your eyes just lock and you don't know what to say? And you just bear hug each other and then you just shake your head. And bless his heart — he had to comfort all of us. [Laughs] He truly had to comfort all of us while he's going through his own processing in the moment. But fortunately, everything's [shot] so out of order that you can shoot what will be the finality [of that character], but you still have more time together. So that's some measure of grace — a small measure.

	











In these last two episodes, Bobby has a one-on-one scene with almost all the important people in his chosen family, who he says are responsible for saving him from the throes of addiction and making his life worth living again. Tim, how did you want to find ways to honor that growth in the character in this storyline, particularly at the very end of his life?


MINEAR He came to L.A. thinking, “I'm going to save this number of people that would make up for the lives that were taken with my mistake back in Minnesota.” And then as he says to Athena in this episode, “And then you said yes to my dinner invitation. I started to live again.” I explored a lot of it last year too, in the Amir storyline. So I think he's a guy who came to L.A. with a death wish, and at the end of the day, he ends up sacrificing himself to save the people that he loves, but he no longer wishes to die — so that the sacrifice actually means something.


Angela, given all the time that you and Peter have spent playing these characters and building this relationship, what do you remember from the painful experience of having to shoot Bobby's death scene? Did you feel as helpless shooting that sequence in the moment as the audience will feel watching it?


BASSETT I think so. I just didn't know how emotional I would be. You're not trying to plan it and plot it. I think I remember saying, “OK, I'm not crying. I'm going to be stoic. I'm going to be strong. Athena's strong.” But being separated from him by that partition of glass and the hazmat suits, we're not only separated by glass, but we have these big bubble helmets on our head, so it makes it even more impossible to touch. So I really had to look and search for his eyes. You really have to just attempt to touch each other in whatever way you can, and that is gazing in the eyes and really looking into the eyes and the soul and the spirit of another human being and seeing their humanity.

	











	So I'm looking as a character, but I'm looking as Angela; I'm looking as a human being. It was a very rich moment, and all the emotion that needed to be there was there on both our parts take after take after take. However many takes [it took], you're like, it is still fresh and real. So as hard as it was, [there] was also something very cleansing about it, because we're human and we connected as characters and we connected as colleagues. It was just a bigger-than-life moment and experience.


What else stands out to both of you in Athena and Bobby's final moments together? Angela, how specifically did you want to play Athena's last moments with the love of her life?


BASSETT As strong as Athena has been, I think she wanted to express her love to him. Maybe she could express that in that moment — all that he has been and meant to her life, her family's life, her children's life. You want to be the pillar, a bit of strength for them, in that moment, and express your love, but it's so incredibly painful. But you're going to be there until the final breath, the final moment.


MINEAR What stands out to me is the way Peter played it. It was his idea to turn away and make his way to that table and just get into this prayerful posture. I thought that was brilliant because both Peter and I agreed that — and you'll see some of this when you see the final version, some effects that have yet to be in there — what we didn't want was for Bobby to die in an orgy of body horror, where he just looked like a zombie dying or something, you know what I mean? So I think it'll feel horrifying, but poetic and subtle in a way. And Peter's decision to move away from her and turn his back to her and just get into that position I just thought was such a great choice. That's what stands out to me — and also just his performance there, both of them, of course. But when he says, “I don't want to go,” it's a knife in your heart. It's certainly a knife in mine. I'm a murderer! [Laughs uneasily.]

	











Angela, you recently said that you couldn't imagine what 911 would look like without Athena and Bobby together, but now we're about to find out. We see Athena, Buck, Hen, Chimney, Ravi and Hen's wife Karen's (Tracie Thoms) immediate reactions to Bobby's death. How much are we going to see Athena and the rest of the 118's grief play out in these final three episodes of the season? And now that we have finally reached this point, going forward, what will this show look like without Bobby and Peter?


BASSETT She's going to try to be on her own. I don't know how it's going to play out at the beginning of next season, but initially, I think she has things [to lean on] — she has her kids, but they're pretty grown. She still has the home that they were building and is attempting to complete, so that's not complete. And there's still cases [of the week], so I think her [coping] mechanism is trying to dive back into work to distract herself. But we'll see how that plays out for her, and if that's going to work or not. Maybe she needs to go to therapy or something. [Laughs]


	This is the third love of her life that she's lost in some form or fashion. [Writer's note: Athena lost her fiancé, Emmett, in the line of duty decades ago, and her ex-husband, Michael, came out as gay in the pilot.] I am very curious to see how this plays out, and I know the audience will be as well. I know some of them are going to be so shocked, mortified, pissed off — all the things! But no doubt, it's going to give us something interesting to play when we lose someone so beloved in our lives.

	











MINEAR It was important for me that this wasn't a season finale. It was important for me that we had ideally three episodes. There were actually going to be four episodes, and then I shot episode 15 very quickly and aired it as episode 13, because I wanted it to line up right before the one week that we were off. That needed to happen, to give the audience a breath. But it felt very important to me that this couldn't even be a penultimate episode. You needed two or three episodes after this moment for the audience to process it and for the characters to grieve. I just felt like it would be a giant ripoff for the audience if, for instance, this happened at the end of a season and then you came back into a new season and you missed the grieving period.


	So every one of the episodes, for the last three, even though there's thrilling adventures and high stakes and season finale-level stuff happening, everything is about the fact that Bobby's not there and them all processing that. It's not like they're going to get to three episodes in, and they're like, “OK, we're good now. Bring in the new guy!” That's not what's happening.


Tim, we know you love a good ghost story. Will Bobby appear in these final three episodes of the season?


MINEAR What I would say is that episode 15 is not Peter Krause's last appearance this season.


Angela, you and Peter share the distinction of being the longest scene partners of each other's careers. What stands out to you about the evolution of Athena and Bobby's relationship in these eight seasons, and what will you miss most about working with Peter?












BASSETT It was surprising to me when they got together at the end of that [first] season. I was like, “What?! OK.” [Laughs.] And even more surprising that now they're parting, but hopefully there will still be fond memories and they'll still get together. We'll see how he revisits her, or if he does, or for how long. When we lose someone, we dream of them sometimes, or we can be doing the most mundane thing and something in our spirit hears them or feels them or senses them, so I can't wait to see what Tim comes up with. Tim usually mirrors life in a very beautiful and poignant way. A lot of times when I read some of the scripts, I've said, “Is he eavesdropping on my life or a portion of my life? Whether it's about the kids, or the ex-husband, or friendships, or relationships.”


	[Peter's] gentle. He's easy. He's warm. He's welcoming. He knows everyone's name. He is just a wonderful actor and a quintessential good guy, so I'll miss that. He's the best, and it's been great getting to know him and working with him is always an upside and a positive with him. He's honest — and he's good for a laugh. He doesn't mind being the point of a joke because the 118, they are all a bunch of characters and funny men and clowns. They love to laugh all day with each other, so I think we're all going to miss that. But he's a beautiful soul.


Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) absence was particularly noticeable in these two episodes — some of the issues that the 118 faced in this episode could have been fixed if there was an additional medic quarantined in that lab — but Eddie is still in El Paso happily rebuilding his relationship with his son, Christopher (Gavin McHugh). What can we expect from Eddie's reaction to Bobby's death and his return to L.A. for his former captain's funeral?












MINEAR Eddie experienced it in a different way. He wasn't there. He got a phone call. So in a way, I think what Eddie's feeling is, “Would it have been different if I had been there?” So that's not going to be easy for him, but we're going to see all that in these last three episodes.


Following Thursday's episode, ABC released a teaser for the next episode, which airs May 1 and will see the show's characters confronting the loss. Watch it below.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about Episode 815 of ABC's 9-1-1, “Lab Rats.“


	Four Station 118 firefighters got trapped into a lab with a deadly virus on ABC's 9-1-1. Three of them, Chimney, Hen and Ravi, had a brush with death but it was the fourth who didn't come out alive: Captain Bobby Nash, played by series co-lead and executive producer Peter Krause.


	Thursday night's episode, “Lab Rats,” written by series executive producer Kristen Reidel, Molly Green and James Leffler and directed by Dawn Wilkinson, marked Krause's final appearance as Bobby sacrificed himself to save his team.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In an interview with Deadline, 9-1-1 executive producer/showrunner Tim Minear explained the decision to kill off the beloved character, which is certain to leave the series' legions of fans heartbroken, and what it would mean for the long-running drama, which has been renewed for a ninth season. He addressed the online leaks from the shoot of Bobby's funeral, along with the release of “The Last Alarm” title for that episode that tipped fans off to his fate, and that alternate (and fake) Bobby death script page that further fueled speculation that he may be gone. He also pointed out the clue to Bobby's looming demise early in the season, which you likely missed, gave an update on Bobby's mom and teased upcoming 9-1-1 cast addition(s).

9-1-1 co-lead/executive producer Angela Bassett, who plays Bobby's wife, LAPD Sargent Athena Grant, spoke of her shock and her meeting with Krause after learning of Bobby's fate. She revealed that — possibly as a redirect — there was another firefighter in the lab who they initially thought was going to die.


	Bassett detailed the filming of Bobby and Athena's emotional goodbye scene on opposite sides of a glass door and shared that they shot a different version of its ending after Bobby tells Athena, “You have to go, you can't be here for this next part” in which she complies with his request. 


	In the final cut, Athena replies with, “I'm here for all the parts that we have left” and stays with Bobby as he kneels to pray and dies, a final chord Krause had a key involvement in beyond acting, Minear revealed.

	











DEADLINE: For a long-running drama like 9-1-1 to kill off a major star the reasons are often financial, sometime creative and occasionally both. Which one do we have here?


TIM MINEAR: Creative.


DEADLINE: 100% creative?


MINEAR: 100%


DEADLINE: When and why did you make that decision to kill off Bobby?


MINEAR: Like you said, going into Season 9, I have all these perilous situations that I put the characters into, and I think maybe the writers but also the audience starts to get a little complacent because it's like, well, we all know it's going to all work out fine in the end. 


	I had been toying with the idea for a couple of seasons actually, maybe even longer, feeling like at some point I'm going to have to do this. And then once I came up with this idea for the lab leak episode, that's when it solidified for me that it was time to do it, it felt like a real opportunity to give somebody an epic Wrath of Khan-like death. When it came down to deciding who should that be, I wanted it to be a character that affected all the characters' stories in a very specific and yet different ways. There was only one man for the job, and it was Bobby.

	So that's why. It was a wrenching decision, and I think it was wrenching for everybody, because I adore Peter, and he's so great on the show, really the backbone of the show in so many ways, which is why it was both a terrifying decision but also, creatively, I just knew that it would be so meaningful and have such repercussions and give me so much story for the show. 


	Once I had made that choice, suddenly the world of the show seems so much more real to me, just feeling the grief of the characters and feeling just how that nuclear bomb going off in the center of that universe affected everything. Suddenly everything just felt weirdly more alive to me.


DEADLINE: There is this line in Bobby's final speech where he says, “I don't want to go.” I felt like Peter was not acting; the guy said just last last year that he wanted to do 100 more episodes of 9-1-1. What was his reaction to the news that his character is being killed off?


MINEAR: Peter is a friend of mine. He understands the realities of the creative process, and he knew it wasn't personal, he understood right away why I was telling him this. But I don't think it was an easy decision for any of us, it really felt like a loved one was dying in a way I never expected.


	When I was on Angel many, many years ago, I was known as the Tim Reaper because I would constantly kill off beloved characters. On a show about vampires, it's a little different, they can always come back. But here, because we'd all been in this together for over eight years, it's like, “Oh, it's TV, you kill off characters,” but when it came right down to it, I think we were all surprised at how incredibly emotional it was for all of us, crew, his castmates, me, him. And it remains that way right now, very raw.


DEADLINE: Angela, did you have any inkling that something of this magnitude might be coming this season? 


BASSETT: Absolutely not. Not an inkling, not a word, not birdies, nothing. This is near the end of the season. Sometimes near the end of the season, we're in this race against time to get our scripts, you're really getting it in real time. It's like get it today, and we're going to start filming it tomorrow. 

	











	So it was really a jaw-dropping moment when I read the script and saw that. Well, initially it was a different character, the whole bio lab. I mean, it could be anyone, it could be Chimney, it could be him, it could be Ravi.


	I remember Tim called. He said, someone's going to pass away. I said, Is it me? Self-preservation, you know. I went through the list, you start with yourself, but I was very surprised that it was my husband.


DEADLINE: You mentioned that there was a different character that initially was supposed to die. Did something change in the script?


BASSETT: That may have been just a misdirect, but initially it was Ravi, the probie; well, he is not a probie anymore.


DEADLINE: Angela, if I understood correctly, you literally found out about the death when you got the “Lab Rats” episode script, not earlier in the season?


BASSETT: Literally. Trust and believe, yeah.


DEADLINE: So when you were interviewed in March and said that you cannot imagine the show without Peter, you weren't being coy and protecting the secret, you were just being honest?


BASSETT:  I try to always be honest and never lie. Only after we'd received the episode we had to be a little bit coy. No, I can't imagine, that's true. And even sitting here today, I can't imagine it. I don't know how this is going to play out: Athena, her relationship with her job, herself, her kids, the 118. This is the second husband that she's lost and the end of her and Peter's tremendous bond. Where is she going? 


DEADLINE: As an actor, you see where this is probably going. Athena was in a great place, building a new home with her husband. And now she's lost a third significant other: a fiancé and a husband to death, and another husband to divorce. 


BASSETT: You're so right about that, I forgot about Emmett. 


DEADLINE: It feels like the writers want Athena back in a rocky, dark, emotional state. 


BASSETT: I think you're right, I think you might be on to something.


DEADLINE: This is a huge shock to the system of the entire team. We saw Chimney who clearly has survivor guilt; I can't even imagine what Athena will go through. Tim, can you talk about the impact of Bobby's death?


MINEAR: Well, not only is Bobby the captain of the 118, he is a father figure and mentor to Buck. He is an inspiration to all of them. He is seen as a husband. He is Athena's children's stepfather. It just reaches every element of the show. And as far as where we're going to go with all that, the story will tell me.


DEADLINE: Will you be adding somebody to the cast in the wake of Peter's exit? Somebody needs to lead the 118.


MINEAR: There will be changes in the universe. I'm still working my way through what those changes will be. I'm definitely going to be adding to the fire family but not necessarily in the way you might think.


DEADLINE: Did you adjust Bobby's story arc this season to give him a proper sendoff? Obviously he died a hero, saving his team, but he also had a heroic moment in the pre-lab leak episode, emerging from the smoke of a bus crash with a baby in his arms. He finally reconciled with his mother, too. 


MINEAR: Yes, a little bit actually. I'd really been thinking about it back during the first part of the season. There's a moment in the first part of the season when Brad Torrence, the Hotshots [TV show] star, says that his captain is never going to wake up from his coma, and a fan says, you can't kill him off, he's the father figure of the firehouse. So that was me hinting a little bit about where I might be going.

	











DEADLINE: Was Peter involved in crafting Bobby's ending? 


MINEAR: When I told him what was happening, like I said, he understood. And then I laid out for him how I felt this sacrifice would present itself. In a way, it's not arbitrary at all that this is Bobby, because it makes sense in the tragic arc of his character, for this to be his ending, that he ended up sacrificing himself to save the people that were closest to him. And if you want to talk about redemption, it's the ultimate redemption. We talked about every element of how we would accomplish it.


DEADLINE: Did Bobby die before his mother? Will we find out if she's still alive?


MINEAR: Yes, you'll see her at the funeral.  


DEADLINE: I assume that will be the May 1 episode “The Last Alarm”?


MINEAR: Yes.


	Following the airing of the “Lab Rat” episode, ABC released a promo for “The Last Alarm,” which deals with the immediate aftermath of Bobby's death and features his funeral.


DEADLINE: Speaking of the funeral. Didn't you guys learn anything from And Just Like That… and Succession about using decoys to throw bystanders off and protect a major death? As videos from the location shoot hit social media, online sleuths quickly deducted that Bobby is probably dead.   


MINEAR: We had our fingers crossed that when we went out and shot the procession, it wouldn't leak. I think we were just all being incredibly naive; I think I've underestimated the interest of the fans out there for this show. I think I've always been a little bit surprised by it. You know me, I'd worked in genre for so long, and that fan base is quite rabid and quite interested. Half the time I think, well, this is my network procedural, people aren't going to be as stanning about this show as they were about the other shows, but boy, I think the stanning on this show is bigger than anything I did in genre.


	I wanted the pageantry, I wanted the production value, I needed that. And so we rolled the dice, and we shot it in public. Now, the fact that I was literally watching the tap from the camera and Twitter, and I was like, hmm, which one's the tap and which one's somebody livestream TikTok-ing it, that was a bit of a shock.


DEADLINE: What about that fake script page with Bobby calling 911 from a coffin, which Oliver Stark posted on April Fools' Day that also riled fans up? How did that come about?


MINEAR: As far as that page, I don't know where that came from.


DEADLINE: Angela, what was your conversation like with Peter after finding out that Bobby was going to die. Did you call him right away?


BASSETT: No. I knew it was gonna be tough and sad and awkward, so I just preferred to see him face to face as opposed to on the phone. Part of us knows, we've been in this industry for a while, these kind of things have happened to our characters from time to time. I saw him, we looked at each other, it's like, oh well, and gave each other a big hug. We're just like, didn't see this coming.


	At that moment, we knew it's something that you have to process over the days and weeks, especially as you're still filming episodes and episodes. It's something that's coming but it's slowly revealing itself. It's a goodbye, but it's taking time. I guess it gave us all a chance to process and mourn. And we did, because we're an incredibly close cast, that team is very close. In scenes where Peter and I found ourselves with each other, it was like, “Oh my god, I can't believe it.” “I know, what are we gonna do?” “How do you feel?” Knowing the end and still having the ending scene to do.

	











DEADLINE: Let's talk about that ending scene for Bobby and Athena at the lab. Was this the last scene you two filmed? 


BASSETT: No, fortunately, it wasn't the last scene. Since we do everything out of order, I still had a few more scenes to do with him. It was a heart-wrenching moment, and then that's the goodbye. Cutting it off bit by bit, not a big chop as it were.


DEADLINE: How did you feel doing the goodbye scene, not even being able to be in the same space with your acting partner?


BASSETT: I actually enjoyed it. It added even more emotionality for me because I couldn't get to him, I couldn't touch him, embrace him, grab him. It's like there's this barrier so you're really trying to break through the glass. It really set something up for me that I didn't expect, because we had a number of scenes where, okay, I think this is where the emotion is going to be.


	We did two different versions [of the final scene]. There was also a version where, when he tells me to leave as he doesn't want me to see what he needs to do and what he's going to do in the lab, I go out and I'm by myself, and there's Buck, and then I have a breakdown there, like I was so strong for him inside.


	I was like, uh-uh. I said, well, I've done it now. I can't cry every single scene. I mean, you still have a funeral to go through.


	But when it came to that scene where I was actually in it with Bobby, you're separated by the glass, by the partition, by everything that separates people, your metaphor for whatever separates people, the virus, all of it. And seeing them, seeing their eyes, the memory of who they are, who they are to you, it was just there, every moment, every take for the two of us — the history, the bond.


DEADLINE: Knowing what happens with Peter brings additional meaning to some of the dialogue in that scene, Bobby saying “I don't want to go” and “I'm sorry, we don't have any more time” and Athena responding, “We need more time.” Was any of that improvised? It seems a bit like you're talking about you as actors not being on the show together anymore.


BASSETT: No, that's all Tim, those were the words. But yeah, it has that whole double entendre, double meaning that's come into play, absolutely, yeah.


DEADLINE: What about the touching of the hands through the glass, was all in the script too?


BASSETT: I believe that was in the script as well, a little of that, they wanted that moment.


DEADLINE: Tim, you mentioned redemption earlier. Bobby was praying as he died, also coming full circle as he and Athena first bonded when they went to church together. How did you come up with that ending?


MINEAR: That was Peter. That was Peter.


DEADLINE: Angela, how was it filming that? Was that the hardest part of that whole sequence?


BASSETT: Again, we filmed two versions of this, and I think that was the hardest part. But I always thought this version was the most right and heroic of Bobby, because that is such an integral part of his journey. And leaning in that moment still on his faith. That it is a tough, impossible situation, but there's still his creator, there's still hope. Never surrender that. And I thought it was beautiful and touching. He couldn't touch me, but he can still touch. He can still be in communion with his creator. So I love that.


	So I appreciate what the version of it that I longed for was [chosen]. Even with the separation of the glass, there's a tremendous bond and respect. And they're vulnerable with each other. They've had to be so strong for their team but they have that moment of vulnerability and still, you can go on your knees and pray.

	











DEADLINE: Who picked Hozier's “Work Song” for Bobby's final moments?


MINEAR: That was Kristen Reidel.


DEADLINE: Tim, are you afraid of fans' reaction to Bobby's death? Are you going into witness protection?


MINEAR: I I've been in witness protection ever since I stopped looking at social media. That's the way I protect myself, is I just don't look at that stuff.


	I'm definitely going out on a skinny branch in some way. We'll see what happens. I fervently believe that it was the right move creatively for the show. I didn't expect us to be going into a ninth year, and if the show has any hope of being creatively viable and alive going forward, then you need moments like this. You need them.

A US Navy officer has spoken out about spotting UFOs while working on a warship in the Pacific Ocean in 2023.

Footage was released last week that claimed 'tic tac' shaped objects were spotted by the crew of the USS Jackson on 15 February, 2023.

One of the unidentified objects was supposedly seen exiting the water and then flying away without leaving any sort of exhaust trail.

A man who witnessed it is Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins, who has spent 23 years in the US Navy. He said that his father had worked at Area 51.

You know, that place in the middle of the desert where the US keeps a bunch of secret stuff that may or may not have anything to do with aliens.

Anyhow, as for this sighting, 8newsnow reports that Wiggins was working as a radar specialist on the USS Jackson and his job was to spot objects in the air around the ship.

He said a whole bunch of people in the ships combat information centre saw strange objects on their screens, and described the moment.

He said: "To my surprise, which is something I've never witnessed, was a light I noticed on the horizon, it looked as if it were surfacing out of the water and going up

“We only saw the one, and then we see the second one, it was only when we zoom out that we realize, holy crap, there's two more out here, a total of four."

The sailor said he didn't know exactly what he saw, predicting that whatever it is might become better known when he's much older and it's several decades down the line.

"I am skeptical myself as to what I saw that day," he said of some of the former secrets which eventually became well known.

"Maybe one day I'll know what that was, and I'll be like 80 or 90 years old, and it'll be normalized like… the stealth fighter or Area 51. At some point, it'll be public, but then I'll be old."

There have been all sorts of sightings over the years of things known as UFOs or UAPs (unidentified flying phenomenon), some harder to verify than others.

There have been documentaries claiming to have uncovered the truth about various mysterious sightings, while there's plenty of footage of weird goings on for aficionados to go through.

RIO RANCHO — It's not every day that a retired U.S. Naval officer and strike fighter pilot would receive a spoof package of Tic Tacs, but that's what happened to Alex Dietrich following her highly publicized close encounter with an unidentified flying object, known as the "Tic Tac UFO."

The package supposedly containing the popular breath mints has still not been opened by Dietrich because she is mindful of the playful warning label, she told Cleveland High School students on Thursday. 

"My husband says, 'Just open it!'" said Dietrich, a scholar in residence at the University of Colorado-Boulder, during a speech in the high school's theater.

Dietrich, dressed in her flight suit, delved into some of the ways her routine training mission in November 2004 captured the national spotlight — from interviews in glossy magazines to gifts — but her appearance at Cleveland and Rio Rancho High School was at its core motivational, telling students to engage in critical thinking and be leaders. 

Her speech, coincidently, came as the renowned James Webb Space Telescope spotted the first potential signs of life outside of the solar system, a development Dietrich told students Thursday.

Dietrich's visit to the two schools also presented the opportunity for her to see the National UFO Historical Records Center, a large collection of artifacts related to unidentified flying objects that opened in October at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School.

Dietrich said in an interview Thursday that the center intrigued her, and she has been in talks with the center's executive director about collaborations for over a year.

The center, however, was not the centerpiece, so to speak, of Dietrich's speech; her UFO encounter was.

Dietrich, newly graduated from flight school, was flying a routine training mission for the USS Nimitz off the Southern California coast with other pilots on Nov. 14, 2004. While it was initially agreed for the pilots to meet at a certain point over the ocean, they received direction from radar control: "'This is real-world contact; you need to go check it out,'" Dietrich recalled controllers saying. 

"The hair on the back of my neck stood up," she told students. 

Dietrich did not see anything at first but soon noticed a disturbance in the water. 

"If it had not been for the water disturbance, I would not have picked up a visual response," Dietrich said. "We call it the Tic Tac."

She then held up a 3-D model a friend made her of the a 40-foot-long, white, oblong shape she saw. 

"This is what it looks like," Dietrich said, before asking students how many of them liked Tic Tacs.

Dietrich later spoke with investigators about her UFO encounter, which became part of a June 2021 report from the Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. The report examined 140 incidents of unidentified aerial phenomena and determined all but one of them could be traced to a source, the report said. The other incidents, however, could have been anything from a balloon to technology from a foreign country, according to the report. It also determined the phenomena "clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to U.S. national security."

Dietrich's speech detoured into getting students to engage in critical thinking by examining different philosophers and reading the U.S. Constitution. She called her pocket version of the document, "my pocket critical thinking guide."

Dietrich ended with a stark message to students about their future.

"You've probably heard this a lot — 'We're looking to you; the burden is on you, the next generation; you've got to step up and lead,'" Dietrich said. 

It's true, she said softly into the microphone before the crowd of students. 

"We need you to step up and tackle big problems, whether it's the opioid crisis or ... the UFO phenomenon," Dietrich said.

In the world of military and extraterrestrial encounters, few stories capture the imagination quite like the one involving Soviet soldiers reportedly turned to stone by aliens. This narrative, originating from a 1990s CIA report, has resurfaced, rekindling interest in UFO phenomena and the mysteries that surround them. The details of this incident, which unfold like a science fiction tale, have sparked discussions about the implications of such encounters. As we delve deeper into this astonishing report, we explore the intersection of military actions and possible alien retaliation, questioning how much we truly understand about the universe around us.

According to the CIA report, the tale is as chilling as it is intriguing. An agent described the event as “a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.” The incident allegedly took place during a training exercise in Ukraine, where Soviet soldiers encountered a low-flying spaceship shaped like a saucer. During the exercise, a surface-to-air missile was launched, successfully striking the UFO. What followed was an alleged act of retaliation that defies logic and science: the extraterrestrial beings reportedly turned the soldiers to stone.

This account, detailed in the now-declassified CIA document, suggests that the soldiers' transformation was both instantaneous and irreversible. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen the aftermath of this event, including stark images that depict the eerie scene. The report, while lacking corroborative scientific evidence, provides a captivating narrative that challenges conventional understanding and raises questions about the potential consequences of military engagements with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

The CIA report that brought this story to light was compiled after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. This geopolitical shift allowed Western intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, to access previously classified documents, including a 250-page report from the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB). The KGB report contained detailed accounts of the event, complete with eyewitness testimonies and purported photographic evidence.

Originally declassified in 2000, the report was first brought to public attention by publications like the Canadian Weekly World News and Ukraine's Holos Ukrayiny. Despite its sensational nature, the story remained largely within the confines of UFO enthusiast circles until recent years. The establishment of the UAP Task Force by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2020 reignited interest in such reports, as the task force aimed to systematically study and catalog unexplained aerial phenomena. This renewed focus on UAPs, coupled with the release of new government files, has once again thrust the stone-turning incident into the spotlight.

The report is bolstered by eyewitness accounts from those who allegedly witnessed the Soviet soldiers' transformation. These individuals describe an event that defies rational explanation, one where the soldiers, moments after the UFO was shot down, were inexplicably turned to stone. The document claims to include images depicting the aftermath, showing soldiers frozen in lifelike poses, as if caught in a moment of time.

While the authenticity of these accounts and images remains a matter of debate, their inclusion in the report adds a layer of eerie realism to the narrative. The potential existence of photographic evidence provides a tangible, albeit unsettling, connection to the event. Yet, the lack of scientific analysis or verification leaves room for skepticism. Regardless, these accounts contribute to the story's enduring allure, providing a vivid illustration of the alleged consequences of human-alien encounters.

The resurfacing of this report has had significant repercussions in the field of UFO research and beyond. It has sparked renewed interest in the study of UAPs and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life. As governments worldwide release more information on UFO sightings, stories like that of the Soviet soldiers challenge us to reconsider our place in the universe and our understanding of its mysteries.

The incident also highlights the potential dangers of engaging with unidentified aerial phenomena. If true, the transformation of soldiers into stone serves as a stark warning of the consequences that could arise from such encounters. This narrative, while steeped in mystery, serves as a catalyst for discussions on the need for caution and further investigation into the unknown. As science advances and our ability to explore the cosmos grows, the questions raised by such accounts continue to provoke curiosity and debate.

As we ponder this tale of Soviet soldiers and alien retaliation, we are left with more questions than answers. The enigmatic nature of the event challenges our understanding of reality and the potential interactions between humanity and extraterrestrial life. Could this be a mere story, or does it hint at a deeper truth about our universe? As we continue to explore the cosmos, what other secrets lie in wait?

In February 2023, during routine operations off the coast of Southern California, the crew of the US Navy's Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Jackson recorded a sequence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) exhibiting anomalous behavior.

The incident involved four aerial objects that appeared to rise from the ocean without any visible means of propulsion. This event is similar to the well-known 2004 “Tic Tac” encounter.

Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins, a 23-year veteran of the US Navy and a radar expert, has come forward to share his firsthand account.

Wiggins, whose responsibilities aboard the USS Jackson included tactical airspace monitoring and identification, detected irregular radar returns while stationed in the ship's Combat Information Center (CIC).

To visually confirm the irregularities, he moved the topside of the ship.

He observed what appeared to be a luminous object surfacing from the sea and ascending, behavior inconsistent with any known aerial platform.

Upon returning to the CIC, Wiggins utilized the ship's SAFIRE system, a thermal imaging sensor designed for maritime surveillance, to acquire and track the target.

What initially appeared to be a single contact rapidly became a four-object formation, each resembling the cylindrical, tic-tac-like profile previously reported in US Navy engagements.

Wiggins reportedly said the objects displayed no exhaust signature or thermal trail, a critical indicator of conventional propulsion systems.

Moments later, all four objects accelerated simultaneously toward the northeast at a velocity and synchronization that he described as “two steps behind instantaneous.”

Wiggins clarified that the USS Jackson did not file a formal incident report.

The reason for not filing an incident report is that the objects stayed at a safe distance and showed no clear signs of aggression.

According to current Navy rules, these conditions do not require automatic threat reporting.

His account nonetheless contributes to a growing body of military-observed UAP incidents in the Southern California Operating Area (SCOA), which has been the locus of anomalous aerial activity in recent years.

This is not Wiggins's first encounter in high-interest maritime airspace.

He previously served aboard the USS Omaha, one of ten Navy warships that reported being swarmed by unidentified aerial contacts in 2019.

That series of incidents produced radar and thermal imaging evidence of multiple large, spherical objects maneuvering around the vessel for over an hour, one of which was observed submerging into the sea.

While Wiggins said he is not a whistleblower, he believes the continued public minimization of UAP incidents undermines operational transparency.

“I'm not trying to make waves,” he said. “I served with pride. But this happened, and it's operationally significant.”

The Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), created to centralize UAP investigations, remains the designated authority for analysis.

However, active-duty personnel and veterans have expressed skepticism regarding the office's credibility and effectiveness.

The absence of actionable feedback or follow-up investigations deteriorates trust among frontline warfighters who have experienced these encounters firsthand.

Analyst Marik von Rennenkampff, a former Defense and State Department official, reviewed flight records for the timeframe and confirmed no conventional aircraft were near the USS Jackson during the incident.

Rennenkampff concluded that the sightings cannot be explained by commercial, civilian, or military aviation activity.

Wiggins said, “Maybe one day, this will be like the stealth fighter or Area 51, classified for decades and then just accepted. But by then, I'll be 80 or 90, and it'll be too late to matter.”

A reanalysis of ancient DNA shows that a major cultural change took place in Ireland after four centuries of farming.

Archaeologists have long assumed that Stone Age tombs in Ireland were built for royalty. But a new analysis of DNA from 55 skeletons found in these 5,000-year-old graves suggests that the tombs were made for the community, not for a ruling dynasty.

In Ireland's Neolithic period, which lasted from about 3900 to 2500 B.C., people built "megalithic monuments" — large stone structures that contained human bones and cremated remains. While the monuments clearly marked burials, archaeologists have argued about who was interred in them and whether the tombs served other purposes, such as being focal points for rituals, ceremonies or performances.

Early DNA work found that the people who built these monuments were early farmers who herded cattle and grew grain. It also concluded that these tombs were built for ancient elite dynasties with incestuous marriages. But a study published April 2 in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal suggests archaeologists may have been wrong about the identity of the people buried in the tombs — and their relationships.

Instead of being royal tombs, the megalithic monuments may have been spots where people came together in different seasons to work, feast and bury their dead, study lead author Neil Carlin, an archaeologist at University College Dublin, told Live Science in an email. And this society built the tombs following a major shift away from four centuries of simpler burial practices, the study suggests.

Archaeologists have identified four different kinds of ancient graves in Ireland, including three simple types used in the earlier part of the Neolithic and a fourth type called the "developed passage tomb" that originated around 3300 B.C. Passage tombs consisted of a large circular mound entered through a stone corridor. They are older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids, and many still dot the landscape of Ireland, including the well-known Newgrange passage tomb.

Carlin and his team noted that most individuals buried in the passage tombs did not have close genetic ties. Given this, the researchers wrote in the study, "we cannot say that these tombs were the final resting places of a dynastic lineage who restricted access to 'burial' within these tombs to their relatives."

Because megalithic monuments were obviously important to Neolithic people but were not necessarily linked to biological relationships, the researchers wanted to "develop a deeper understanding of changes in kinship during the Neolithic," Carlin said. By looking closely at the DNA evidence and at the subtle differences in burials throughout the Neolithic period, the researchers discovered a major shift after the first four centuries of farming in Ireland.

In the early Neolithic, the small, simpler tombs are paralleled in the genetic work, which has shown that there were smaller communities with closer biological ties. But in the later Neolithic period, when people built larger passage tombs, most of the people buried there were relatively diverse and more distantly related, the DNA analysis showed.

"We argue that this reflects how the kin groups using these tombs were interacting on a larger scale and more frequently choosing to have children with others from within these extended communities," Carlin said.

What caused this shift isn't clear. But the researchers suggest that the clusters of passage tombs in Neolithic Ireland show that disparate groups of people came together, perhaps seasonally, to participate in ceremonial activities together.

Instead of seeing the Neolithic period as one ruled by powerful dynasties, the researchers view it as "a more equal society," Carlin said. But more work is needed — including new studies of DNA, artifacts and monumental architecture — to fully understand the social changes that happened in Ireland after 3600 B.C., the researchers wrote in their study.

Six well-known experts in paranormal activity research will be the featured speakers at the 18th annual Butler Paranormal Conference on April 26.

"We cover all aspects of the paranormal, including UFO and UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena), aliens, Bigfoot, Dogman, cryptids in general and ghosts," said Daniel Hageman, founder and director of the Butler Organization for Research of the Unexplained (BORU), which organizes the annual event.

"This is the 18th year for the conference, and it's growing exponentially," he said. "People are more interested than ever in these paranormal sightings. There are more shows about it on television than ever."

The annual Butler Paranormal Conference brings in people from across the nation who are interested in the unexplained or who want to talk about an experience or sighting that they cannot explain, Hageman said.

Likewise, he said, BORU's core mission is to investigate and present truthful information to the public about UFO/UAP sightings, cryptid sightings and other unexplained phenomena occurring in western Pennsylvania and the tri-state area.

"Most of the time, we can explain (a sighting) as a manmade or natural phenomena, but there's a percentage that can't be explained," he said.

"Keep an open mind, come hear the guest speakers and hear what they've experienced. There are too many credible people from all walks of life who have had personal experience in a sighting for it to be anything but real."

The day's five presentations (each an hour long) begin at 11 a.m. with paranormal researcher Stan Gordon, who is well known for his investigation of the 1965 UFO incident near Kecksburg and thousands of unexplained paranormal incidents across Pennsylvania. Gordon's presentation, titled "Strange Aspects of Elusive Bigfoot," will offer new information on Bigfoot and the UFO connection.

At 12:30 p.m., folklore researcher and paranormal investigator Kevin Paul will speak on his experiences with the unexplained in his talk, "Close Encounters of the Celtic Kind."

At 2 p.m., James Krug, an Altoona area science teacher, astronomer and Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) field investigator, will share insights from his experience.

At 3 p.m., paranormal author and Bigfoot researcher Maxim Furek will speak about his latest book, "The Lost Tribes of Bigfoot" and his research into Bigfoot sightings in Pennsylvania, which he said has the third-highest number of sightings in the nation.

"I'm excited to be back in western Pennsylvania and sharing my research with folks at the conference," Furek said. "I'm looking forward to meeting the folks at the conference, to answer their questions about Bigfoot and give my answers on what (a sighting) could be."

The day's final presenters at 5 p.m. are Jean Vincent and Suzanne Vincent, known as the Psychic Vincent Sisters. They will discuss how their work has helped law enforcement solve crime investigations and share their experiences with the paranormal in researching missing persons cases and unsolved crimes. They will also conduct a live psychic gallery reading during their presentation.

In between presentations, the event includes opportunities for book signings by the presenters, raffles, door prizes and more than 50 vendors onsite selling CDs, books, T-shirts and other merchandise to those who attend. Food will also be available for purchase during the conference.

The conference will be from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. April 26 at the Tanglewood Senior Center, 10 Austin Ave. in Lyndora, Butler County. Tickets are $20.

The admission cost to attend the conference will be used to fund next year's conference, Hageman said.

"We're not in it for profit," he said. "We believe the public has the right to know the truth."

Anyone who wants to share an experience they've had with the unexplained can contact Hageman and BORU at the organization's Facebook page, in an email to vop4647@yahoo.com or call 724-282-1710.

"If you see something you don't understand or can't explain, report it," he said. "We take what we do very seriously. The truth is out there – we are not alone."

Stock Analysis

 When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early.  A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining.  This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well.  On that note, looking into UFO Moviez India (NSE:UFO), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going.  

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

 Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  The formula for this calculation on UFO Moviez India is: 

 Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 

0.062 = ₹248m ÷ (₹5.4b - ₹1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).

 Thus, UFO Moviez India has an ROCE of 6.2%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 6.2%, it's still a low return by itself.

 In terms of UFO Moviez India's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence.  Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 18% that they were earning  five years ago.  Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period.  Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last  five years.   So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on UFO Moviez India becoming one if things continue as they have.  

 All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine.      And, the stock has remained flat over the last  five years, so investors don't seem too impressed either.   With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.
