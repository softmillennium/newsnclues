                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The results of a large survey from a diverse patient population revealed cautious support for artificial intelligence (AI) implementation in screening mammography, according to a study published today in Radiology: Imaging Cancer, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Personal medical history and sociodemographic factors influenced respondent's level of trust in AI. Patient perspectives are crucial because successful AI implementation in medical imaging depends on trust and acceptance from those we aim to serve. If patients are hesitant or skeptical about AI's role in their care, this could impact screening adherence and, consequently, overall health care outcomes." To gain a better understanding of patient opinions and concerns regarding the use of AI in screening mammography, Dr. Dogan and colleagues developed a 29-question survey to be offered to all patients who attended their institution for a breast cancer screening mammogram. The optional survey was available for a period of seven months in 2023. The survey obtained demographic information in addition to clinical information, which uncovered a respondent's history with breast cancer, such as whether they had any abnormal mammograms in the past or if they or a close family member has ever had breast cancer. Of the 518 patients who completed the survey, most indicated support for the use of AI alongside a radiologist's review, with 71% of respondents preferring AI to be used as a second reader. This was despite concerns about loss of personal interaction with the radiologist, data privacy, lack of transparency and bias. Less than 5% were comfortable with AI alone interpreting their screening mammogram. Because of its large and diverse patient population, the survey uncovered a variety of demographic factors that influence patient perceptions. Respondents with more than a college degree or a higher self-reported knowledge of AI were two times more likely to accept AI involvement in their screening mammogram. Of note, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black respondents reported significantly higher concerns about AI bias and data privacy, which most likely resulted in a lower acceptance of AI among these patient groups. "These results suggest that demographic factors play a complex role in shaping patient trust and perceptions of AI in breast imaging," Dr. Dogan added. Familial and personal medical history also impacted patient attitudes toward AI. Regardless of whether an abnormality was detected by AI or a radiologist, patients who had a close relative diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to request additional reviews. However, these patients exhibited a high degree of trust in both AI and radiologist reviews when the mammogram came back as normal. In contrast, patients with a history of an abnormal mammogram were more likely to pursue diagnostic follow-up if AI and radiologist reviews conflicted. "This highlights how personal medical history influences trust in AI and radiologists differently, emphasizing the need for personalized AI integration strategies in mammographic screening," Dr. Dogan said. The researchers noted that it is important to continue engaging with patients to understand their evolving views of AI technology in health care, as the technology continues to advance. "Our study shows that trust in AI is highly individualized, influenced by factors such as prior medical experiences, education and racial background," Dr. Dogan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oxidative stress could be a key process in acyclovir (ACV)-induced nephrotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a water-soluble antioxidant with anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of NAC on ACV-induced nephrotoxicity in adult Wistar rats. Forty adult male Wistar rats (200–220 g) were used. The rats were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 5/group) and were treated intraperitoneally daily for seven days as follows: Group 1 (Control) was administered water (0.2mL), while groups 2–4 were administered NAC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg). Group 5 was administered ACV (150 mg/kg), while groups 6–8 were supplemented with NAC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) prior to treatment with ACV (150 mg/kg). On day 8, the rats were weighed and euthanized, and blood samples were collected for the assessment of biochemical markers. ACV had no significant (p > 0.05) effects on the body and kidney weights of rats compared to the control. ACV produced significant (p < 0.001) elevations in kidney malondialdehyde, serum urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels in rats, which differed from the control. There were significant (p < 0.001) decreases in kidney glutathione, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase, as well as serum chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, and sodium levels in ACV-treated rats compared to the control. Nonetheless, NAC supplementation abrogated ACV-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Kidney histology was restored by NAC supplementation. This finding shows that NAC may have therapeutic potential for nephrotoxicity caused by ACV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PBS News Weekend's Ali Rogin spoke with KFF Health News contributor Michelle Andrews about what some people with missing limbs consider a disparity in health insurance coverage: Though a knee replacement likely would be covered, a prosthetic knee isn't always. A prosthetic device can be subject to cost caps and an amputee may be required to prove medical necessity for coverage. Andrews recently explored these issues in her article "Health Insurers Limit Coverage of Prosthetic Limbs, Questioning Their Medical Necessity."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bottom line: A subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discontinued immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) continued to experience long-term disease control. Journal in which the study was published: Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Authors: Senior author Mark Awad, MD, PhD, chief of the Thoracic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and first author Federica Pecci, MD, a research fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for NSCLC, offering significant survival benefits in both early-stage and advanced disease. However, by stimulating the immune system, ICIs can cause irAEs, such as pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatitis, which can also lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. But this activation can also cause inflammation in other organs," Awad said. Many of these patients face concerns about whether their cancer will progress or recur if they stop treatment. Results: In a multi-institutional cohort of 2,794 patients who were treated with ICIs alone or in combination with other therapies, approximately 10% discontinued treatment due to irAEs; among these patients, the median post-discontinuation progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.7 months, and the median post-discontinuation overall survival (OS) was 43.7 months. "These outcomes suggest that patients can experience prolonged disease control and survival after stopping treatment due to toxicity or if side effects are impacting their quality of life," Pecci said. In a multivariable analysis, predictors of longer post-discontinuation PFS included high PD-L1 expression, a complete or partial response (CR/PR) to treatment, and a treatment duration of either three to six months or more than six months before discontinuation. The use of steroids or other immunosuppressants to treat irAEs was not associated with a difference in PFS or OS after discontinuation in the study, suggesting that such treatments may not jeopardize the anticancer response. Author's comments: "We identified clinical and pathological features that can help physicians to better understand which patients can benefit longer without any additional treatment after discontinuing for toxicity," Pecci said. "Our study can serve as a valuable resource to support clinicians in the complex considerations of treatment discontinuation for irAEs." While discontinuation is clearly warranted in cases of severe irAEs, the management of grade 2 irAEs often presents a more nuanced challenge for clinicians. These findings may help physicians provide patients with a clearer, more individualized assessment of their risk of disease progression, Pecci said, taking into account factors such as treatment duration before discontinuation, response to therapy, and other clinicopathologic characteristics. Study limitations: Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, which could be hindered by missing or inaccurate data annotations. Additionally, comparisons based on treatment duration before discontinuation may be confounded by an overrepresentation of long-term responders in the longer-duration groups. To mitigate this, landmark analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to help reduce potential biases and enhance the reliability of the findings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers at Yale University suggests that early-life exposure to two widespread environmental pollutants- small particle air pollution and outdoor artificial light at night-could increase the risk of pediatric thyroid cancer. The study-a collaborative effort involving multiple Yale departments and institutions across the U.S.-found a "significant association" between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and outdoor artificial light at night (O-ALAN) and increased risk of papillary thyroid cancer in children and young adults up to 19 years old. Fine particulate matter is found in urban air pollution due to automobile traffic and industrial activity, and artificial light at night is common, particularly in densely populated urban areas." Dr. Nicole Deziel, PhD, MHS, environmental epidemiologist with the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) and study's lead author The research team analyzed data from 736 individuals diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer before age 20 and 36,800 matched control participants based on birth year. Using advanced geospatial and satellite modeling, the team assessed individual-level exposure to PM2.5 and O-ALAN based on residential location at birth. All of the study participants were from California. The findings showed that for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 exposure, the odds of developing thyroid cancer rose by 7% overall. The strongest association between exposure and thyroid cancer was found among teenagers (15–19 years of age) and Hispanic children. "Thyroid cancer is among the fastest growing cancers among children and adolescents, yet we know very little about what causes it in this population," said Deziel, an associate professor of epidemiology (environmental health sciences) and co-director of the Yale Center for Perinatal, Pediatric, and Environmental Epidemiology. "Our study is the first large-scale investigation to suggest that these exposures early in life-specifically to PM2.5 and outdoor light at night-may play a role in this concerning trend." In addition to Deziel, the research team included experts from Yale's Departments of Biostatistics, Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and Pediatrics, as well as researchers from the University of Southern California, UC Berkeley, and the American Cancer Society. The impact of papillary thyroid cancer on children can be extensive. Pediatric survivors of thyroid cancer can suffer aftereffects ranging from temperature dysregulation and headaches to physical disabilities and mental fatigue. Both PM2.5 and O-ALAN are considered environmental carcinogens that have been shown to disrupt the body's endocrine system, including thyroid function, in animals and adults. The particles associated with PM2.5 pose a threat because they are small enough to enter the bloodstream and can interfere with hormone signaling, including those involved in regulating cancer pathways. Outdoor artificial light at night has been shown to suppress melatonin and alter circadian rhythms, which can also influence hormone-regulated cancer pathways. The current research raises important environmental justice concerns. Communities of color and lower-income populations are often disproportionately exposed to both air pollution and light pollution-inequities that may contribute to the higher thyroid cancer burden observed in Hispanic children. The researchers emphasized that more work is needed to replicate and expand on their findings, ideally using improved exposure metrics and longitudinal designs. "In the meantime," Deziel noted, "our results point to the critical importance of addressing environmental factors in childhood cancer research. The study appears online in Environmental Health Perspectives. Perinatal Exposures to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter and Outdoor Artificial Light at Night and Risk of Pediatric Papillary Thyroid Cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, a team led by researchers from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH) say public ignorance and apathy towards bird flu (highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI) could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a larger-scale public health crisis. The authors, including CUNY SPH Assistant Professor Rachael Piltch-Loeb, Associate Professor Katarzyna Wyka, Professor Jeffrey V. Lazarus, Senior Scholar Kenneth Rabin, Distinguished Lecturer Scott C. Ratzan, and Dean Ayman El-Mohandes, conducted a population representative survey of U.S. residents from August 5 to 15, 2024, which used an in-depth sampling framework and intentional oversampling of rural populations. The results suggest many respondents were unaware of simple food safety practices that could reduce the risk of HPAI infection. Over half (53.7%) did not know that pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, although almost three of four respondents (71.3%) did understand that cooking meat at high temperatures could eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses like H5N1. Participants who described themselves as Republicans or Independents were significantly less likely than Democrats to support either vaccination or dietary modifications. Rural Americans, many of whom are more likely to work or live in or near livestock industries, were less likely to accept public health measures, including vaccination and dietary changes, compared to their urban counterparts. "These attitudes could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a major public health crisis," says Piltch-Loeb, the study's lead author. Rabin, who has been engaged in health communications campaigns for more than four decades, adds that, "Working closely with agricultural leaders, farm communities and food processing companies will be critical, and the fact that most of the agricultural workers who are at direct risk of exposure to the bird flu virus may be undocumented could seriously jeopardize efforts to track and control the spread of infections."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She previously spent more than a decade reporting on the federal government, most recently covering surprise medical bills, drug pricing reform, and other health policy debates in Washington and on the campaign trail. The secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contradicted his agency's researchers this week with unsubstantiated or outright false claims about autism spectrum disorder and those with the condition. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices as his administration signaled that tariffs on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients could be on deck. And new data shows that the number of abortions performed nationwide increased slightly last year, as travel and telehealth prescribing maintained access for some patients in states with abortion bans. Also this week, Julie Rovner of KFF Health News interviews Krista Harrison and Robbie Zimbroff, health policy researchers at the University of California-San Francisco. Plus, for "extra credit," the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too: Emmarie Huetteman: KFF Health News' "States Push Medicaid Work Rules, but Few Programs Help Enrollees Find Jobs," by Sam Whitehead, Phil Galewitz, and Katheryn Houghton. Anna Edney: ProPublica's "Unsanitary Practices Persist at Baby Formula Factory Whose Shutdown Led to Mass Shortages, Workers Say," by Heather Vogell. Jessie Hellmann: The Hill's "Military's Use of Toxic 'Forever Chemicals' Leaves Lasting Scars," by Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin.
