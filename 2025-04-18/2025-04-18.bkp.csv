            The Trump administration's patience with peacemaking for Ukraine, always painfully thin, now appears to be running out altogether.
    


            “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after meeting European and Ukrainian officials for talks in Paris.
    


            For President Donald Trump, who swept into office convinced he possessed the skills to quickly end the gravest conflict in Europe since the World War II, there is immense frustration with the lack of progress.
    


            “The President has spent 87 days at the highest level of this government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end,” Rubio added, as the bloodshed in the war zone continues unabated.
    


            So what would to “move on” look like?
    


            One option might be redouble US military support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's efforts to court the Kremlin, or perhaps because of them, Russian intransigence has emerged as the main obstacle to peace, such as Moscow's foot-dragging over Trump's proposed 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine alone has agreed.
    


            Admittedly, fresh deliveries of billions of dollars more of American arms to Ukraine may be an unpopular policy U-turn among some Trump supporters, but a newly invigorated Ukrainian push-back on the battlefield could encourage the Kremlin to reassess its negotiating position.
    


            New, properly tough US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and those who buy it, have also been touted as a potential means of applying maximum pressure on Moscow.
    


            Problem is, forging a peace in Ukraine is just one of the agenda items in what Trump and the Kremlin see as a much broader, lucrative reconfiguration of US-Russian relations – involving energy deals, space exploration and mining contracts – which Trump may be reluctant to jeopardize.
    


            Back in Paris, Rubio hinted at a possible second, more likely, option.
    


            “It's not our war. We didn't start it. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it's not our war,” Rubio stressed, alluding to the possibility that the US could simply walk away, leaving Ukraine and its European backers to face Russia alone.
    


            That would pose a huge challenge, given Ukraine's depleted resources and Europe's dire unreadiness, currently, to bolster the front lines with sufficient military supplies of its own.
    


            For the Kremlin, American disengagement is a double-edged sword. It may give its battered forces a freer hand in Ukraine, but it doesn't necessarily deliver the win that Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, insists that he wants, instead dragging out the pain.
    


            Russian troops, who are being killed and injured at an alarming rate, would continue to be fed into the brutal “meat grinder” of the Ukrainian front lines, increasing simmering social pressure on the Kremlin at home.
    


            Pressure on the Russian economy, already weakened by war, would also increase. If there is no peace deal, there is unlikely to be any easing of the punitive international sanctions already straining fragile Russian finances.
    


            Putin, bent on total victory, may regret passing up the extraordinary chance offered by Trump to end his disastrous Ukraine war and cut his country's substantial losses.
    


            The Trump administration insists it has not yet entirely given up – just hours after Rubio's comment, Vice President JD Vance said the White House was “optimistic” it could still end the war – but is signalling that that point may be drawing close.
    


            “We need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” Rubio said of peace in Ukraine before heading back to Washington.
    


            The Kremlin is also engaging in the brinkmanship, its spokesman insisting “there are no contacts planned for this week, but, on the other hand, let's say that the established contacts allow us to very, very quickly agree on such a conversation if necessary.”
    


            There is, it seems, still a narrow scope for a face-saving, last minute breakthrough. But time and patience in Washington to end the war in Ukraine seems to be rapidly running out.

            Maintaining a good relationship between the United States and Europe has long been seen as a no-brainer by leaders on both side of the Atlantic. After all, it's this friendship that has led to decades of peace, stability and prosperity.
    


            And then came US President Donald Trump.
    


            In his second term, Trump and his closest aides have repeatedly expressed a deep disdain for Europe, centered mainly around their belief that the continent is taking advantage of the US when it comes to security and trade.
    


            They say the US has for decades been subsidizing Europe's inadequate defense spending, while getting slapped with tariffs and trade barriers in return.
    


            But their dislike seems to be at least partly rooted in ideology.
    


            Majda Ruge, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that Trump's foreign policy is an extension of the culture wars that he and his administration are leading against liberalism at home.
    


            “And Europe is considered to be one of the bastions of that liberalism,” she said.
    


            She said Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement has been largely inspired by people's disappointment with globalization.
    


            “It is based on grievances and backlash against globalization, elites, against international organization, supranationalism and everything that the European Union represents,” Ruge told CNN. “And then you have the backlash against progressive liberal policies on gender, on education, on immigration. Again, Europe finds itself there on the wrong side of the culture war,” she added.
    


            Few in the Trump administration have shown as much contempt for Europe as Vice President JD Vance.
    


            Just weeks into his tenure, Vance stunned European leaders by using his speech at the Munich Security Conference to berate them over free speech and migration. He went as far as suggesting that the biggest threat to European security wasn't Russia or China, but “the threat from within,” which he characterized as “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.”

            He followed that up a wide-ranging interview with British website UnHerd on April 15 where he shared his and the president's frustration with European leaders.
    


            “The reality is – it's blunt to say it, but it's also true – that Europe's entire security infrastructure, for my entire life, has been subsidized by the United States of America,” he said.
    


            “It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States.”
    


            But the extent of his dislike for the continent was laid bare when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to a group chat of Trump's top officials on the nongovernment messaging app Signal.
    


            Vance suggested calling off a US attack on the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who had been disrupting key international shipping routes for months, because it would help European economies more than it would America's.
    


            “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in the chat.
    


            That remark was in line with Trump's long-held belief that European countries have been able to underspend on defense because they knew the US would step in and bail them out.
    


            He has threatened to take the US out of NATO and questioned Article 5 of the treaty, the principle of collective defense – a key pillar of the alliance that has only been invoked once in its history, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.
    


            Trump made defense spending a major issue when he first became US commander in chief and 22 out of NATO's then 27 members were spending less than the agreed upon 2% of their GDP on defense.
    


            Things have changed since then – partly because of Trump's pressure, but mostly because of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which was a major wake-up call for Europe.
    


            In 2024, only eight out of the expanded alliance's 32 members didn't meet the target.
    


            And while it is true that the US has invested a lot of money and manpower into Europe's security, experts say the picture is a lot more nuanced than how Vance and other top Trump lieutenants present it.

            “Americans didn't do this out of the goodness of their hearts,” Ruge said. “Regardless of the administration, the US has rarely done something on the foreign policy front, which hasn't been to the benefit of or in line with (the) national interests of the United States.”
    


            Sudha David-Wilp, vice president of external relations and senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, agreed with that assessment – and warned that pulling away from the time-tested alliance could end up costing the US.
    


            “Yes, the United States is the one that invests more blood and treasure, but the United States has also benefited from this network that has been created in the last 70 years,” she told CNN.
    


            The US was able to rely on the support of its European allies on a number of occasions, even when it didn't necessarily benefit their own political standing – such as when they refused to condemn the decision by the US to kill Iran's General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, or when they supported the US invasion of Afghanistan and contributed troops to the multinational force there as required by NATO's Article 5, even though majorities of their citizens opposed it.
    


            “Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Does it need reform? Yes. But by tearing it all down, it could make (the world) more dangerous and riskier for the United States,” David-Wilp said.
    


            Trump and those close to him have long pushed for the US to pull back from its traditional role as the world's policeman, warning against America's involvement in foreign conflicts.
    


            The paradox of this, Ruge said, is that Vance and other “restrainers” are aligned with many European countries who have in the past criticized US interventions abroad.
    


            Vance said as much in the interview with UnHerd, when he suggested that if Europe was a “little more willing to stand up” to the US, it “could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq.”
    


            Both Germany and France opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion, a stance which greatly angered the Bush administration. The then-Secretary of State Colin Powell threatened France with “consequences” over its decision to stand up to Washington. An anti-French sentiment took hold across the US — with actions like “French fries” being renamed “freedom fries” in establishments around the country.
    


            “If you think about the Signal chat, where they're going into the action of bombing of Houthis in Yemen and saying ‘we're going to give the bill to Europeans,' well, there's an amount of hypocrisy, because American action – especially in the Middle East and North Africa – has produced huge amounts of liabilities for Europe,” Ruge said.
    


            The US has a vast network of military bases across Europe, with some 80,000 service members deployed there, down from a 20-year peak of 105,000 at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The current number is roughly one fifth of what it used to be during the Cold War.
    


            The strategy of stationing American troops closer to conflict zones dates back to World War II and has proven to be beneficial time and time again.
    


            While different administrations have tinkered with the number of troops and locations of bases, the US has always maintained a significant military presence around the world.
    


            “One can certainly make credible arguments that it's important to move assets to regions like the Indo-Pacific, but it still makes sense to have a presence in Europe, because having a presence in Europe also helps the United States when it comes to out-of-area conflict,” David-Wilp said.

            According to research by the Atlantic Council, it would cost the US taxpayer nearly $70 million more per year to rotate military forces in and out of Europe rather than have them based in Germany and Poland.
    


            The huge investments the US has been making into defense in Europe and elsewhere have also directly benefited the American economy.
    


            Because while Trump and others often make it sound like the US is pouring cash into Europe, and Ukraine in particular, what the US is mostly doing is pouring money into American defense contractors.
    


            “In terms of what the alliance has given to the US, besides all the other benefits, just in terms of the economy – the benefit (the) American economy has drawn from this in terms of weapon sales and weapon production is huge,” Ruge said.
    


            Of the more than $175 billion in aid that the US Congress has appropriated to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than $120 billion has been spent directly with US companies or on US Forces, according to conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute.
    


            And according to the Kiel Institute, which monitors aid to Ukraine, European countries have provided even more aid to Ukraine than the US – first by using their own existing arsenals and then by procuring weaponry from Western defense industries. With four out of the top five global defense contractors being American companies, US industry is getting a sizable chunk of this new business.
    


            Trump has made his personal contempt for the European Union clear on multiple occasions in recent months. He even complained to Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, incorrectly, that the bloc was making it difficult for him to expand his golf resort in Ireland.
    


            Last month, Trump claimed the EU was “formed to screw the United States” when announcing his “Liberation Day” tariffs.
    


            It was a strange suggestion given that the EU would likely not exist if it wasn't for the post-war push by the US to help form it. President Harry Truman was a great advocate of European unity and his and subsequent US administrations have supported European integration, seeing a united Europe as a more prosperous trade partner and stable ally.
    


            In Trump's worldview, the US is being “screwed” by the EU because it is running an overall trade deficit with the bloc. But, just like with defense spending, the issue is more complex than Trump might suggest.
    


            The US and the EU have the largest trading relationship in the world, having traded $1.4 trillion worth of goods and services in 2023, according to the latest available official data. And while the US ran a trade deficit with the EU in goods, it had a surplus in services.
    


            The two sides have been balancing on the edge of a trade war after Trump unveiled 25% tariffs on European steel, aluminum and car exports, and 20% “reciprocal” tariffs on all other goods. The EU said it would retaliate but then put a pause on the planned countermeasures after Trump announced he'd temporarily halt the tariffs.
    


            But while a full-blown trade conflict has been avoided for now, trust between the two sides of the Atlantic has been fractured – perhaps irreparably.

    Editor's Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.



            On a trip to the English countryside, Catherine, Princess of Wales, signaled that the Y2K style revival — which has resurrected both Ugg boots and wearing dresses over pants — is still in full swing.
    


            In a short film released by the palace on Monday, the princess is seen sporting a puffy dark green baker boy hat as she joined a group of Scouts for an outing in England's Lake District last month.
    


            The baker boy hat (also called a newsboy cap) was a staple of '90s and early '00s fashion. Jennifer Lopez matched hers with a pink tracksuit, Britney Spears' collection included variations in blue denim and pink leather, and Anne Hathaway wore a tweed version in “The Devil Wears Prada” following her fashionable on-screen makeover.
    


            This isn't Kate's first time rocking the iconic noughties look — in fact, it appears to be her go-to when visiting the Scouts. Back in 2013, the then-Duchess of Cambridge wore a similarly small-brimmed, puffy style to join the youth organization for a volunteer training day.
    


            Despite its name, the hats were not exclusively worn by bakers. The style's humble beginnings instead date back to 1571, when England's parliament passed a law requiring all working-class men to wear woolen hats on Sundays and holidays, or risk a fine, according to British hatmaker Hicks & Brown. The caps proved popular with dockworkers, shipwrights and bandits, and, over time, the baker boy hat became synonymous with the newsboy cap (which was actually worn by boys working at newsstands).
    


            Though Kate's choice of headgear has been called “divisive” by Vogue and a “Dickensian fashion moment” by Elle Australia, she's in good company: Kendall Jenner was spotted walking the streets of New York City in a baker boy hat earlier this year and Anne Hathaway opted for the throwback look in Paris in 2023.
    


            Never one to shy away from an outfit repeat, the Princess of Wales also appeared to sport the exact jacket she wore in the controversial edited family photo amid speculation about her health following abdominal surgery last year (she subsequently revealed her cancer diagnosis a few weeks later). In the latest video, she matched the green bomber with a cozy camel-knit sweater and a classic pair of skinny jeans.  matched the green bomber with a cozy camel-knit sweater and a classic pair of skinny jeans.
    


            The princess, who has served as joint president of the UK's Scouts association since 2020, wore the ensemble for her walk with a group of Scouts aged between 10 and 15 near the shores of Lake Windermere in northwest England.
    


            “I find it a very spiritual and very intense emotional reconnection,” she said, describing her relationship with nature in a short film about the excursion. “It is so therefore meaningful to me as a place to balance and find a sort of sense of peace and reconnection in what is otherwise a very busy world.”

            Turkey started hastily organized mass trials on Friday to prosecute some of the hundreds of people who took part in the widespread demonstrations over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the major rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Turkey detains more than 1,400 protesters and multiple journalists after jailing of leading opposition figure



            Some 189 people, including journalists, students and activists, were on trial across two overflowing court rooms in Istanbul's Caglayan justice palace, one of the city's main courts.
    


            Both courts ruled to split the list of defendants to more manageable numbers after hearing procedural motions by defense lawyers.
    


            Charges against the defendants stem from the protests that erupted after Imamoglu's arrest on March 19 on corruption allegations — a move critics see as an attempt to sideline a key rival to Erdogan ahead of elections expected to be held in 2028.
    


            At least 1,400 people were arrested during the demonstrations, posing one of the biggest challenges yet to the long rule of Erdogan, who is seeking to extend his presidency.
    


            Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the trials as politically motivated, citing a lack of evidence and calling the charges incompatible with democratic norms.
    


            A small group of parents and supporters gathered outside the court before the trials to demand justice for students who are among those being prosecuted, holding signs, releasing balloons and chanting “we want justice for our kids.”
    


            “We release these balloons to symbolize their right to freely express themselves, their right to education, and their right to lead free lives,” the group said in a statement.
    


            Eight journalists who were arrested while covering the protests in Istanbul also appeared in court on Friday.
    


            One defense lawyer called for the immediate dismissal of the case and told the court, “The journalists were carrying out their constitutionally protected jobs.”

            HRW reviewed the indictments against 650 demonstrators “accused of protest-related offenses,” noting that 120 were charged for assemblies held after an eight-day protest ban expired.
    


            Potential sentences range from six months to five years, yet in some cases the evidence appeared thin. In one case, a rock allegedly held by a protester was cited as a weapon.
    


            Protesters in the capital Ankara were met with police water cannons. In Istanbul, police doused people with pepper spray, and some officers kicked and hit demonstrators after several fireworks and other objects were thrown at riot police near the city's municipality building, according to Reuters.
    


            Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe director, criticized the trials as “a warning against exercising the rights to peaceful protest or free expression,” and urged prosecutors to drop charges without concrete evidence.
    


            Turkey's record on assembly rights has long drawn scrutiny, with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issuing over 70 rulings against Ankara since 2010 for disproportionate crackdowns, HRW said.
    


            The Council of Europe has called on Turkey to protect “the right to peaceful protest.”
    


            “The presumption of innocence, the use of pre-trial detention strictly as a measure of last resort and the protection of political expression” must all be guaranteed, the Council said.
    


            Despite this, Erdogan's government has tightened control, with Freedom House, a US-based nonprofit research organization, labeling Turkey “not free” amid censorship and surveillance laws.
    


            As the trials begin, observers have warned of deepening authoritarianism. With 90% of Turkish media under government influence and journalists routinely targeted, the cases underscore a broader erosion of rights under Erdogan, who has ruled since 2003 and could remain in power until 2029.
    


            Elections are not scheduled until 2028 but would need to come earlier if Erdogan, 71, who has run Turkey for 22 years, wants to run again. Imamoglu leads the president in some polls.

THE African National Congress (ANC) says it remains committed to fostering “inclusive and principled dialogue” as part of efforts to ensure effective governance and safeguard South Africa's democratic gains.

This follows a meeting between the ANC negotiating team, led by secretary-general Fikile Mbalula, and a delegation from the Freedom Front Plus (FF+), headed by Corné Mulder. According to the ANC, the engagement was constructive.

It was previously reported that the FF Plus and the Democratic Alliance (DA) were among the parties that voted against the passing of the national budget in Parliament.

Their opposition was largely due to concerns over the 0.5% Value-Added Tax (VAT) increase, which is expected to come into effect in May. The DA has also filed papers in the Western Cape High Court challenging the legality of the 2025/26 national budget process.

The ANC described the meeting with FF+ as “cordial” and “forward-looking”, with both parties recognising the urgent need to address South Africa's fiscal and governance challenges.

”There was broad alignment on the importance of the recently adopted Fiscal Framework, particularly as a foundation to stabilise public finances, maintain essential public services, and promote sustainable economic growth,” said ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri.

The discussions also underscored the need for strong parliamentary oversight, efficient public spending, and decisive action against financial mismanagement.

Over the weekend, the ANC also held high-level talks with the DA in Johannesburg. DA Federal chairperson Helen Zille confirmed that “a negotiating team appointed by the Federal Executive of the DA met a delegation from the African National Congress (ANC)”.

Bhengu-Motsiri noted that GNU partners must “be guided by mutual respect, common purpose, and disciplined cooperation in the national interest.”

She added that these engagements are part of the ANC's broader effort to deepen multiparty consensus and democratic accountability within the GNU.

The ANC reaffirmed its commitment to “inclusive leadership, stability, and the advancement of the country's developmental agenda” as it continues discussions with various political stakeholders.

The US has carried out strikes on the Ras Isa fuel port in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen. The operation is part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to prevent the rebel group from targeting tankers and other merchant vessels sailing through the Suez Canal and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.

“The Iran-backed Houthis use fuel to sustain their military operations, as a weapon of control, and to benefit economically from embezzling the profits from the import,” the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Thursday. It added that ships continued supplying fuel through the port after the militant group's terrorist designation took effect on April 5.

“Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts,” CENTCOM said. “The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis.”

The Houthi authorities said 38 civilians were killed, including five paramedics, and 102 more were injured. The majority of the victims were reportedly port workers.

“We affirm Yemen's legal right to defend itself, and this crime will not go unpunished,” the Houthi authorities stated, according to Al-Masirah TV.

Hours after the strikes, the Israel Defense Forces said they intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen on Friday morning.

The Houthis control the western part of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and the port of Hodeidah. Since 2023, the group has been firing kamikaze drones and missiles at commercial ships in support of the Palestinians in Gaza. The Houthis also launched ballistic missiles at Israel, saying they would stop the attacks once Israel ends its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.

Last month, Trump instructed the Pentagon to step up strikes in Yemen, warning that the Houthis would be “completely annihilated” unless they cease targeting shipping. The group, however, vowed not to bow to pressure. The Houthis have since claimed attacks on US warships patrolling the Red Sea area. On April 1, the militants reported shooting down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone.

UNITED NATIONS, April 18. /TASS/. A ceasefire in Ukraine is unrealistic at this point, as Kiev fails to honor the moratorium on striking energy infrastructure, said Russia's envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya.

""We had an attempt at a limited ceasefire concerning energy infrastructure, which was not observed by the Ukrainian side. Under these circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to talk about a ceasefire at this point,"" he told reporters.

On March 18, US President Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the sides of the conflict to refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed and immediately gave the Russian military the appropriate command. Vladimir Zelensky later said Ukraine would also support the proposal.

However, Ukraine attacked Russian energy sites from March 18 to April 16 in 15 regions. They are the Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Zaporozhye, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Krasnodar and Kherson regions, Crimea, and the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. The strikes were carried out with drones and various artillery capabilities, including the HIMARS.

A charity controversy and GOP unrest threaten Casey DeSantis's chances of succeeding her husband as governor in 2026

It had the hallmarks of a dynasty in the making. When Ron DeSantis was asked in February whom he would like to see succeed him as Florida governor when he is termed out of office in 2027, his answer was unequivocal: his wife, Casey.

“There's no question about it,” he told a press conference in Tampa.

“She's someone who has the intestinal fortitude and the dedication of conservative principles that, you know, anything that we've accomplished, that she'd be able to take to the next level.”

Now, storm clouds are swirling as Florida's glamorous first lady, a close political adviser to her husband as well as his loyal wife, ponders whether to throw her hat in the ring.

A political initiative she founded in 2021 to improve welfare provision has become mired in controversy over its charity wing's failure to file required tax documents. There have also been probing questions from Florida Republicans over a “probably illegal” $10m donation from a legal settlement to the state that was secretly directed to the charity – some of which ended up in the hands of her husband's political cronies.

It is a scandal that some observers believe has the potential to sink her possible candidacy for the November 2026 gubernatorial election before it even begins, or at least provoke some soul searching in the DeSantis camp about how and when to launch it.

“This is really her first test of negative publicity, and some negative attention in the media, and we'll see ultimately how that plays out,” said Michael Binder, professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Florida.

“I don't know that it's a death knell for her candidacy. Rick Scott was a Medicare embezzler and it didn't necessarily prevent him from not only winning a governor's race twice, but getting elected to the Senate. So these things can pass.

“But that being said, none of this is great for her. And press like this is not great.”

Binder's department conducted a February poll that showed Casey DeSantis with a 30% approval rate overall, rising to 57% among registered Republicans.

“She polled well a year-plus ago because she has some name recognition relative to the other candidates. I suspect eventually she'll get into the race. But I certainly see this being a tougher race than probably both parties might think,” he said.

It is an unfamiliar position for Casey DeSantis, 44, one half of what some see as the fairytale couple of Florida politics since their Disney World wedding in 2009. A former television news reporter with a compelling story, including surviving breast cancer, she has been her husband's chief cheerleader, confidante and campaigner.

She was at his side through his first election to Congress in 2012 and elevation to the governor's mansion in Tallahassee six years later on the back of a tweeted endorsement from Donald Trump.

As recently as February, her own star was shining brightly, even as Florida's Republican legislators began pushing back against Ron DeSantis's handling of state affairs and agenda after six years as governor.

Donors were reportedly lining up to support her potential candidacy. Sources told NBC News that DeSantis saw his wife as a way to keep the governorship out of the hands of some of those with whom he has been recently feuding, including the agriculture commissioner, Wilton Simpson, and another former ally, the representative Byron Donalds.

Then came the hammer blow of Trump's endorsement of Donalds, before an alleged “kiss the ring” breakfast visit in March by both Ron and Casey DeSantis to the president's West Palm Beach golf club. That was quickly followed by the burgeoning charity scandal enveloping the Hope Florida Foundation, a non-profit supporting Casey DeSantis's flagship initiative to reduce government funding for welfare programs and replace it with more community and corporate input.

The Tampa Bay Times discovered that the DeSantis administration secretly directed $10m to the charity from a $67m overbilling settlement last year between the state's agency for health care administration (AHCA) and the Medicare operator Centene. The direction was in apparent contradiction of Florida law requiring such money to be paid into a trust or act as general revenue for state legislators to spend.

It was subsequently revealed that two organizations that received money from Hope Florida gave $5m each to political committees that supported Ron DeSantis's ultimately successful efforts last November to defeat a ballot amendment calling for the legalization of recreational marijuana.

On Wednesday, the executive director of Hope Florida, Erik Dellenback, resigned, as the charity came under heightening scrutiny.

The scandal has angered some senior Florida Republicans, including the house speaker, Daniel Perez, and state representative Alex Andrade.

Perez said it appeared DeSantis transferred the $10m to Hope Florida “in the dead of the night” and has threatened subpoenas to get answers; Andrade, chair of the house healthcare budget subcommittee, last week spent two hours questioning the DeSantis-appointed AHCA secretary, Shevaun Harris.

“The reference to that $10m not being taxpayer dollars I find offensive,” he said, after Harris explained the money was a “donation” by Centene to Hope Florida on top of the settlement, and therefore exempt from state law.

Andrade said he believed the redirection of the money was a DeSantis “policy decision … that I believe was illegal”.

Harris, who was appointed in February, claimed she was “ambushed” at the meeting, and has denied that AHCA did anything wrong. Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said Hope Florida's actions were legitimate.

On Monday, Ron DeSantis lashed out at his fellow Republicans, adding more heat to a feud that has been simmering since legislators shut down his immigration proposals in January, then launched an inquiry into the DeSantis administration's spending habits.

“Shame on you in the Florida House and your terrible behavior in leadership,” DeSantis told a press conference in Kissimmee, reported by Florida Politics.

The outlet said the governor denounced “a lot of baseless attacks” and “manufactured smears against the first lady and the program that's Hope Florida”.

The next steps for Casey DeSantis are uncertain, but some observers believe the controversy has ended any hope she had of becoming only the second woman, after Wyoming's Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, to succeed her husband as a state governor.

“It's clear, even at this point, that the Hope Florida scandal is going to kill her campaign in the cradle,” Peter Schorsch, publisher of Florida Politics, wrote in a post on X.

“She's never gonna get back to the pristine starting point she needed to be at to run for governor.”

Frank Orlando, political science professor at St Leo University, said Casey DeSantis had essentially been caught up in the escalating dispute between her husband and state politicians, who are making hay from the Hope Florida situation.

“She's been a relatively popular first lady of Florida, and my feeling from talking with legislators in Tallahassee is that it's primarily a beef with Ron,” he said.

“It's just finding ways to pick fights, to undermine his authority. To the extent that Casey is involved, it's the fact that she would be in that wing of the party, and holding that banner. I don't think this is being done to undermine Casey as much as it is saying to Ron: ‘We've been under your thumb for six years, and we're not going to take it any more.'”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Neil Duhon blames archdiocese for allowing his rapist to prey on children throughout his career

The clergy abuse survivor who helped prosecutors secure the only conviction against a notorious child rapist and retired Roman Catholic priest in New Orleans is still hoping that authorities file criminal charges against his former high school principal and everyone else who enabled the clergyman.

“Everybody that had any part … needs to be held accountable. Period – period,” Neil Duhon, whose rapist was Lawrence Hecker, said in an interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, the first and only time he's ever revealed his identity to the public.

Referring to the Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans, the institution that employed and protected Hecker for decades and kept doing so even after the cleric admitted he had preyed sexually on minors throughout his career, Duhon added: “I hope they get some type of criminal charge.

“You know, they are responsible for all of this.”

And Duhon, who is now 65 but was about 16 when Hecker raped him in 1975, had particularly harsh words for a judge who handled part of his ordeal. New Orleans criminal court judge Benedict Willard delayed Hecker's trial date for more than a year before recusing himself on the day that jury selection for the case was to begin. Only by handing the matter over to another judge did Willard finally clear the way for Hecker to plead guilty in December – shortly before the priest died.

Duhon called Willard “a coward – a coward. That's it.”

The hours-long interview Duhon granted a pair of outlets whose reporting aided Hecker's successful prosecution provided the most detailed account yet of the stand he took against one of the Catholic church's most inveterate abusers. Hecker's prosecution also showed how the clergy molestation crisis roiling the US church for decades was not yet over.

As Duhon told it, he was a freshman student at New Orleans' St John Vianney high school – which catered to boys interested in joining the priesthood – when he met Hecker in 1973. The school, which has since closed, required students to essentially help local Catholic churches with their masses and other services. And Duhon was assigned to do that at a church adjacent to St John called St Theresa and colloquially known as Little Flower, where Hecker introduced himself to him.

Hecker left Little Flower – which has since closed, too – in about 1974. But during the summer of the following year, Duhon saw him again at one of the weekly pool parties that the Notre Dame seminary, an institution in New Orleans that educates and trains priests, would host for St John students.

According to Duhon, Hecker recognized him and asked if he was still working at Little Flower. Duhon said he was.

Days later, after finishing his mass-related duties at Little Flower, Duhon was exercising on a weight bench set up in a room attached to the church bell tower. Hecker appeared unannounced, offered to give him pointers that could help Duhon earn a spot on a wrestling team being started at St John, and eventually put him in a headlock.

Duhon tried to force himself free of Hecker but couldn't. He said he suddenly felt Hecker's penis inside of him. As he tensed up, Duhon said Hecker's arm came across his upper chest toward his neck. Duhon said he lost consciousness and woke up alone.

The shadows cast in the room were much longer than he remembered them, suggesting hours had passed. Duhon said he soon realized he had semen on his backside. His mind raced as he removed his gym shorts and underwear, changed into his trousers and rushed to his bus stop. Along the way, he said he suddenly realized he was carrying the soiled clothes and – overcome with disgust – threw them in a garbage can.

Duhon said his mother was the first person he told about his rape, when laundry day arrived the following Friday. He said he disclosed the attack to her after struggling to give an answer when she asked where his gym shorts and underwear were so she could wash them.

He said his mother said nothing but appeared to be in shock. Duhon said he was never sure whether she disclosed the rape to his father. But his parents soon decided he would not return to Little Flower and instead would work a newspaper delivery route with his father.

Not immediately realizing that he was traumatized, Duhon said he returned to St John much more combative than he had been before. One priest and teacher, Luis Fernandez, had the habit of using a lengthy stick to strike students who were sleeping, talking or inattentive. He hit Duhon with it one day that year, and the pupil snatched it away, igniting a heated confrontation that got him sent to the office of the principal, Paul Calamari.

Calamari initially punished Duhon with detention. But later that same day, Duhon was standing in the lunch line with a friend and began arguing with him over something he can no longer remember. They ended up in a fistfight. Teachers sent Duhon back to Calamari. Duhon recalled the principal saying: “Ah … you're fighting now. Why you fighting, Neil?”

As he remembered it, Duhon didn't mince any words and immediately told Calamari that Hecker had raped him. Duhon said Calamari's reaction was to angrily ask who else the boy had told.

“My mom,” Duhon recalled saying, which prompted Calamari to summon the boy's parents and meet with them without their son present.

Ultimately, Duhon recalled agreeing to undergo treatment from a psychiatrist in lieu of expulsion over the fight with his friend and confrontation with Fernandez. The sessions – which Duhon suspects were paid for by the school – focused on managing his anger problems and what Calamari called “fantasy stories” instead of addressing his rape at the hands of Hecker, he said.

“We never talked once about that,” said Duhon, adding that the sessions went on for months.

Duhon said he eventually graduated from St John, burned his memorabilia from the school and threw his class ring into Lake Pontchartrain. Despite everything, his mother wanted him to become a priest, and he enrolled briefly at St Joseph seminary college north of New Orleans. Yet he said he intentionally tanked his studies and withdrew, having concluded he was not comfortable around priests and felt “hypocritical” pretending he was.

Duhon later served in the US navy and coast guard. And he served as an emergency medic and police officer, first in Louisiana and then in north-west Ohio. He got married, started a family in Ohio and tried not to think about St John.

But that became impossible beginning in 2018 when, amid its efforts to manage the fallout of the worldwide Catholic church's clergy abuse crisis, New Orleans' archdiocese released a list of priests and deacons whom it had judged to be credibly accused of child molestation.

Hecker was on that list in connection with reported abuse that had nothing to do with Duhon. Another person on that list was Calamari, who became a priest after Duhon's rape. Carl Davidson, a priest who worked at St John and had successfully recruited Duhon to join a choir there, was on the list, too.

Robert Cooper, who taught at St John while Duhon was a student there, would be added after a 2020 investigation by WWL Louisiana and a reporter now at the Guardian.

Not on the list was Fernandez, whom the reporters also investigated later. After the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020 in an attempt to limit its liability from lawsuits prompted by the abusive conduct underlying the list, the church quietly canceled most of Fernandez's retirement benefits. The priest, who moved to Florida, later told the Guardian that a church attorney told him he lost the benefits because of a credible child molestation accusation, though he correctly said he had never been put on the New Orleans archdiocese's credibly accused list.

Duhon noted that the credibly accused list's publisher, Archbishop Gregory Aymond, worked at St John at the beginning of his career alongside all those clergymen. Looking back, Duhon said it was as if his high school education unfolded within the clutches of “a pedophile ring”.

“I actually feel [that] as an adult now looking back,” Duhon said.

Louisiana state police troopers would arrive at a similar suspicion after Duhon was put in touch with attorney Richard Trahant, who frequently represents clergy abuse survivors. Duhon – with Trahant's help – reported Hecker to law enforcement in June 2022, formally accusing him of rape, a crime for which he could be prosecuted no matter how long ago it occurred.

Duhon immediately realized how grueling the ensuing process would get. For example, immediately after Duhon described passing out as Hecker began raping him, an apparently inattentive investigator filling in that day for a co-worker jabbered: “There's no penetration.”

“Yep – this is over,” Duhon recalled saying irately as he got up to leave and considered abandoning his complaint.

Yet he calmed down and continued cooperating, though there was little progress for several months.

In June 2023, the Guardian reported on a printed copy of a confession Hecker provided to his church superiors in 1999, in which the priest admitted molesting or sexually harassing several children other than Duhon. The Guardian provided the confession to WWL Louisiana in August 2023, and journalists from both outlets confronted Hecker on camera.

Hecker told the outlets that his written confession about “overtly sexual acts” with underage boys was accurate and authentic. Nonetheless, he insisted that the children were “100% willing” despite their legal inability to consent.

As part of the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy, the judge overseeing the proceeding – Meredith Grabill – was provided that confession. But as she weighed whether such information about Hecker should remain secret because of confidentiality rules governing the bankruptcy or be accessible to the public, she indicated she would “destroy” documents “that this court received” pertaining to the self-admitted child abuser.

Duhon, after learning about that during his interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, said Grabill has “got to get [her] head examined”.

“A judge squashing that … is absolutely ridiculous,” Duhon said. “It's just ridiculous.”

The media outlets were also able to report on a video deposition that Hecker gave during civil litigation stemming from a separate complaint against him. The video was confidential but obtained by the outlets. In it, Hecker outlined how New Orleans' last four archbishops had helped him avoid all accountability over the course of decades.

Hecker also testified about collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of retirement benefits after he retired in 2002, in effect on his own terms.

In September 2023, just two weeks after Hecker's on-camera confession to WWL and the Guardian made national headlines, the office of New Orleans' district attorney, Jason Williams, obtained a grand jury indictment charging Hecker with rape, kidnapping and other crimes against Duhon.

The case was the first time Hecker faced consequences for his crimes. It was randomly allotted to Judge Willard.

Hecker turned 92 shortly after his indictment. And over the next year, Willard repeatedly postponed trying the case over questions about whether Hecker – at his advanced age – had the mental competence required to withstand trial.

Doctors determined that Hecker had dementia but fit the constitutional criteria to legally stand trial. It seemed that Hecker would be tried in late September. And Duhon flew in from Ohio to be the star witness, one of nearly a dozen victims of Hecker whom prosecutors had lined up to testify against the clergyman.

Yet on the morning of jury selection, Willard suddenly recused himself from handling the case, citing nothing more than a clash of personalities with one of Williams's prosecutors.

Duhon, through Trahant, released a media statement saying Willard's waffling on the bench offered an example of why many rape survivors decline to ever come forward.

It wasn't immediately clear how much more time Willard's recusal might cost Hecker's prosecution. But the judge who took over the case, Nandi Campbell, set a trial date for 3 December. And Campbell made clear the trial would go forward that day barring the death of Hecker, who by then had turned 93.

On the morning of the trial, as prospective jurors gathered outside the courtroom, Hecker suddenly pleaded guilty as charged. Campbell imposed a mandatory life sentence a little more than two weeks later.

But first, she held a hearing during which Duhon addressed his rapist. It was the first time Duhon had seen Hecker in person in half a century.

Duhon directed his words at Hecker, saying that he couldn't wear trousers without underwear to this day without thinking of the rape.

“My whole aspect of church changed” because of that attack, Duhon said to Hecker, as a weeping Campbell listened.

Duhon also said he would never forgive Hecker – not that the priest asked for it when Campbell gave him the chance to address the courtroom before he was sentenced.

Hecker served eight days of his punishment. He died early in the morning of 26 December of natural causes as he awaited transfer to Louisiana's maximum-security state penitentiary, infamously nicknamed Angola.

Duhon got emotional reflecting back on his reaction when he first got word of Hecker's death.

“I actually felt free,” Duhon said. He said he regretted that he had lost both of his parents before ever experiencing the relief Hecker's death brought him.

Still, “my feeling [was], ‘It's finally over,'” Duhon remarked.

But he also feels the case isn't totally resolved. Duhon said he was aware that his case spurred a broader investigation into Hecker's former employer.

Statements sworn under oath in April 2024 by the Louisiana state police investigator who built the case against Hecker, Scott Rodrigue, allege that authorities already have probable cause to suspect that the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was illegally “covered up and not reported” to authorities, Rodrigue's sworn statement said.

Calamari was questioned about Hecker as part of that investigation. And he admitted he was a child molester, according to Rodrigue's sworn statement. However, Calamari has not been charged for, as Duhon put it, sending an underage boy to therapy without alerting police that the child had been raped.

And neither had any of Hecker's other superiors – who Hecker acknowledged in his deposition had coddled him despite knowing he was a serial child molester.

Duhon said he decided to shed his anonymity to lend weight to his plea for Rodrigue and his colleagues to complete that investigation, no matter the political and logistical hurdles that may complicate their efforts.

“We need to hold the archdiocese accountable,” Duhon said. “I mean – their secrets cannot stay secret any longer. [They] really can't.”

In prior statements, archdiocesan officials have said they are cooperating with the state police investigation. They have said that they “hope and pray [Hecker's] death will bring closure and peace to … survivors”.

Duhon furthermore said he wanted to openly tell his story as a demonstration of strength to his fellow survivors.

As he put it: “I'm Neil Duhon. I was sodomized [and] choked unconscious by a priest named Father Lawrence Hecker.

“I couldn't say that with my name attached to it prior to his death. But now … to publicly say this, I feel that it just sets [me] right.”

Secretary of state threatens to pull plug ‘within days', as Kyiv says it has signed mineral deal memorandum

The US will abandon its efforts “within days” to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine unless there are clear signs a settlement can be reached, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said, as Kyiv says it has signed a memorandum with the US over a controversial minerals deal.

Speaking in Paris on Friday after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said Donald Trump was still interested in a deal. But he added that the US president had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress.

“It is not our war. We didn't start it,” Rubio said, adding that if a deal were not possible – with both sides still far apart – the US president was “probably at a point where he's going to say, well, we're done”. Trump felt “very strongly” about this, he said.

Rubio's comments are the clearest signal yet that the White House is ready to walk away from its diplomatic attempts to negotiate an end to the war. It was unclear if this would also mean an end to US military assistance to Kyiv. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that deliveries had already “practically stopped”.

Last month Zelenskyy agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin, however, has rejected the plan. Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that ending the war was “not a simple topic”. Moscow was seeking a settlement that “ensured its own interests”, he added.

In recent weeks Russia has launched a fresh military push across the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and stepped up its air attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. On Sunday it bombed the city of Sumy, killing 35 people and injuring 117.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January he has piled pressure on Ukraine, stopping most US military assistance and temporarily cutting off intelligence sharing. This week he falsely blamed Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.

In contrast, Trump has refused to criticise the Russian president or to impose sanctions on or punish Moscow. Senior US officials – including the special envoy Steve Witkoff, who held talks last week with Putin in St Petersburg – have instead parroted Kremlin talking points.

According to Bloomberg, the US's latest peace plan presented on Thursday to European leaders would effectively freeze the war along the existing frontline. Russia would keep the territory it occupies, while Kyiv would not be allowed to join Nato.

Talks are due to continue in London next week. US officials conceded that the proposal would be irrelevant if the Kremlin did not agree to stop the fighting, and said security guarantees were essential for Ukraine if the deal were to work, Bloomberg reported.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, speaking in Rome after a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said he was optimistic “the very brutal war” could be stopped. “Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on,” he said.

Meanwhile, significant details of the minerals deal remain unclear, including whether Kyiv has agreed to a White House demand that it “pays back” the cost of earlier military assistance.

Zelenskyy was poised in February to sign a framework agreement over a wide-ranging economic partnership. It was derailed after his disastrous encounter with Trump and Vance in the Oval Office.

Since then negotiations have continued. Overnight, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, said a memorandum had been finalised. It paved the way for the setting up of an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, she indicated.

“We are happy to announce the signing with our American partners,” she said. Speaking to reporters in the White House, Trump said a deal could be signed next Thursday.

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, added: “We're still working on the details.” He said the latest version ran to 80 pages and was “substantially what we'd agree on previously”. “That's what we will be signing,” he said.

According to the latest draft, seen by the Guardian, Ukraine acknowledges the “significant material and financial support” Kyiv has received from the US since Russia's 2022 invasion and the desire from both countries for a “lasting peace”.

It says Ukraine's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, will visit Washington next week to hold final “technical talks” with Bessent. They are expected to complete discussions on a “reconstruction investment fund”, the memo adds.

The deal would need to be ratified by Ukraine's parliament, Ukraine's deputy minister of economy said on Friday.

Zelenskyy is keen to improve relations with the Trump administration. At the same time, he has so far rejected the White House's demand that revenue from the new joint fund is used to cover the cost of weapons deliveries provided by the Biden administration.

Trump has previously said Ukraine “owes” the US $300bn (£226bn). Zelenskyy has pointed out this assistance was given as a grant, not as a loan, with Republicans and Democrats approving it in Congress. Any future partnership has to be based on “parity”, and should benefit both countries, he says.

The deal may help US weapons manufacturers who are facing a critical shortfall of key rare-earth minerals imported from China. Beijing has restricted their export in response to Trump's escalating trade war.

Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy thinktank in Kyiv, said the deal had gone through “multiple iterations”. He added: “It's hard to say what's inside.”

Landa said he did not expect Kyiv to accept that previous “non-refundable military aid” was now “debt”. “That's not only unfair and unrealistic, but may also negatively affect the full global financial system,” he said.

He continued: “If it suddenly turns out that countries and organisations can demand payments for aid given unconditionally in previous years, it will make recipients more cautious, and could reopen difficult issues from previous decades around the world.”

The latest negotiations came as Russia killed one person and injured about 70 in a ballistic missile strike on a residential area of the city of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine. Five of the injured were children. There were also strikes on Dnipro, Kyiv and Mykolaiv, as well as the Donetsk region.

“This is how Russia began this Good Friday – with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shaheds – maiming our people and cities,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the Russians used ballistic missiles equipped with cluster munitions. “That is why the affected areas are so extensive,” he said. At least 20 blocks of flats, 30 houses and an educational institution were damaged.

On Palm Sunday Russia dropped two Iskander missiles in the city centre of Sumy. One of them hit a congress centre. The other exploded between two university buildings and next to a crowded bus and cars.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Report finds over a quarter of Canadians exposed to ‘more sophisticated and more politically polarizing' fake content

More than a quarter of Canadians have been exposed to fake political content on social media that is “more sophisticated and more politically polarizing” as the country prepares to vote in a federal election, researchers have found, warning that platforms must increase protections amid a “dramatic acceleration” of online disinformation in the final weeks of the campaign.

In a new report released on Friday, Canada's Media Ecosystem Observatory found a growing number of Facebook ads impersonating legitimate news sources were instead promoting fraudulent investment schemes, often involving cryptocurrency.

Canada's federal election, on 28 April, is the first national vote in which Canadian news is not permitted to be shared on products owned by Meta, including Facebook and Instagram. The ban, which began in August 2023, is a result of a standoff between the tech giant and Ottawa over the Online News Act that forced intermediaries such as Meta and Google's parent company Alphabet to compensate journalism outlets for sharing their content. Meta described the legislation, Bill C-18 – passed on 18 June – as “unworkable” and argued that the only way to comply with the law is to “end news availability for people in Canada”.

But media researchers found more than half of Canadians still say they get political news from Facebook, despite the platform's ban on news articles from reputable outlets.

“People using Facebook aren't often thinking, ‘Am I reading the news?' But they leave feeling more informed politically, either from comments from friends or family, about the election. They might see a post from a candidate or follow cultural news aggregating types of accounts,” said Aengus Bridgman, the executive director of the MEO.

“But we know this is not the same quality of information they might have accessed before the ban. The richest, densest and most accurate and factchecked information is not making it through any more. Neither is information that might contradict the views they hold. All of that just has been cut really – like, off at the knees.”

Bridgman says that most of the content the team uncovered – including more than 40 Facebook pages promoting fraudulent ads, with new pages being created and identified every day – were meant to be humorous or ironic, instead of convincing. None of the content the team found is expected to sway the electorate.

But Canada's Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (Site) is monitoring the election for disinformation and says it expects increased online political activity following the two closely-watched leaders debates. China, Russia and Iran remain the greatest threats to Canada's election, according to the taskforce.

Last week, Site officials said they had found an information operation linked to China on Chinese-language social media platform WeChat, the popular news account Youli-Youmian.

“Foreign interference has been top of mind this election, with candidates bludgeoning each other on this issue. We monitor these platforms and our evaluation of that incident in particular doesn't feel as though it had any material influence or consequence,” said Bridgman.

“We don't think one WeChat channel posting a couple times about Canadian politics articles consistent with their editorial line amounts to foreign interference.”

Instead, researchers have focused their attention on a series of scams that appear to be a continuation of a trend replicated in other countries, in which ads showing “fake sensational political headlines” impersonate small business and personal accounts.

Bridgman cautioned that the broader risk of deepfakes comes when a population is uninformed. “If you've never heard about this person before, you cannot distinguish audio or video of them in compromising situations or making offensive remarks. And in the context of politics, we worry that with more unfamiliar candidates, the risk of convincing deep fakes escalates,” he said.

Among posts examined by the team were seven deep fake videos falsely showing prime minister Mark Carney promoting the fraudulent investment platforms featured directly in the ads. These deepfakes typically mimic broadcasts by the CBC or CTV, two of the top news outlets in Canada.

In one of those, the headline reads “Mark Carney announces controversial retaliatory tariff plan in response to Trump's devastating tariff hikes this week”. The article shows Carney meeting with a top CBC news anchor and includes a purported transcript of an interview, in which he promises to send money to Canadians if they register for what purports to be a newly formed government programme. The link, however, brings users to a cryptocurrency scam.

In another, a page called Money Mindset, which uses the logo of the CBC/Radio-Canada, bought five French-language Facebook ads that were active from one to four hours between 4 and 9 April. One of the ads, featuring a deep fake video of Carney, cost US$300–$399 (about C$500) and received between five and six thousand impressions. In total, the five ads represent an investment of approximately C$1,000 and have received around 10,000 impressions.

“These imposter ads, fake news articles, and deepfake videos can undermine the credibility of both the targeted party leaders featured in the content and the news brands and journalists whose names, logos, or visual designs are being impersonated,” the report said.

A spokesperson for Meta told the Guardian it was “against our policies to run ads that try to scam or impersonate people or brands” adding the company encouraged people to report fraudulent content.

“This is an ongoing industry-wide challenge – scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams.”

But researchers say the response from tech companies “appears to have been inconsistent and insufficient for preventing these ads from spreading” – pointing to the proliferation of ads in recent days. The observatory also found that since many of these ads do not self-disclose as political, they often do not appear in the Meta's ad library, which hampers the ability to assess the scope of the trend.

“Imagine that on TV there's an ad using clearly fraudulent content or is a deepfake. In what world would that be allowed? It would never get approved for use because of the advertising standards in this country,” said Bridgeman.

“And yet, Facebook runs these ads that get hundreds of thousands of views across the country and it's just a pure scam. In the midst of a federal election using an image of Carney and a fake CBC news website on a platform that bans the news – this feels like we're kind of in like a Black Mirror kind of moment. And what worries me is that it feels like people are just okay with this.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Tokyo, April 17 (Jiji Press)—UNESCO's executive board on Thursday added Buddhist scriptures kept at Tokyo's Zojoji Temple to its Memory of the World register, making it the ninth Japanese inscription.

The series of some 12,000 Buddhist scriptures, printed in China and the Korean Peninsula between the 12th and 13th centuries, is a key material in fields such as history and linguistics, as well as Buddhist studies.

The scriptures were collected by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan's Edo era, and donated to the temple.

Meanwhile, a set of 1,532 photographs and two films taken between Aug. 6, 1945, and December that year, following the U.S. atomic bombing of the western Japan city of Hiroshima, did not receive a Memory of the World listing this time.

The UNESCO board decided in 2021 not to allow inscriptions if objections are raised by a country, until the country gives its consent.

There may have been objections raised to the Hiroshima bombing records.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

A full ceasefire in Ukraine is ""unrealistic,"" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said during an April 17 briefing, challenging diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting.

The statement came more than a month after Ukraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposal, introduced during earlier negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. 

""We had an attempt at a limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure facilities, which was not observed by the Ukrainian side,"" Nebenzya claimed, referring to a partial deal reached during U.S.-mediated talks in Riyadh on March 25.

""Under the current circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to talk about a (full) ceasefire at this stage.""

After meeting with U.S. delegates on March 11, Kyiv accepted the full ceasefire deal on the condition that Russia would also halt hostilities and refrain from undermining Ukraine's defenses. Moscow refused, demanding a halt to foreign military aid and restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Russia's rejection of the full truce has coincided with strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure. According to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Moscow has violated the energy ceasefire more than 30 times since its announcement.

The Kremlin denies the accusations. Its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claimed Russia continues to honor the agreement but ""reserves the right"" to abandon it if Ukraine fails to comply.

Russia claims that it has been upholding a 30-day moratorium on strikes against energy facilities since a verbal agreement in a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18.

This period lapsed on April 17, and Peskov said no decision has been made yet on the next steps. Kyiv has dismissed the March 18 truce announcement as a Kremlin propaganda stunt without any substance, saying Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian energy facilities since then.

In turn, Russia accused Ukraine of targeting the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast and other energy facilities — accusations that Kyiv has rejected — as Moscow seeks justifications to continue its attacks on Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on March 28 to submit evidence of Russian violations to U.S. officials. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Moscow had sent a list of ceasefire breaches to the U.S., the U.N., and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

With U.S.-led diplomatic talks stalled, Russia continues to insist on maximalist demands, showing little readiness for a genuine peace agreement. Ukraine maintains it remains committed to a complete ceasefire if Russia agrees to reciprocate.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

The United States is shutting down three of its eight operational bases in northeastern Syria, reducing its military presence from 2,000 to 1,400 troops, the New York Times reported on April 17, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The closures include Mission Support Site Green Village, MSS Euphrates, and a smaller unnamed facility. U.S. commanders will reportedly decide within 60 days whether to further reduce the troop presence.

Despite the reduction, the U.S. military will continue supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance controlling northeastern Syria, in operations against the Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ""expressed deep skepticism"" about maintaining any military presence in Syria. However, military analysts have recommended keeping at least 500 troops in the country to counter lingering terrorist threats. 

Since pro-Russian dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a rebel offensive and fled to Russia, Moscow also began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country.

A Russian delegation had since traveled to Syria to meet the new leadership, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin pledged support and cooperation to Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Bloomberg reported that Moscow is close to an agreement with Syria's new government to maintain a limited military presence in exchange for assisting with anti-Islamic State operations in eastern Syria.

Ukraine has also reached out to Syria's new government regarding Russia's military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30, 2024, and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, centre, and Germany's political director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gunter Sautter, right, attend a meeting on Ukraine and its security in Paris on April 17.Julien de Rosa/The Canadian Press

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.

He spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.

“We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,” Rubio told reporters. “Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on. It's not our war. We have other priorities to focus on.”

He said the U.S. administration wants to decide “in a matter of days.”

Rubio's comments stepped up pressure on both sides to reach a peace deal, even as the U.S. and Ukraine made progress on a minerals agreement that Trump has sought to recoup billions of dollars in military assistance that Washington sent Kyiv since Russia's full scale invasion in February 2022.

They also indicated the road to a complete truce will be long and mired with contention, despite U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly claiming on the campaign trail that he could end the war within a day. Trump said last month that he was “being a little bit sarcastic” when he claimed that.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance struck a more hopeful tone in Rome on Friday, ahead of talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

“We think we have some interesting things to report on, of course in private,” he said. On the negotiations, “I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close.”

He didn't give more details.

Rubio's comments came as the U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a long-delayed deal granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Donald Trump's peace push. Trump said Thursday: “We have a minerals deal.” Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.

The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term co-operation.

The framework of the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Negotiations have since resumed.

Despite apparent impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. He didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.

When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “fairly complex” negotiations are ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Trump and Putin are scheduled in the coming days.

“Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,” he said.

Peskov also stressed that a limited, 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington that both Russia and Ukraine last month embraced in principle has now lapsed, but did not say what steps Moscow might take next.

While voicing their readiness to implement the agreement, the warring parties issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. They differed on the start time of halting strikes, and alleged near-immediate breaches by the other side.

After weeks of tensions with European allies, Rubio said the European negotiators proved helpful. “The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.”

European concerns are growing about Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. The talks in Paris were the first time since Trump's inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.

The meetings addressed security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again after a peace deal is reached.

Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.

Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russia kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.

One person died and 98 others, including six children, were hurt as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early in the day, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on Friday. He said cluster munitions struck a “densely populated” neighbourhood four times.

Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.

Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is staging a charm offensive in the region while US President Donald Trump inflicts massive tariff pain.

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Cambodia on Thursday for the last leg of his week-long tour of Southeast Asia, which included earlier stops in Vietnam and Malaysia.  

Although his visit was scheduled months ago, it fell at an opportune moment for Beijing, with the international trade system in disarray because of the actions of US President Donald Trump.  

On April 2, Trump launched his tariff onslaught, unveiling steep ""reciprocal"" duties on goods coming into the US from most of its trading partners, including 49% tariffs on products from Cambodia, 46% on those coming from Vietnam and between 20%-30% on most other Southeast Asian countries.

The tariff turmoil has hit trade and investment flows as well as financial markets. Most countries, including in Southeast Asia, are currently predicting a major global economic downturn. 

Several agencies have cut their growth forecasts for the region this year.

Shortly after the high tariffs came into effect on April 9, Trump announced that the new duties would be paused for 90 days — except those on China which faces combined tariffs of 145% — while the US negotiates bespoke deals with each country.

At a meeting with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam on Monday, Xi said that their two countries ""have brought the world valuable stability and certainty"" in a ""turbulent world.""

The world is ""standing at the turning point of history,"" Xi said, and China and Southeast Asian states ""should move forward with joint hands.""

Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, told DW that the Chinese leader is pushing on ""an open door.""

""Xi has portrayed China, which has over $980 billion (€863 billion) in trade with Southeast Asia, as a force for economic stability and multilateralism,"" said Abuza. ""In contrast to Washington, Xi is presenting Beijing as predictable, cooperative, and committed to win-win trade and investment.""

For more than a decade, the United States and other Western countries have attempted to portray China as a ""revisionist power,"" a country that abuses international laws — especially in its aggression against rival claimants to territory in the South China Sea — and disrupts global trade through dumping low-cost goods on poor countries.

However, because of Trump's ""America First"" economic policy, ""Xi is seeking to portray China as the status-quo power and the US as an unpredictable disruptor,"" Hunter Marston, a Southeast Asia researcher at the Australian National University, told DW.

In Vietnam, Xi oversaw the signing of 45 new cooperation agreements between the two countries.

Khac Giang Nguyen, a visiting fellow at ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute, told DW that the most tangible outcome of Xi's Vietnam visit was progress on the long-discussed rail link connecting northern Vietnam with southern China.

For years, Hanoi and Beijing have discussed upgrading two railways that were built by the French more than a century ago, but both sides have now agreed to build two new lines across their border.

However, beyond this rail link agreement and some photo opportunities, Khac said, little substantive detail was offered.

""The unusually vague language and delay in public statements suggest that Hanoi, and perhaps others, resisted Beijing's attempts to shape the narrative,"" he added. ""Thus, this was a visit heavy on symbolism, but lighter on deliverables than the number of signed agreements would suggest.""

In Malaysia, Xi also spoke about standing together against ""shocks to global order and economic globalization.""

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has had a frosty relationship with the US over its support for Israel in the Gaza War, spoke in similar terms, warning about ""a retreat into economic tribalism.""

In Kuala Lumpur, Xi signed several cooperation deals and called for advancing discussions on a free trade agreement between China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc. Xi said he wants this to be agreed ""as early as possible."" Malaysia is the chair of ASEAN this year.

""We stand with the Chinese government, for the well-being of our people and for our national economic interests, as well as the overall development and stability of our country,"" Malaysian PM Anwar told reporters.

Xi then arrived in Cambodia — China's ""ironclad friend"" in the region that could potentially be among the worst hit by Trump's tariffs.

Nearly two-fifths of all Cambodia's exports, chiefly its garment products, are bought by the US, according to Cambodian government figures.

But China is Cambodia's largest trading partner, with bilateral commerce surpassing $15 billion in 2024 and representing nearly 30% of the Southeast Asian nation's total trade volume. China also accounts for more than half of all investment in Cambodia.

Xi was scheduled to visit the Ream Naval Base, which was reopened last month after years of refurbishment by Chinese companies. Since 2018, the US has claimed that Phnom Penh will allow the Chinese military exclusive access to the base, which Cambodia and China deny.

Xi's visit to Cambodia comes as the country commemorates the 50th anniversary of the ""fall of Phnom Penh,"" when the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge captured the capital, the start of a four-year regime in which almost 2 million people were killed in a genocide.

Responding to Xi's visit to Hanoi on Monday, Trump publicly accused China and Vietnam of trying ""to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.""

It's not clear whether Xi's visit will help or hinder the three Southeast Asian states as they go about trying to negotiate down their tariffs with the US.

Cambodia has vowed to significantly reduce tariffs on most imports of US goods, while Vietnam has promised to scrap all duties on US imports and considerably increase its purchases of American goods. 

On the one hand, pledges to improve trade cooperation between Southeast Asian states and China will likely irk some of Trump's confidants, especially Peter Navarro, his trade adviser, who is very concerned about ""transshipment."" This refers to Chinese goods being essentially exported to America via Southeast Asian countries, allowing China to evade US tariffs.

Recently, Navarro accused Vietnam of being ""essentially a colony of communist China"" because it acts as a ""transshipment"" point for Chinese goods.

""Trump holds grudges, so I don't think that the warm reception that Xi has had across Southeast Asia is going to go unnoticed in DC in the coming 80-plus days,"" said Abuza, referring to how long the tariff-pause has left.

On the other hand, Virak Ou, president of Future Forum, a leading Cambodia-based think tank, told DW that Trump might view Xi's warm reception in Southeast Asia as a reason for the US to ""rebalance and try to backtrack and reassure partners here in the region.""

Marston said that Xi's visit could even give Southeast Asian states ""more bargaining power.""

""To be courted by China demonstrates they have options, and the Trump administration alienates them at its own risk,"" he said.

For now, Xi speaks the language that Southeast Asian governments want to hear. Most appear willing to set aside their own animosity toward Beijing as the White House shakes their economic fortunes and the wider global trade system.

A cable car crashed to the ground at Monte Faito, a peak around 45 kilometers southeast of Naples. It is a popular hiking and tourist destination.

Four people died, one was seriously injured, and another was missing following a cable car crash Thursday near the southern Italian city of Naples, local rescue services and firefighters said. 

The accident took place at Monte Faito in the town of Castellammare di Stabia.

""The cabin at the top has crashed,"" said Umberto De Gregorio, chairman of the EAV public transport company which runs the cable car service.

The cable car, from which passengers get views of Mount Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, had only reopened for the tourist season a week prior.

The trip up to the 1,100-meter-high (3,600-foot) mountain normally takes around 10 minutes.

Several Italian media reports said that one of the cables supporting the cabin had snapped while the vehicle was over a steep drop.

Rescue operations were being hampered by fog and high winds, Vincenzo De Luca, head of the Campania region around Naples, told RAI public television.

Another cable car had been using the same line at the time of the incident, but it was close to the town and all 16 passengers were safely rescued.

Thousands in Germany will join traditional Easter peace marches this weekend — but the heyday of the country's peace movement seems long gone, as the government prepares to re-arm. What happened?

Tens of thousands of people in Germany are expected to join around 120 protests across the country this weekend as Germany's peace movement prepares for its traditional Easter marches — even as the presumptive next government under likely-Chancellor Friedrich Merz is getting ready to spend billions on rearming the country. The government is also seeking to boost the number of Bundeswehr recruits from the current 83,000 to 203,000 by 2031 with a new voluntary program.

German public opinion on war and peace is conflicted: Surveys by the Forsa research institute (carried out in March and April for media outlets RTL and NTV) found that while a majority of Germans (54%) fear that the country could get dragged into the Ukraine war, only one in six of the population would be prepared to fight for the country.

This year Easter marches themselves are very eclectic, with each of the 120 protests publishing its own demands that call attention to different conflicts around the world. But, according to Kristian Golla, who is helping to coordinate the demos through the organization Network of the German Peace Movement, there are a few key points common to all: The demonstrations all oppose the ""excessive arms build-up in Germany and Europe,"" call for more diplomatic efforts to end wars ""especially those in Ukraine and Gaza,"" demand the dismantling of all nuclear weapons, and oppose the stationing of medium-range ballistic missiles in Europe.

""I think it's important to point out that there are alternatives — that it's not just about rearmament, rearmament, rearmament — is that the right path?"" Golla told DW. ""I think the politicians are trying to offer a solution that isn't really a solution. Is it really true that once Russia has occupied Ukraine, they would then occupy half of Western Europe? I'm very unsure whether that is really true.""

Golla was also keen to underline that the German peace movement is not exclusively pacifist. ""There are those who don't fundamentally oppose the use of violence,"" he said. ""It's the purpose of the movement to ask the question: What conflicts are there and how can they be resolved? Can conflicts only be resolved militarily or are there other points?""

Olaf Müller, a pacifist and philosophy professor at Berlin's Humboldt University, thinks that Germany's peace movement is at one of its lowest ebbs in decades. ""I think the peace movement is demoralized,"" he told DW. ""And one of the reasons is that if you take to the streets against militarism now you are instantly suspected of playing into Putin's hands.""

It's certainly true that despite this week's protests, the German peace movement has experienced a drastic decline since its heyday in the 1980s, as the Cold War was slowly drawing to a close and freedom movements were spreading across communist Europe.

In 1983, for instance, some 4 million West Germans had signed the so-called ""Krefeld Appeal,"" demanding that the West German government withdraw its promise to allow medium-range ballistic missiles to be stationed in the country — one of the main demands of this weekend's Easter marches, where only tens of thousands are expected to attend.

There's a good reason for this hesitation: Germans are increasingly frightened of war, not least because of recent developments in the White House. ""Germans are scared right now because they're no longer sure that the security guarantee of the NATO treaty will hold,"" says Müller.

Müller believes that there are practical alternatives to military defense, and argues that if Germany were, for example, to reintroduce military service, as has been suggested, people should be given the option of training in non-violent civil resistance and civil disobedience instead of weapons training. Some Ukrainian towns and people have indeed practiced such methods against the Russian invaders.

Annette Ohme-Reinicke, author of a book on the history of social movements, thinks Germany's peace movement has been undermined by other worries since the end of the Cold War, when society began ""looking away"" from the issues of war and defense.

Now, she argues, Germans have become much more preoccupied with social concerns: The difficulties of inflation, the rise in rents, and simply trying to secure a living have engendered a new anxiety in the population. Meanwhile, she argues, an increasingly neoliberal economic system, and the individualism that comes with it, has undermined social movements in general.

""It's a completely different mood than in the 60s and 70s,"" she said. ""I think that has made the population more vulnerable to issues that create fear and drives them to feel like they must join one side or another.""

Ohme-Reinicke also argues that there's a growing disconnect between government concerns about national security and the population's concerns about their own safety. ""I think trying to bridge this discrepancy is currently a huge task for the peace movement.""

At the same time, Ohme-Reinicke sees a failure in Germany's debate culture and more polarization, which has led to people being increasingly worried about being branded if they join a peace demo.

That is exacerbated by the fact that the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which, according to the latest polls, is supported by a quarter of all voters, has now also adopted a more pacifist stance towards Russia. Few in Germany's traditionally left-wing peace movement wish to be associated with the far right party.

For Müller, it is vital underline the alternatives to militarism, even in an uncertain world where people have legitimate fears of war. The key would be to be careful about what Germany invests in — if Germany must buy weapons, then they should be as defensive as possible: Air defense systems, reconnaissance technology, logistics that ensure Germany is able to get defensive troops to NATO's eastern border.

Political scientists Klaus Schlichte and Stephan Hensell from Bremen University argue that peace research is not naive, but more important than ever: ""As outrageous as it may seem at the moment, anyone interested in Europe's stability will have to start thinking about initiating a new disarmament process now,"" they wrote in the national Frankfurter Rundschau daily at the end of March. ""The carte blanche for armaments, which was hastily decided upon, should actually be the reason for all experts to think about such solutions to the security dilemma. That would be the historical mission of peace research.""

France's Aix-Marseille University offered a program for scientists ""threatened in their research"" in America. Europe is sensing an opportunity to attract talent as the Trump administration cuts funding to colleges. 

A group of US-based researchers is due to start work at a French university in June, as scientists and academics scramble to deal with massive cuts introduced by President Donald Trump's administration.

France's Aix-Marseille University said its ""Safe Place for Science"" scheme, which in March became available to US scientists threatened by cuts to higher education in America, was flooded with applicants.

The ""Safe Space for Science"" scheme aims to attract US workers from fields such as health, queer studies, medicine, epidemiology and climate change.

Aix-Marseille said it received 298 applications for the program, of which 242 were deemed eligible, and their applications were under consideration since there were only 20 available posts. The applicants included 135 US citizens and 45 dual nationals.

""Our colleagues were frightened,"" university director Eric Berton said. ""It was our duty to rise to the occasion.""

Berton added that 10 European universities have contacted him about launching similar programs.

Berton is advocating for creating a ""refugee scientist"" status to allow more US researchers into France and Europe, a call echoed by former French President Francois Hollande.

With many US-based academics considering crossing the Atlantic amid growing threats to their livelihood, Europe is sensing opportunity.

At least 13 European parties including Germany, France and Spain have urged the European Commission in a letter signed in March to quickly move to attract gifted academics, according to Reuters.

The European Research Council, an EU body that finances scientific work, told the news agency it planned to double the relocation budget granted to researchers moving to the EU.

Reuters also reported seeing negotiation documents in the lead up to the formation of Germany's coalition government, where plans were laid out to attract up to 1,000 researchers.

""The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the USA, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe,"" Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said last month. ""This is a huge opportunity for us.""

A White House official was cited by Reuters as saying the administration was prioritizing funding areas likely to bring returns for taxpayers ""or some sort of meaningful scientific advancement.""

Trump's cuts have affected academics at top world universities such as Yale, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins, raising European hopes of attracting intellectual talent.

However, many have argued that despite the cuts and Europe's attempts to seize the opportunity, the size of the existing gap between university spending in the US and Europe means the status quo would not change that quickly.

""I don't foresee a rapid build-up of additional scientific capability that could match what the U.S. now has...for several decades,"" Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton, told Reuters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","In China's ‘Christmas Town,' Trump's tariffs are dimming the lights","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/business/yiwu-china-market-impact-trump-tariffs-intl-hnk-dst/index.html","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            It's a familiar, beloved scene for millions across America: snow drifting outside and Christmas music playing while families decorate their homes with string lights, stockings and a star atop the tree.
    


            But few know exactly where those iconic holiday items come from.
    


            Most of the time, they hail from just one city in China's Zhejiang province: Yiwu, nicknamed “Christmas Town,” which supplies nearly 90% of all decorative Christmas goods used in the United States, according to state media.
    


            And many of those products can be traced back to Yiwu's wholesale market — the biggest in the world.
    


            It's a labyrinthine complex measuring nearly 1,000 acres, the equivalent of roughly 750 football fields. Inside, foreign buyers browse narrow corridors overflowing with merchandise, ranging from piano-playing musical Santa dolls to artificial Christmas trees — as well as countless other items destined for American homes, including “Make America Great Again” hats, massage guns and foldable camping chairs.
    


            But these days, there's an undercurrent of anxiety. These vendors are on the front lines of global trade — and are now grappling with triple-digit tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which have sent shockwaves across the world and upended relationships forged over decades between the US and China, two superpower economies.
    


America's overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%, the highest trade penalties imposed by the US in nearly a century, with Trump's most recent “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese imports coming after earlier rounds related to fentanyl.
    


            For many vendors, the measures have already cost them customers, slashed their profits and forced them to pivot to other markets. When CNN visited the market earlier this week, many voiced both concern and bewilderment at Trump's actions, but also desire for a peaceful resolution as they pick up the pieces of their disrupted businesses.
    


            “Some of our long-term clients have stopped dealing with us and we are all very sad,” said Ran Hongyan, 43, who has been selling Christmas decorations for 15 years.
    


            After the tariffs hit, she tried offering her American customers a discount to save the relationship, but it didn't work. Eight out of ten canceled their contracts this year, representing a loss of more than $135,000, she said.
    


            Ran said the US exports made up only a portion of her total clientele, but they're not just numbers on a screen or an accounting ledger. Many were longtime partners. She had met one American customer at a trade fair in China years ago, and they had worked together for nearly a decade; he even traveled to visit her factory where the products were made.
    


            “Because of the tariff issue, he said he had no choice but to cancel it this year and see what happens later,” she told CNN, standing amid rows of reindeer plushies and festive teddy bears in her small store. “We have been working together for a long time.”
    


            Much of President Trump's tariff rhetoric has been about restoring US factory jobs that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals.
    


            But it's difficult to see a future where the kind of products on display at Yiwu could be made by American hands — unless consumers are willing to pay much more for something as ubiquitous and currently inexpensive as plastic Christmas ornaments.
    


            The second-biggest exporter of Christmas decorations to the US is Cambodia, where factory wages are even lower than China, but Trump also imposed 49% tariffs on the small Southeast Asian nation, before the recent 90-day pause.
    


            The city of Yiwu is relatively small by Chinese standards, home to fewer than two million people, but it has an outsized footprint in global trade. Last year, it sent $81 billion of goods overseas, of which about $11.5 billion went to the US, according to local customs data.
    


            This massive impact is clear from the moment you land in the city. As you step off the plane, the boarding bridge connected to the airport is plastered with English ads that read: “China goods! Do global business in Yiwu!”
    


            When CNN visited the wholesale market, it was still bursting with activity. After all, the US is currently alone in slapping universal tariffs on the world's second-largest economy.
    


            The multi-story, multi-block complex boasts different types of goods on each floor, with coffee shops and snack stalls scattered throughout. Everywhere you turn, there is an explosion of color and sound, with an estimated 70,000 stalls crammed inside, according to local authorities.
    


            But the escalating trade war is already making a mark.
    


            CNN saw buyers from various countries perusing the booths and negotiating contracts with sellers, but there wasn't a single American in sight. Shopkeepers were on edge, too — with many declining to speak and cautious of local Chinese officials wandering the market.
    


            Even vendors who don't sell to the US are nervous.
    


            Trump may have delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other nations besides China, prompting many to suspend their own counter-measures, but talks are still ongoing, and there's no telling if the announced tariffs might be reinstated. Many economists, even Trump allies, are warning a global recession could still take place if the trade war continues.
    


            The back-and-forth means that the world's economies remain in flux, with consumers potentially tightening their purse strings and reassessing where they're spending their money. That could spell deep trouble for the people of Yiwu, whose livelihoods depend on overseas customers, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.
    


            Li Xinyao has been working at her family's imitation flower business at Yiwu market since it was established in 1993, selling plastic bouquets of roses, sunflowers, daisies and more. Though they don't currently have any American customers, their revenue has still taken a hit since the trade war kicked off.
    


            “Even though we think China will be better (and recover), but the United States is still the best country in the world, the richest,” she said. “The Americans always impact the world. When they start the trade war, all the people will worry about that, and our customers will maybe hold on (orders).”
    


            The turbulent global economy could also hurt her sales, since decorations, like plastic flowers, could be first on the chopping block for clients needing to cut expenditures, she said.
    


            “If we cannot lead a happy life, who will care about decorations?” she asked.
    


            For many other vendors, whose customer base is concentrated in the US, Trump's trade war means they will now need to look for other opportunities.
    


            In some ways, this pivot has been happening for years on a national level. The idea of decoupling, a scenario where two countries have virtually no trade or investment, has been bandied about in US-China circles for years, though such a historic rupture would cause enormous pain for both of the deeply intertwined economies.
    


            Tensions have been rising since the US-China trade war during Trump's first term, and China has been quietly bracing for a showdown in the years since. Since 2018, Beijing has diversified its supply chains and expanded trade relations with the rest of the world, thereby reducing the share of US exports. China's exports to the US made up 19.2% of its total overseas shipments in 2018 – but dropped to 14.7% in 2024, according to official figures.
    


            This means China now relies less on US businesses than it did before, an attitude the Yiwu sellers are adopting too.
    


            “I am now taking all goods that are halted by my US customers to the EU route. I will push all these goods to our EU customers,” said 39-year-old Nie Ziqin, who sells Halloween decorations.
    


            Up to half of her exports used to go to the US. Like Ran, she had cultivated trade relationships with “old customers for many years,” she said. But now, many of those orders have been suspended, even though they were negotiated before the tariffs were announced.
    


            Although her sales have dropped “significantly,” she voiced optimism about her other options. “I still have the domestic market, and the EU market. I am also doing cross-border e-commerce online,” she said, gesturing to the walls of ghostly masks, pumpkin lanterns, dancing ghouls and giant eyeballs around her.
    


            “Last year, we had already started to design products that (we) could sell to the Chinese domestic market.”
    


            Some of the vendors praised China's response to the trade war, echoing sentiments expressed on China's tightly controlled social media, where online users vented anger toward the US and supported Beijing's firm stance against Trump's tariffs.
    


            Last week Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125%, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping saying his nation was “not afraid.” Officials indicated Beijing would not raise rates further since it would be meaningless to continue escalating.
    


            “Our government is doing good in these things,” said Li, the imitation flower seller.
    


            But that doesn't lessen their fear, as they brace for impact and worry about what the trade war could mean for Yiwu and the families who live there.
    


            Li, the plastic flower seller, worries about how the state of the world will affect her six-year-old daughter “every day,” she said, adding that Chinese people “always worry about the next generation.” And even as a history buff, she remains confused about why Trump would launch such a trade war in the first place.
    


            “We want world peace. From my perspective, I really don't understand why they would do this,” she said.
    


            She and the other vendors all voiced hope that the two countries' leaders can reach an agreement and end the tit-for-tat tariffs that have plunged their lives and businesses into uncertainty. But as the trade war drags on, it's not clear whether that relationship can be repaired — or whether it will ever look the same again, even if vendors eventually resume selling to their long-time customers.
    


            For some, the damage has already been done.
    


            “When we do daily shopping, if we want to buy a bag or buy some daily necessities, we will now start considering whether these products are imported from the United States,” said Ran, the Christmas decorations seller.
    


            And if those goods are American-made: “I will definitely choose not to buy them.”

Follow:


            Russia's Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a ban on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization more than two decades ago.
    


            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as US and NATO troops were in the final weeks of withdrawing from the country after two decades of war.
    


            The Russian court's move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Moscow's list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law.
    


            At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker.
    


            The court's ruling on a request by the Prosecutor General's Office followed last year's adoption of a law stipulating that the official designation as a terrorist organization could be suspended by a court.
    


            The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989.
    


            Russian officials have recently been emphasizing the need to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan.
    


            In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terrorist groups.
    


            The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade.
    


            Such measures have isolated the Taliban on the world stage, although their government has established diplomatic ties with countries including China and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            The UN this year renewed its call for the Taliban to lift the bans.
    


            The group's decrees limiting the participation of girls and women have affected foreign aid to the country. The Taliban also have brought back their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, including public executions.
    


            Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the US under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases.
    


            Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with Crisis Group's Asia Program, said the Taliban's listing as a terrorist group was a legal impairment for trade and political ties with Kabul and its lifting reflected Moscow's desire to improve relations.
    


            “However, beyond making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage with Afghanistan, I am not sure what other major benefit this will have,” he said.
    


            South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Russian move was not ground-breaking because many countries had never formally designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization. At the same time, he called the decision a “win-win” for bilateral relations.
    


            For Russia, he said it would serve as a confidence-building measure helping pave the way for more engagement and enabling Moscow to better protect its interests in Afghanistan, particularly concerns about anti-Russia terror groups like Islamic State-Khorasan.
    


            “Meanwhile, for the Taliban, the court decision is a legitimacy-boosting outcome they can leverage to point to international acceptance of their rule,” Kugelman observed.

            Sen. Chris Van Hollen said he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, Thursday night.
    


            “I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” the Maryland Democrat said in a post on X, sharing a photo of the two seated together at a table. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”

Appeals court backs judge in Abrego Garcia case, saying Trump DOJ ‘would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness'



            Abrego Garcia will remain El Salvador's custody following the meeting, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a Thursday night post on X.
    


            “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody,” Bukele said. The Salvadoran president posted several photos earlier of Van Hollen shaking hands with Abrego Garcia and the two seated alongside a third man.
    


            In a swipe at Democrats critical of Abrego Garcia's incarceration in El Salvador's maximum-security prison, CECOT, he wrote: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' & ‘torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!”
    


            CNN has reached out to Van Hollen and Bukele's offices for more information. The senator declined to provide additional details to CNN en Español about the meeting as he departed a hotel in the capital San Salvador Thursday night, adding that a full readout would be given Friday.
    


            The US lawmaker traveled to the Central American nation on Wednesday in a push for the man's release. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and in the weeks since, his case has become a flashpoint in the fight over the Trump administration's hardline deportation push.
    


            Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, celebrated the meeting on Thursday night.
    


            “My children and my prayers have been answered. The efforts of my family and community in fighting for justice are (being) heard, because I now know that my husband is alive. God is listening, and the community is standing strong,” she said in a statement.
    


            Thursday night's meeting came after Van Hollen earlier in the day said he was denied entry to CECOT when he tried to check on Abrego Garcia's “health and wellbeing.”
    


            He previously told reporters in San Salvador that he had been “stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about three kilometers” from the notorious CECOT prison, where he had driven with Chris Newman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia's wife and mother.
    


            Van Hollen said that denying Abrego Garcia access to his lawyers “is a violation of international law.”
    


            “El Salvador is a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights. El Salvador has signed and ratified that covenant. And that covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,'” he said.
    


            Van Hollen's attempt to enter CECOT came a day after El Salvador's vice president denied him access following an in-person meeting.
    


            Salvadoran authorities have not formally charged Abrego Garcia, and are not bound by a strict timeline to do so, according to a high-level source close to Bukele, under the country's ongoing state of exception, which suspends certain constitutional rights.
    


            While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error.
    


            In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. US officials have alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward.
    


            “Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist,” White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote on X Thursday after news of the meeting between Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia broke. “It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans.”
    


            Van Hollen on Thursday again accused the US government of violating Abrego Garcia's right to due process and emphasized that was his reason for traveling to El Salvador.
    


            “I am not here to vouch for any particular set of facts or claims, but I am here to vouch for the judicial system in the United States, which guarantees individuals the right to due process,” he said.
    


            Other Democratic delegations, he said, are “in the works now,” and while a Republican congressional delegation had recently been allowed to visit CECOT, Van Hollen said: “They did not ask to meet with Kilmar. That was not part of their mission.”
    


            Van Hollen said he also met with the US Embassy team during his visit, as well as representatives from DHS, FBI, and DEA to discuss joint efforts between the United States and El Salvador to “crack down on transnational gangs like MS-13.”

PARIS (AP) — France hosted high-level talks Thursday to discuss Ukraine and its security, the first time since President Donald Trump's inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials are known to have met together to discuss an end to the war. 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff joined other top Ukrainian and European officials for hours of separate meetings at the French presidential palace before French President Emmanuel Macron brought them all together for a final round of talks at the end of the day.

Macron described the talks as an important “convergence.” France announced that talks in the same format would continue in London next week.

The meetings came as concerns grow about Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia and after weeks of U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine failed to bring an end to the fighting. There is also frustration among Europeans over the Trump administration's other moves, from tariffs on some of its closest partners to rhetoric about NATO and Greenland.




Rubio wrote on X that the American delegation in Paris was looking to “secure real, practical solutions to end the Russia-Ukraine war.”

Rubio also spoke by phone Thursday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, conveying the same message he gave the delegations in Paris, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.

“President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” the statement says. “The encouraging reception in Paris to the U.S. framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement.”

Until now, Trump's officials have pursued separate negotiating tracks between the United States and Ukraine, and between the U.S. and Russia. 

Senior U.S. officials had previously made comments suggesting European representatives would not be involved in ceasefire negotiations. Experts said the talks are thought to be the first time Witkoff — Trump's chief envoy tasked with negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin — has met senior Ukrainian officials. 

Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, called this “really, really important. And I think that is emerging because I think the U.S. process has stalled and ... they realized that you need European input because they have skin in the game.''

“This is not just about a swath of territory in Ukraine,” she said. “This is about broader questions of European security and you can't disentangle those.″

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wanted his representatives to raise the question of security guarantees for Ukraine, and said he gave his team a mandate to discuss a full and partial ceasefire — but not matters relating to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

A senior French official said after Thursday's talks that U.S. officials were ''ready to discuss security guarantees,″ without elaborating. The official spoke anonymously as he was not authorized to be publicly named, according to presidential policy.

Ukraine's presidential adviser, Andrii Yermak, said the Ukrainian delegation and European partners discussed the next steps toward achieving a “just and lasting peace,” including a full ceasefire, the deployment of a multinational military contingent, and the development of an effective security architecture for Ukraine.

“It was a very substantive conversation. We continue our work,” he wrote.

Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, also joined the talks. Other participants included Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, the German government's foreign policy adviser and German Foreign Ministry's political director.

Around 30 countries led by Britain and France have been discussing a possible coalition to police any future peace agreement with Russia. 

The success of the coalition's operation hinges on U.S. backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support which European officials say is critical.

Polyakova, from the Washington group CEPA, suggested peace efforts have so-far failed because Putin does not want a ceasefire and is stalling for time. The Trump administration's strategy so far has been to offer Russia “lots of carrots” but “very few sticks” to bring Moscow to the negotiating table, she said.

The question “is whether these talks in this format will shift the administration's strategy,” she added.

Macron spoke with Zelenskyy twice during the day and has spoken frequently with Trump in recent weeks. France hailed Thursday's meetings as a diplomatic success borne from those relationships.

Hours earlier, a massive drone attack hit the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Wednesday night, killing three people, including a child, regional authorities said. 

Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks.

Rubio and Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace more than three years after Russia launched the war. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia, and Witkoff met last week with Putin.

Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine. 

At Thursday's talks in Paris, Macron also discussed the impact of Trump's tariff policies and the conflicts in the Mideast.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discusses the latest developments with Panama, tensions with China and more on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Why are President Donald Trump and his national security team focused on Panama and Greenland? 

Donald Trump understands that modern threats – China's predatory mercantilism and its massive military buildup, including the ability to destroy our reconnaissance satellites in orbit – requires an urgent reinvigoration of the 200-year-old Monroe Doctrine.

The Monroe Doctrine, America's fundamental national security imperative, seeks to exclude outside powers from the Western Hemisphere. It is key to protecting the U.S. and our neighbors from China's malicious designs.

Trump understands that Greenland and Panama aren't merely the key in any potential conflict with China, they are key to deterring China from conflict in the first place.

WHY MAKING AMERICA SAFER MEANS REVOKING VISAS WHEN THREATS ARISE

During WWII and the Cold War, prior to the advent of near-global real-time overhead satellite coverage, America maintained forward bases in a string from Hawaii to Alaska to Canada to Greenland to Puerto Rico to Panama. These bases hosted naval assets, electronic listening posts, early warning radars and airfields for patrol aircraft. 

The forward presence not only protected the American heartland, but it also served to guard the sea lanes needed for trade and to support our allies in Europe and Asia. 

Trump recognizes the shifting geopolitical landscape, with China's rise posing a new challenge to U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere – and a secure homeland. In 2019, he expressed interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, citing its vast natural resources and strategic Arctic location. This is more relevant than ever, with the Northwest Passage becoming increasingly accessible due in part to Russia and China's rapidly growing heavy icebreaker fleet. 

TRUMP'S GOT IRAN CORNERED BY FOLLOWING REAGAN'S DOCTRINE

Similarly, Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are taking significant steps to secure the Panama Canal – with full cooperation from the Panamanian government. 

The Panama Canal is a vital artery for global trade and military logistics. But in 1997, just before Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based shipping and logistics firm, bought the concession that privatized operations of the Panama Canal. 

When, in 2020, China ended the ""one country, two systems"" model with Hong Kong, it meant for all intents and purposes that Hutchison Whampoa (now known as CK Hutchison) must do the Chinese Communist Party's bidding. This greatly increases the risk to the Panama Canal – and it's why the firm, reacting to pressure from Panama and the U.S., agreed to sell its global assets to an American holding company. That proposed sale was quickly threatened by the Chinese Communist Party, which instituted an ""antitrust review.""

TRUMP'S TARIFF TRIUMPH BIG STEP FOR AMERICA'S COMEBACK

Just to be sure, the Trump White House directed the U.S. military to develop options for increasing troop presence in Panama to ensure ""unfettered"" access to the canal, reflecting concerns about ongoing Chinese threats to the canal's operation. 

The strategic importance of Greenland and Panama is heightened in the context of a potential conflict with China, particularly if America's extensive network of reconnaissance and nuclear missile early warning satellites are destroyed by China in its opening attack. Modern warfare relies heavily on satellite technology for communication, navigation and intelligence gathering. 

If these assets are compromised, the U.S. would need to rely on traditional methods, such as long-range patrol aircraft and naval vessels, operating from forward bases. Greenland, with its airfields and ports, provides an ideal location for staging operations in the Arctic, deploying assets like the P-8 Poseidon to monitor submarine activity and secure shipping routes.

The Panama Canal, meanwhile, ensures rapid deployment of naval forces between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, maintaining flexibility in military operations.

This focus on forward bases aligns with the need to defend the homeland and secure vital shipping lanes critical for global trade and military logistics despite enemy efforts. China's growing naval capabilities, including advanced submarines and aircraft carriers, necessitate robust strategic positioning to deter potential threats and maintain maritime routes.

Historical precedents underscore the importance of forward bases in national defense. During WWII, the U.S. established the Caribbean Defense Command – forerunner to today's U.S. Southern Command – to protect the Panama Canal and monitor German U-boat activity in the Atlantic. Bases in Trinidad, Brazil and Puerto Rico were instrumental in anti-submarine warfare, ensuring the flow of supplies to Europe and preventing Axis powers from gaining a foothold in the Americas.

During the Cold War, the U.S. maintained a significant military presence in Latin America to counter Soviet influence. Today, in Cuba, what's old is new again, as China has occupied and upgraded the massive Cold War-era Soviet eavesdropping base at Lourdes. From that perch, China can listen to every cellphone conversation in the American Southeast. 

Beyond Greenland and Panama, China's activities in the Western Hemisphere, such as its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure projects – some serving as replenishment ports for its navy – pose a direct challenge to U.S. interests and regional security. Along with the malevolent presence of Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, and hostile regimes such as Maduro's Venezuela, Trump's team has a big task to clean up decades of neglect in the Western Hemisphere.

Vice President JD Vance is departing for a weeklong trip across Italy and India on Friday, just the latest in a string of diplomatic deployments President Donald Trump has assigned to his second in command.

According to the White House, the vice president and second lady Usha Vance will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, along with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, in Rome and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. 

One day earlier, Meloni met with Trump in the White House for a bilateral meeting focused on trade. The Vances will specifically “discuss shared economic and geopolitical priorities with leaders in each country,” the vice president's office said of his trips to Italy and India.

The assignment comes at a perilous moment in U.S. diplomacy. Both countries are facing heavy new tariff penalties should they fail to negotiate trade deals with the Trump administration by the summer. The president announced a 90-day pause of his “Liberation Day” tariffs earlier this month, lowering the effective rates for the European Union and India from 20% and 26%, respectively, to 10% while negotiations take place.

The trip also reflects the ways in which Vance, considered a possible successor to Trump in 2028, is rounding out his foreign policy portfolio. 

Last month, Vance traveled to Greenland to speak to American military personnel as the president continued to make the case for annexing the Danish territory. And in February, Trump sent Vance to Paris and then the Munich Security Conference, where he pressed European allies to increase their NATO defense contributions and take a more prominent role in policing the continent.

Ryan Walker, executive vice president of Heritage Action for America, told the Washington Examiner that Vance's ability to vocalize the “root” of Trump's “America First” foreign policy has made him a top “confidant” in crafting how the administration engages different foreign governments.

“Having someone like that in the administration is almost like a superpower, being able to communicate, boil it down to the root of what those policies are derived from, and based on what they're trying to solve,” Walker said of Vance. “JD Vance is the best one in the administration, in my view, at doing that and articulating the vision and the future for the American people, and, frankly, I think that the America First agenda and movement is going to need someone like JD in the future.”

Still, Vance's foreign relations input has produced a handful of hiccups. His remarks in Munich, and specifically accusations of free speech “backsliding” on the continent, were received icily by European allies. 

His recent comment that the United States is borrowing from “Chinese peasants” has apparently become an impediment to trade talks as well, with China asking that members of Trump's Cabinet remain respectful, according to Bloomberg.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian had called the remarks “astonishing and lamentable” last week.

Three veteran Republican operatives with ties to the White House suggested to the Washington Examiner that Vance is clearly being used as an enforcer abroad. The president has hosted a series of world leaders at the White House since January, but he is not expected to make his first foreign trip, to Saudi Arabia, until May.

“It's a great ‘one-two' punch,” one former Trump administration official said. “President Trump is trying to shake up America's relationships with allies and enemies alike. But he's also dealing with a ton at home, limiting his ability to travel and engage leaders on their own turf. That's where the vice president comes in.”

A second longtime Republican operative suggested that Vance's “happy warrior” mentality keeps foreign leaders “on their toes.” 

“These other countries are used to getting the bad cop routine from the Trump administration, so I think the vice president's ability to effectively vocalize the mechanics of President Trump's policies, and to do it with a smile, is invaluable,” that person continued. “It's a tool that the president really didn't have in his tool kit the last time around.”

TRUMP CONSIDERING CORPORATE TAX HIKE TO PAY FOR ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL' TAX REFORM PACKAGE

Ultimately, Walker thinks Vance's deployment as a top Trump messenger is helping to build the “leverage” to accomplish the president's foreign policy goals.

“I think our view is that something has to change, dynamics need to change, relationships need to change,” he explained. “Donald Trump, more than any other person in recent memory, at least in my view, understands leverage, and leverage is so important in developing trade relationships, developing military relationships, developing overall foreign policy relationships with other countries.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

U.S. forces launched airstrikes against the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen on Thursday. The location is controlled by Houthi rebels, who have been causing havoc in the region. 

Thursday's military strike reportedly killed at least 38 people and wounded over 100 others. The attack was confirmed by the U.S. military's Central Command in a press release. 

“Today, U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” the statement read. “The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen. This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”

The number of casualties from the strike is believed to be one of the largest totals since President Donald Trump started ordering military strikes in March against the designated terrorist organization, the Associated Press reported.

Later, the Houthis reportedly fired a missile toward Israel on Friday, but it was intercepted, Israel's military said. The Times of Israel reported that the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command used a newly developed warning system to alert citizens in the area of the missile.

CENTCOM specified that Thursday's strike was intended to curtail the economic benefits the Houthis receive due to oil profits from the region. These funds allow the terrorist group to carry out its military operations instead of being distributed to people in Yemen.

“The Houthis have continued to benefit economically and militarily from countries and companies that provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,” CENTCOM's statement read. “The Iran-backed Houthis use fuel to sustain their military operations, as a weapon of control, and to benefit economically from embezzling the profits from the import.” 

“This fuel should be legitimately supplied to the people of Yemen,” the release noted. “Despite the Foreign Terrorist Designation that went into effect on 05 April, ships have continued to supply fuel via the port of Ras Isa. Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts.”

The Houthis denounced the U.S. airstrike in a statement of their own, the Associated Press reported. The group categorized the strike as directly “targeting of the entire Yemeni people.”

“This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,” the Houthis' statement read. “It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A window into how the network is handling the new Trump era

On March 25, the veteran film producer Erika Dilday spoke at a documentary conference in Copenhagen, on a panel addressing the many challenges, political and otherwise, that now face nonfiction-film distribution. “Even though it's terrifying, it's also incredibly energizing,” Dilday, the executive director of the nonprofit that produces PBS's long-running, Emmy-winning series POV, told the audience. “I'm ready to paint my face, tie a band around my head, and crawl through the mud to try to save our ability to show independent content on public media.”

In the background, though, the fight was not going well. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, public media has been under heavy threat from legislators and the administration; plans are in the works for Congress to claw back $1.1 billion in federal funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. At a House DOGE subcommittee hearing the day after Dilday spoke in Copenhagen, the chair, Marjorie Taylor Greene, accused PBS of “brainwashing and trans-ing” America's children. Dilday herself had already seen how the situation was playing out on TV schedules. At the end of February, she'd heard from PBS that the release of Break the Game, a film from POV's current slate about a trans video gamer's relationship with fame and her fans, would be postponed indefinitely. By all appearances, the network was obeying in advance. (The Atlantic has a partnership with WETA, which receives funding from PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)

Dilday passed along that news to the film's director, Jane M. Wagner, in a February 24 phone call, Wagner told me. She said that the call included Chris White, an executive producer at POV and American Documentary, the nonprofit that Dilday leads. The film would not be shown as planned on April 7, they explained, because executives at PBS were worried about Break the Game's transgender themes and the risk of further political backlash. “PBS is our platform, and we have to respect their directive,” Wagner says White told her. (Neither Dilday nor White responded to multiple requests for comment on this story.) Two days later, Dilday sent Wagner an email that confirmed the details of their phone call, including PBS's concerns about political backlash. “I am so sorry about this,” she wrote.

Mark Leibovich: It's not easy being (Marjorie Taylor) Greene

At some point in the days that followed, the webpage for the film on PBS.org was taken down, along with an associated reading guide. On April 7, PBS rebroadcast a 2022 film about a man with disabilities in what had been Break the Game's original slot. Wagner was devastated. She'd spent six years making the documentary, and paid for most of its production on her own. The network's decision to abandon it didn't even make sense to her on its own terms. “The administration is going to come for public broadcasting because they reject the notion of public broadcasting in general,” she told me when we spoke last week. “It doesn't matter what you show.”

In any case, PBS quickly changed its mind last Friday afternoon, around the time that I reached out for comment on the film's withdrawal. Less than two hours after I'd emailed the network, Wagner received a message from White at POV: “Wanted to let you know that PBS has just come back to us with a confirmed Break the Game airdate of June 30,” he wrote. A network spokesperson eventually shared the same news with me directly: “‘Break the Game' is part of POV's summer season line-up, and it will air in June,” she wrote in an email sent on Tuesday morning, adding in a follow-up that “a slot for this program had been identified in June to commemorate Pride Month.” PBS did not respond to questions about why Break the Game's original airdate had been canceled, or why the new one had been assigned so quickly after I'd requested comment.

“It's not hard to connect the dots here,” Wagner told me. It was “painfully clear,” she said, that PBS had switched positions on the film in an effort to “avoid public scrutiny and accountability.” Certainly, the back-and-forth suggests that PBS executives are not exactly crawling through the mud in defense of independent filmmaking. When the network's president and CEO, Paula Kerger, was asked at the DOGE subcommittee hearing to defend PBS's other trans-themed documentaries, she gave a tepid, practiced answer: “These are documentary films that are point-of-view pieces that are part of our primetime schedule for adults.” Of course, she could have said the same about POV and Break the Game: The series is literally named point of view, and the film's original broadcast slot had been set for 10 p.m., during the prime-time schedule for adults. The fact that the network still chose to disappear Wagner's movie—and then to re-appear it later on, still without an explanation—suggests that the institution is at sea. Self-censorship may be easy to undo, but it's also easy to avoid in the first place. PBS seems to have created this scenario of its own accord, and now it's showing that it doesn't even have the courage of its lack of convictions.

“I never would have described myself as a political filmmaker, or as a social-justice filmmaker, or even as a journalistic filmmaker,” Wagner told me. Indeed, PBS's decision to withhold Break the Game appears to be a function of its timing: The original April 7 airdate would have come a bit too soon after the DOGE subcommittee hearing. A few of the documentary films that have already aired during the current season of POV, before Trump's second inauguration, are explicitly left wing. Twice Colonized, which was broadcast last October, tells the story of an Indigenous-rights activist from Greenland (of all places) who, according to the synopsis, “works to bring her colonizers to justice.” That film's discussion guide, which remains available on PBS.org, invites viewers of the film to think about how they understand the terms cultural erasure, institutional racism, and mental colonization. Another film on the current slate, Who I Am Not, which premiered in December, tells the story of an intersex South African beauty queen and an intersex activist.

Break the Game is neutral by comparison: It neither depicts activism nor advances an ideological position. POV's producers pitched the film as “a sharp, compassionate exploration about the darker side of online gamer culture” in a draft press release. The film tells the story of Narcissa Wright, a virtuosic gamer and habitual livestreamer known for her record-setting speedruns of The Legend of Zelda and other games, who lost a major portion of her online fan base after she came out as trans. At first, Wagner figured that she'd capture Wright's attempt to win back fans by setting a new speedrun record: The film would be “the Rocky of the digital world,” Wagner said. She thought it was going to end with Wright at a gaming convention, getting “a standing ovation and being accepted.” But the finished product—which comprises mostly animated sequences and footage from Wright's webcam—has less to do with a famous gamer's comeback (which doesn't really materialize) than with her relentless, sometimes self-destructive push to find connection online. Wright's experience as a trans woman provides the central context for the film, but it isn't quite its subject matter.

Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won't end there

“The movie is kind of two movies,” Alex Eastly, another gamer who appears in the film, told me. The first movie is about Wright's relationship with her mother, Eastly said: “That's the emotional core of the film.” The other movie, she said, “is about how trans people become a lightning rod for a lot of displaced frustration with the world at large.” (Wagner plans to stream the film on Twitch on Monday night.)

Eastly told me that she wasn't surprised when she learned that the film had been bumped for political reasons. “This isn't an issue specific to PBS. This is society-wide,” she told me. Wagner said that although she's not a political filmmaker, “I still believe in speaking truth to power.” What had happened, she said, left her feeling “existential devastation.”

The episode calls to mind a similar controversy from more than 30 years ago involving PBS and POV, when a documentary short called Stop the Church was abruptly dropped from the network's programming two weeks before its scheduled broadcast in the summer of 1991. The film was about a raucous demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, where more than 100 people were arrested for protesting Cardinal John O'Connor's positions on abortion and the AIDS crisis. PBS executives decided that airing the documentary, which took a mocking tone toward the Catholic Church, would be overly provocative, given that another POV film—Tongues Untied, about the lives of Black gay men—had produced a controversy of its own just the month before and had gotten dropped from the schedules of some member stations. PBS executives had stood behind that film, even as it was cited on the floor of Congress as evidence of the network's political agenda. But standing up for Stop the Church wasn't worth the risk, they thought, of incurring yet another rhubarb over taxpayer-funded programming and more public pressure on local stations. They told POV that they wouldn't air the film, Marc Weiss, the creator of the series and its executive producer from 1986 to 1997, told me. POV had little chance of fighting back, as far as he could tell, and doing so would have been unwise: A second scandal in a row could easily have led to the series' cancellation. “It was a calculation, and I'm not proud of it,” he said.

Whatever outrage that decision fostered was soon forgotten, as POV and PBS were celebrated for their courage in defending Tongues Untied. But contemporary critics such as Arthur Kropp, the president in 1991 of the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, did see the dustup as a portent way back then. “This is the kind of censorship you can't fight—self-censorship,” Kropp, who would die from AIDS a few years later, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “This is the first indication of where we're heading.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The new film is a transfixing take on the Southern Gothic.

One of the rarest and most exhilarating types of horror films is what I call the switch-flip, in which a straightforward drama or thriller transforms halfway through into a pure fright-fest. The original (and best) example is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho; Takashi Miike's Audition also stands out, as does Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which sees a pair of fugitive bank robbers suddenly trapped in a saloon full of vampires. The Rodriguez film in particular kept coming to mind as I watched the writer-director Ryan Coogler's Sinners, another tale of vampires that slow-rolls its intentions. But when the switch flips and the whole picture becomes clear, so does the terrific scope of Coogler's triumph.

That Sinners is a vampire movie is an open secret. Much of the advertising for the film establishes this premise, and Sinners itself begins with a prologue announcing that something supernatural is coming. But the script's unhurried reveal took me aback: What starts as an intriguing period drama set in the Jim Crow–era South curdles into a chilling showdown. Coogler established himself, with Creed and his two Black Panther movies, as a filmmaker with propulsive, novel takes on franchise fare. The wiliness of Sinners, however, makes it perhaps his most exciting creation yet.

Sinners stars Coogler's enduring collaborator Michael B. Jordan, who has appeared in all of his films, as identical twin brothers. Nicknamed “Smoke” and “Stack,” the men have returned home to the Mississippi Delta after several years of working for the mob in Chicago. Jordan plays each brother with subtle differences, a risky choice that demands a little extra attention from the audience: Smoke is a bit meaner and colder than his sibling, while Stack is quicker to flash a (still-threatening) smile. But they're two gun-toting peas in a pod, muscling their way back into town after declaring Chicago to be “Mississippi with tall buildings.”

Read: The game-changing success of Black Panther

Smoke and Stack buy a disused mill on the outskirts of town from its despicably racist owner, then recruit friends old and new to help them convert it into a saloon. The linchpin of their effort is a talented young blues musician named Sammie Moore (played by Miles Caton, in his feature debut), whose showstopping singing and guitar-playing is the club's opening-night centerpiece. His ability to communicate the difficulty of Black life in the Delta through music resonates with the patrons, a mix of sharecroppers and working-class locals. But Sammie isn't just a great performer; he's also key to the film's ambitious concept—that Delta-blues music is so raw and generationally powerful that even vampires want to listen to it. They're violent and soulless, but they're nevertheless lovers of good songs.

Understanding how ridiculous this conceit might seem, Coogler devotes the movie's biggest, strangest scene to selling us on it. He represents Sammie's performance as so transporting that it opens doors to other times; dancers and musicians from the past and the future materialize on the dance floor around him in a metaphysical ballet. The scene is dizzying stuff that might sound corny on paper, but in Coogler's hands, it's cinematic alchemy. The emerging mélange of time-traveling multidisciplinary artists, entranced by the same tune, makes his point far more profoundly than any expository dialogue ever could.

But Sammie's virtuosic playing also entices a coven of vampires to come by, and then gives them cause to capture him. The gang of bloodsuckers is led by Remmick (played by the flinty, alluring Jack O'Connell), who strikes a balance of beguiling and petrifying. Remmick and his pals gradually start to convince the bar's patrons—a crowd of Black southerners in search of hope during a despairing period in American history—to join the campaign to make Sammie one of their own. After all, the vampires reason, what's the appeal of a mortal existence in such a cruel world?

Read: 125 years old and still biting

Coogler leaves a lot of that philosophical debate to the audience. Once Sinners snaps into full-on horror mode—with Smoke and Stack fighting through a cluster of undead beings to rescue their friends—the film itself has no time for such a heady question. Coogler has demonstrated a knack for building action sequences that stand out in an era of weightless CGI garbage; Sinners, which was photographed on the expansive IMAX film format, has a similarly impressive scale. But the gory, sinewy vampire combat is stunning for reasons beyond the crisp presentation: By the time the movie flips the switch to unveil itself as a Southern Gothic, the audience has become invested in the journeys of its characters—even those of the immortal ones. Sinners had me cheering for every thrill and spill, all while mulling the deeper concerns threaded through it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

President Donald Trump said there may be a point where he doesn't want to put higher tariffs on China because the move could deter buying.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he may not raise tariffs if China goes beyond the 125% duty it has on American goods.

""At a certain point, I don't want them to go higher because at a certain point, you make it where people don't buy,"" Trump said when a reporter asked what happens if China raises tariffs on the US.

""I may not want to go higher, or I may not want to even go up to that level — I may want to go to less, because you want people to buy, and at a certain point, people aren't going to buy,"" he added.

Earlier on Thursday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it wouldn't pay attention to Trump's ""tariff numbers game"" after the White House said Chinese exports face a levy of up to 245%. Last week, Beijing called escalating US tariffs a ""joke"" and said they no longer hold ""any economic significance.""

China is the third-largest buyer of US goods, behind Canada and Mexico. According to US government figures, China bought $143.5 billion worth of American products last year.

In addition to tariffs, China and the US have imposed various punitive measures on each other in the escalating trade war. China has curbed the import of Hollywood films, and earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Beijing asked its airlines to stop taking deliveries from Boeing. The US said that companies selling H20 chips to China will need a license, a move analysts said is essentially a ban on exporting those chips.

On Thursday, Trump added that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have a ""very good relationship"" and said Xi has reached out to him ""a number of times.""

The president on Thursday also commented on TikTok, whose fate in the US remains unclear.

""We have a deal for TikTok, but it'll be subject to China, so we'll just delay the deal till this thing works out one way or the other,"" Trump said, responding to a question about whether he would consider reducing tariffs to complete a TikTok deal.

TikTok's parent company faces a summer deadline to divest its US operations or face removal from US app stores. Trump has twice pushed back the deadline.

Among the parties who have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's US operations are Amazon, Oracle, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, and the YouTuber MrBeast.

""If we're making a deal, I guess we'll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok, it wouldn't take very long,"" Trump said.

President Donald Trump is moving forward with his promise to slash a top federal consumer watchdog.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began sending termination notices to nearly 90% of its employees on Thursday night, slashing the agency spearheaded by Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2011 with the aim of preventing another financial crisis like the one that sparked the Great Recession.

Over the past decade, the CFPB has filed lawsuits against major companies, including student lenders and banks like Capital One, over accusations of predatory behavior. It has also returned billions of dollars to consumers and introduced new rules to crack down on medical debt and overdraft fees.

""I regret to inform you that you are affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,"" a copy of the notice viewed by Business Insider from Russell Vought, acting director of the CPFB and director of the Office of Management and Budget, said. ""This RIF action is necessary to restructure the Bureau's operations to better reflect the agency's priorities and mission.

The notice added that employees will ""retain access to work systems"" until 6 pm ET on Friday, and that after that deadline, ""system access will be discontinued, and you will be placed in an administrative leave status through your official separation date as outlined above.""

The National Treasury Employees Union wrote in a legal filing on Thursday that Vought sent reduction-in-force notices to ""the vast majority of CFPB employees."" The notices, as first reported by Fox Business, went out to about 1,500 employees, slashing the agency's workforce by nearly 90%. The CFPB sent those numbers to BI.

""As one would expect with a RIF of that size, the plaintiffs have been told that entire offices, including statutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person,"" the NTEU wrote in the legal filing.

These termination notices come just one week after a federal judge ruled on April 11 that the CFPB could move forward with firing some employees deemed unnecessary to carry out the CFPB's ""statutory duties."" It followed an earlier ruling from a federal judge that froze the CFPB's earlier attempts at terminations, calling them a ""hurried effort to dismantle and disable the agency entirely.""

Business Insider reported on Wednesday that the CFPB laid out new priorities for the agency in an internal memo sent to employees. The memo, viewed by BI, said the CFPB would ""shift resources from enforcement and supervision that can be done by the States.""

That included plans to ""deprioritize"" student-loan oversight, medical debt, consumer data, and digital payments.

These changes are part of Trump and the DOGE office's efforts to slash the government workforce to reduce spending. Elon Musk, DOGE's unofficial leader, has previously said he wanted to ""delete"" the CFPB entirely, writing ""CFPB RIP"" in a February post on X.

Warren wrote in a statement on Thursday night that ""Trump just gutted almost all CFPB staff, so the agency can't do its job of helping Americans who get scammed by big banks and giant corporations.""

""Dismantling the CFPB in the face of a court order blocking an illegal shutdown is yet another assault on consumers and our democracy by this lawless Administration, and we will fight back with everything we've got,"" she said.

The OMB and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.

In recent months, backlash against Elon Musk has spurred a Tesla boycott movement, pushing some owners and shareholders to ditch the brand — and, in some cases, leading to vandalism incidents.

Business Insider spoke to four Tesla owners about their concerns on ownership amid a growing campaign against the EV giant.

While one owner returned his Cybertruck as a precaution for his kids, the other three owners said they don't plan to get rid of their vehicles, despite the rise in anti-Tesla sentiment.

The following stories are based on transcribed conversations with Tesla owners. Business Insider has verified their identities and vehicle ownership. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.

Ben Baker is a Tesla owner living in Sacramento, California, who sold his Cybertruck.

I'm a huge fan of technology. I already own a Tesla, which I absolutely love, and I really wanted a Cybertruck.

I think Cybertrucks are freaking awesome. They're really fun to drive. They're roomy and spacious. I wasn't buying it for other people, I was buying the Cybertruck because I wanted to drive the future.

Not too long ago, after the election, somebody keyed my Tesla Model Y, and I was like, ""OK, that's no big deal."" I live in California, which is a Democratic state, and so I kind of figured that there would be some of that stuff. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal until I went and bought a Cybertruck.

The first week I drove the Cybertruck, I took my family to Starbucks in it. My family went in and I took some cool pictures. As I was doing that, three people walked behind me and started looking at me and laughing. Then one of them called me a Nazi.

I go, ""What are you talking about? I'm just buying this awesome truck. I think it's awesome. I'm not a Nazi."" They were like, ""Whatever, Nazi.""

I thought was weird.

Later on, one of my daughters told me that if I kept the Cybertruck, she was going to get bullied. My son, who leans right, said I should be able to drive the car I want.

I started thinking about if one of them is driving the Tesla Cybertruck and someone started vandalizing it. My daughter is young, she's had her license maybe a year. That's terrifying to me.

I'm a father and I have to do the right thing by my kids. If I could afford to own a Cybertruck myself and then send them to school with another vehicle, then great, it would be on me if it got damaged. But I can't have that happen to them in that vehicle. And who knows how far these guys will take it. They could harm my kids physically — and I couldn't live with myself if that happened. To me, it just wasn't worth seeing my daughter live in fear of the vehicle getting vandalized at their school.

I ended up taking it back, and Tesla was really cool about it. I was able to unwind everything.

I think people should have the right to protest — but they should have the right to protest without destruction. That's where the lines have been crossed.

John VonBokel is a 45-year-old Tesla owner living near St. Louis, Missouri. Business Insider has verified his shareholder status.

I have appreciated and admired Tesla for some time. I was under the impression that it aligned with my personal beliefs in terms of environment, which also overlaps with my personal political beliefs.

Now I feel as though I was wrong all along, or something has changed — but I certainly don't feel like I align with the company and the brand anymore. The shift has been uncomfortable and difficult.

As of October last year, I had hundreds of Tesla shares, and I sold all of them in the last few months.

My decision to sell was primarily financial. After the election, the stock just started going up, and I couldn't figure out how Elon Musk and Trump being together was beneficial to Tesla — and certainly not to the degree that warranted its market capitalization to nearly double.

For me, that meant it was overvalued and I needed to cash out. But I'm under no illusion that selling my shares had any impact on Elon's personal wealth or are somehow a repudiation of his actions.

I feel like what Elon Musk is doing politically is negatively impacting the brand and the company. But I'm more interested in protests that are focused on Elon Musk and Donald Trump's specific actions, or politics in general.

The name ""Tesla Takedown"" itself evokes something negative to me. They're trying to take down a company that I believe is still full of good people who just happen to be led by somebody I don't support anymore.

While I'm not interested in taking down the company, I'm also not interested in supporting it.

I drive a Tesla pretty much daily and haven't experienced vandalism, so I'm not worried about that. But I certainly would struggle to buy a new Tesla now.

Coincidentally, though, they don't have anything that I really want. I have multiple Teslas that I'm happy with. I have test-driven the newer versions, but there aren't any improvements that make me want to get a new loan at current interest rates.

The future is difficult to predict. My decision to purchase another vehicle would depend partly on what they come out with.

Mitchell Feldman is a Telsa owner living in the UK.

I'm a gadget enthusiast, and I was drawn to buying a Tesla because it had all the things I wanted in a car. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. I liked the idea of never having to go to a gas station again. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me.

I bought my Model Y in 2022, and it's performed over and above my expectations.

In March, I experienced the first negative reaction to my Tesla since I've had the car. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing.

The guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, ""Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?""

I was quite aghast. I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say.

I've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla.

I hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO.

The incident made me realize how the perception of Musk impacts his brands. It hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla, however. I'm hoping to have the new Model Y in a few months.

Everyone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says.

Michele Pierog, a 57-year-old Tesla owner from New Hampshire.

I got myself a Tesla Model Y in 2023. I wanted something that was convenient, and I didn't think that any competitor brands had charging infrastructure as robust as Tesla's.

I wanted to try out the car, but thought I'd probably sell it in two years. After three months of driving it, I was amazed by how much I enjoyed never having to go to a gas station.

The utility has been great. I often use its self-driving driving capabilities. There's plenty of room, and it has a ""frunk"" — a trunk and the front where I keep games for my granddaughter when we're traveling. We call it the ""frunk of fun.""

I'm not a huge news watcher, so I wasn't really aware of the Tesla controversy. I knew Elon Musk had been put in a position of power, and people weren't happy, but I wasn't aware this impacted Tesla drivers until a friend called me a couple of weeks ago. She asked how I felt about driving my Tesla.

My response was that nothing had changed for me. The utility of the car was the same.

I did some research afterward and saw that there were protests at Tesla dealerships and some violent acts around Teslas. Regardless of what people's political views are about my vehicle, I think it's wrong that people are vandalizing Teslas.

Recently, when I was driving my granddaughter, someone in a truck behind me drove up aggressively close to me and sandwiched me between them and the car in front. They started beeping and yelling at me. I don't know if this was because of my Tesla, but I assumed that it was because it coincided with media reporting of Tesla vandalism, and there aren't many other Teslas in my area.

Even though this is speculative, I'm now wondering whether my vehicle choice is putting me in a bad position safety-wise.

I don't yet feel unsafe enough to get rid of my Tesla, but it saddens me that I may have to make a decision about changing my car based on other people's perceptions.

Driving a Tesla doesn't automatically mean I support what Elon is doing or have a particular political view. I don't think people should make assumptions about me because of the car I drive.

US Treasuries are the most important market in the world. With some $29 trillion outstanding, they create the benchmark that informs basically every other type of borrowing. Any changes to how the bond market works would be a massive deal. But lately, there's been a lot of chatter about how the Trump administration could radically restructure and refinance the US debt under the so-called ""Mar-a-Lago Accord."" In this episode, we speak with University of Virginia law professor Mitu Gulati about how far the administration could go to legally reform this huge and important market. We also talk about how to buy Greenland and whether Trump could make a few billion by collecting on some old loans from allies.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Pham Minh Chinh

Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said his nation has a “unique bond” with the US as his government engages in trade talks with the Trump administration to avoid a large tariff on its products.

Chinh, who earlier this week warmly welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to Hanoi, said Vietnam's relationship with the US is unlike ties with other countries, according to a post on the government's website Friday. The premier made the comments in a meeting in the capital with Warburg Pincus Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Perlman, who is also chairman of the US-Asean Business Council.

The US attacked a key Yemen oil port controlled by the Houthis overnight and killed dozens of people, according to the Iran-backed militants, raising the specter of a widening conflict in the Middle East.

The assault on the Ras Issa fuel-import terminal appeared to be one of the biggest and deadliest since US President Donald Trump ordered an aerial campaign against the Houthis in mid-March. The strikes have so far failed to stop Houthi maritime assaults in the Red Sea and missile attacks on Israel, causing the American military to consider supporting a ground offensive on the group by Yemeni factions.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Cities Confront Cars:

Traffic restrictions are controversial. Here is how they are playing out in three global cities.

In Paris, the local government has reserved one lane on the main highway encircling the city for public transport and carpooling.

Cities around the world trying to limit driving have faced objections — namely that the measures would limit personal freedom, cost too much, destroy commerce or have negligible effects on air quality. 

Now the first data from these experiments in New York, London and Paris is trickling in. They offer some clues about whether cutting speed limits, charging traffic for entering a city center and penalizing drivers of the most polluting cars can reduce congestion and improve air quality, without causing too much disruption.

Paris Hilton may be best known as a pop culture icon, but she has big plans to cement her place in the world of business and the future of entertainment.

Among her many titles — including ""The Simple Life"" reality TV star and highest-paid female DJ — Hilton is founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global, next-generation entertainment company that spans albums, TV shows, books and consumer products.

""I want to build the next Disney,"" Hilton, 44, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. ""The way Bob Iger sees Disney is the way I see 11:11 media, where it really puts together commerce and community and built this whole ecosystem that involves everything from television to video to audio to products to the metaverse.""

Among Hilton's more recent projects are a skin-care line, a cooking show on Netflix, an encore ""The Simple Life"" with Nicole Richie on Peacock, an upcoming true crime podcast, a new animated kids show, and continued appearances in commercials for Sonic and Crocs.

""I just do things that I love and I'm passionate about,"" Hilton said. ""I don't want to be put inside one box.""

She said being an ""undercover nerd"" pushed her to be on the forefront of technology, including exploring the metaverse and in 2021 hosting her own ""Paris World"" event on Roblox, and that her ADHD is a ""superpower"" to pursue her many interests.

Hilton credited her family for instilling in her a hard-work ethic, one that propelled her great grandfather Conrad Hilton to found Hilton Hotels and his son, Barron, to scale the empire to success.

""Business is something that really runs in my blood,"" she said. ""I always wanted to build something on my own. I didn't want to be known as the Hilton Hotel granddaughter. I wanted to be known as Paris.""

Hilton went on to discuss how the alleged abuse she endured at a Utah boarding school as a teen drove her to seek success.

She said her parents sent her to the youth treatment facility after her school grades fell and they worried about her behavior.

""When I was in there, I just promised myself, 'I'm going to work so hard and become so successful that one day, no one will ever be able to control me or tell me what to do,'"" Hilton said at the CNBC event. ""That's something that really gave me that drive. I always thought success would just make me happy and I would never have to depend on anyone but myself.""

In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for, aid and protect children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act and played a key role in the passing of 10 state laws reforming residential treatment facilities.

""It was so scary,"" Hilton said of going public with her experience and speaking out against the treatment facilities. ""The whole world had known me from 'The Simple Life' and this character that I built, and even that character I built was a trauma response to what I went through.""

She said she was encouraged to speak out by Alexandra Dean, who directed Hilton's 2020 documentary ""This is Paris.""

""It just made me realize that I could use my voice to help make a difference for so many children,"" Hilton said. ""Turning my pain into a purpose has been the most healing experience of my life.""

Ukraine said Thursday that it had signed the basis of a minerals deal with the U.S., although the details of the outline agreement are yet to be announced.

Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said both sides had signed a ""memorandum of intent"" that was the basis of an agreement that is likely to see Ukraine and the U.S. jointly develop the country's natural resources.

""We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine,"" Svyrydenko posted on social media platform X.

""There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,"" she added.

Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's deputy prime minister, gave no further detail on the contents of the outline deal but posted images of her and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent purportedly signing the agreement.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Bessent had told reporters that a comprehensive agreement would be signed next week.

""Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday — next Thursday [24 April]? Soon. And I assume they're [Ukraine] going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. But we have a deal on that,"" Trump said at a press conference at the White House on Thursday.

Bessent added that ""we're still working on the details. We're shooting for around April 26th.""

Asked for more details, the treasury secretary said the deal was ""substantially what we agreed on previously [with Ukraine] ... We went straight to the big deal, I think it's an 80-page agreement, and that's what will be signed.""

CNBC has asked the White House for further detail on the deal and is awaiting a response.

Trump has coveted a minerals deal with Ukraine since his inauguration in January, saying an agreement to jointly develop and monetize Ukraine's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas and other natural resources would act, effectively, as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine throughout the war with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signalled on Thursday that the outline of a deal had been reached, telling reporters, ""this is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions,"" Reuters reported.

He added that the offer to sign the memorandum before the comprehensive deal, which would require the Ukrainian parliament to ratify it, had come from the U.S. side, the news agency noted.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced fees on Chinese-built vessels after a United States Trade Representative investigation by the Biden-Trump administrations found China's acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

""Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ""The Trump administration's actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships.""

The USTR said China largely achieved its dominance through its increasingly aggressive and specific targeting of these sectors, severely disadvantaging U.S. companies, workers and the U.S. economy.

The fees will be charged once per voyage and not per port, as originally proposed.

The policy proposal, begun under the Biden administration and culminating in a January report concluded China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage, would allow the U.S. government to impose steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports. The original proposal called for a service fee of up to $1 million to be charged on each Chinese-owned operators (such as Cosco). The original proposal also said that for non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.

The USTR acknowledged this change was made due to the public comments at the two days of hearings on the fines in March where over 300 trade groups and other interested parties testified. Many warned the government in letters and in testimony that the U.S. was in no position to win an economic war that placed ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels in the middle. Soon, Chinese-made vessels will represent 98% of the trade ships on the world's oceans.

Vessel owners could be eligible for a remission of the fees if they can provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. The remission of the fee would be based on a net tonnage capacity of equal to or less than the U.S. built vessel ordered. ""If a prospective vessel owner does not take delivery of the U.S.-built vessel ordered within three years, the fees will become due immediately,"" the report read.

For the first 180 days, the fees would be set at zero and are broken down into various categories. All charges are based on the net tonnage of a vessel. Container vessels can range from 50,000 to 220,000 tons.

Service Fee on Chinese Vessel Operators and Vessel Owners of China:

The fee will be charged up to five times per year, per vessel. The register did not break out the price per container.

Service fees on vessel operators of Chinese-Built vessels is lower.

The fee will be charged up to five times per year, per vessel.

Fees on foreign-built car carrier vessels will also be based on their capacity. The fee would start at $150 per Car Equivalent Unit (CEU) in 180 days. 

The second phase actions will not begin for three years and would target LNG vessels. The USTR would limit restrictions on transporting LNG via foreign vessels. These restrictions will increase incrementally over 22 years.

Ocean carriers if they provide proof of ordering a U.S.-built vessel, the fees or restrictions on an equivalent non-U.S.-built vessel are suspended for up to three years.·   

Fees on Chinese-built ships effectively do not cover Great Lakes or Caribbean shipping, shipping to and from U.S. territories.

Bulk exports like coal or grain will be exempt, along with empty ships arriving at the ports.

In this article

Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.

 BTC bought between three and six months ago and moving onchain has spiked. It is a classic precursor to ""significant"" volatility, the latest analysis says. 

Bitcoin (BTC) speculators may spark “significant” BTC price volatility as a large tranche of coins moves onchain.

In one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on April 18, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant warned that a Bitcoin market shake-up is due.

Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) are signaling that the current calm BTC price behavior may not last long.

CryptoQuant reveals that 170,000 BTC owned by entities with a purchase date between three and six months ago has begun to circulate.

“Around 170,000 BTC are moving from the 3–6 month holder cohort,” contributor Mignolet confirmed. 

An accompanying chart shows the impact of previous STH events, with the latest being the largest by volume since late 2021. Price direction varies, with both upward and downward market responses visible.

“Volatility is coming,” Mignolet concluded.

As Cointelegraph reported, STH entities are notoriously sensitive to snap market moves and transitive narratives.

Recent BTC price downside has been met with episodes of panic selling by the cohort, which is defined as an entity buying up to six months previously.

Earlier this week, CryptoQuant listed STHs as one of the main sources of current Bitcoin selling pressure.

“Short-Term Holders (STH) have been the primary sellers, sending an average of ~930 BTC/day to exchanges,” fellow contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a separate Quicktake post. 

Crazzyblockk described a “classic shakeout” occurring in Bitcoin, while allaying concerns over a uniform rush for the exit across the investor spectrum.

“With Bitcoin trading sideways and volatility compressing, this cohort-driven breakdown helps us understand that the current correction is not a mass exodus by smart money — it's more likely a reaction from nervous short-term and mid-tier holders,” the post said.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump's escalating trade war (with a top Federal Reserve official confirming a bail out is ready for the $30 trillion bond market).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has dropped sharply from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to lows of under $75,000 as traders are warned of a U.S. dollar ""confidence crisis"" that could be worse than 1971.

Now, with Wall Street banks suddenly staring down the barrel of an “existential” bitcoin and crypto threat, Trump's war with Fed chair Jerome Powell could be about to trigger a bitcoin price and wider market ""black swan.""

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned interest rates must remain high to prevent the return ... More of inflation—something that could weigh on the bitcoin price and stock market.

“Trump somehow firing Powell would represent another black swan. If it happens, react fast and short swiftly,” Alex Krüger, a closely-watched trader and economist, posted to X and referring to so-called black swan events that are typically hard to predict and have extreme consequences.

“This is not something I'd trade in anticipation,"" Krüger added. ""When it comes to black swans, reacting fast works well.”

This week, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough” after Powell reiterated his intention to keep interest rates on hold due to uncertainty over Trump's tariff trade war.

Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.”

“If I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump later said in the Oval Office while taking questions from reporters during a visit with Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni. “I'm not happy with him.”

Krüger predicted that if Trump were to fire Powell, stock markets would “implode,"" with the bitcoin price going “down hard then up as it progresses from a pure risk asset to a risk-safe haven hybrid.”

The bitcoin price has dropped since U.S. president Donald Trump took office but remains well above ... More where it was this time last year.

Bitcoin has so far failed to trade in line with the traditional safe haven asset, gold. The gold price has shot higher as Trump's global trade tariffs come into force, with the bitcoin price following stock markets lower.

This week, Powell reiterated that the Fed was waiting for greater clarity before making any moves, predicting Trump's tariffs would likely worsen inflation.

“Powell stated that tariffs were not a catalyst for a rate cut,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “His remarks cast a fresh layer of doubt over the central bank's path forward and renewed concerns over stagflation risk.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin miners may be struggling as the price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market value trades sideways, and investors sell off their equity—but stablecoin giant Tether is betting big on one of the sector's largest players, purchasing about $32 million in equity in publicly traded Bitdeer in April.

An SEC filing shows Tether snapped up the shares as the price of Bitdeer's stock dropped. Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions, but the company has increased its interest in the Bitcoin mining space: The company bought a stake in Bitdeer last year, and in March, filings showed that it had increased its stake in the company to 21%. 

The stablecoin company said Monday that it would support Bitcoin mining pool Ocean, too, by providing it with hash rate to help mine blocks and reap the BTC rewards.

Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer (BTDR) finished the day trading at $7.62 a share, down nearly 67% year-to-date and part of an industry-wide swoon that's come as Bitcoin has lost momentum and mining difficulty has soared, making it difficult for miners to recover their costs.

The share price of MARA Holdings, the largest miner by market capitalization, is off 26% so far this year, while fellow large miner Riot Platforms is down over 38%. 

Last week, miners quickly offloaded Bitcoin in frantic selling, likely to raise funds, data from CryptoQuant showed.

Bitcoin was recently changing hands at about $85,000, up nearly 7% over the past week but well off its record high near $109,000 set in January.

Tether is the company behind USDT, a digital token that runs on a number of blockchains. USDT is the biggest stablecoin, the third-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, and often the most-traded crypto token by daily volume.

As a stablecoin, it's backed by dollars, treasuries, and other investments, so the value of the cryptocurrency can be used like fiat currency—mainly so traders can enter and exit trades without using a bank.

Tether has had legal problems, though. In February 2021, the company agreed to no longer do business in New York after a two-year state attorney general investigation found it had “made false statements about the backing” of its stablecoin.

Still, Tether has pointed to quarterly attestations and transparency reports as proof its crypto is backed as claimed. The firm also confirmed to Decrypt that it is working with a Big Four accounting firm to get independently audited.

Ethereum (ETH) traded just below $1,600 on Thursday following a 60% plunge in the total net assets of US spot Ether ETFs. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun said that he won't sell his ETH holdings despite the sustained downtrend in the top altcoin's price.

US spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their negative flows on Wednesday after shedding $12.01 million, per SoSoValue data.

Since Trump's tariffs went live, ETH ETFs have seen a net outflow of $909 million. ETH's weak price has also caused their total net assets to plummet by over 60%, going from an all-time high of $14.28 billion in December to $5.25 billion on Wednesday. The sustained outflows signal increased institutional risk-off sentiment, hampering ETH's price growth.

This comes as issuers, including Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale and 21Shares, are seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking within their ETH ETF products. Approval from the SEC will see investors earning ~3% yield on their ETH ETF holdings, potentially slowing down selling pressure on the products.

Meanwhile, in an X post on Thursday, Tron founder Justin Sun noted that he will not sell its ETH holdings despite the top altcoin's weak price action in the past few months. Instead, he highlighted that Tron will continue collaborating with Ethereum developers.

""ETH is currently at a low price, but we have no intention of selling our ETH holdings,"" Sun wrote on X.

Sun has been a major investor in ETH, increasing his holdings on several occasions in the past year. While Sun reportedly transferred a huge amount of ETH to his HTX exchange in Q4' 24, he still holds a fat ETH balance across several staking protocols. One whale wallet potentially belonging to Sun holds over 168,000 stETH, per Arkham's data.

Sun's remark follows potential selling activity from digital asset firm Galaxy Digital, which has deposited 49,681 ETH worth about $79.37 million into Binance and Coinbase over the past five days, per wallet tracking platform Lookonchain's data. Several ETH whales also capitulated within the past month following Trump's tariff impact on the market.

Ethereum saw $23.10 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations is $12.52 million and $10.58 million, respectively.

ETH has been on an extended downtrend since December 16, stretching its move within a key descending channel beyond four consecutive months. This marks ETH's longest multi-month downtrend since it launched in 2017.

A breakdown below the channel's lower boundary could accelerate ETH's decline and cause immense capitulation. However, a breakout above the channel's upper boundary and reclaim of the $2,000 key level could flip ETH into a bullish trend.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of entering the oversold region, while the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has remained oversold since late February. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) posted two consecutive receding histogram bars, indicating a slight weakness in the bearish momentum.

Bitcoin price consolidates above $84,000 on Friday, a short-term support that has gained significance this week. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to weather storms caused by US President Donald Trump's incessant trade war with China after pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9 for other countries.

Official Trump ($TRUMP), the Presidential meme coin launched in January by the United States (US) President Trump family's World Liberty Financial company, is in a precarious situation that could see volatility spike significantly. 

Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $84,000 on Friday as President Donald Trump slammed Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates on time. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering rates by 25 basis points, urging Powell to do the same in the US.

Slovenia has become the latest European Union member state to crack down on untaxed crypto gains, unveiling a proposal to impose a 25% tax on personal profits from digital asset disposals starting in 2026.

Ethereum is trading at critical levels after enduring weeks of aggressive selling pressure. Since retracing below the key $2,000 mark, the second-largest cryptocurrency has struggled to regain bullish momentum. Currently down 21% from that level, ETH continues to hover near $1,580, reflecting a clear lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers.

The market has entered a period of extreme indecision. According to top analyst Daan, Ethereum's price has remained notably compressed, barely moving over the past two days. This type of consolidation often precedes sharp price action in either direction, and traders are watching closely for signs of a breakout or breakdown.

Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to influence investor sentiment, with global trade tensions and monetary policy concerns keeping pressure on risk assets like Ethereum. For now, bulls must reclaim the $1,850 resistance zone to confirm a trend reversal, while a drop below $1,500 could open the door to deeper losses.

As volatility builds in the background, the current compression could be the calm before a storm—setting the stage for Ethereum's next decisive move. Will it break out to the upside, or is more downside in store?

Ethereum is facing a critical test as it trades at compressed levels following weeks of sustained selling pressure. The broader crypto market remains under pressure as global tensions escalate. US President Donald Trump's trade war with China continues to shape macroeconomic sentiment, leaving investors cautious across all high-risk asset classes.

Despite last week's announcement of a 90-day tariff pause for all countries except China, uncertainty remains. The unresolved status of US-China trade relations continues to weigh on markets and is one of the primary factors driving hesitation in price movement. For Ethereum, this has translated into extremely low volatility and a stalled price structure.

Daan shared insights suggesting that Ethereum's price has been “extremely compressed” and has not shown meaningful movement for the better part of two days. According to Daan, this type of compression usually precedes a significant breakout—though the direction of that move remains unknown.

Investors and traders alike are closely monitoring this setup, as compressed price action typically leads to large, momentum-driven shifts. With broader macro risks still in play, Ethereum's next move could define the short-term trend and set the tone for the market in the weeks ahead.

Ethereum is trading at $1,590 after several days of sideways price action, hovering between support at $1,550 and resistance near $1,700. Despite holding above the lower end of this range, ETH has struggled to generate the momentum needed to break out and confirm a short-term recovery.

For bulls to establish a stronger position, ETH must push above the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both of which continue to act as dynamic resistance. A breakout above these indicators could trigger renewed interest from traders and signal the beginning of a recovery phase.

However, the true test lies at the $2,000 level—a major psychological and technical resistance zone. Reclaiming this level would mark a shift in market sentiment and open the door to higher targets.

On the downside, failure to gain ground above the current range and a drop below $1,550 could quickly drag ETH below $1,500, increasing the risk of a deeper correction. For now, Ethereum remains in a consolidation phase, and the next decisive move will likely dictate whether bulls regain control or if sellers push prices into lower demand zones.

What happens when a longtime Ethereum insider calls the ecosystem a “religion” that's lost touch with reality? A critical look at Soleimani's thread — and why it struck a nerve.

Table of Contents

On Apr. 17, Ameen Soleimani posted a detailed thread on X that sharply critiqued what he sees as Ethereum's (ETH) growing detachment from practical concerns. 

Okay so I'm drunk, bored and on a plane, so I'm going to address this point by point. I'm doing this because I despise the part of the Ethereum religion that promotes euphemisms over reality, as in my view it gets in the way of real progress. Why do you think I named it… https://t.co/Mu4hNVbDeb

Soleimani's comments were framed as a response to a values-oriented post by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, which had been endorsed and shared by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

In his posts, Soleimani challenged what he described as Ethereum's reliance on abstract ideals and aspirational messaging, arguing that these narratives often obscure the real challenges facing the network. 

He expressed concern that the culture around Ethereum risks becoming too comfortable with vague slogans at the expense of accountability and grounded problem-solving.

Soleimani is not new to Ethereum, nor is he speaking from the sidelines. He is best known as the creator of MolochDAO, a decentralized funding collective launched in 2019 to support Ethereum infrastructure. 

MolochDAO also distributed grants for Ethereum 2.0 research and contributed to resource coordination during the network's transition to proof-of-stake.

His involvement in Ethereum dates back further. He co-founded SpankChain, an adult content platform built on Ethereum that explored use cases in direct crypto payments and censorship resistance. 

He also backed RAI, a decentralized, non-pegged stablecoin developed by Reflexer Labs, and participated in public discussions around Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused protocol currently under legal scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.

Let's examine the core arguments Soleimani laid out and evaluate how his concerns reflect deeper tensions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

One of the more pointed issues raised in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's continued dependence on centralized stablecoins. 

While Ethereum presents itself as a platform for decentralized finance, a large share of its day-to-day activity is still conducted through assets issued by private companies.

As of Apr. 18, stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) account for a significant portion of Ethereum's liquidity and trading volume. According to DeFiLlama, the combined value of USDT and USDC deployed across Ethereum exceeds $100 billion. 

These tokens serve as core collateral in lending markets, key trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, and settlement mechanisms across a wide range of DeFi protocols. Their widespread integration has made them foundational to many applications built on Ethereum. 

However, this level of dependence brings different trade-offs. Both USDT and USDC are issued by companies that operate under national regulatory regimes. Tether is managed by iFinex, while USDC is issued by Circle and governed through the Centre Consortium.

These issuers maintain fiat-denominated reserves, publish regular attestations, and possess the authority to freeze or blacklist wallet addresses. 

While such powers are used sparingly, their existence introduces a form of counterparty risk that sits uneasily with Ethereum's broader decentralization narrative.

At the protocol level, Ethereum remains open, permissionless, and resistant to censorship. But the tools most commonly used within its application layer rely on infrastructure that can be altered or restricted by centralized actors. 

This distinction is important. It highlights how decentralization in Ethereum is not evenly distributed across all layers, especially in the context of financial instruments that are susceptible to regulatory oversight and issuer control.

Another area of concern in Soleimani's post is Ethereum's evolving relationship with political systems. While the protocol is often described as apolitical and neutral, recent developments show that its broader ecosystem is increasingly interacting with legal frameworks and policy discussions across jurisdictions.

This shift does not alter Ethereum's core design, which remains permissionless and open. However, it reflects a growing need for engagement with regulators, particularly as the network supports more capital, users, and applications. 

Infrastructure tied to Ethereum — including validator operators, custodians, and development teams — frequently operates under national laws and is subject to local compliance requirements.

Many of these entities are based in jurisdictions with active enforcement regimes. As of April 2025, Ethernodes data indicates that over half of all active Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries like the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, where crypto-related legal obligations are well established. 

The geographic distribution of these nodes gives Ethereum global reach, but also exposes it to varying degrees of regulatory oversight.

Meanwhile, on the global front, Ethereum Foundation members have taken part in policy discussions with governments in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. 

Over the years, Vitalik Buterin has held meetings with public officials in Montenegro and Argentina to explore national approaches to crypto governance. 

While these interactions remain informal, they suggest a deliberate effort to contribute to policy formation, without necessarily steering the protocol in any political direction.

In functional terms, this engagement is not unusual. As Ethereum becomes more embedded in real-world finance and infrastructure, the need for legal clarity increases. Protocol developers, node operators, and wallet providers often require stable regulatory environments to mitigate operational risks. 

Meanwhile, policymakers increasingly seek technical input to inform emerging regulation. The result is a two-way exchange — policy shaped by protocol insight, and protocol development influenced by regulatory context.

Ethereum remains decentralized at the base layer and does not rely on state endorsement for its technical operation. Still, the individuals and entities building within its ecosystem often work within legal boundaries. 

The result is not full detachment, but conditional independence — one where neutrality is preserved at the protocol level, even as engagement with political systems continues at the edges.

Soleimani's thread also takes aim at the Ethereum community's embrace of “permissionless innovation,” a principle rooted in the idea that anyone should be able to build without needing approval. 

While this concept has driven much of Ethereum's early growth, Soleimani argues that its consequences are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

One of the most prominent examples he cites is Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol launched via autonomous smart contracts on Ethereum. 

In 2022, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the protocol, alleging that it facilitated money laundering for criminal actors, including North Korea's Lazarus Group.

The sanctions were followed by arrests. Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, two of Tornado Cash's developers, were detained in the United States and the Netherlands. 

Storm now faces charges related to money laundering, violations of international sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money services business — charges that carry a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years.

For Soleimani, the issue is not just the legal action itself, but how the Ethereum community has responded to it. Some defended the developers, while others leaned on the argument that “code is speech” and therefore beyond the reach of legal systems. 

Soleimani views this assumption as misguided. In his view, relying on the neutrality of code to shield developers from responsibility ignores how financial technologies are regulated in practice.

He is especially critical of the belief that developers do not need legal support. In his post, he points to the legal teams and advocacy organizations that have submitted amicus briefs in defense of Roman Storm. 

These briefs argue that writing and deploying open-source code should be protected under free speech, and that creators of decentralized tools should not be held liable for misuse by third parties. 

While these positions have gained support within parts of the crypto industry, they remain legally uncertain.

This case has broader implications for Ethereum's development model. The right to build remains intact at a technical level, but the legal risks tied to privacy tools and cross-border transactions are growing. 

In Soleimani's view, defending permissionless innovation now requires more than idealism. It demands legal foresight, active engagement, and a deeper understanding of the risks that come with building in a regulated world.

Soleimani also raises concerns about Ethereum's reliance on the price of ETH to maintain network security. In his post, he revisits an earlier disagreement with Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, who had previously suggested that ETH's market price was not particularly important. 

Soleimani pushed back by asking a direct question: if ETH were to lose its value, how would Ethereum continue to secure its network?

This is a fundamental issue within Ethereum's current architecture. Since the network's transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum no longer uses miners. Instead, it relies on validators who stake ETH to verify transactions and keep the system operational. 

The effectiveness of this model depends on both the amount of ETH being staked and the market value of the token itself.

If ETH's price falls too low, the rewards for honest validation decrease, making it less attractive for participants to stake. 

At the same time, the cost of attacking the network becomes cheaper. This dynamic weakens both the incentive to secure the network and the deterrent against malicious activity.

As of Apr. 18, ETH is trading around $1,570, reflecting a drop of over 52 percent from recent highs. According to data from Beaconcha.in, more than 34 million ETH is currently staked, representing roughly 28 percent of the total supply.

Soleimani's argument is that proof-of-stake systems do not separate monetary value from security. ETH's price is not just a market metric. It is a core part of how the network stays resilient.

Soleimani closes his post with a question that extends beyond any single disagreement. Can Ethereum, as a system and a community, recognize its internal contradictions and still find a way to move forward?

Despite his strong criticism, he does not write off the network. Instead, he reflects on past moments where change did occur. For example, early debates around the importance of ETH's price eventually led to the emergence of the “ultrasound money” narrative. He sees this as proof that the community is capable of adapting when it chooses to.

His hope is that similar shifts can happen again. The challenges facing Ethereum today are different in nature — they involve legal risk, coordination problems, and questions about how power is distributed. These are not technical issues alone. They require a broader view of how the protocol fits into the world around it.

Whether Ethereum can reconcile these tensions depends on how it responds to them. That includes being realistic about the risks developers face, the tools it depends on, and the systems it interacts with. It also means accepting that decentralization comes with trade-offs that must be managed, not ignored.

Key Points

With its price down by 46% over the last three years, Ethereum (ETH 0.22%) now confronts yet another problem. While it certainly won't be alone, the possibility of devastation is ahead.

But where there's danger, there's often opportunity, and for Ethereum, this is likely one of those times. The new threat could enable Ethereum to reverse its fortunes.

As the cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector within cryptocurrency, Ethereum needs to have its users' trust. A big part of that trust is built on the security features of the chain. There's not much point in investing in a chain or developing an application there if your money can easily be liberated from your wallet by a hacker.

It isn't always possible for a chain's developers to foresee threats. But right now, one potentially severe threat in particular is getting a lot of attention.

You've probably heard of quantum computers, which may in the future be able to perform certain tasks like cryptographic codebreaking far more efficiently than the classic computers that we use every day. Therefore, there is also a risk that a future quantum computer might be powerful enough and its users sufficiently adept to crack the encryption used for blockchains like Ethereum's. Such attackers could steal vast sums of cryptocurrency and potentially destroy a blockchain's entire ecosystem overnight. This is one of the few things that could make Ethereum go to zero.

There is no risk of that happening today. It's also unclear precisely when or if quantum computing will become advanced enough to pose an immediate threat. Nonetheless, the issue is already on the radar of most of the core development teams of the largest cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum is no exception.

The Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit that is effectively the governance council of the chain, is investing in a research initiative with the mandate of making the chain secure via post-quantum cryptography (PQC), meaning cryptography resistant to threats from quantum computing. It is also in the process of considering whether to adopt a few other proposals for fortifying Ethereum against the quantum computing threat. While any implementation of those proposals is at least a few years away, the chain is far ahead of its competitors in its planning process.

Ethereum's early progress in preparing for quantum computing is important because it shows that security is a serious focus for the chain. But investors won't buy a coin based on the future security characteristics of its chain alone, and you shouldn't, either, at least not yet.

Make no mistake: Ethereum is currently the major chain that is among the least likely to fall victim to a quantum computing-based exploit, on the basis of its work in evaluating proposals and funding research into mitigation strategies. As (and if) the threat nears, that could make it more and more valuable. Eventually, it could make Ethereum a coin worth buying, especially if its competitors fail to keep up with its preparations for the future.

But the threat is still abstract. And investors shouldn't merely settle for discussion of risk mitigation measures; there's no real value in being added to the chain until it upgrades its tech. So keep an eye on Ethereum in the context of this issue.

If it stays ahead of the pack in preparing for quantum computing, that will be a bullish sign that Ethereum desperately needs right now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin To Continue Massively Outperforming Altcoins Until This Happens, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/04/18/bitcoin-to-continue-massively-outperforming-altcoins-until-this-happens-according-to-analyst-benjamin-cowen/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:05:01 GMT","

Analyst and trader Benjamin Cowen believes Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to continue outperforming altcoins.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 892,000 YouTube subscribers that the total market cap of altcoins (Total3) when paired against Bitcoin is going to continue on a downtrend.

Total3 is the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies with the exception of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH).

“…now altcoin/Bitcoin pairs are somewhat flat. I think they're probably going to spend the next few weeks dropping just like they did last year… “

Cowen further says that Bitcoin is likely to continue outperforming altcoins until the US monetary policy eases.

“My base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over…

… I'm bullish on Bitcoin dominance because quantitative tightening has not ended. If the Federal Reserve were to end quantitative tightening at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, then it's possible that my opinion would change.”

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of the total market capitalization of BTC relative to all other crypto assets. A rising Bitcoin dominance indicates that Bitcoin is either rising faster relative to other crypto assets or its decline is relatively muted compared to the rest of the digital asset market.

On when the Federal Reserve could ease the US monetary policy, Cowen says,

“Now, I don't know how long it's going to take them to end quantitative tightening, it's possible they end it this summer.”

Bitcoin is trading at $84,270 at time of writing.

Solana's memecoin activity has dropped over 80%, but its apps still lead in blockchain earnings.

Solana continues to top blockchain revenue charts, even as activity on its network drops sharply.

Data from Blockworks Research reveals that while memecoin activity on Solana has dropped by over 80% from its peak, the network's applications still account for more than 70% of all on-chain revenue across the ecosystem.

This trend is further supported by findings from Syndica, which reported that Solana-based decentralized applications (dApps) generated 46% of total on-chain revenue across all networks in March.

While Solana still holds the lion's share of on-chain earnings, its total network revenue has plunged more than 90% from the highs recorded in January. The current figures reflect a return to July 2024 levels, signaling a slowdown in network activity and user engagement.

The sharp decline is mainly tied to lower transaction fees. According to DeFiLlama data, Solana now collects under $5 million weekly fees, marking its weakest performance since September last year.

A key factor behind this decline is the collapse of several headline-grabbing memecoins, such as LIBRA, which was linked to key political figures and drove massive speculation on the blockchain network.

With the frenzy for these tokens fading, the blockchain's future revenue performance may depend on whether new apps and use cases can fill the gap left by memecoins.

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Meta Earth surpasses 1M users: Modular blockchain adoption accelerates globally","https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/meta-earth-surpasses-1m-users-modular-blockchain-adoption-accelerates-globally","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 11:02:48 GMT","



Zug, Switzerland — April 2025 — Meta Earth, a modular blockchain network natively integrated with a Decentralized Identity (DID) protocol, has surpassed 1 million ecosystem participants in just a few months, with over 670,000 KYC-verified users via its ME ID system.

As modular blockchains rapidly redefine the future of Web3 infrastructure, Meta Earth is positioning itself as one of the most promising next-generation networks, combining technical scalability with real-world economic utility.



With the ME Network now live and in testing, Meta Earth introduces a sustainable model of blockchain participation: every verified user receives one permanently staked MEC token (Meta Earth's native asset) and daily staking rewards, as well as additional incentives through referral and ambassador programs.

The unique implementation of Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) represents a step toward a more equitable digital economy — where verified users around the world benefit from daily on-chain earnings and ecosystem privileges.

Unlike many blockchain projects focused solely on speed or market speculation, Meta Earth is rooted in a broader vision: to build a digital infrastructure that promotes equality, sustainability, and happiness.

This mission stems from founder Patrick Oerer's decades of experience in finance and tech, having witnessed global economic inequality and systemic inefficiencies firsthand.

To realize this vision, Meta Earth Holding Group was established, securing a diversified portfolio across blockchain, AI, real estate, and investment. In 2023, the group launched Meta Earth Association in Switzerland to support institutional onboarding and regulatory alignment.

The organization plays a pivotal role in funding early-stage infrastructure, compliance efforts, and expansion strategies.

Central to Meta Earth's socio-economic vision is its ME ID Protocol — a privacy-preserving identity framework that uses homomorphic encryption to deliver KYC-compliant, self-sovereign digital identity. Verified users maintain full control over their personal data, selectively granting access to verified counterparties.

At the core of Meta Earth's architecture is a modular, horizontally scalable framework, composed of distinct execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability layers. This design dramatically improves throughput, scalability, and developer flexibility.

ME Network offers a comprehensive ME-SDK development suite, enabling modular Rollup deployment with seamless MBC (Multi-Blockchain Communication) integration. Developers can construct application-specific Rollups while maintaining interoperability across the broader Web3 ecosystem.

While traditional Layer 2 infrastructures suffer from centralized sequencers, single points of failure, and operational bottlenecks.

ME Network addresses these inefficiencies through a decentralized sequencer model, wherein nodes stake MEC tokens to participate in sequencer governance and transaction ordering. ME Network also enhances Optimistic Rollup's challenge window, integrating zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to reduce dispute resolution times from seven days to under three days, significantly improving latency and cost efficiency.

This comprehensive infrastructure makes Meta Earth technically differentiated and institutionally viable — ready for enterprise-level adoption and regulatory integration.

While many Web3 projects chase fast traction through airdrops and inflated wallet counts, Meta Earth has pursued authentic user adoption. To participate, users must verify their identity through ME ID, which prevents bot activity and fake accounts.

This has helped the project avoid the “ghost chain” syndrome seen in other ecosystems and maintain long-term sustainability.

As of April 2025, the Meta Earth network has:

Community expansion has been steady and user-driven, reinforced by product-level incentives and utility, rather than speculation. Verified users gain access to features like ME Pass, staking programs, referral bonuses, and participation in the decentralized sequencer network.

Meta Earth is not resting on its achievements but continues to advance according to a clear and structured roadmap. Official projections indicate that 2025 will be a pivotal year, with the team prioritizing the release of ME Network v2.0, the initiation of Rollup-chain testing, and the expansion of DeFi infrastructure.

This phase is expected to catalyze rapid ecosystem growth and yield substantial advancements.

Additionally, Meta Earth has launched a Global Ambassador Recruitment Program, which has already expanded to dozens of countries and regions, attracting a high-quality user base.

This steady and organic community expansion serves as a solid foundation for ME Network's future technological innovations and large-scale ecosystem development.

Meta Earth is now actively inviting users, developers, and organizations to join its growing ecosystem. Anyone can mint their ME ID, receive a staked MEC token, and begin earning daily rewards. The team regularly announces public testing opportunities, product updates, and community incentives through its official channels.

Meta Earth (ME) is based on a modular, high-performance, infinitely scalable multi-dimensional fusion underlying value network — ME Network, which supports the high-concurrency big data processing needs of traditional industrial applications. And through an encrypted DID (Decentralized Identifier) system — ME ID & ME Pass which can effectively protect user privacy data, and a co-construction & co-governance mechanism which can fully reflect personal sovereignty and equality for all, as well as an economic model which can guarantee UBI (Unconditional Basic Income) without any distinction, Meta Earth is fully dedicated to enhancing happiness for a better life and maintaining ecological balance to promote sustainability.

Non-fungible token sales on the BNB Smart Chain skyrocketed as investors show increased interest in the digital art sector.

Investors are showing strong interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with BNB Smart Chain (BSC) stealing the spotlight from Ethereum and Polygon.

According to data from CryptoSlam, the daily NFT sales volume increased by 66%, reaching $21.5 million. The rise comes with increased interest from buyers.





CryptoSlam data shows that the number of buyers rose by 9% to over 47,000, while the number of sellers declined by 11% to 27,500.

The daily sales on the BSC network increased by over 5,000% in the past 24 hours, reaching the top spot with $8.2 million in volume, marking a new all-time high for the first time since Jan. 29, 2024's $3.2 million ATH.

Polygon and Ethereum recorded $3.2 million and $2.8 million in NFT trading volume, respectively. This brings the total NFT sales volume on BSC to $480 million.

While the BSC blockchain took the spotlight, it's still far away from Ethereum's total $45.5 billion NFT sales volume.

The NFT sector has been struggling over the past three years with limited investor interest.

The positive sentiment around digital collectibles has been consistently fading away since May 1, 2022, when the daily NFT sales reached an ATH of roughly $580 million.

While there have been a few bounces over the years, the NFT space has been lacking a strong catalyst and real-world utility to drive strong growth and adoption.

The recent rise in BSC-based NFTs also brought a mild bullish sentiment to BNB

Key Takeaways

OM suffered a historic 90% crash in April 2025, wiping out over $5 billion in market cap within hours and triggering panic in the community.

Mantra DAO responded quickly with damage control measures: announcing a major token buyback and burn, launching a $108 million ecosystem fund, and hosting community calls to regain trust.

Short-term outlook remains bearish, with OM trading below $1 and strong resistance near $1.00. The token may retest lows around $0.35–$0.40 if no positive catalyst appears.

A 30–40% relief rally is possible if the team takes proactive steps or the broader market sentiment improves.

Once sell pressure subsides, OM could bounce sharply – similar to past cases like LUNA and FTT, before entering a new accumulation phase.

Mantra OM, the native token of the MANTRA DAO ecosystem, recently experienced a historic crash in April 2025, plunging over 90% in just a few hours. This event not only sent OM's price tumbling from multi-dollar highs to below $1 but also severely shook investor confidence in the project.

This article will provide a comprehensive analysis of the crash's impact, assess OM's price trends across short to medium-term timeframes, examine key influencing factors (overall market conditions, macroeconomic news, tokenomics, and the development team), and offer insights into the risks and investment opportunities surrounding OM at this critical juncture.

Around April 13–14, OM's price plummeted from ~$6.30 to below $0.50, wiping out over 90% of its market value overnight. OM's market cap collapsed from roughly $6 billion to under $700 million.

The crash drew immediate comparisons to the LUNA/UST meltdown of 2022, triggering widespread fear and speculative rumors. Rumors circulated that the team had sold off 90% of the total token supply, leading some traders to suspect an insider manipulation or rug pull.

In response to growing backlash, the Mantra DAO team moved quickly to reassure the community. John Patrick Mullin, Mantra's co-founder, denied any rug pull and stated that the drop was triggered by “forced liquidations” on a centralized exchange (CEX).

He explained that one exchange – unnamed but confirmed not to be Binance, unexpectedly froze and liquidated OM positions during a period of low market liquidity.

To restore confidence, the team announced a series of corrective measures. Mullin revealed a plan to buy back and burn a large amount of OM, reducing circulating supply. 

He also unveiled a $108 million ecosystem fund to support technology development, partnerships, and marketing.

These actions were considered an effort to “atone” and restore investor trust using the project's remaining resources. In addition, community calls were held to provide transparency around the incident and outline the recovery roadmap.

Still, the psychological damage from a 90% crash runs deep. A clear sign: even after the positive announcements, OM's price only saw a weak bounce and has continued to trade below $1.

The technical outlook for OM remains bearish. After hitting a bottom around $0.38–$0.50 during the major sell-off, OM briefly rebounded to the $0.80–$1.00 range, but was quickly sold off again. As of mid-April, the token is trading sideways between $0.60 and $0.80.

The $0.68–$0.70 zone is emerging as a short-term psychological support level, acting as a temporary “floor” following the crash.

However, $1.00 has now flipped into a strong resistance zone – previously a key support level, and OM has failed to reclaim it decisively, highlighting weak buying momentum.

Looking ahead over the next 1 – 4 weeks, downside risk remains elevated. If overall market sentiment does not improve, OM may retest its recent bottom near $0.35 – $0.40, which many technical indicators now flag as a potential breakdown zone.

There is also a risk that OM could dip further to around $0.32–$0.36 before finding strong buying interest. 

Conversely, OM may show signs of reduced selling pressure. At this stage, it's likely that the token will trade within a narrow range and gradually decline until the situation stabilizes.

In the medium term, OM is entering a critical “trust-testing” phase. A few months will be enough for the market to evaluate whether the project is genuinely delivering on its promises to recover.

The overall trend remains bearish to neutral until a clear reversal signal appears. On the weekly chart, trend indicators have turned negative: the Supertrend, which had shown a buy signal for several months, has now flipped to sell following the crash. Additionally, a death cross has formed between the long-term EMAs, with the EMA12 crossing below the EMA26 on the weekly timeframe.

Source: TradingView

These signals suggest that OM's medium-term trend remains weak. OM could slide further toward the $0.32 support zone.

However, given how fast OM has already dropped, a sideways accumulation phase may unfold in the coming weeks or months, as selling pressure gradually subsides. In that case, OM could trade within a narrower range, possibly between $0.50 and $1.00, as the market attempts to establish a new price floor.

In a more optimistic scenario, if strong demand re-emerges, OM could rally back to around $2.18, where it would encounter significant resistance.

On the fundamental side, the focus in this timeframe will be on execution. The community will closely monitor whether the Mantra team follows through with its token burn commitments and utilization of the $108 million ecosystem fund. If OM buybacks and burns begin in earnest within the next 3-6 months, it could help stabilize the price and gradually restore investor confidence.

Like LUNA or FTT, OM could bounce hard once sell pressure fades before a new accumulation phase. With the right catalyst or team action, OM could see a 30–40% rebound from current levels.

High-risk phase, but short-term rebounds possible if market calms or surprise catalysts appear.

The recent crash of Mantra (OM) was a painful event, but it doesn't necessarily mark the end of the project. If trust returns, OM could deliver outsized gains from its current fear-driven price level.

On the flip side, this remains a highly speculative investment, and losses could deepen if existing risks materialize. Therefore, investors should proceed with caution and closely monitor the team's next steps in the coming months.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","This spa's water is heated by bitcoin mining","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/18/1114464/bitcoin-mining-heat-spas-water-climate-warming/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Bitcoin enthusiasts are using a side effect of mining's immense computational load to heat hot tubs, office buildings, and homes.

At first glance, the Bathhouse spa in Brooklyn looks not so different from other high-end spas. What sets it apart is out of sight: a closet full of cryptocurrency-­mining computers that not only generate bitcoins but also heat the spa's pools, marble hammams, and showers. 

When cofounder Jason Goodman opened Bathhouse's first location in Williamsburg in 2019, he used conventional pool heaters. But after diving deep into the world of bitcoin, he realized he could fit cryptocurrency mining seamlessly into his business. That's because the process, where special computers (called miners) make trillions of guesses per second to try to land on the string of numbers that will earn a bitcoin, consumes tremendous amounts of electricity—which in turn produces plenty of heat that usually goes to waste. 

Cryptoscammers tried to trick me using fake profiles of tech personalities. I am not alone.

 “I thought, ‘That's interesting—we need heat,'” Goodman says of Bathhouse. Mining facilities typically use fans or water to cool their computers. And pools of water, of course, are a prominent feature of the spa. 

It takes six miners, each roughly the size of an Xbox One console, to maintain a hot tub at 104 °F. At Bathhouse's  Williamsburg location, miners hum away quietly inside two large tanks, tucked in a storage closet among liquor bottles and teas. To keep them cool and quiet, the units are immersed directly in non-conductive oil, which absorbs the heat they give off and is pumped through tubes beneath Bathhouse's hot tubs and hammams. 

Mining boilers, which cool the computers by pumping in cold water that comes back out at 170 °F, are now also being used at the site. A thermal battery stores excess heat for future use. 

Goodman says his spas aren't saving energy by using bitcoin miners for heat, but they're also not using any more than they would with conventional water heating. “I'm just inserting miners into that chain,” he says. 

Goodman isn't the only one to see the potential in heating with crypto. In Finland, Marathon Digital Holdings turned fleets of bitcoin miners into a district heating system to warm the homes of 80,000 residents. HeatCore, an integrated energy service provider, has used bitcoin mining to heat a commercial office building in China and to keep pools at a constant temperature for fish farming. This year it will begin a pilot project to heat seawater for desalination. On a smaller scale, bitcoin fans who also want some extra warmth can buy miners that double as space heaters. 

Crypto enthusiasts like Goodman think much more of this is coming—especially under the Trump administration, which has announced plans to create a bitcoin reserve. This prospect alarms environmentalists. 

The energy required for a single bitcoin transaction varies, but as of mid-March it was equivalent to the energy consumed by an average US household over 47.2 days, according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, run by the economist Alex de Vries. 

Survivors reveal how criminal syndicates use Big Tech to recruit and trap people into operating “pig butchering” scams—and then use the same platforms to steal billions of dollars from targets all over the world.

Among the various cryptocurrencies, bitcoin mining gobbles up the most energy by far. De Vries points out that others, like ethereum, have eliminated mining and implemented less energy-­intensive algorithms. But bitcoin users resist any change to their currency, so de Vries is doubtful a shift away from mining will happen anytime soon. 

One key barrier to using bitcoin for heating, de Vries says, is that the heat can only be transported short distances before it dissipates. “I see this as something that is extremely niche,” he says. “It's just not competitive, and you can't make it work at a large scale.” 

The more renewable sources that are added to electric grids to replace fossil fuels, the cleaner crypto mining will become. But even if bitcoin is powered by renewable energy, “that doesn't make it sustainable,” says Kaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment, and Health. Mining burns through valuable resources that could otherwise be used to meet existing energy needs, Madani says. 

For Goodman, relaxing into bitcoin-heated water is a completely justifiable use of energy. It soothes the muscles, calms the mind, and challenges current economic structures, all at the same time.

According to Minister Thang, Vietnam ranks third globally in the number of participating investors in cryptoasset trading. Underground and unofficial transactions, outside of state oversight, pose a significant risk to investors, so a robust legal framework is essential for effective regulation.

The government assigned the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to preside over and work with relevant agencies to build the legal framework for cryptoasset transactions. The MoF will submit to the government a resolution in early May to pilot the implementation of a cryptoasset trading platform in the country to control risks and test the legal corridor so that businesses and investors can be transparent and safe in all transactions.

""This mechanism also helps to utilise resources from cryptoassets to develop the digital economy in Vietnam,"" the minister said.

Bybit is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2018 in Dubai. It is also the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world after Binance, and is licensed to operate in many countries around the world.

""Vietnam has great potential to develop a cryptoasset market,"" co-founder Zhou said. ""Once a legal framework is established, a well-regulated exchange can bring many positives.""

Zhou is interested in a sandbox model that is a safe and simulated environment to test trading features. He has proposed working closely with the MoF to assist in the process of drafting the legal framework, as well as providing technical support.

""Vietnam has many blockchain technology developers, but Bybit has experience building anti-money laundering control systems, along with tools and partnerships with major global organisations, allowing full transaction tracking to prevent illegal money flows. This means Bybit is well-positioned to help Vietnam develop proper legal processes for cryptoasset transactions,"" he added.

Minister Thang expressed his appreciation of Bybit's offer of support and assigned the State Securities Commission to work with the company to firm up its proposals.

The Ministry of Finance is assisting enterprises in practising environmental, social, and governance considerations in order to improve their competitiveness.

Minister of Finance Nguyen Van Thang received Scott Morris, vice president for East and Southeast Asia, and the Pacific of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on April 15 to discuss how to improve the efficiency of loan use.

Recognising cryptocurrency and building a comprehensive legal system will not only help Vietnam access foreign currency but also create an alluring environment for domestic businesses.

Vietnam's digital transformation, coupled with its strong economic growth and significant investments in the financial sector and fintech ecosystem, enabled significant retail adoption in the cryptocurrency investment market. In 2024, Vietnam ranked fifth among the top 20 nations for crypto adoption by Chainalysis, with millions of users and a thriving blockchain ecosystem.

The best crypto to buy now might not always be tied to headlines, but smart investors know headlines can shift markets. As talk of a trade war softening gains ground, especially with Big Tech getting a pass, risk appetite is starting to return. That ripple effect is spilling into crypto, where altcoins are once again gaining traction. Here's three worth considering.  

Even as the broader market gave back some of Wednesday's historic rally, with the S&P 500 down over 3% and major crypto tokens like Bitcoin and Ether dropping 3% and 8% respectively, investor sentiment remains resilient. 

One rising pick is Dawgz AI, a low-cap project blending AI tools with meme-powered momentum, quietly building while the macro dust settles. As larger tokens wobble, such projects may benefit from renewed interest in innovative, early-stage altcoins.

Crypto may be decentralized, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Global events – from trade policies to economic sanctions still impact investor behavior. When things get hairy, riskier assets like altcoins tend to cool off. But when things settle or get better, confidence can come back fast. That's why global headlines still matter. Whether it's interest rate changes or trade agreements between China and the US, these events impact how people move their money – and crypto is often the first place it flows when sentiment turns bullish.



The recent exemption granted to major US tech firms in the ongoing trade talks is more than just a policy update – it's a signal. It means tensions between global powers may be easing or at least cooling off for now. That kind of shift tends to open the door for broader market optimism. When Big Tech breathes easy, so do investors. This usually triggers a “risk on” mood – where capital flows into growth assets like tech stocks and crypto. Altcoins, especially early stage projects could benefit from this renewed appetite for higher reward plays as the market looks forward.

With global markets turning a corner and crypto confidence creeping back, here are three coins making early moves worth paying attention to.

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is an ERC-20 token project that merges the viral appeal of meme culture with real utility through advanced AI-driven trading algorithms. Designed to operate on the Ethereum blockchain, the project leverages proprietary blackbox AI systems developed by Wall Street veterans to generate optimal trading yields. With a strong emphasis on community engagement, staking incentives, and a fully audited smart contract, Dawgz AI aims to set a new standard in the memecoin space—one where entertainment, innovation, and financial technology intersect. Currently in presale at $0.004 and with over $3.2 million already raised, Dawgz AI positions itself not merely as a meme, but as a utility-driven asset with long-term growth potential.



Here's what's making Dawgz AI more than just another presale coin:

If you're looking for a more in-depth overview of Dawgz AI, you can check the video below by the crypto enthusiast ClayBro.

Dogwifhat might've already had its viral moment, but this pup's story isn't over. Trading at $0.38 with a $381M market cap, WIF exploded from a meme into a cultural icon. 

WIF Price source: Brave New Coin Market Cap Data

It hit an all-time high of $4.85 just a few months ago, and despite a big pullback, its community is still strong and the trading volume is high. With over 218K followers and meme coin mania still alive, WIF could easily fire back up as retail interest returns.

Here is a quick look at the numbers that matter:

Popcat isn't just riding the Solana wave, it's helping power it. Priced at $0.24 with a market cap of $235.57 million, Popcat became a meme coin rocket, exploding from nearly nothing to over $2.07 in just months. 

POPCAT price source: Brave New Coin Market Cap Data

While it's pulled back since, the POPCAT community is still massive, and it remains one of Solana's most recognizable meme plays. As meme coins continue to attract retail energy, Popcat could be a top comeback contender.

Here's what the numbers are saying:

When market sentiment flips from cautious to optimistic, Bitcoin usually leads, but altcoins move faster. That's because smaller-cap tokens are more volatile by nature, and it takes less volume to move them. 

As a result, when confidence returns, altcoins often outperform in percentage gains. This is why traders looking for sharper upside often start eyeing early-stage or under-the-radar coins. Tokens that are still in presale are exactly the kind of projects that can benefit most when the market turns risk-on.

The best crypto to buy is often the one gaining quiet traction while the market shifts in the background.  With trade tensions easing and investor appetite returning, altcoins are starting to pop again.  While the big names have stayed steady, early movers like Dawgz AI are getting noticed for their timing, features, and potential upside.

Welcome to your Good Friday edition of the daybook. With markets on a shortened schedule for the Easter holiday, today's update is shortened as well. CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas will be back to its regular size on Monday, April 21. Enjoy the holiday!

By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

It's Easter. Traditional markets are closed in many parts of the world and plenty of people are taking a break from work, and that's keeping crypto markets in check as well. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the biggest, most active cryptocurrencies, has gained less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours with bitcoin (BTC) up just 0.1%.

That's a pretty muted response to calls from President Donald Trump for the removal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump criticized Powell over his reluctance to cut interest rates, further adding to the economy uncertainty that has left bitcoin treading water and seen Wall Street piling onto gold.

Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, said Powell was “too late” in lowering interest rates, saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” The President's words come after Powell said the central bank sees unemployment and inflation rising because of the tariffs Trump imposed on most other countries.

The tit-for-tat has further raised uncertainty, to the point the S&P 500 closed the shortened trading week up just 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.1%.

""Right now, markets are extremely reactionary to White House decision making and are poised to remain that way for the foreseeable future,” Ira Auerbach, head of tandem at Offchain Labs and former head of digital assets as Nasdaq, told CoinDesk.

“Trump's push for rate cuts amid tariff-driven inflation risks could reignite bitcoin's original 'hedge against eroding purchasing power' narrative. Its recent risk-off behavior may be short-lived as monetary policy uncertainty intensifies.""

For the time being, though, the hedge against currency debasement and uncertainty appears to be gold. The precious metal's recent bull run has meant that, over the last 20 years, it's outperforming the S&P 500. That's including dividends.

For crypto investors, signals are mixed. While on the macro front uncertainty reigns, under the Trump administration regulatory outlook has been improving and institutions have shown more comfort with the space.

“It is probably sound to 'let the dust settle' as tariff implementations and bilateral negotiations unfold,” dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d'Haussy told CoinDesk. “Market participants' consensus seems to signal central banks' action past the summer.” Stay alert!

HashKey Capital announced what it says is the first investment fund in Asia designed to track the performance of XRP, the digital asset used in Ripple's global payment infrastructure.

The new fund, called the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund, will be open to professional investors and will allow exposure to XRP without the need to manage the asset directly. It will offer the ability to buy through cash and in-kind subscriptions, and offers monthly liquidity.

Ripple will be an early backer of the fund. The investment deepens its strategic ties with HashKey, which already has Hong Kong-listed spot ETFs for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

The company will continue to partner with Ripple on additional financial products, Vivien Wong, a partner at HashKey Capital, said in a statement. One possibility includes tokenizing a money market fund on the XRP Ledger.

Ripple's Asia-Pacific managing director Fiona Murray said the partnership with HashKey is part of a broader push to bring more regulated crypto products to institutions in the region.

 The Synthetix team told Cointelegraph it has short, medium and long-term plans to mitigate risks as its sUSD stablecoin remains depegged. 

The Synthetix protocol's native stablecoin, Synthetix USD (SUSD), has slipped further away from its US dollar peg, reaching new all-time lows under $0.70. 

However, the firm reiterates that this isn't the first time the asset has been under significant stress, and several risk measures are in place.

“Synthetix and sUSD have weathered multiple bear markets and periods of stablecoin volatility; this is not the first resilience test,” a spokesperson from Synthetix told Cointelegraph.

sUSD is a crypto-collateralized stablecoin. Users lock up SNX tokens to mint sUSD, making its stability highly dependent on the market value of Synthetix (SNX). 

At the time of publication, sUSD (SUSD) is trading at $0.70, 30% below its intended 1:1 peg with the US dollar, according to CoinMarketCap data.

During the same period, SNX has held relatively steady, dipping just 1.08% over the past week, trading at $0.63. However, from a broader view of the overall crypto market downturn, SNX has fallen approximately 26% over the past 30 days.

The spokesperson explained that sUSD's short-term volatility is driven by “structural shifts” after the SIP-420 launch, a proposal that shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself. 

They explained that the firm has short, medium, and long-term plans to mitigate the risks.

In the short term, Synthetix said it will continue supporting liquidity for sUSD through Curve pools and deposit campaigns on its derivatives platform, Infinex.

For mid-term measures, Synthetix has introduced “simple debt-free” SNX staking that it says will “encourage individual debt repayment.”

Over the long term, the firm says it will make capital efficiency changes through the 420 Pool, take over protocol-level management of sUSD supply, and introduce new “adoption-focused mechanisms” across Synthetix products.

Synthetix founder Kain Warwick explained on April 2 that the volatility is largely due to the primary driver of sUSD buying having been removed. “New mechanisms are being introduced, but in this transition, there will be some volatility,” Warwick said in an X post.

“It is worth pointing out that sUSD is not an algo stable, it is a pure crypto collateralized stable, the peg can and does drift, but there are mechanisms to push it back in line if it goes above or below the peg,” he added.

On April 10, Cointelegraph reported that the asset has faced persistent instability since the start of 2025. On Jan. 1, sUSD dropped to $0.96 and only rebounded to $0.99 in early February. Prices continued to fluctuate through February before stabilizing in March.

 BTC bought between three and six months ago and moving onchain has spiked. It is a classic precursor to ""significant"" volatility, the latest analysis says. 

Bitcoin (BTC) speculators may spark “significant” BTC price volatility as a large tranche of coins moves onchain.

In one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on April 18, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant warned that a Bitcoin market shake-up is due.

Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) are signaling that the current calm BTC price behavior may not last long.

CryptoQuant reveals that 170,000 BTC owned by entities with a purchase date between three and six months ago has begun to circulate.

“Around 170,000 BTC are moving from the 3–6 month holder cohort,” contributor Mignolet confirmed. 

An accompanying chart shows the impact of previous STH events, with the latest being the largest by volume since late 2021. Price direction varies, with both upward and downward market responses visible.

“Volatility is coming,” Mignolet concluded.

As Cointelegraph reported, STH entities are notoriously sensitive to snap market moves and transitive narratives.

Recent BTC price downside has been met with episodes of panic selling by the cohort, which is defined as an entity buying up to six months previously.

Earlier this week, CryptoQuant listed STHs as one of the main sources of current Bitcoin selling pressure.

“Short-Term Holders (STH) have been the primary sellers, sending an average of ~930 BTC/day to exchanges,” fellow contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a separate Quicktake post. 

Crazzyblockk described a “classic shakeout” occurring in Bitcoin, while allaying concerns over a uniform rush for the exit across the investor spectrum.

“With Bitcoin trading sideways and volatility compressing, this cohort-driven breakdown helps us understand that the current correction is not a mass exodus by smart money — it's more likely a reaction from nervous short-term and mid-tier holders,” the post said.

 Bitcoin ETF holders having “stronger hands” will lower Bitcoin's volatility over the long term, says an analyst. 

Bitcoin's relatively stable price movements despite macroeconomic uncertainty is likely due to resilient spot Bitcoin ETF holders and Michael Saylor's firm continuing to buy aggressively, according to a Bloomberg analyst.

“The ETFs and Saylor have been buying up all ‘dumps' from the tourists, FTX refugees, GBTC discounters, legal unlocks, govt confiscations and Lord knows who else,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 16 X post.

Balchunas pointed out that spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs have attracted $131.04 million over the past 30 days and are up $2.4 billion since Jan. 1. Balchunas called this “impressive,” noting it helps explain why Bitcoin has “been relatively stable.”

“Its owners are more stable,” Balchunas said. Balchunas said Bitcoin ETF investors have “much stronger hands than most people think.” He said this “should” increase the stability and lower Bitcoin's volatility and correlation in the long term. 

Saylor's firm, Strategy, made its latest Bitcoin purchase on April 14, acquiring 3,459 BTC for $285.5 million at an average price of $82,618 per coin. According to Saylor Tracker, Strategy holds 531,644 Bitcoin at the time of publication.

The Bitcoin Volatility Index, which measures Bitcoin's volatility over the previous 30 days, is at 1.80% at the time of publication, according to Bitbo data. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,610, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin has traded between $75,000 and $88,000 amid macroeconomic uncertainty primarily driven by US President Donald Trump's imposed tariffs and ongoing questions about the future of US interest rates. 

Despite this, Bitcoin has remained above its previous all-time high of $73,679, first surpassed in November.

Participants in the broader financial market have also expressed surprise at Bitcoin's relative strength in recent times, particularly in comparison to the S&P 500.

Stock market commentator Dividend Hero told his 203,200 X followers on April 5, after Trump's “Liberation Day,” that he has “hated on Bitcoin in the past, but seeing it not tank while the stock market does is very interesting to me.”

 The new proposal allows validators to vote on multiple deflation rates and uses the weighted average as the outcome. 

Crypto research firm Galaxy Research has made a proposal to adjust the voting system that decides the outcome of future Solana inflation following the failure to come to a consensus in a previous vote.

On April 17, Galaxy introduced a Solana proposal called “Multiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation” (MESA) to reduce the inflation rate of its native token, SOL (SOL). The researchers described the proposal as a “more market-based approach to agreeing on the rate of future SOL emissions.”

Rather than using traditional yes/no voting for inflation rates, MESA allows validators to vote on multiple deflation rates and uses the weighted average as the outcome.

“Instead of cycling through inflation reduction proposals until one passes, what if validators could allocate their votes to one or many changes, with the aggregate of ‘yes' outcomes becoming the adopted emissions curve?” Galaxy explained.  

The motivation for the concept comes from a previous proposal (SIMD-228), which showed community agreement that SOL inflation should be reduced, but the binary voting system couldn't find consensus on specific parameters. 

SIMD-228 proposed to change Solana's inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. 

The new proposal suggests maintaining the fixed, terminal inflation rate at 1.5% and sets forth multiple outcomes that create multiple ‘yes' voting options with different deflation rates from which an average is aggregated if a quorum is reached. 

For example, if 5% vote for no change, remaining at 15% deflation, 50% vote for a 30% deflation rate, and 45% vote for 33%, the new deflation rate would be calculated as the aggregate at 30.6%. The target is to reach the terminal rate of 1.5% supply inflation. 

The benefits are that a more market-driven system allows validators to express preferences along a spectrum rather than with binary choices, while maintaining predictability with a fixed inflation curve.

“Galaxy Research seeks to suggest a genuinely alternative process to achieving what we believe is the community's broad goal, and not necessarily proscribe any particular inflation rate outcome,” the firm explained.

Under the current mechanism, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%. Solana's current inflation rate is 4.6%, and 64.7% of the total supply, or 387 million SOL, is currently staked, according to Solana Compass.

 HashKey Capital has launched Asia's first XRP Tracker Fund with early investment from Ripple, aiming to convert it into an ETF. 

Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm HashKey Capital announced the launch of an XRP fund, with plans to convert it into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the future.

According to an April 18 announcement, the fund, officially titled the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund, is reportedly “the first investment fund in Asia designed to track the performance of XRP.”

XRP developer Ripple will serve as the fund's anchor investor. In a separate X post, HashKey Capital said the fund aims to bring “more institutional capital into regulated XRP products and the broader digital asset ecosystem.”

In another X post, HashKey Capital said the fund marks the beginning of a closer collaboration with Ripple. The two firms “are exploring new investment products, cross-border DeFi solutions, and tokenization —including the possibility of launching a money market fund (MMF) on the XRP ledger.”

Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, a crypto investment firm based in Asia, told Cointelegraph that “the launch of the XRP Tracker Fund by HashKey Capital marks a pivotal moment for institutional adoption” in the region. He said regulated and transparent products like Hashkey's fund are what institutional investors need to enter the market. 

“XRP's proven use case in cross-border payments, combined with HashKey's robust infrastructure, sets the stage for meaningful capital inflows and wider acceptance of crypto assets in global finance,“ Huang said.

NASA's Next Major Space Telescope Is Ready to Launch. Trump Wants to Kill It and Other Vital Science

Amid harsh cuts, the Trump administration has proposed canceling the nearly ready-to-launch Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope

By Nadia Drake edited by Dan Vergano

The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope is designed to observe hundreds of millions of galaxies and thousands of supernovas to investigate dark energy and the universe's accelerated expansion.

GSFC/SVS

Technicians at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center are nearing the finish line on the space agency's newest flagship astrophysics mission. Called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the eagerly awaited $3.5-billion observatory could solve the secrets of the dark universe, spot untold undiscovered worlds and light the way toward finding alien life. It only awaits final integration and testing, a short hop down to Cape Canaveral, Fla., and a longer journey to a sun-circling orbit near the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In a triumph for NASA, reliable sources say that Roman could launch as early as the fall of 2026, well ahead of its May 2027 target and potentially under budget.

But a leaked draft of the president's 2026 budget request, which Scientific American has reviewed, instead calls for canceling Roman.

“This is nuts. You've built it, and you're not going to do the final step to finish it?” says astrophysicist David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation and former co-chair of Roman's science team. “That is such a waste of taxpayers' money.”

Roman isn't the only casualty in the president's draft NASA budget, which is still in flux and will ultimately require congressional approval. The proposal cuts heavily into the $25-billion space agency's science division, home to missions that include JWST, the twin Voyager probes, the Hubble Space Telescope and a fleet of Mars rovers that have colored in our understanding of the cosmos and captured imaginations worldwide for half a century.

The draft budget includes an almost 50 percent cut to heliophysics, which studies the sun and space weather, reducing it to $455 million; a more than 50 percent reduction in Earth science funding, which includes climate monitoring, taking it down to roughly $1 billion; and a 30 percent cut to planetary science and solar system exploration, resulting in $1.9 billion. The last cut kills the upcoming DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission to Venus and NASA's beleaguered mission to bring rocks back from Mars. Notably, the document also cleaves off two thirds of the funding for NASA's astrophysics division, which studies stars, galaxies and cosmology, dropping it to $487 million and specifying that “no funding is provided” for telescopes other than JWST and Hubble.

Space policy observers expressed dismay at the budget cuts, particularly at the notion of throwing away a flagship space telescope. “This is a wholly unserious budget proposal,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking member of the spending committee for NASA, in a recent statement.

Privately, space policy experts have been even less charitable about the proposal: “It sets back a program that is clearly the leading program in the world—in a historic fashion,” says a former government official, speaking to Scientific American on condition of anonymity because of concerns about retaliation. “You take that program and shoot it through the head.”

NASA has refrained from saying much publicly. A spokesperson for the agency has only issued a statement that it has the draft “and has begun the deliberative process.” (The White House has not responded to requests for comment.) The agency received the draft on April 10, one day after Jared Isaacman, President Donald Trump's nominee for NASA administrator, insisted in his nomination hearing that the U.S. could send humans to the moon and Mars and “do all the other things” with NASA's current budget. “I do believe the president is looking to usher in the golden age of science and discovery,” Isaacman said. Now observers suggest that instead of ushering in that golden age, the Trump administration simply seems to be trading in the entire universe.

“If you want to take the most successful fleet of missions ever built, and the leadership that accompanies that fleet, and throw that all away, this is the budget to do it,” says another senior space scientist, speaking anonymously because of concerns about budgetary retribution from the Trump administration. “This budget is like, ‘Here is a shit sandwich with no side of pickle.' You don't even get the plate!”

This isn't the first time Trump's White House has tried to zero out Roman—it's the fourth. But in each previous instance Congress kept the program alive. Observers are hopeful that lawmakers will again rescue the telescope because space science has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.

In 2020 NASA named the project, which until then had been called the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), after Nancy Grace Roman, an astronomer who played a pivotal role in developing Hubble. The Roman telescope has been ranked as a top priority in astrophysics since a National Academy of Sciences review in 2010—a status that was only bolstered two years later, when the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which builds and operates spy satellites, donated two large, unused mirrors and associated optics to the mission.

Designed to survey our own planet, the NRO's 2.4-meter-wide mirrors match Hubble's in size. But they have a shorter focal length that makes them better suited for doing wide-field imaging surveys that monitor millions of stars and take broad looks at exploding stars, early galaxies and large-scale cosmological structures. “Every Hubble image you see—make it 100 times bigger,” Spergel says. “It's like 200 Hubbles. We will survey the entire sky, with Hubble-quality images.”

The project was initially overbudget, but after a hefty course correction, the team is on track to deliver Roman ahead of its planned 2027 launch—and, if so, below cost. That comes on the heels of repeated criticism from federal and congressional watchdogs over price tags and schedule overruns for large space agency missions in the past two decades.

“The team should be given an award, not beat up!” says the former government official. “This is what we want. This is exactly what we want to achieve.”

Like JWST, Roman sees the universe in infrared light—which means that it can spot very old, very faraway objects whose light has stretched into longer, redder infrared wavelengths as it has traversed the expanse. One of the mission's primary scientific goals is to gather the multitude of observations we need to understand dark energy, the mysterious force that is causing the universe to balloon outward.

“Roman has the sensitivity we need to understand what's going on with the 70 percent of the universe that we don't understand, which is dark energy,” Spergel says.

Crucially, recent results from other surveys suggest that this still mysterious dark energy, whose force is seemingly pushing galaxies apart at an accelerating rate, might surprisingly weaken over time. And Roman is designed to be complementary to the European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, which makes similar observations at visible wavelengths, and the U.S.'s powerful, ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is coming online later this year in Chile. “These are not missions that do the same thing,” says Henk Hoekstra, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies dark energy. “We have this strange universe—would you trust a single result and build our whole understanding of the universe on just this one measurement?” Another Roman instrument—a starlight-blocking coronagraph—is a key prototype for NASA's next major astrophysics flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory. That space telescope will look for signs of life in the atmospheres of faraway, habitable planets. Zeroing out Roman would mean losing all the information we'd get from that tech demo. And observers say the cut would also erode current and future astrophysics. Plus, pulling the plug on Roman would not only erode expertise; it would also damage international collaborations. For those to work, Hoekstra says, international partners need to trust that “people can't just suddenly turn off the tap and say, ‘We're not going to do this.'”

Many of the budget's proposed cancellations do exactly that.

“Why do we even plan on doing great things if, on a whim, we can just decide ‘nah'?” the senior space scientist says. “These things take a generation to build and enable multiple generations of scientists. They should not be blithely thrown away.”

Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.

Atomically engineered heterostructures of strongly correlated oxides have enabled the rational design of emergent interfacial magnetic and electric properties not present in the constituting layer1,2,3. The most prominent examples are the two-dimensional (2D) electron gas formed at the interface between two band-gap insulators4,5, superconducting interfaces between non-superconducting cuprates6, and the ferromagnetism between two antiferromagnetic materials7. Among the magnetically ordered materials, including ferromagnetic (FM), ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic (AFM), FM and ferrimagnetic materials have significant technological importance in diverse applications, such as permanent magnets, microwave devices, sensors, magnetic recording, and memory media8. Magnetic interfaces, particularly those based on perovskite oxides, ABO3, are of similar technological importance, but the interface-induced changes to electronic structure, orbital occupancy, and charge redistribution in addition to metal–oxygen band hybridization often lead to magnetic exchange interactions across B–O–B bonds different from those of the bulk9,10,11. Notably, although the charge transfer and the emerging functionalities at oxide heterointerfaces have been intensively investigated for early transition metal oxides9,11,12,13,14, the charge transfer across heterostructures consisting of two late transitional metal oxides remains less investigated10,15,16,17. Research is extremely limited for cases where the thickness of the component for the heterointerface or the superlattice is precisely controlled down to a single unit cell (uc) of the perovskite oxide (~0.4 nm)18,19.

Rare-earth nickelate RNiO3 (with R = rare-earth) is a typical family of late transition metal oxides, which have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their remarkable properties including sharp metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) tunable with the R radius19,20,21 as well as the emergency of superconductivity in the infinitely layered Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films22. LaNiO3 (LNO) is the only member of the rare earth perovskite RNiO3 that is a Pauli paramagnetic (PM) metal with no signature of MIT or magnetic order at any temperature. Electronically, LNO is a charge transfer metal with strong hybridization between Ni 3d and oxygen 2p states, where the electronic configuration can be described as a superposition form \(|\psi \rangle=\alpha |3{d}^{7}\rangle+\beta |3{d}^{8}\underline{L}\rangle\) (\(\underline{L}\) denotes a ligand hole on the oxygen ion)23. The system shows partial covalence, and the degree of covalence is given by the ratio between β2 and α2 (α2 + β2 = 1). The hybridization between the 3d band and the oxygen 2p band results in the formation of oxygen holes and a small or negative charge transfer gap21, which are key features of high-temperature superconducting cuprates24. Therefore, strain-engineered thin films or multilayers based on nickelates have been intensively investigated to explore electronic structures that would mimic those of cuprate parent materials25, which prefer AFM order. Moreover, the low-lying Ni 3d bands of LNO with partial filling make it prone to electron acceptors. Notably, ferromagnetic-like behavior has been reported in the paramagnetic LNO layer when it is interfaced with another ferromagnetic layer of LaMnO3 thin films15,16 or a ferrimagnetic layer of GdTiO311. But most of such charge-transfer-induced ferromagnetism shows Curie temperature below room temperature.

In this manuscript, we report a charge transfer-induced ferromagnetism in the heterostructure of LaFeO3/LaNiO3 (LFO/LNO) (Fig. 1a), where LFO is a G-type AFM insulator (Fig. 1b) as electron donor, the amount of the transferred charge is controlled by the thickness of LNO on the scale of 1 uc. In the extreme limit of the single superlattice (SL) stacking periodicity (periodic lattice, p.l.) consisting of one unit cell (uc) pseudo-cubic LNO and one unit cell pseudo-cubic LFO, similar to the theoretically predicted double perovskite (DP) La2NiFeO626, the SL shows not only a high magnetization of 4 μB/p.l., but also a high Curie temperature of 608 K. The emergent properties are not observed either in the constituting materials (LFO and LNO) or the mixed compound LaFe0.5Ni0.5O327, which could result from the formation of an emergent DP phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations along the (001) orientation. The ability to affect interfacial charge transfer and the Ni 3d–O 2p covalency thus the Ni 3d–O 2p–Fe 3d exchange interactions through a precisely controlled approach, not realizable by conventional processing techniques, suggests a new avenue to realizing FM materials.

a The sketch of the SL structure where the thickness of paramagnetic LNO, n, was varied from n = 1 to 5 uc, while the G-AFM LFO layer was set to 1 uc. b The illustration for magnetic structures of G-AFM, paramagnetic (PM), and FM coupling. c and d The cross-sectional STEM HAADF images of the LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 SL, respectively, were recorded along the [100] zone axis. e The EELS maps obtained from the analysis of the La M4,5 (left) and Fe L2,3 (right) signals reveal the epitaxial growth of the periodic structure and cation intermixing confined within 1–2 uc of LFO (within 1 p.l. of the SL).

We have grown LNOn/LFOm superlattices (SLs) by alternately stacking LNO and LFO layers using pulsed laser deposition on SrTiO3 (STO) (001) substrates (see the “Methods” section), where n and m represent the layer thickness of LNO and LFO in pseudo-cubic uc, respectively. Here n was varied from n = 1 to 5 uc, while the LFO layer was set to 1 uc thick. The LNOn/LFO1 bilayer was repeated 10–20 times to form the SL. The SL growth was monitored in-situ by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Streaked RHEED patterns with clear intensity oscillations were observed during the growth of both LNO and LFO films, implying a 2D layer-by-layer film growth mode (Supplementary Fig. S1). The epitaxial growth of the high-quality LNOn/LFO1 SLs was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction experiments and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Notably, although clear Laue fringes are visible for all the SLs from high-resolution XRD θ–2θ scans (Supplementary Fig. S2) due to their atomically smooth surfaces as confirmed by atomic force microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3), the satellite peaks indicating the chemically modulated structure with well-defined interfaces were only visible for n ≥ 3, consistent with the previous results on similar structure17. Moreover, for n ≤ 3, the SL is under compressive strain with c ≥ 3.905 Å. While as n > 3, the SL is under tensile strain. Such decrease of out of plane c with increasing n is consistent with the smaller lattice constant of LNO compared to LFO (LFO is orthorhombic with a pseudo-cubic lattice constant a0 = 3.93 Å17, and LNO is rhombohedral with pseudo-cubic a0 = 3.838 Å). Figure 1c and d show the atomically resolved high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image of the cross-section of the LNO1/LFO1 SL and LNO4/LFO1 SL samples, respectively, recorded along the [100] zone axis. As the intensity of HAADF-STEM images is sensitive to atomic number (Z), both SLs show coherent epitaxial lattice as demonstrated by the brightest sublattice of the La ions. No dislocations, defects, or any nano-scale phase-separated microstructures such as Fe or Ni metal clusters were observed. The compositional electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) maps obtained from the analysis of the La M4,5 (Fig. 1e left), Fe L2,3 (Fig. 1e right), and Ni L2,3 signals reveal the epitaxial growth of the periodic layered structure, which is flat and continuous over long lateral distances. Cation intermixing of Fe and Ni ions when occurs is found to be confined within 1–2 uc of LFO (within 1 p.l. of the SL). Shortly, high-quality LNOn/LFO1 superlattices with layered ordering of configurations for Fe and Ni cations are successfully fabricated.

LNO is a paramagnetic metal, and LFO is a G-type AFM insulator with intralayer antiparallel spin alignments, which shows one of the highest ordering temperatures of perovskite oxide (TN ≈ 740 K). Remarkably, when they were epitaxially grown along the (001) directions but absent for the (110) and (111) directions (Supplementary Fig. S4), the LNOn/LFO1 SLs show strong signatures of ferromagnetism, which depends critically on the stacking thickness, n, of LNO. Figure 2a shows the hysteresis curves of the LNOn/LFO1 SLs measured at 300 K, i.e. the dependence of the magnetization (M) as a function of the magnetic field B, which is saturated under the applied field above 3.5 kOe. All samples exhibited key characteristics of FM behavior, including hysteresis and remnant magnetization. At n = 5, the SL shows weak saturation ferromagnetism similar to LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 thin films. Remarkably, as n decreases, the highest saturation magnetization increases significantly, reaching 252.8 emu/cm3 for n = 1, ~4.0 μB/p.l., comparable to the 4.96 μB/f.u. (f.u. = formula unit) for the FM DP La2NiMnO628, and much larger than that of the LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 thin films (Fig. 2b). Figure 2c shows the temperature dependence of magnetization (M–T curve) for the typical LNOn/LFO1 (n = 1, 3 and 5) SL samples in addition to the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 film. The Curie temperature, TC, could be determined based on the minimum value of the temperature coefficient TCM, defined as TCM = 1/M(dM/dT). Remarkably, all the SL samples show a TC much higher than room temperature, around TC = 608, 589, and 419 K, respectively, for n = 1, 3, and 5. It is also noteworthy that the LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 film shows a TC = 109 K, much lower than those of the SL but higher than the bulk spin glassy temperature of 83 K27. The results strongly suggest that a unique FM order is accessed in the SLs structures with the strongest magnetism obtained at n = 1, an emergent La2NiFeO6 DP structure with B-site layered ordering configuration along (001) direction. As illustrated in Table 1 its TC is close to the highest value (TC = 625 K) reported for Sr2CrReO6 among the DP compounds29. The temperature-dependent resistivity, ρ, of the LNOn/LFO1 (n = 1, 3 and 5) SL sample was also measured between 2 and 300 K, as shown in Fig. 2d. All the SLs show a semiconductive behavior with small polaron conduction mechanism (n ≤ 4) (Supplementary Fig. S5), although the LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 thin film is found to be highly insulating. This strong conduction difference, in addition to the strong difference in magnetism, may be related to the difference in the ordered arrangement of the Fe and Ni cation atoms over the B-sites, where the higher level of cations ordering prefers higher magnetization and higher conductivity19. We thus obtained an emergent La2NiFeO6 DP with Curie temperature much higher than room temperature, which has been predicted to be a half-metallic ferromagnet26.

The magnetic domain microstructure and its evolution with respect to the applied field for the LNO1/LFO1 SL were also investigated by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Generally, the magnetograms obtained by MFM provide information on the effective magnetization along the z direction of the local domains. Figure 3 shows the magnetograms obtained at 2 K in different out-of-plane magnetic fields corresponding to the critical points on the M–H loop in Fig. 2b. Here the red or blue-colored regions represent net-magnetization oriented up (+Mz) or down (−Mz), respectively, and the green color represents the zero Mz signal. As shown in Fig. 3, the as-grown LNO1/LFO1 SL first demonstrates nearly zero-magnetization along the z direction after the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) process. By applying a positive magnetic field along the out-of-plane direction, discrete upward domains begin to appear and grow continuously (+900 Oe), eventually reaching an upward single-domain state at the saturation field of +20 kOe. By applying a negative magnetic field, the single-domain state turns to fragments of upward and downward domains at the coercive field of approximately −250 Oe, corresponding to the zero net magnetization in the M–H loop. The typical size of the fragment domains after magnetization (measured at +250 Oe) is about 300–500 nm (Supplementary Fig. S6). The magnetic domain evolution is repeatable during the field-sweeping process, as further evidenced by the downward single-domain state at −20 kOe and then the fragment-domain state at +250 Oe (the positive coercive field). The domain structures after ZFC and their evolution upon applying magnetic fields are consistent with the direct magnetization measurements. This further confirms that the strong magnetism is intrinsic to our SL samples, where the plausible magnetic contribution from the STO bulk substrate is negligible.

The magnetic contrasts (Δφ) are represented by colors: the red (blue) colored area with positive (negative) Δφ represents the net magnetization projecting along the upward (downward) z direction, and the green colored area with nearly zero Δφ represents for domain walls or the grains with zero-magnetization.

The magnetic exchange interactions in 3d perovskite oxides occur through d orbitals (dominated mainly by eg orbitals) centered at neighboring B cations bridged by an oxide ion, referred to as “super-exchange interaction”. The guidelines referred to as the Goodenough–Kanamori–Anderson rules can be used to predict the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states for transition-metal oxides30. The nominal Fe3+ ion in LFO has a 3d5 (t2g3↑eg2↑) configuration. It is AFM in accordance with the Goodenough–Kanamori rules. The nominal Ni3+ ion has a 3d7 (t2g6↑↓eg1↑) configuration with filled t2g orbitals and one electron residing in the doubly degenerate eg orbitals. Due to the electron-acceptor nature of LNO as illustrated in Fig. 4c, the strong ferromagnetism could originate from the electron transfer from the LFO to the LNO layer, which fills not only \(\alpha |3{d}^{7}\rangle\) but also \(\beta |3{d}^{8}\underline{L}\rangle\) states, where the ferromagnetism at the interface could emerge from the covalent exchange coupling between Ni2+ and Fe4+ ions through the hybridization between the oxygen 2p band and the 3d band31.

a and b The XAS signal of LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 near the Ni L2 edge, respectively. All curves were fitted with two Gaussian functions, labeled as “a” and “b”. The fitting data were shown as thin dashed lines. c and d The schematic representation of the charge state before and after the charge transfer induced rehybridization process, respectively, from LFO to LNO.

To determine the cation valence (Fe3+/Fe4+, Ni3+/Ni2+) thus the charge transfer in addition to their spatial distribution of the Fe–Ni system32, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed on our LNOn/LFO1 (n = 1 and 4) SL samples. The signal of the Fe L2,3 edge was found to show roughly similar features between LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 samples, except that the splitting between the two Fe L3 peaks of the LNO1/LFO1 was slightly wider than that of the LNO4/LFO1 sample (Supplementary Fig. S7). In contrast, the XAS signal at the Ni L2,3 edge, after correction for the overlap of the La M4,5 signal, shows a distinct difference between LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). The shape of the spectra in our SL samples clearly deviates from that of the LNO film33, which readily indicates a different formal Ni oxidation state. Particularly, as shown in Fig. 4a and b, we compared the Ni L2-edge region for the LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 samples. This region has no overlap with La edges and shows quite distinct features between Ni3+ and Ni2+ thus can gain insight into the Ni valence in our samples as reported previously11. The Ni L2 experimental spectra for the LNO1/LFO1 and LNO4/LFO1 samples were fitted with two Gaussian peaks labeled as ‘a' and ‘b'. The changes in the spectral shape, particularly the sharpening of the low-energy feature (labeled ‘a'), are reminiscent of the signature of Ni2+ in the NiO34. By comparing the relative intensity of the two features (‘a' and ‘b'), it is clear that the Ni valence is more strongly reduced towards 2+ for the LNO1/LFO1 sample than the LNO4/LFO1 sample. These results not only confirm the charge transfer from Fe to Ni ions in the LNOn/LFO1 SL samples but also reveal a strong dependence of the number of transferred electrons on the thickness of the nickelate, where the charge transfer length is in a short-range nature and strongly confined to the proximity of the interface.

Upon charge transfer, the filling of the Ni3+ \(\alpha |3{d}^{7}\rangle\) increases Ni2+ \(\alpha {\prime} |3{d}^{8}\rangle\) and the level of the corresponding subband will decrease. As a result, the overlapping or the hybridization between the 3d band and the oxygen 2p band \(\beta {\prime} |3{d}^{8}\underline{L}\rangle\) will also increase, as illustrated in Fig. 4d. This rehybridization process requires a redistribution of electrons between the \(|3{d}^{7}\rangle\) and the \(|3{d}^{8}\underline{L}\rangle\) states, which occurs at an energy cost |∆| for each electron transferred between \(|3{d}^{8}\underline{L}\rangle\) and \(\alpha |3{d}^{7}\rangle\), but thanks to the presence of \(\alpha {\prime} |3{d}^{8}\rangle\), the |∆| is expected to be decreased after change transfer and the rehybridization is more prone to occur. On the other hand, due to the strong covalent character of LNO with a large rare-earth size, which increases the cost of rehybridization, the competition between the charge transfer, controlled by the energy gain associated with the difference in electron affinity, and the cost of rehybridization, limits the number of electrons that can be transferred across the interface. Notably, changes in the multiplet splitting of the Ni L3 absorption edge can be used to estimate the level of covalence35. This splitting corresponds to the energy separation between t2g and eg levels resulting from the interplay between hybridization and Coulomb repulsion, which is both stronger for eg levels. Previous studies have shown that the larger splitting of the L3 peaks indicates a decrease in covalence11,34. The fitted XAS at the Ni L3 edge also indicates that peak splitting increases from LNO1/LFO1 to the LNO4/LFO1 samples, reflecting a decrease in covalence, where a weakened ferromagnetism is also observed. These results suggest that the charge transfer from Fe3+ to Ni3+ indeed results in an increase of covalence, favoring the ferromagnetic Ni2+–O2−–Fe4+ interactions31. The hybridization and charge transfer along the interfacial Fe–O–Ni bonds are mainly proposed to explain the ferromagnetism across the interface and on the Ni site. As for the magnetic nature of the LFO single layer, in contrast to the bulk G-AFM configuration, it probably exhibits a helicoidal magnetic (HM) ordering due to the negative charge transfer energy and the enhanced oxygen–oxygen hopping amplitude when it is interfaced with LNO upon charge transfer36. It is noteworthy that X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements showed negligible local Fe or Ni moments at the Fe L2,3 and Ni L2,3, although they were found to be coupled ferromagnetically to each other. As for the fact that the estimated Fe and Ni moment from XMCD is significantly lower than that measured by the SQUID magnetometry, it might result from the presence of a surface layer with a strongly reduced FM signal as the XMCD measurement was performed in total electron yield configuration, which is very surface sensitive and probes only a few nano-meter deep. Similar huge deviations have been also observed in BaFeO3 thin films37 and for LaMnO3/LaNiO3 superlattices16. Therefore, the exact origin of the strong ferromagnetism remains under investigation.

In summary, we have created a late transition metal oxide superlattice composed of LNOn/LFO1 exhibiting robust ferromagnetism with high magnetization and Curie temperature significantly larger than room temperature by precisely controlling the charge transfer as well as the interfacial orbital hybridization. The latter is viable for tuning the strength of the exchange interactions in all-oxide heterostructures. The semiconducting and FM LNO1/LFO1 SL, which can be regarded as an emergent DP phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations along the (001) orientation, can have a wide spectrum of applications for spintronics.

High-quality LNOn/LFO1 SLs were epitaxially grown on (001)-oriented STO substrates by pulsed laser deposition (KrF, λ = 248 nm) with 10–20 repetitions. During film growth, the substrate temperature was kept at 620 °C and the oxygen pressure was set to 3.4 × 10−2 mbar. The fluency of the laser pulse was 1.2 J/cm2, and the repetition rate was 2 Hz. The SL growth was monitored in situ by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Layer-by-layer epitaxial growth was achieved for both the LNO and LFO layers. After deposition, the sample was cooled to room temperature under the oxygen pressure of 0.1 mbar. The crystal structure of the superlattice was observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The magnetic properties were measured by a quantum-designed vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM-SQUID). The M–T measurements were performed in two temperature ranges from 2–300 and 300–750 K using the same system with an oven option. The transport measurement was measured by a physical properties measurement system (PPMS) at temperatures from 5 to 300 K.

MFM measurements were performed in a variable temperature system from attocube equipped with a superconducting magnet (attoDRY2100). All measurements were conducted in a vacuum at 2 K, based on a phase modulation technique in noncontact mode, with a cantilever (PPP-MFMR) with a spring constant k ~ 2.8 N/m and a resonant frequency f ~ 75 kHz.

For cross-sectional microscopy, the sample was prepared by using focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Cross-sectional lamellas were thinned down to 60 nm thick at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV with a decreasing current from the maximum of 2.5 nA, followed by fine polish at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV with a small current of 40 pA. STEM measurements were conducted by a double Cs-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM200CF operated at 200 kV with a CEOS Cs corrector (CEOS GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).

Resonant X-ray reflectometry (RXR) experiments were carried out at the REIXS beamline of the Canadian Light Source at 300 K in an ultrahigh vacuum environment.

Metrics details

Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile three-dimensional (3D) material platform to explore quantum phenomena and functionalities that emerge from an intricate interplay among magnetism, band structure, and electronic correlations. Here, we report the observation of a nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior and collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM) in V1/3NbS2. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify a commensurate, collinear AFM order formed by intercalated V moments. In the magnetically ordered state, the spontaneous AHE is tenfold greater than expected from empirical scaling with magnetization, and this strongly enhanced AHE arises in the NFL regime that violates the quasiparticle picture. V1/3NbS2 challenges the existing single-particle framework for understanding AHEs based on one-body Berry curvature and highlights the potential of magnetically intercalated TMDs to unveil new electronic functionalities where many-body correlations play a critical role.

The interplay between many-body correlations and topology gives rise to new material properties and functionalities, triggering massive interest extending from condensed matter physics to a broad, multidisciplinary spectrum. One versatile material family for this theme is transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)1,2,3. These materials often exhibit strongly correlated states, and their two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures open up new pathways for correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from Mott and heavy-fermion physics to quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Another groundbreaking discovery based on TMDs is the zero-magnetic field fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) engendered by topological flat bands and enhanced electron correlation in moiré heterostructures, a discovery that could produce the next great leap in quantum computing and topological quantum devices10,11,12,13.

Stepping from the 2D heterostructures to three-dimensional (3D) materials, the intercalation of transition-metal elements between van der Waals layers of bulk TMD compounds introduces magnetism and electron correlations. This offers an alternative means to tune the carrier density and engineer the band topology in TMD systems, similar to the effects of electrostatic gating applied in moiré heterostructures14,15. The magnetically intercalated TMD family has diverse magnetic structures and electronic properties15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. While the interplay between magnetic ordering and topological band structure is widely investigated, less is known about the possibility of realizing novel electronic properties driven essentially by strongly correlated electrons. Berry curvature—the intrinsic mechanism of AHE—is currently understood within effective single-particle theories of non-interacting electronic bands without considering electron correlations or many-body entanglement26,27. Thus, a realization of AHE emerging in an NFL state that defies Landau's paradigm and does not have well-defined quasiparticles may incentivize the establishment of a new framework to explain Berry-curvature-driven phenomena in strongly correlated quantum phases.

Our focus here is V1/3NbS2, which comprises magnetic V ions intercalated between parent NbS2 layers (Fig. 1a). The shifted stacking between the two neighboring V planes breaks inversion and mirror symmetries, resulting in a non-centrosymmetric chiral structure (space group: P6322) (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). The combination of structural chirality and magnetism is known as a feasible pathway toward novel electrical transport phenomena. Band filling by 3d electrons of the intercalated V is predicted to modify the electronic band structure of the parent NbS2 dramatically, with the potential of realizing topological semimetal states14. Moreover, the band structure obtained by density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT) features nearly flat bands with a substantial density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, attributed to Kondo hybridization between V-3d and Nb-4d orbitals (Fig. 1c–e). Thus, V1/3NbS2 offers unique opportunities to engineer exotic quantum phases through the mixing of spontaneous symmetry breaking, electron correlation, and non-trivial band topology.

a Schematics of the crystal structure depicting V, Nb, and S atoms with red, blue, and yellow balls, respectively. The V atoms lie in between the host NbS2 layers. A unit cell (solid lines) contains two V layers. The magnetic moments of V (red arrows) form the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order; they are ferromagnetically ordered within the layer and antiferromagnetically stacked along the [0001] direction. b Six domain configurations of the Γ6 collinear AFM state, α+, β+, γ+,α−, β−, γ−. The balls represent V atoms, and the arrows represent the staggered magnetic moments. The circular plot shows the orientation of the staggered moment for each domain configuration. The sign of the induced AHE is marked by  + or  − . The dashed lines mark the staggered moment directions that forbid the AHE. The x, y, and z directions, respectively, refer to the real-space crystal directions \([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\), \([01\bar{1}0]\), and [0001]. c The DFT + DMFT band structure: the spectral function for the antiferromagnetic state. The nearly flat band mentioned in the main text is marked by the gray box. d The density of states (DOS) per unit cell. The solid blue line represents the total DOS. The solid red line and the dashed black line represent the contributions from the V t2g orbital and other orbitals, respectively. e The up-spin and down-spin DOS at a V site.

Among the candidate AFM structures for V1/3NbS2, the collinear AFM is particularly intriguing20,21. Large zero-field AHE has been established in noncollinear and noncoplanar AFMs, presenting compelling new opportunities for ultrafast non-volatile information storage17,18,19,28,29,30,31,32,33. Widening the landscape of such functional AFM orders may yield broad scientific and technological impacts. Collinear AFM structures exhibiting sizable spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses (i.e., zero-field AHE), termed altermagnets34,35, have recently attracted immense interest, yet their physical realization remains elusive. Recent studies on candidate altermagnets, such as MnTe and Mn5Si3, have identified zero-field AHE36,37. However, these observations have been limited to thin films, which hampers experimental determination of the microscopic magnetic structure and crystal structure. In this work, we combine high-quality single-crystal synthesis with neutron and X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical transport measurements to demonstrate that the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 displays enhanced zero-field AHE. This constitutes the first experimental evidence for the anomalous Hall effect in a collinear antiferromagnet.

We shall first determine the magnetic structure of our V1/3NbS2 crystals through single-crystal magnetization and neutron diffraction measurements. We use a right-handed coordinate system with axes x, y, and z to respectively represent the \([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\), \([01\bar{1}0]\), and [0001] real-space directions of the hexagonal V1/3NbS2 indicated through Miller-Bravais indices. Following Ashcroft and Mermin, we use square brackets for real space and rounded brackets for reciprocal space. The set of three symmetry-related x and y directions are labeled as 〈x〉 and 〈y〉, respectively. The magnetization M measured in a small field rises abruptly upon cooling below 50 K (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6), marking a transition to AFM order with a Néel temperature TN  =  50(1) K. Further cooling reveals anisotropic magnetic properties with small ferromagnetic (FM) components arising both in the xy plane and along the z-axis: While the out-of-plane M forms a plateau between about 10 K and 40 K and develops a weak upturn below about 10 K, the in-plane M decreases with T after reaching a 30 K maximum (Fig. 2a). Magnetization isotherms M(B) measured at 2 K show a spontaneous moment of about 0.01μB/V with finite coercivity for B∥z (Fig. 2b) and about 0.04μB/V without coercivity for B⊥z (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These weak ferromagnetic moments are less than 1% of the V3+ moment size (Methods) and may correspond to sample-averaged spin canting of less than 1∘ relative to a predominantly collinear AFM order. The M-T curves differ from those reported in a previous single-crystal neutron diffraction study21. There are also considerable differences between previously published magnetization data20,21,38 indicating differences in V composition and disorder. To facilitate interpretation here we report magnetic, electrical transport, specific heat, and neutron diffraction measurements on the same crystal. This crystal has near-perfect stoichiometry and exhibits the ideal ABAB stacking of V without the ABC-type stacking fault, as discussed in the “Methods” section, Supplementary Note 8, and Supplementary Fig. 12.

The solid line in the main panel is a fit to the power-law form \(I \sim {({T}_{{{{\rm{N}}}}}-T)}^{2\beta }+{I}_{0}\), where β is the critical exponent, and I0 is the background intensity above TN. This fit yields β =  0.363(2), TN  =  50.1(1) K, and I0  = 247(5) counts per 1500 monitor counts. Inset: a log-log plot of the magnetic peak intensity vs. the reduced temperature (TN  − T)/TN. The solid line shows power-law behavior near the critical temperature. Error bars in all neutron scattering figures represent one standard deviation.

Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify an exclusively magnetic Bragg peak that appears at Q  =  (0001) upon cooling below TN  =  50.1(1) K (Fig. 2c, d). The temperature dependence of the peak intensity follows an order-parameter-like form (Fig. 2d). Temperature-dependent Bragg scattering is also detected at Q  =  (0003) but with weaker intensity (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with the V3+ magnetic form factor. The \((11\bar{2}\ell )\) (0  <  ℓ  <  1) scan at T  =  2 K shows no extra magnetic Bragg scattering at low T (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Based on the polarization factor for unpolarized neutron diffraction, this sets an upper limit of 0.1μB/V on the ordered z-axis moment in our sample. Thus, we can rule out the possibility of the Q = (000\(\frac{1}{3}\)) noncoplanar spin configuration reported in ref. 21. The structure factor for a series of magnetic Bragg peaks in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) and \((hh\overline{2h}\ell )\) reciprocal lattice planes is best accounted for by the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR), that describes an antiferromagnetic stacking of ferromagnetic vanadium layers (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). Refinement against the Γ6 structure yields a V moment of 1.7(1) μB/V, which is comparable with the moment size of 1.5(1) μB/V reported in ref. 20 and is consistent with the expected moment size gS  =  2μB with effective spin S  =  1 and g  =  2. The local easy axis of the collinear AFM structure is identified as \(\langle 2\bar{1}\bar{1}0\rangle\) through the field dependence of the \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) magnetic Bragg peak intensity under a magnetic field applied along the perpendicular \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) (〈x〉) direction (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

To detect a potential change in the antiferromagnetic structure associated with the weak upturn in out-of-plane M for T <  10 K (Fig. 2a), we first note that there is no anomaly in the temperature-dependent intensity of the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Fig. 2d). This shows the domain averaged in plane staggered magnetization does not change at 10 K. For sensitivity to the in-plane AFM domain distribution, we turn to the \((10\bar{1}0)\) Bragg peak. Supplementary Fig. 5g, h shows there is no change in the field dependence of the \((10\bar{1}0)\) intensity around T  =  10 K. This precludes a substantial change in the magnetic structure or its easy axis at 10 K. Thus, our neutron diffraction experiments show that the Γ6 collinear AFM structure with a staggered moment lying along 〈x〉 is retained as the sample-averaged magnetic structure down to at least 2 K. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the specific heat, C(T), exhibits no noticeable anomaly around 10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8a). These findings exclude the possibility of a magnetic phase transition into a noncoplanar AFM order below 10 K. Because an out-of-plane uncompensated FM moment does not break symmetry elements of the Γ6 collinear AFM configuration (Supplementary Note 5), it must emerge concurrently with the collinear AFM order in a single phase transition, albeit potentially with a very small magnitude as indeed observed (Supplementary Note 6). However, the in-plane FM component associated with the enhanced in-plane M for T  <  50 K is incompatible with the symmetry properties of the prevailing AFM order and is likely associated with stacking faults, as detailed in the discussion section below.

Though the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 state has a vanishingly small M, it hosts a sizable spontaneous (zero-field) Hall effect. Figure 3a shows the Hall resistivity ρxy measured for B∥z. The spontaneous component of ρxy(B  =  0) appears below 10 K and grows upon cooling, reaching  ≈ 0.1 μΩcm with a clear field coercivity of  ≈200 Oe at 2 K. For T  >  10 K, the spontaneous Hall effect vanishes, and ρxy shows nearly linear field dependence without hysteresis. Correspondingly, a spontaneous Hall conductivity σxy(B  =  0) ≈  ρxy/(ρxxρyy) only appears below 10 K, where it rises to approximately 3Ω−1cm−1 at 2 K (Fig. 3b).

The current I is applied along the y-direction. Inset: The Hall resistivity ρzy obtained at T  = 32 K with B∥x and I∥y. Error bars represent uncertainties in measured data. c The scaling relation between the net magnetization M and the spontaneous Hall conductivity σH(B  =  0). The Hall conductivity σxy(B = 0) of V1/3NbS2 (solid red circles) deviates greatly from the linear scaling for conventional ferromagnets (blue-shaded region), constituting the unconventional regime (red-shaded regime) associated with known Weyl magnets. In contrast, σyz(B  =  0) for V1/3NbS2 (half-filled red circles) is linearly related to the in-plane M as in ordinary ferromagnetic materials28,29.

In ordinary ferromagnets, the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σH is proportional to M, and the ratio SH  =  σH/M is of order (0.01–0.1) V−1, constituting the conventional regime (blue shaded region in Fig. 3c)26,29. In contrast, the observed Hall conductivity σxy in V1/3NbS2, when compared to its tiny net ferromagnetic moment of  ~0.01μB/V leads to SH  ~  1 V−1 for T ≤ 10 K (solid red circles in Fig. 3c), which is well beyond the linear relation for conventional ferromagnets. Instead, the AHE in V1/3NbS2 falls in the same regime as topological magnetic materials such as the Weyl magnets Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge)28,29, Co3Sn2S239, and Co2MnGa40 (red shaded region in Fig. 3c). Note that the net magnetization, μ0M <  10−3 T, in V1/3NbS2 is about one-tenth of the value found in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge), and just 1% of that in the ferromagnetic Weyl magnet Co3Sn2S2. The deviation from the conventional scaling relation indicates that an order parameter other than the net magnetization (i.e., cluster multipoles as discussed below) characterizes the symmetry-breaking mechanism in the AFM state, and there exists a significant contribution to the Berry curvature that is independent of the net magnetization32. Moreover, with such deviation recognized as a universal signature in topological magnets32, we anticipate that the out-of-plane spontaneous AHE in V1/3NbS2 might arise from topologically non-trivial band features, though further confirmation through spectroscopic probes is required for a firm conclusion41,42,43.

The in-plane spontaneous AHE, ρzy(B =  0), differs qualitatively from the out-of-plane AHE ρxy(B  =  0) in two aspects: (1) ρzy(B  =  0) peaks near 30 K and then decreases toward zero around 10 K (Fig. 3b); (2) the corresponding zero-field Hall conductivity σyz  ≈  −ρyz/(ρyyρzz) is an order of magnitude smaller than σxy(B  =  0) and lies within the regime for ordinary ferromagnets in the scaling plot for the anomalous Hall conductivity ∣σH∣ vs. M (Fig. 3b, c). Thus, the AHE ρzy(B  =  0) can be understood as driven by the in-plane FM component within the conventional scheme.

Another striking observation in V1/3NbS2 is the emergence of pronounced NFL resistivity within the same temperature regime (T  ≲  10 K) as the disproportionately large spontaneous AHE. The zero-field longitudinal resistivity ρ (Fig. 4a) is T-linear in the paramagnetic phase between 350 K and TN. It then drops sharply for temperatures below TN, which we ascribe to a reduction in magnetic scattering. On further cooling, ρ(T) once again exhibits linear T-dependence for T  ≲  10 K (Fig. 4a, c) before settling into a T1.6(1) behavior below about 1 K for B  ≲ 1 T (Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary Fig. 7c).

Inset: the temperature derivative, dρ/dT.

The black arrows mark the onset of the NFL state ρ(T)  ~  T1.6 (solid lines). Above 1 T, ρ(T) recovers the FL T2 dependence (dashed lines), with the red arrows denoting its upper limit. e Representative R-squared R2 of power-law fitting to ρ(T)  =  ρ0  +  ATn versus n. The maximum value of R2 (dotted lines) indicates optimal fitting. f Power-law exponent n (left-axis) and the inverse of the FL coefficient A (right-axis) versus B. The blue dashed lines are guides for the eye. The linear fit 1/A  ~  ∣B  − Bc∣ (red dashed line) provides a critical field Bc  =  1.2(2) T. Error bars in b, f represent uncertainties in the measured data.

The zero-field electronic specific heat coefficient exhibits a logarithmic increase Cel(T)/T  ~ log(T*/T) below 1.3 K, which overlaps with the onset of ρ(T) ∝  T1.6(1) (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8b). As shown in the temperature-field (T - B) phase diagram (Fig. 4b), the NFL regime characterized by T-linear resistivity extends from approximately 10 K to 2 K within the AFM phase. For B  ≲  1 T, ρ(T) does not enter a Fermi liquid (FL) regime with ρ(T)  ~  T2 even in the T  →  0 limit.

The T-linear resistivity above 2 K persists for B∥z up to 8 T (Fig. 4b, c), with its onset temperature shifting to higher values with increasing B. In contrast, the T1.6(1) NFL phase below  ~1 K is replaced by a FL with T2 resistivity for B  ≳  2 T (Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Fig. 7b). In the field-induced FL phase, the coefficient A characterizing the T2 resistivity ρ =  AT2 increases by a factor of five with decreasing B and appears to diverge near  ~1.5 T, as indicated by the linear field dependence of 1/A  ~  ∣B  −  Bc∣, with Bc  =  1.2(2) T (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 7b). Since A measures the quasi-particle effective mass m*, the divergence of A near Bc marks a quasi-particle breakdown.

The NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 recalls observations in correlated quantum materials, ranging from high-temperature superconductors, heavy fermions, to twisted bilayer systems2,9,44,45,46,47,48,49. A generic feature of these materials is the T-linear resistivity governed by a universal transport scattering rate 1/τ that obeys the Planckian limit: ℏ/τ  =  αkBT, where ℏ and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively45,46,47,48,50. Following the procedure used in refs. 46,47,48, we obtained α  = 0.7  ±  0.2 for V1/3NbS2, which is of order unity as expected for Planckian behavior (Supplementary Note 4). The Debye temperature of V1/3NbS2 is as high as  ~380 K21, and the phonon contribution to the specific heat is negligible below  ~10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. 8a). Thus, the observed T-linear resistivity at low temperatures cannot be attributed to conventional electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. We can also rule out extrinsic factors, such as impurity phases and chemical inhomogeneity, as the cause of the observed NFL based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction and chemical composition analysis (Methods and Supplementary Note 8). On the other hand, two unique aspects of the NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 stand out: (i) Unlike typical quantum critical systems where the NFL behavior emerges at the margin of an ordered phase, the NFL regime in V1/3NbS2 occurs well within the AFM order without tuning (i.e., zero field and ambient pressure)51,52; (ii) The low-temperature T-linear resistivity covers a broad B range with the monotonically increasing onset temperature up to 8 T (Fig. 4b). This seems to defy straightforward explanation based on proximity to a magnetic-field-tuned QCP, for which the NFL behavior is typically confined near a critical field44,45.

The symmetry properties of the underlying AFM spin texture provide an essential basis for understanding the emergence of magnetization-free spontaneous AHE. The collinear AFM state in V1/3NbS2 can be viewed as a ferroic order of cluster dotriacontapoles that belongs to the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR) (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. 10)53. The two possible spin configurations Γ6(1) and Γ6(2) shown in Supplementary Fig. 10(a) are symmetrically distinct: Γ6(1) forces the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σxy to be zero, whereas Γ6(2) allows out-of-plane spin canting and finite σxy. With the staggered moment lying along the x-axis, the observed AFM order corresponds to the Γ6(2) configuration at zero field, which breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and can exhibit a finite spontaneous AHE even with vanishing net magnetization (Supplementary Note 6). Figure 1b illustrates the six equivalent domain patterns hosted by the Γ6 collinear AFM state, α+, β+, γ+, α−, β−, γ−, where the  + and  − refer to the different signs of the AHE signal. The presence of magnetic domains is evident from the hysteric behavior observed in ρxy(B) (Fig. 3a) and in the field dependence of rocking scans through the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). An out-of-plane magnetic field B∥z can shift the balance between  + and  − domain populations (Supplementary Note 6). This effect may result in a finite spontaneous AHE, σxy(B  =  0), which aligns with the experimental observation for T  ≲ 10 K (Fig. 3a).

Aside from the unique characteristics of the collinear AFM order, our experimental findings, in combination with the DFT+DMFT calculation (Method, Supplementary Note 7), suggest that electronic correlation effects play a role in generating the novel electronic state at zero fields. The NFL behavior and signature of quasi-particle breakdown near zero fields are reminiscent of the strange metal state observed in various classes of strongly correlated materials. On the theoretical front, the DFT band structure features narrow V-3dt2g bands hybridizing with Nb-4d bands near the Fermi level EF (Supplementary Fig. 11). Taking into account the electronic interactions between V-3dt2g orbitals within the DMFT, we obtain an itinerant AFM with the local magnetic moments of approximately 1.3μB at TN  ≈  50 K, comparable to the experimental staggered moment of 1.7(1)μB observed at T  = 2 K. With increasing on-site interaction U, the DFT+DMFT calculations predict that the ground state of V1/3NbS2 can be tuned through a quantum phase transition (QPT) separating the itinerant AFM and a correlated metallic paramagnet (PM); the latter hosts heavy quasiparticles with a significant mass enhancement factor of 50– 100 due to Kondo hybridization between the V-3d and Nb-4d electrons. The low-T specific heat data above the  ~log(1/T) upturn yields a large value of the electronic specific heat coefficient γ  =  40.6(3) mJmole−1K−2, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the DFT value of 0.14 mJmole−1K−2. By assessing γ under detailed tuning of the interaction parameters, we find that the experimentally observed mass enhancement can be reproduced only when the AFM ground state lies near the AFM-PM QPT. Thus, the experiment-theory comparison suggests that the zero-field AHE appears in a setting where correlated effects and quantum fluctuations play prominent roles. An effective non-thermal tuning parameter for accessing this anticipated QPT remains to be identified, with disorder strength being a plausible candidate. Below, we elaborate further on the nature and role of disorder in V1/3NbS2.

Two of our experimental observations defy symmetry-based expectations for a single macroscopic domain of AFM order: (i) The small yet finite in-plane ferromagnetic moment observed in Mx(B)(B  =  0) and the resulting spontaneous Hall signal σyz(B  =  0) (Figs. 2a and 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) are incompatible with the symmetry of bulk Γ6 AFM order (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. 10); (ii) The out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) becomes finite at approximately 10 K (Fig. 3a) where there is no peak in the specific heat nor a thermal anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic Bragg diffraction to indicate a thermodynamic phase transition (Supplementary Fig. 8a, Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary Fig. 5g, h). This suggests that structural disorder plays a role. Refinement of a structural model of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data reveals  ~85% V occupancy on the 2d site and  ~15% V occupancy on the 2b site (Methods, Supplementary Note 5, and Supplementary Tables 1, 2). In an intercalated layered structure such as V1/3NbS2, occupational disorder typically takes the form of planar stacking faults; defect V layers interspersed within the prevailing ABAB stacking pattern. Planar defects can strongly impact Hall and magnetization measurements, which rely on macroscopic coherence. In analogy to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in multilayer magnetic thin films54, the localized DMI associated with a planar defect can introduce a local twist or phase slip in the otherwise collinear Γ6 AFM order. A low density of planar stacking faults thus might induce the unexpected Mx(B)(B  =  0) and σyz(B  = 0) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and suppress Mz and the out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) (Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a, b). We thus hypothesize that the 10 K temperature scale is associated with a planar defect-induced crossover in domain wall dynamics of an otherwise collinear AFM.

We next discuss the possible physical origin of the low-T NFL behavior. Inside an AFM phase, spin fluctuations typically cannot give rise to divergence in self-energy required for quantum criticality. Another relatively underexplored mechanism for NFL behavior is related to chiral spin texture with non-trivial topologies, such as a skyrmion lattice underlying the pressure-induced NFL behavior in MnSi55. The broad crossover around 1.3 K in ρ(T) of V1/3NbS2 and the subsequent power-law behavior ρ(T)  ∝  T1.6(1) aligns well with the MnSi case55. However, the spontaneous AHE occurring in the same T regime requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, a condition not fulfilled by magnetic skyrmion bubbles. Thus, the concurrent NFL and spontaneous AHE suggest the possibility that the aforementioned AFM domain walls represent a new type of topological nano-magnetic entity. The AFM domain structure and domain wall dynamics are expected to be sensitive to variations in the stacking order. Thus, if one can manipulate the type and strength of the V disorder, V1/3NbS2 may hold the potential to serve as a physical example demonstrating the controlled disorder-tuning of strange-metal behavior and Planckian transport, as recently proposed in ref. 50.

In summary, we identify a substantial zero-field AHE in a collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 with vanishingly small magnetization. This observation suggests that 3d band filling by V intercalants could lead to topological band features, for which spectroscopic evidence is worth pursuing. Most remarkably, this spontaneous Hall signal co-occurs with pronounced NFL behavior that defies a conventional quasi-particle description. Strong correlation effects play a vital role in the emergence of zero-field AHE inside the NFL phase, the description of which goes beyond the widely-used free fermion Berry-curvature framework. These findings showcase a promising outlook for magnetically intercalated TMDs to realize exotic electronic states characterized by a rich interplay of many-body correlations, band topology, and magnetism. Structural disorders are known to substantially influence the intrinsic quantum phases and properties of intercalated TMDs. Anticipating improved understanding and control of disorder-related effects, the unusual electronic states found in the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 could lead to electronic and spintronic functionalities that extend beyond current paradigms.

The V1/3NbS2 single crystals were synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method using iodine as the transport agent. We first obtained polycrystalline samples by heating stoichiometric amounts of high-purity vanadium (Rare metallic, 99.999%), niobium (Rare metallic 99.999%), and sulfur (Rare metallic 99.9995%) in an evacuated silica ampoule at 1000 ∘C for 24 h. This heating process was done stepwise in a controlled manner before naturally cooling the material to room temperature. We then mixed 2 g of polycrystalline powder with 0.1 g of iodine in an evacuated silica tube (20 mm inner diameter, 15 cm length). Next, this ampule was loaded in a three-zone furnace in which the hot and cold zones were kept at 1000 ∘C and 800 ∘C, respectively, for 7 days. This resulted in several plate-like and well-faceted V1/3NbS2 crystals (maximum size  ~3 mm ×  ~2 mm) at the cold zone side of the ampoule.

We determined the chemical composition of the V1/3NbS2 crystals using electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) JXA-iSP100 (JEOL). The measurements provide an average atomic percentage ratio of V:Nb:S = 9.97: 29.80: 60.23, which corresponds to a composition of V1.004Nb3S6.06.

The structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data were collected on a single crystal of 0.16  ×  0.15  ×  0.02 (mm)3 on a Bruker Kappa D8 Quest diffractometer equipped with an IμS microfocus source (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å), a HELIOS optics monochromator, and a Photon II CPAD detector. The Bruker SAINT program was used to integrate the diffraction data. Scaling and multi-scan absorption corrections were performed using SADABS. The crystal structure of V1.00Nb3S6 was solved using intrinsic phasing methods in SHELXT56 and anisotropically refined using SHELXL57. All atomic parameters were refined anisotropically. The V content was restrained to 1.00 to match the total amount determined by EPMA. The data collection and refinement parameters are presented in Supplementary Table 1, and the atomic positions are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

We further investigated the local crystal structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM-2010F instrument operated at 200 kV at the Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP), the University of Tokyo. The specimen was put on a holder that allowed a tilt angle of  ± 30∘ for the TEM observation. Selected area electron diffraction patterns were obtained using an aperture of 10 μm diameter, being ca.125 nm in real space, and recorded using an imaging plate. Specimen for the TEM observation was initially prepared using a JEOL Ion-Slicer, but since it was altered during processing, a powder sample obtained by crushing the single crystal in an agate mortar was used instead. The powder was diffused into a solvent and dropped onto a microgrid together with the solvent to prepare an observation sample for TEM. The TEM results shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 confirm the non-centrosymmetric P6322 space group with (√3 × √3) V ordering at room temperature.

The behavior of bulk magnetization reported across existing studies on V1/3NbS2 reveals notable sample dependence20,21. To ensure consistency, we report the magnetic properties of the same crystal used for measuring electrical transport and specific heat, which is stoichiometric to within 1%, as mentioned above, and exhibits ABAB stacking (Supplementary Note 8). The magnetization data shown in Fig. 2a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 2a were obtained on oriented samples using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) under both zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions. The ZFC data were obtained by cooling the sample from 300 K to 2 K at zero field. A magnetic field of 0.1 T was then applied, and measurements of the magnetization were conducted while warming the sample to 400 K. Maintaining the B  = 0.1 T magnetic field, the sample was then cooled to base temperature. The FC M(T) data were subsequently acquired while warming the sample to 400 K. To obtain the isothermal magnetization M(H) curves, we first cooled the sample in zero field from T  =  300 K to the target temperatures. We then measured M(H) while scanning the magnetic field between  ±7 T. The magnetic susceptibility measured at a magnetic field B  = 0.1 T exhibits nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2a, inset. The inverse susceptibility, 1/χ, is linear in the temperature range between 300 K and 400 K, yielding a Curie-Weiss temperature θW = −70(4) K and an effective moment per V atoms μeff  = 2.9(1) μB for both the in-plane and out-of-plane field directions. The negative sign of θW indicates antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state, and the fitting parameter of μeff  = 2.9(1)μB is close to the value of \(g\sqrt{S\cdot (S+1)}{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}=2.83{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}\) expected for a V3+ ion with a spin-only local moment where g =  2 and S  =  1. This result is consistent with previous reports21,58.

Zero-field specific heat measurements down to 2 K were carried out using a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) through the relaxation method. The corresponding data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a. The low-T specific heat data shown in Supplementary Fig. 8b were acquired using the quasi-adiabatic method at the International Megagauss Science Laboratory of ISSP. Details of this technique are described in ref. 59. Each data point in the measurement was obtained within a short timescale of  ~5 ms under a 0.1 ms heat pulse, as shown in the inset of Supplementary Fig. 8b.

The longitudinal and Hall resistivities were measured in six-point geometry. Crystals were polished into bar shapes, with their long edge parallel to the in-plane x and y directions, respectively. Electrical contacts to the crystals were made by attaching 20 μm gold wires with silver epoxy. Measurements in the temperature range of 2 K–400 K were performed using the DC option of the PPMS system (Quantum Design). The resistivity data in the 0.1 K–4 K temperature range were obtained using a dilution refrigerator (Kelvinox 25, Oxford Instruments) and the AC method with an excitation current of 0.1 mA. The Hall contribution to the resistance and vice versa were extracted by subtracting and adding the resistance of positive and negative field scans, respectively.

A 20 mg plate-like single crystal with the z-axis perpendicular to the surface was used for neutron diffraction experiments. The experiment was performed on the triple-axis spectrometer BT-7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)60. The sample was mounted on an aluminum sample holder with the [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction (〈x〉-axis) vertical and perpendicular to the horizontal scattering plane of the instrument for observing scattering signals in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane. All measurements were performed with a fixed final neutron energy of 14.7 meV, filtered through 25 mm pyrolytic graphite (PG) before the saggital focusing PG (002) monochromator and an additional 25 mm thick PG filter between the sample and the PG (002) analyzer. To determine the magnetic structure we used open-50'-50'-120' collimation and conducted rocking scans on the accessible magnetic and nuclear Bragg peaks. We inferred the fully Q-integrated intensity of Bragg peaks from rocking scans using Reslib. Specialized software was developed for the subsequent structural refinement to account for the resolution effect. A comparison between the calculated and observed structure factor is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a–c. The magnetic Bragg peaks detected in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane contain contributions from two out of three magnetic domains, which were taken into account in the analysis. The experimental moment size is within 15% of the spin-only value (see main text), confirming the assumption of a uniform distribution of domain size.

To investigate the field dependence of the magnetic structure, we conducted rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) and (0001) at the base temperature of 2 K with a magnetic field between 0 and 8 T applied along the vertical [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction. To achieve sensitivity to the magnetic correlation length/domain size, we used tight collimation around the sample for these measurements: Open-10'-10'-120'. Rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) are sensitive to the correlation length along the c-axis, which was found to exceed 800 nm for all field values (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Rocking scans at Q  =  (0001) are sensitive to the in-plane correlation length along the \([10\bar{1}0]\,\langle y\rangle\)-direction, which shows strong field dependence (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The contrast between the in-plane and out-of-plane correlation length indicates the formation of magnetic field tunable domains extending in the z-direction, which survive up to a field of 8 T applied along [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] (〈x〉). This is evident from the hysteresis observed in the field dependence of the y-axis correlation length (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The observed asymmetry in the hysteresis can be attributed to the hysteresis occurring only within a specific range of the applied magnetic field. In the negative field sweep, the applied field strength was not high enough to fully polarize the magnetic domains. This results in partial polarization, creating a minor loop.

To look for changes in the antiferromagnetic structure upon cooling below 10 K where a small c-oriented magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect appears, we examined the temperature and field dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak. These data were acquired using 14.7 meV neutrons on the EIGER triple-axis spectrometer at the Swiss spallation neutron source SINQ, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland. The magnetic diffraction intensity is proportional to the sum squared staggered magnetization along the perpendicular \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) and [0001] directions. With a field applied along the vertical \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) direction, there is thus sensitivity to the in-plane domain distribution. Though data marked with blue symbols have lower counting statistics, Supplementary Fig. 5g shows the field dependence of the overall domain fraction is indistinguishable above (blue symbols, 12 K) and below (red symbols, 1.5 K) 10 K. Supplementary Fig. 5h shows the temperature dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak intensity in the presence of a 2 T magnetic field along \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\), which disfavors domains with staggered magnetization along that direction. The temperature dependence is indistinguishable from that acquired in zero fields at the (0001) peak, where all domains contribute equally to the scattering. These data show the magnetic structure of V1/3NbS2 is virtually unchanged across 10 K. We propose that the appearance of a zero-field Hall response and remnant magnetization along the c-axis for T  <  10 K results from a subtle change in domain wall dynamics at this temperature.

The line shape and integrated intensity of a rocking scan is affected by all components of the resolution function, including the out-of-plane resolution. To account for these effects, we assume an infinite correlation length along the c-axis and adopt the following isotropic form for the in-plane correlation function:

The corresponding Bragg peak profile can be obtained analytically by Fourier transformation and the result is isotropic in 2D in-plane q-space:

where I0001 is the integrated peak intensity at Q = (0001).

The experimental peak profile is obtained via convolution with the resolution function defined as:

Here q0 = (q0,z, q0,y, ℏω0, q0,x) is the instrument-targeted energy and wave-vector transfer for each point in the rocking scan passing through Q = (0001).

Reflecting the mirror symmetry of the instrument about the horizontal plane, the structure of M allows us to complete the integration over x:

Here q∥ is the wave-vector within the scattering plane (yz plane). R0001 is the Gaussian resolution function at Q  = (0001). \(U(a,b,z)=1/\Gamma (a)\int_{0}^{+\infty }{e}^{-zt}{t}^{a-1}{(1+t)}^{b-a-1}dt\) refers to the confluent hypergeometric function61. The delta function within the peak profile and condition of rocking scans q0,x  =  0, q0,z ≈ 0 was applied from the first line to the second line of Eq. (4).

The qy integrated intensity is thus given by

This one dimensional integral can readily be evaluated through numerical integration. To duly account for the field dependent correlation length κ, Iob,0001 was used to convert the measured (0001) rocking scan integrated intensity into a full integrated intensity measure of the total coherent staggered magnetization.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed by the ab initio code OpenMX. The generalized gradient approximations (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) were adopted for the exchange-correlation potential. An 8 × 8 × 4 k-point grid was used for the calculation. We employed the valence orbital sets V6.0-s3p3d2, Nb7.0-s3p2d2, and S7.0-s3p3d2f1, and set a cutoff energy of 150 Ry for the numerical integrations. The Wannier functions of the t2g vanadium orbitals and the \({d}_{{z}^{2}}\), \({d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\), and dxy niobium orbitals were constructed from an outer energy window of [−5 eV: 5 eV].

The dynamical mean-field (DMFT) calculation was performed with the finite-temperature exact diagonalization solver, where the dynamical mean field was represented by six bath sites. We chose a reasonable value of the intra-orbital Coulomb interaction U  =  3 eV and Hund's coupling J  =  0.5 eV for V-t2g orbitals; the inter-orbital Coulomb interaction was determined by \(U{\prime}=U-2J\). For the double-counting correction, we subtracted the self-energy in the high-frequency limit of the paramagnetic solution, which corresponds to a static mean-field value with inter-orbital components. The spectral function was obtained with 10 meV energy smearing.

LG TVs will soon leverage an artificial intelligence model built for showing advertisements that more closely align with viewers' personal beliefs and emotions.

This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.

The company plans to incorporate a partner company's AI tech into its TV software in order to interpret psychological factors impacting a viewer, such as personal interests, personality traits, and lifestyle choices. The aim is to show LG webOS users ads that will emotionally impact them.

The upcoming advertising approach comes via a multiyear licensing deal with Zenapse, a company that describes itself as a software-as-a-service marketing platform that can drive advertiser sales “with AI-powered emotional intelligence.” LG will use Zenapse's technology to divide webOS users into hyper-specific market segments that are supposed to be more informative to advertisers. LG Ad Solutions, LG's advertising business, announced the partnership on Tuesday.

The technology will be used to inform ads shown on LG smart TVs' home screens, free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels, and elsewhere throughout webOS, per StreamTV Insider. LG will also use Zenapse's tech to “expand new software development and go-to-market products,"" it said. LG didn't specify the duration of its licensing deal with Zenapse.

Zenapse's platform for connected TVs (CTVs), ZenVision, is supposed to be able to interpret the types of emotions shown in the content someone is watching on TV, partially by using publicly available information about the show's or movie's script and plot, StreamTV Insider reported. ZenVision also analyzes viewer behavior, grouping viewers based on their consumption patterns, the publication noted. Under the new partnership, ZenVision can use data that LG has gathered from the automatic content recognition software in LG TVs.

With all this information, ZenVision will group LG TV viewers into highly specified market segments, such as “goal-driven achievers,” “social connectors,” or ""emotionally engaged planners,"" an LG spokesperson told StreamTV Insider. Zenapse's website for ZenVision points to other potential market segments, including ""digital adopters,"" ""wellness seekers,"" ""positive impact & environment,"" and ""money matters.""

Companies paying to advertise on LG TVs can then target viewers based on the ZenVision-specified market segments and deliver an “emotionally intelligent ad,” as Zenapse's website puts it.

LG will use Zenapse's technology to divide webOS users into hyper-specific market segments that are supposed to be more informative to advertisers.

This type of targeted advertising aims to bring advertisers more in-depth information about TV viewers than demographic data or even contextual advertising (which shows ads based on what the viewer is watching) via psychographic data. Demographic data gives advertisers viewer information, like location, age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and income. Psychographic data is supposed to go deeper and allow advertisers to target people based on so-called psychological factors, like personal beliefs, values, and attitudes. As Salesforce explains, “psychographic segmentation delves deeper into their psyche” than relying on demographic data.

“As viewers engage with content, ZenVision's understanding of a consumer grows deeper, and our... segmentation continually evolves to optimize predictions,” the ZenVision website says.

LG's partnership with Zenapse comes as advertisers struggle to appeal to TV viewers' emotions. Google, for example, attempted to tug at parents' heartstrings with the now-infamous Dear Sydney ad aired during the 2024 Summer Olympics. Looking to push Gemini, Google hit all the wrong chords with parents, and, after much backlash, pulled the ad.

The partnership also comes as TV OS operators seek new ways to use smart TVs to grow their own advertising businesses and to get people to use TVs to buy stuff.

With their ability to track TV viewers' behavior, including what they watch and search for on their TVs, smart TVs are a growing obsession for advertisers. As LG's announcement pointed out, CTVs represent ""one of the fastest-growing ad segments in the US, expected to reach over $40 billion by 2027, up from $24.6 billion in 2023.""

However, as advertisers' interest in appealing to streamers grows, so do their efforts to track and understand viewers for more targeted advertising. Both efforts could end up pushing the limits of user comfort and privacy.

LG is one of the biggest global TV brands, so its plan to distribute emotionally driven ads to the 200 million LG TVs currently in people's homes could have a ripple effect. Further illustrating the dominance of LG TVs, webOS is estimated to be in 35 percent of US homes, per data that Hub Entertainment Research shared this week. As such, LG's foray into advertising driven by AI's ability to understand and appeal to viewer emotions could lead to other CTV OSes following suit.

For its part, LG thinks it can use Zenapse's tech to make ""future innovations that could shape new emotionally intelligent experiences for the TV screen,"" a spokesperson told StreamTV Insider.

As it stands, targeted ads are a divisive approach to what we might consider a necessary evil: advertising. While targeted ads rely on tracking techniques that many find invasive, they could also result in ads that are more relevant and less annoying to the people seeing them. In cases where advertising is inevitable, some prefer ads that appeal on a personal level over messaging that can be inappropriate or, even, disturbing and offensive.

At this stage, we don't know how the ads shown on LG's webOS might evolve with Zenapse's technology. But it seems like LG and, likely, other smart TV OS operators will try to strengthen their abilities to understand your convictions, beliefs, and values.

Ever since I started backpacking in the 1990s, I've carried a lightweight fleece jacket. The puffer jacket may have eclipsed it in popularity, and merino wool is sustainable and stink-free. But the humble fleece is durable, breathable, and light. It also costs next to nothing. (I have 30-year-old Marmot fleece that still works great.)

Much as I still love that old fleece, you may have noticed climbers and backpackers wearing a specific kind of new, high-tech performance fleece—whether it's the Patagonia R1, the Senchi Designs Alpha 120, or the famous, ever-elusive Melanzana Micro Grid. What is it? Do you need it? Here's a quick rundown of fleece varieties. Once you're done here, check out the rest of our outdoor apparel guides, from the Best Rain Jackets to the Best Running Shorts.

Long, long ago (since the 1980s, to be precise), there was just fleece. The lightweight fabric was invented by Malden Mills (now known as Polartec). And it was good, most of the time. The humble fleece jacket I've been carrying for all these years is great for breaks on high passes, when the temperature drops suddenly and the wind picks up. While fleece's wind resistance isn't as good as a shell, it can hold the wind at bay during hiking breaks. Fleece is also great around camp, and even off the trail, in town.

Depending on the temperature and ventilation options, it can also be a good option for aerobic activities. For example, a half-zip fleece pullover offers a little more ventilation. I often start out spring and fall days hiking in fleece through the cool mornings, and it works great. But when you're very active—cycling for example—you can overwhelm traditional fleece's breathability. Textile manufacturers began working on new types of fleece to address the lack of breathability.

Photograph: Squak Mountain

The fact that OG fleece does eventually get overwhelmed when you're really moving led Polartec, creators of fleece, to develop a grid fleece known as Polartec Power Grid. Grid fleece weaves in about 5 percent elastane (aka Spandex) in a grid-like pattern (hence the name).

The gaps in the grid allow more moisture out, which increases the breathability significantly. The gridded blocks trap air, keeping you warm. The trade-off is that grid fleece is much less effective in the wind.

Grid fleece is generally not intended to be something you put on at camp, but something you hike in during the day. Really, grid fleece isn't a great stand-alone garment. Where grid fleece excels is when paired with a windshirt or rain jacket. This combo is especially great for high aerobic-intensity activities like cycling. Pairing grid fleece with my Patagonia Houdini wind shell is perfect for early rides on cold mornings. Grid fleece with a wind shell is better at blocking the wind than traditional fleece and more breathable as well.

In 2017, in conjunction with the US military, Polartec created Alpha Direct fleece (sometimes called just Alpha), which is even lighter and more breathable than grid fleece. Alpha fleece uses a fishnet-like weave to hold high-loft fibers in between the weave. For military purposes, this layer was then put under a windproof outer layer, which makes it considerably heavier. But some cottage industry hiking companies got hold of the fabric and started making fleece hoodies using just Alpha Direct.

The result is a garment that has a startlingly good warmth-to-weight ratio, so long as the wind isn't blowing. As with grid fleece, you want to pair an Alpha Direct fleece hoodie with a windproof shell. Alpha Direct weighs next to nothing, and an entire hoodie can stuff down to not much bigger than your fist. Yet they are nearly as warm as a traditional fleece (until the wind blows). They've proved popular with thru hikers and other ultralight backpackers.

The downside to Alpha Direct is that the weave is very fragile. Any kind of rough bushwhacking will quickly shred your Alpha Direct fleece to nothingness. A friend who tried one in the canyon country of Utah likened it to being a big horn sheep—you leave a tuft of your jacket on every passing branch. However, if you stick to areas where abrasion isn't an issue, or you only wear it in camp, or you pair it with a shell, Alpha Direct fleece wins hands down on warmth-to-weight and for packing down to a tiny size.

For a while, Rab made a jacket called the Alpha Freak (no longer sold) that was an intriguing combination of grid fleece and Polartec Alpha Direct 190 gsm, or grams per square meter, fleece. It even had some Pertex Quantum over the hood to keep your head warmer. By all accounts, this was something of a technical marvel that a lucky few backpackers now carefully horde. Rab, if you're listening, bring back the Alpha Freak.

The answer depends on what you're doing.

Traditional fleece jacket: This remains the most durable and versatile of the bunch. It breathes, it's the most windproof, it's pretty light, and it's cheap. Solid fleece also dries very quickly (you can wring it out) and is warmer than your average sweatshirt. Go for a full-length zipper, and size up if you want to increase breathability. This is the best all-around option. When you can get one for less than $25 dollars, there's really no reason not to have one.

Grid fleece: If you're planning on being active in cold weather, hiking, biking, running, or walking, grid fleece is a better option. You'll want to pair it with a shell if there's any wind, but the increased breathability makes grid fleece the best choice for getting after it.

Alpha Direct fleece: The lightest of the bunch, Alpha Direct is great when you're headed into the backcountry and want an ultralight fleece as your insulating layer. Alpha Direct comes in a variety of fabric weights, from a partly see-through 60 gsm to a more useful (and durable) 120 gsm, all the way up to 190 gsm. I have not tested anything at 190 gsm. The most popular seems to be the 60 and 90 gsm, but I have found 120 gsm feels like the sweet spot between weight (about 8 ounces for a men's large) and warmth. As an added bonus, 120 gsm is about where you stop looking like a bizarre thru-hiking creature and have a jacket you can walk around town in without attracting stares. (Maybe. Depending on the town.) Just beware hiking in rough terrain. Snagging Alpha Fleece on anything will quickly destroy it.

In the end, depending on what you do outdoors, you might want one of each. Thankfully several of these are quite cheap. For traditional fleece I like a quarter-zip pull over, which can be had at Decathalon for $25, or if you want something a bit more stylish you can go for the Patagonia Micro D pullover for $70.

Grid fleece is the priciest of the bunch—Patagonia's popular Men's R1 Air is $180—though there are much cheaper options available. I haven't tested it yet, but several thru-hikers I know speak highly of Squak Mountain's grid fleece hoodie ($65). Alpha Direct fleece is getting more popular outside the hiking/backpacking community, which has led to numerous new options we're in the process of testing, but two tried-and-true standbys remain my top picks.

Both the Senchi Designs Alpha Direct 90 hoodie, and the Leve Alpha 90 hoodie are also great, though availability is limited. That also contributes to Alpha Direct's allure—many of the small companies that make these layers only make them in small drops.

The downside to fleece is that fleece is a huge contributor to plastic pollution, specifically microplastics, which fleece sheds when you wash it. Alpha Direct fleece is much worse about this than the others (did I mention that it's fragile?). The loose weave of Alpha Direct sheds pretty bad, both in the wash and on the trail. Many companies making Alpha Direct garments will include a microplastic wash bag, which helps somewhat, but it's still not ideal.

This is where wool wins. It's better for the environment and its made of natural, renewable materials. If weight or expense is not your primary concern, I suggest merino wool.

My best friend recently called my 13-inch iPad Air the “giant-ass iPad.” All my friends know how much I rely on Apple's slate, and that's because my only hobby outside of reading is binge-watching everything and anything. (Someone get me on Summer House.) But I also review iPads for my job, and have the entire lineup to choose from. As tempting as the large screen is, if I were to go out and buy my own right now, I'd get Apple's basic iPad.

Apple refreshed its entry-level tablet in March, and it's nearly identical to the 2022 model that preceded it. It's largely a processor upgrade with the A16 Bionic, the same chip inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15, and you finally get 128 GB of storage instead of 64. It's such a basic update that it doesn't even have Apple Intelligence—you know, the thing Apple won't stop talking about with every new product launch and software update. Some might even relish that, free from having AI shoved into every product.

The point is that, as basic as it is, Apple's regular-ass iPad is all you need. (If you do actually need a new tablet.) Whether it's going to be used to stream all the reality TV, to take notes in class, or to compose emails, this machine can do almost everything and remains the best iPad.

Apple is moving away from using generations to distinguish its tablets. Technically, this iPad is the 11th-gen model, but Apple officially calls it the iPad (A16), named after the processor inside. It looks like the old one, though I would've appreciated even more fun color options. Apple sent me the yellow, which cheers me up whenever I look at it, but a few extra shades couldn't hurt.

The LCD screen is now 11 inches, a measly 0.1-inch size increase from the prior model. Barring that, you still get the USB-C port, a 12-megapixel centered landscape selfie camera, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor baked into the power button on the edge. The bezels are chunky, a signature of all ""cheap"" tablets and screens. The smaller size is noticeable coming from the 13-inch iPad Air, but it's comfortable for getting work done (even with multiple apps and windows open), and I had no trouble binge-watching TV. (It is easier to carry, though not as portable as the iPad Mini.)

Apple iPad (2025, A16)

My desk is near a window, so I always have to keep this iPad at max brightness to avoid the glare (maybe invest in an anti-glare screen protector). No fancy nano-textured glass for you. Speaking of the glass, this is the only iPad that isn't fully laminated. There's a gap between the screen and the glass, so you might feel a slight delay when sketching with the Apple Pencil.

Frankly, if you want an iPad for drawing, you should skip this one. It only supports the first-gen Apple Pencil (the one that rolls off every table) and the Apple Pencil USB-C (the one that can't sense pressure). You cannot use the Apple Pencil Pro, and Apple has officially discontinued the second-gen Apple Pencil—even if you had one lying around, it won't work here.

And if you want to do some typing, Apple has the two-piece Magic Keyboard Folio. But the $249 price is absurd after spending $350 on the iPad. Just get a third-party keyboard case, like the Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard.

The A16 Bionic driving the performance has been snappy and smooth during my time with the iPad. I've mainly used the slate for streaming content, taking notes, and reading books on the Kindle app. I also used it to write some of this review—even with multiple tabs and apps open, I didn't experience any hiccups.

Unfortunately, since this isn't an iPad with an M-series chip, it doesn't support Stage Manager. It's the feature that enables a desktop-like environment, which makes it easy to switch between apps. I could only use Split View and Slide Over for so long before I returned to my MacBook Air. The basic iPad is fine for singular tasks like crushing through an email inbox, taking Zoom calls, basic photo or video editing, and mobile gaming.

Why is Apple Intelligence unavailable? The technical reason is that the A16 Bionic has 6 GB of RAM, and Apple Intelligence requires at least 8 GB, as seen on the iPhone 15 Pro. Apple also probably wants to gate-keep some of these features to its more premium devices. It doesn't matter for me, though. I already turned off Apple Intelligence on my iPhone and MacBook.

The basic iPad is still undefeated in value over competitors. Sure, the price jumps dramatically if you opt for more storage or go with Apple's first-party accessories. But the base model itself does everything most people need, and the iPad ecosystem has hundreds of accessories you can choose from to match your budget. It's an iPad that will easily last the next five years, if not more, and I for one am thankful there's no price hike despite the tariffs (knock on wood).

I will be sticking with this iPad as my daily tablet. I never feel like I'm not using it to its fullest, something I often think about while using the iPad Air. Basic is best, and the iPad is all I need.

Operatives from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Labor (DOL) have access to systems that house sensitive data pertaining to immigrants, sources tell WIRED. This access comes as President Donald Trump's administration has continued its crackdown on immigrants around the US, and DOGE has played a key role in collecting personal data on them.

WIRED previously reported that Miles Collins, Aram Moghaddassi, and Marko Elez are all DOGE operatives embedded at the Labor Department.

Collins has access to the DOL's National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) system, according to sources with direct knowledge. This program offers funding to organizations that work with migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as organizations working on the state level to support job training for low-income farm workers. Last year, the program disbursed $90 million in grants. Anyone legally allowed to work in the United States and who meets the program's criteria is eligible for support.

“When I say ‘migrant and seasonal farm workers,' that does not mean somebody who just arrived from Venezuela or something. It means essentially people who are authorized to work in the United States,” says a DOL employee familiar with the program. “Maybe there's some misunderstanding even among the DOGE guys.”

According to the source, access to the NFJP's system could provide the Social Security numbers of every person who is a beneficiary of the program, as well as what kind of services a beneficiary received. (Social Security numbers are assigned to US citizens as well as immigrants legally residing and working in the country.)

This kind of data, says the source, is normally “very, very controlled.”

Instructions to grant Moghaddassi access to data from the DOL's Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) reporting system were also viewed by WIRED. FLAG is responsible for a number of initiatives, including wage protections for foreign workers and visa programs for foreign and temporary workers. Data on visa applicants maintained in FLAG systems, sources say, could include names, work addresses, work history, phone numbers, email addresses, and an “alien registration number,” which is an identifier assigned to foreign nationals by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These numbers can be found on green cards, or permanent resident cards, and employment authorization cards. Permanent Labor Certifications (PERM) are also available in the FLAG system. The certification, according to the Labor Department's website, “allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently” in the US.

The instructions to grant Moghaddassi data access to FLAG appeared under a heading that reads “OIG access level,” which likely refers to the DOL's Office of Inspector General. The OIG at the DOL, according to its website, “investigates fraud, waste, and abuse related to the department's programs, including the foreign labor certification programs.” FLAG is the application portal for these certification programs. Larry Turner, the former Inspector General at the Department of Labor, was fired by Trump in January as part of a broader purge of the position across more than a dozen agencies. Trump has since nominated Anthony D'Esposito, a former US congressman from New York, for the job.

DOGE's access at the DOL also encompasses data that, while not directly immigration-related, could be used in conjunction with data that is. Collins, Moghaddassi, and Elez all have access to the DOL's Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program, WIRED has confirmed. This program at the DOL provides funding for people who were incarcerated and supports job training and other employment services.

While the REO database isn't immigration-specific, the data from REO could be cross-referenced with other datasets to figure out the immigration status of formerly incarcerated people benefiting from the program. If DOGE were to find crossover, a source at the agency tells WIRED, this “would fit so neatly with their messaging about immigrants being criminals and abusing government services.” (Despite claims from Trump's administration, there is no evidence that immigrants present threats to “national security” and “public safety” or that they abuse government services—in fact, research shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.)

Moghaddassi, Elez, and Collins did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Department of Labor.

Moghaddassi and Elez have also appeared as DOGE operatives at other federal agencies and have connections to Musk.

Moghaddassi has worked at a number of Musk's companies, including X, Tesla, and Neuralink; according to previous WIRED reporting tracking DOGE operatives, he has also been linked to the Treasury Department and DHS.

Elez, a 25-year-old engineer who has worked at Musk's X and SpaceX, has also appeared at the Treasury and Social Security Administration. While at the Treasury, WIRED reported, Elez had both read and write access to sensitive Treasury systems. Elez briefly resigned from DOGE after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez returned to DOGE after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X.

Elez is also staffed at DHS, according to Politico, as part of the administration's effort to bring together data from a number of government agencies to streamline and systematize DHS enforcement and deportation. Elez, despite his initial resignation from DOGE, has seemingly been tasked with a number of unusually sensitive assignments: He is also part of the DOGE team working on a system to sell the $5 million visas that Trump calls “gold cards.”

Elez is on this team with Edward Coristine, the young DOGE operative known as “Big Balls.” Coristine also has his hands in many agencies and recently appeared at the Labor Department, sources tell WIRED.

Coristine is another key DOGE staffer planted at DHS. He has also appeared at the Office of Personnel Management, the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of Education, the General Services Administration, and the Small Business Administration.

Coristine did not reply to requests for comment.

“This is an administration that is happy to go after people with legal status if it dislikes something else about them,” says Victoria Noble, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It's just one more source of information that allows this administration to target people who are here legally, but target them for deportation or other more advanced investigations.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Meta's Monopoly Made It a Fair-Weather Friend","https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-ftc-meta-trial-mark-zuckerberg/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

This week, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in an antitrust trial that could result in the breakup of Meta's social networking empire. It might be years before the nearly 3 billion users of the company's flagship app Facebook—known internally as the Blue app—learn the fate of the service they still use, despite the constant obituaries. (For the record, two years ago, Tom Alison, who heads the service, issued a statement affirming “Facebook is not dead nor dying.”) But with all the hubbub surrounding the trial, Facebook users might have missed the most significant news about Blue in years. On March 27, 2025, the 21-year-old company quietly announced a new feature on its mobile app: an option that would give users the novel experience of seeing their friends' content on Facebook. Finally, there was an alternative to a news feed overwhelmed with garbage, gossip, and influencer videos that people don't necessarily ask for but can't resist clicking on and then feeling bad about. By locating and selecting the Friends tab, your feed will populate exclusively with posts from people you know in real life and that you have chosen to connect with. You might even call it a social app. Imagine!

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

The company's explanation is telling. “Over the years, Facebook evolved to meet changing needs...” read the press release, “but the magic of friends has fallen away.” I marvel at the passive voice. Meta's valuation is over a trillion. It has connected nearly half of humanity—all because of the power of people wanting to keep up with friends and family. And somehow, the company's core purpose of connecting friends just … fell away? Did the thousands of engineers, designers, marketers, and managers working on Facebook just wake one day and say, “Hey, has anyone seen the stuff that's the very reason we are a company?”

No, this didn't just happen. Consider that, in that 2023 press release about Facebook not being dead, Alison listed the priorities for the app that year, including “artificial intelligence, messaging, creators and monetization.” Not a word about boosting friend content, even though Meta executives knew that people wanted to see just that. It came out in court that for years Zuckerberg has been aware that his users crave hearing more from their friends. A Meta survey in 2020 found that 61 percent of users wanted more friend posts, and 66 percent wanted to see a wider diversity of posts among their friends. A year later, another survey reported that three out of the top four “pain points” on Facebook were due to what the Federal Trade Commission called “reduced investment in friends and family sharing.”

Here's one explanation for this. Content from influencers, political activists, and faux news organizations is more profitable and keeps people on the service longer. Misinformation from a stranger is worth more to Meta than family updates and travel photos from friends. Those don't usually go viral. That's why, when Alison wrote about AI, he didn't mean using it to find what your friends are saying but to connect you with creators who are posting to boost their own wallets, with the help of Facebook monetization. On the stand, Zuckerberg offered a different explanation for the change: People began sharing on messaging apps instead of social platforms. But could it be that the reason that they stopped sharing on Facebook was that all those toxic posts from strangers made the platform unpleasant?

Zuckerberg was slippery when it came to admitting that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition—a key issue in the trial. But he was frank in acknowledging that the mission of the company has veered dramatically from the original feel-good crusade to connect humans. It's now as much an entertainment company as a social network, he says. A chart shared by Meta showed that entertainment had overwhelmed social content. In 2025, Facebook users spent only 17 percent of their time looking at content shared from friends. That's not because they prefer to read stuff from influencers and anger-boosters—remember, Meta's own surveys show that users are dying to see stuff from people they know. Yet Zuckerberg matter-of-factly noted that when it comes to friend content, “That part of what we do hasn't really grown.” Again, the passive voice!

Given the hunger people have to see friend posts, one might expect that the skills of Meta's talented workforce would be employed to maximize the value of human connections. For many years, it was. In the early 2010s, I was frequently called to Mark Zuckerberg's conference room, dubbed the Aquarium, to see some interesting project meant to increase the value of the social network. Some of those projects didn't work out—remember graph search?—but they were honest attempts at fulfilling the company mission. As the decade progressed, the social aspect of Facebook became less of a priority for Zuckerberg, and his passion shifted to virtual reality and artificial intelligence.

Here's the link to the antitrust case: Meta was able to shift to entertainment because it had locked in billions of customers who originally joined the platform to be in touch with their friends. Without worrying about competition, Meta could then turn the focus toward content from strangers. When Meta copies a feature like Reels from a rival like TikTok, its built-in audience will consume it, even if the originals do it better. The company was able to get 300 million users on Threads not because its Twitter clone was particularly great but because it could easily shift its Instagram audience to the new service. Its biggest innovations on its social apps in recent years aren't directed at improving the experience for users but at delivering content from strangers that compels you to click or becoming more efficient in serving personalized ads. Meta's gold standard is not a post about your cousin having a baby but some viral dispatch from an influencer or pundit, whether or not it makes you feel bad about yourself or appeals to some prurient instinct.

In another world I might be able to move my social network to another app that focuses more on preserving “the magic of friends.” But not in this world.

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know what the outcome of this trial will be. But I did write a book about Facebook and spent considerable time on how and why the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp. It was clear from my reporting—and internal emails now confirm—that in 2012, Zuckerberg thought Instagram was a competitive threat, and he forced the issue by offering to buy it for $1 billion when the company was worth only half that. I can sympathize with Meta's argument that it may be unfair to roll back a merger that the government originally approved—but I found out that at the time, one of the five FTC commissioners wanted to pause the deal and take its investigation to the next stage. He was unable to convince the others, and the deal went through.

The WhatsApp founders just plain didn't want to sell their company. But Zuckerberg's spyware operation determined that WhatApp's growth was a threat, and his offers kept getting larger until they reached the absurd amount of $19 billion for a tiny company with miniscule revenue. “Mark Zuckerberg checkmated us,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. “When a guy shows up with a suitcase of money, you have to say yes; you have to make the rational choice.” (Acton came to regret the move. “That is my crime,” he told me.) When a company dared not sell to Zuckerberg he would make good on threats to openly copy its product. While wooing Snap's Evan Spiegel, Zuckerberg mentioned he was thinking of doing a similar project named Poke. Snap refused the offer and Zuckerberg soon emailed Spiegel a message: “I hope you enjoy Poke.” (Facebook's clone flopped.)

I'll leave the remedy for all this to Judge James Boasberg—or Donald Trump, who may pull the plug on the whole operation if he feels like it. (It's good to be king.) In the interim, I've been using the Friends tab, and my feed is much better. The only problem is that so few of my 2,000 friends post on Facebook. They're seeking magic elsewhere.

Netflix is building a new search experience aimed at improving the discovery experience, and it's going to use AI to do it, the company's CEO Greg Peters said during its first-quarter results conference call.

Peters said Netflix is working on “interactive search that's based on generative technologies” to help people find different titles.

Answering an analyst's question, Peters said the company's most popular titles that dominate popular conversation draw 1% of traffic, and because of this trend, improving discovery and recommendation is important to the company.

“There is more room to improve the discovery and recommendation experience, and therefore provide more value for members, and therefore find the biggest audiences for our titles,” he said.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Netflix has been testing OpenAI-powered search with select customers in Australia and New Zealand.

The company, which also started testing a new home page design on its TV app that brought a new way to display show titles and descriptions, plans to roll it out widely later this year.

“This [Homepage redesign] is something that we hadn't made big structural changes to in over a decade. We believe that this will significantly improve Netflix's discovery experience. We've been polishing and improving that experience based on the input we got from members who used it,” Peters noted.

The company said first-quarter revenue rose 12.5% to $10.54 billion from a year earlier.

When news broke that OpenAI was in talks to acquire AI coding company Windsurf for $3 billion, one of the first questions on the mind of anyone following the space was likely: “Why not buy Cursor creator Anysphere instead?”

After all, OpenAI Startup Fund has been an investor in Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, since the quickly growing coding assistant's seed round in late 2023. (Anysphere is often referred to by its product name, Cursor.) It turns out that OpenAI indeed approached Anysphere in 2024 and again earlier this year about a potential acquisition, according to a report from CNBC. The talks failed. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital at about $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.

OpenAI's desire to move on to acquisition discussions with another coding assistant maker signals how important capturing a slice of the code generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. Windsurf is generating about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), TechCrunch reported in February. Meanwhile, Anysphere's Cursor reportedly makes about $200 million on an ARR basis.

While OpenAI's Codex CLI “agent,” which the company released Wednesday, can also write and edit code, its attempt to buy Windsurf suggests the company doesn't want to wait for CLI to gain traction with customers.

Nintendo announced on Friday that it will open Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. on April 24, following a delay due to the Trump administration's hefty tariffs.

Fans feared the long-awaited console would spike in price due to Trump's export rules on international goods, but Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2 will still cost $449.99 and come out on June 5, as originally announced.

Switch 2 accessories, however, will increase in price due to “changes in market conditions,” Nintendo said in a press release. The company added that other products could also face hikes down the road.

Most of the Switch 2 accessories seem to be getting a $5 price bump. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, which was initially set to cost $79.99, will now cost $84.99. Joy-Cons will cost $94.99, up from $89.99, and the new Switch 2 camera attachment will cost $54.99, up from $49.99.

As far as games go, Nintendo isn't changing the prices of the digital and physical versions of two launch-day heavy-hitters, Mario Kart World ($79.99) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($69.99). 

“We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing,” Nintendo wrote in the release.

Though the changing prices of accessories may concern some customers, they won't find reprieve from other gaming companies. Earlier this week, Sony announced that it would bump PlayStation 5 prices in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand due to shifts in the global economy. Fans expect that similar price adjustments will hit the U.S. eventually, too.

Certain electronics, like smartphones and laptops, are exempted from Trump's tariffs, but not video game consoles.

__init__ in Python already has a lot of alternatives. IMO a situation encountered similar to the example is when you do not take advantages of the alternatives or your code design is bad.Also, specifically for this case, if I need an object for this IO operation, I __would not__ uses dataclass. The first solution would be to create a context manager[2] and a NamedTuple (or dataclass if needs some mutations). 
If it's not a fit, the classmethod and the dunders __enter__, __exit __ are good if this fd implementation is important for the design of my object. Alternatively, I would just make a builder function outside my object if the implementation of the fd capability should be considered as extra and not a builtin for the object. 
The dataclass decorator could be added to save 1 line of code but would confuse the intent of the object which is a content manager with some state management.A side geniune question, why not a type[3] statement to alias the int as a fd?

It turns out that Silicon Valley's tech bros can't take a joke. Comedian Seth Rogen found this out the hard way this month, when he presented at an awards ceremony for scientific innovation, the Breakthrough Prize, which annually doles out awards of dubious merit to various members of the field's gilded class. Rogan's attempt at a light roast directed at the well-heeled audience, which included the likes of Google co-founder Sergei Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, did not go over well.

Rogen reportedly went off script when he took some shots at the tech bros in attendance who had contributed to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The Hollywood Reporter reports that Rogen said the following: “And it's amazing that others [who have been] in this room underwrote electing a man who, in the last week, single-handedly destroyed all of American science,” Rogen said. “It's amazing how much good science you can destroy with $320 million and RFK Jr, very fast,” the comedian said. THR notes that Edward Norton, who was presenting alongside Rogen, was visibly “uncomfortable.”

The audience of wealthy tech magnates was not impressed. The comedian's “ad-lib landed with a thud,” THR writes, and only received light applause. Worse still, the foundation that hosted the event proceeded to edit Rogen's jokes out of the video that would be posted online a week later. From the report:

Those watching the event on YouTube a week later, though, wouldn't have a clue about Rogen's pointed barbs. The so-called “full video” was subtly edited to make it seem as if Norton's “light applause” comment was a reference to his entrance with Rogen. The stream also cut out a throw-away joke Rogen made a few minutes later in describing the work of the physics prize winner, Gerardus ‘t Hooft of the University of Utrecht. Using the metaphor of a wheel to illustrate the concept of symmetry, Rogen said the wheel could roll either left or right — and quipped that the crowd would “roll right,” according to a source in the audience.

Gizmodo reached out to the Breakthrough Prize Foundation for more information about why they felt this was necessary. In a statement to THR, the foundation said: “This year's ceremony lasted longer than the prior few years, and several edits were made in order to meet the originally planned run time.” It should be noted that the YouTube video in question is quite long, at 139 minutes, but apparently not long enough to include another 30 seconds' worth of material.

Any of the tech dipshits in the audience who supported Trump's presidency very much deserved this. Under Kennedy, the Department of Health and Human Services has gutted federal grants for science research at universities across the country, while also firing droves of officials from critical health agencies like the FDA, the NIH, and the CDC. In the meantime, Kennedy is focused on commissioning a highly questionable study to help determine what can already be considered settled scientific ground: whether vaccines cause autism or not (they don't). Critics maintain Kennedy's changes will derail important scientific and medical research, while potentially putting Americans' lives at risk.

The Mandalorian & Grogu won't be in theaters for over a year but at Star Wars Celebration Japan, the audience was given an exciting tease, and here's what happened

Set for release on May 22, 2026, The Mandalorian & Grogu will be the first Star Wars movie released since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Set after the events of The Mandalorian season three, we pick things up with bounty hunter Din Djarin and his newly minted Mandalorian foundling, Grogu, as they go off on an adventure so big, it had to happen on the big screen.

Jon Favreau writes and directs while Dave Filoni and Kathleen Kennedy produce. They were all on hand at Celebration to show the footage, which began in the belly of an AT-AT. They're searching for a target and the camera pans back through the walker. Dozens of troopers are getting ready for battle when the back door blows off. It's Mando.

In the same shot from before, he goes off. He blasts some troopers, flame-throws others, shoots his wire, it's action packed. Once he's killed about 12 troopers, the camera pans back around to the commander in charge. And he gulps.

We see there are three AT-ATs (which look a little different from how we remember them, with almost buggier eyes) and the action has been in the back one. It explodes and falls off a snowy cliff with the other two still walking forward.

“Messy,” Sigourney Weaver's New Republic leader character says. “Very messy.” She's at a table with Mando and Grogu and Grogu tries to steal her snacks.

“You work for us,” Weaver says over shots of a Razor Crest ship flying and Mando and Grogu walking with Zeb from Star Wars Rebels. Next, he's exploring some dark area and turns a light on on his helmet, uncovering the remains of a droid.

There's a fight in a bar, a shot of Grogu swimming, the pair of them on a smaller walker running under the AT-ATs, and more. Finally, we see a mouse droid with what looks like off-road wheels driving. Through its POV we see Grogu and he stops it with the Force. It all falls apart and one of the wheels rolls away.

In the final shot, we're in the middle of an area with a very, very musclebound Hutt, and Grogu is in the crowd eating popcorn.

Starring Pedro Pascal, Sigourney Weaver, and Jeremy Allen White (just to name a few people who are confirmed), The Mandalorian & Grogu is out May 22, 2206

You'll be laughing it up like a fuzzball of another kind when you see this trio of Hasbro Star Wars figures up close—all somewhat inexplicably linked by their glorious manes.

In Tokyo, Japan for Star Wars Celebration, Hasbro just wrapped up showing fans what's coming for its Star Wars action figures, and to celebrate, io9's got your first look clean and up close at three of those reveals. Carrying on the Black Series' latest update to the classic A New Hope cast, we've got your looks at the newest Han Solo and Chewbacca figures, with Han featuring a new headsculpt complete with a wonderfully fluffy take on Harrison Ford's hair in the first Star Wars, while Chewie, as always, is covered in the stuff, bringing some new paint decos and updates to Black Series' tried-and-true Wookiee formula.

But perhaps the absolute highlight of the trio comes in a smaller stature… although not by much, all things considered. Continuing on the New Hope vibes in the 3.75″-scaled Vintage Collection, we've got your look at this furry epic: a Tusken Raider complete with Bantha mount. The deluxe set features the Tusken Raider figure with his own gaffi stick and rifle accessories, as well as cloth goods to make it easier for him to mount his fully articulated ride.

The Bantha, buried under all those layers of fur (it's very evocative of the classic Power of the Force Bantha figure from the '90s!), features an articulated head, legs, tail, and ankle joints, and can even open and close its mouth. Of course, it also has a detailed saddle atop its hairy back to place its Tusken rider. Check out all the pictures below!

You won't have to wait too long to get your hands on these figures—all three figures are set to release this summer, with Han and Chewie costing $25 each, and the Bantha and Tusken set costing $70. Pre-orders for each will go live on Hasbro Pulse and other retailers tomorrow, April 18, at 3 p.m. ET, although the Bantha and Tusken will be exclusively available through Pulse initially, before becoming available at Disney Stores at a later date.

Stay tuned to io9 for even more coverage from Star Wars Celebration Japan this weekend!

At Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan today during a panel celebrating 20 years of Lucasfilm Animation history, the studio confirmed its next big animated chapter will be none other than a Darth Maul series.

Carrying on a legacy that began with the 3DCG Clone Wars series, before carrying on into the likes of Rebels, Resistance, Bad Batch, and animated anthologies like the Tales series, Maul: Shadow Lord will follow Maul (played by returning Clone Wars and Rebels star Sam Witwer), seemingly as he builds out the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. The trailer shown to gathered fans in the hall included various Criminal factions like the Pykes reeling from attacks on shipments, only for Maul to reveal himself as the architect. While the show's look is a broad evolution of the art style seen in Clone Wars and later the Tales anthologies, there is also a new stylistic flourish in Shadow Lord‘s aesthetic that leans on rough lines and ragged edges, best glimpsed in Maul's crimson saber blades, which look almost fiery in appearance.

One of the most interesting elements of the whole trailer was that Maul finds himself what appears to be a young new apprentice in the ways of the Force: a young Twi'lek girl he liberates from captivity and then begins teaching. Alongside her tutelage, we see shots of gang wars, intense chases through the hustle and bustle of a city planet (not unlike Coruscant, but would Maul really be playing in his old master's back yard like that? We'll have to wait and see), and even an encounter with the Inquisitorius in the form of Ahsoka‘s Marrok, who expresses his surprise that Maul has survived even as he draws sabers with him.

Maul: Shadow Lord will release in 2026.

Almost three decades after it first hit print, Hisao Tamaki's legendary interpretation of A New Hope is getting new life as part of a luxurious new artbook celebrating Star Wars‘ history with Japanese comics.

io9 can exclusively reveal that during Star Wars Celebration Japan today, Dark Horse confirmed that The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope – The Manga will launch as a two-volume collection next year, spotlighting Tamaki's iconic artwork from newly acquired scans of Tamaki's original storyboards, alongside a new English-language translation. Ahead of the release, however, Dark Horse will launch its first-ever Kickstarter to take orders of exclusive editions of the book, including one collector's variant you won't be able to find at retail.

Ahead of the retail release, the Kickstarter for The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope – The Manga will let readers get access to two exclusive editions: a Collector's Edition, which will be the same as the eventual standard retail release but with Kickstarter-exclusive variant covers, and a Masterpiece Edition that will be exclusively available through Kickstarter. As well as reprinting Tamaki's work in two volumes at its original size, the Masterpiece Edition will include a third auxiliary volume, giving even more insight into how this unique corner of Star Wars‘ long symbiotic relationship with Japanese culture came to life.

The prelaunch page for the Art of Star Wars: A New Hope – The Manga Kickstarter is available for fans to follow now. The standard retail release of the collection will hit comic book stores and bookshops starting summer 2026.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to buy a premium MacBook Air, Amazon's current deal on the 2022 MacBook Air (M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage) is almost too good to be true. At $799 down from $1,119, this great model is now available for 33% off its original price point. It's a discount that brings it to nearly its lowest price ever for this configuration. Such a steep decline on an Apple device is very rare.

See at Amazon

The 2022 MacBook Air introduced the M2 chip and new case design that is almost identical to the latest MacBook Pro line. This model boasts a stunning 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with more than 500 nits of brightness and a billion colors for vibrant images and stunning detail for creative work, watching movies, and everything in between. The all-aluminum unibody looks sleek and contemporary but it is also extremely resilient over the years.

The M2 chip comes with an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, and it is coupled with 8GB unified memory (RAM) and a fast 512GB SSD for the model on sale at Amazon. Together, the set of components delivers more than sufficient performance for the run-of-the-mill user as well as even the heaviest of multitaskers. Browsing dozens of tabs, tweaking pictures and holding video calls—daily habits of ours—all seem fast and effortless due to the high memory bandwidth and design of the chip.

Although Apple has now launched the M3/M4 chips, the M2 remains extremely up to date and powerful for the vast majority of users. For general use—web browsing, office work, streaming, and basic creative pursuits—there is not much functional difference between the M2 and newer chips. The M2's efficiency also yields up to 18 hours of battery life on a single charge so you can play or work all day and not worry about looking for an outlet.

This MacBook Air's appearance is virtually indistinguishable from Apple's latest models with an ultra-slim and lightweight (2.7 pounds) design that is very portable for students or business travelers. The 1080p FaceTime HD camera, three-mic array, and four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio make you look and sound fantastic on calls. Connectivity is also well addressed with a MagSafe charging port, two Thunderbolt ports, and a headphone jack.

Obviously, this MacBook Air is built to last – both in terms of hardware and software. The aluminum chassis resists wear and tear and Apple's commitment to software updates means you'll continue to receive new features and security improvements for years to come. It can easily last 5 to 10 more years. Compatibility with popular apps like Microsoft 365, Zoom, or Opera will also ensure your workflow remains seamless.

With a design and performance capability (for day-to-day tasks) that's nearly the same as the latest releases, and a discount that's barely ever seen for Apple gear, this deal is the best MacBook deal on the market today.

The B580's biggest weakness is older CPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Intel Arc B580 is considered the cheapest modern GPU on the market today, with Tom's Hardware considering it the $249 GPU champion. However, several reviewers discovered that the budget GPU performs poorly on older processors. Intel has acknowledged the issue and will investigate it.

A moderator on the Intel Community forum started an Intel Arc Graphics and CPU Overhead thread, saying, “Thank you for your patience. We are aware of reports of performance sensitivity in some games when paired with older generation processors. We have increased our platform coverage to include more configurations in our validation process, and we are continuing to investigate optimizations.”

Reviewers first noticed the issue in early January, when they tested the Intel Arc B580 on older and newer CPUs. For example, Hardware Unboxed ran some gaming benchmarks with the GPU using an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and a Ryzen 5 2600. It also used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 as a control, and these are its results.

The Intel Arc B580 performs decently enough when paired with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with the RTX 4060 outperforming it by around 10% on average. However, the performance gap between the two entry-level desktop GPUs widens when paired with the much older Ryzen 5 2600. The RTX 4060 now gets a 22% advantage over the Intel graphics card, with some games returning an unplayable 30 FPS or lower. Note that this doesn't include 1% low numbers, which are much worse for the B580.

Hopefully, Intel can find a fix for this issue sooner rather than later, mainly as it affects the core market of the Intel Arc B580 — budget gamers. You might think that buying the B580 to replace your old GTX 1060, which was still the most popular GPU on Steam as late as 2022, will finally let you play some newer games. But you might be disappointed with this overhead issue, as it will preclude you from playing some game titles without upgrading your CPU.

This might not be too big of a problem if you already have an AM4 motherboard, especially as AMD is still releasing new chips for this socket in 2025. But if you have an AM3+ or older motherboard (or older Intel chips), you'll likely need to spend on a new CPU and motherboard, increasing the cost of upgrading your system to play the latest titles. And with tariffs jacking up prices everywhere, this might mean you cannot afford to play newer games at all.

Nintendo will open pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the United States on April 24, the company announced today. The prices will remain unchanged, with the system starting at $449.99 and a bundle with Mario Kart World for $499.99.US-based pre-orders were delayed shortly after the console's initial announcement ""to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions."" Some Switch 2 accessory prices are going to get pricier. A pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers that was originally set at $89.99 will now be $94.99 and the Pro Controller has bumped from $79.99 to $84.99. The Switch 2 camera, dock set, wheel set, and charging grips are all also seeing increases.""Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions,"" Nintendo's announcement reads.The system is still set to launch on June 5.Pre-orders were originally set for April 9, but were delayed as Nintendo dealt with the fact that it announced the system on the same day as President Donald Trump announced a sweeping series of tariffs. On April 9, Trump called for a 90-day pause in many tariffs (with the exception of an increase on tariffs on Chinese goods).Nintendo's titles, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Banaza (launching July 17) are not set to see price changes. They're currently listed at $79.99 and $69.99, respectively.The Switch 2 features a number of improvements over the original system, including a larger display with HDR support, a second USB Type-C port, and a more powerful graphics chip from Nvidia.The $449.99 price tag is quite a bit more than the original Nintendo Switch, which. launched at $299.99, leading some fans to fill Nintendo's streams with calls to ""drop the price.""Nintendo's announcement included an apology for the delay, and that the company ""hope[s] this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing.""

That comply with U.S. export restrictions, of course.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said in an interview broadcasted by CCTV that his company will continue supplying competitive products for the Chinese market going forward. 

Huang noted the importance of the Chinese market for Nvidia, emphasizing that it is crucial for the company to continue offering both datacenter and gaming products for the People's Republic. Yet, this is getting harder due to stricter export controls imposed by the U.S. gov't.

""We are going to continue to make significant effort to optimize our products that are compliant with the regulations and continue to serve the Chinese market,"" said Jensen Huang. 

The Trump administration restricted sales of Nvidia's China-specific HGX H20 GPU for AI earlier this week, which made Nvidia write off $5.5 billion worth of inventory for the first quarter. As a result, Nvidia now must obtain an export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce to ship its H20 for the Chinese market. However, the government is unlikely to grant one as it reviews such license applications with a presumption of denial. 

The U.S. government blamed H20's memory bandwidth and interconnect bandwidth for the restriction as both potentially enable usage of the processor inside supercomputers that can be used to develop weapons. It remains to be seen whether Nvidia develops a variant of H20 with lower memory bandwidth and fewer interconnects before the sweeping U.S. AI Diffusion Rule comes into effect in mid-May, though this is not a likely scenario. 

In fact, it is completely unclear how Nvidia plans to 'optimize' its GPUs for the Chinese market from mid-May and onwards as the new export rules prohibit selling American AI GPUs to adversary countries like China and Russia. Nonetheless, it looks like Huang's company is trying to find a solution. 

Meanwhile, Nvidia has criticized the AI Diffusion Rule saying that it would not stop development of Chinese AI technologies, but will likely encourage local companies like Biren and Huawei to develop their own processors, and, more importantly, standards.

""The increased restriction has impacted our company significantly,"" said Huang. ""We have grown up in China in fact, and China has watched us grow in the last 30 years. Of course it is a very large market interactions and working and serving the Chinese companies here […] so it has made us both better and so we are going to continue to make significant effort to optimize our products that are compliant with the regulations and continue to serve the Chinese market.""

A very slick operating system, but one with short support.

Ubuntu 25.04, codenamed “Plucky Puffin” was recently released. Ubuntu 25.04 is an interim release, bringing new features and updates for the venerable Ubuntu Linux distro, and I got hands on with a release candidate to tell you all about the latest version.

I've been casually using Ubuntu since 5.04 “Warty Warthog”, and seriously using it since 6.06 “Dapper Drake”, the first Long Term Support (LTS) release back in 2006. Before Ubuntu I used Red Hat, Mandrake (that was a great distro back in the day), Corel Linux (yes, that Corel) and Open Suse, but Ubuntu offered something a little extra: Ease of use.

Ubuntu 25.04 is not an LTS, this means that you will get nine months of support. An LTS release is made every two years, with the previous release being Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat). Ubuntu 24.04 will receive updates and support until April 2029 and beyond should you be an Ubuntu Pro user. But, for Ubuntu 25.04 we get just nine months of support. Interim releases are production quality, meaning that they can be used in a production environment. But if you need the ultimate stability, LTS releases offer “enterprise grade” levels of stability and support.

The latest Linux 6.14 kernel brings updates for graphics, security, and underlying resource management. The service manager systemd has been updated to v257.4. Netplan, the utility that simplifies network configurations.

Other notable upgrades include:

The installer uses Flutter, introduced a few years ago and while it is hard to get excited about an installer, Flutter does improve the experience for new and experienced users. I've used Linux for almost 30 years (I am officially old) and the installation process on those earlier Linux distros was scary.

Now it is clear, concise and dare I say a pleasurable experience. Improvements for Ubuntu 25.04 see an improved UX for dual boot systems (especially for Bitlocker partitions) and there is now the option to replace an existing Ubuntu installation.

GNOME 48 looks great, and at a casual glance it resembles previous releases. But, it does have a few new features and refinements for a better user experience. When a window opens, it automatically opens in the center of the screen. Reducing the “Where did my app open?” scenario that we have all encountered!



As great as GNOME 48 looks, we need to take some screen breaks, and the Wellbeing tool, found in the Settings menu, will tell you how long you have been using Ubuntu 25.04, and provide reminders to stop staring at the screen, and to move around.



Ubuntu 25.04 comes with some new app choices. Evince, a capable PDF document viewer has been replaced by Papers. Papers started from the Evince codebase, and has been partially rewritten to use Rust, and uses the GTK4 widget toolkit. If you are upgrading to Ubuntu 25.04 and have a personal terminal preference, then you'll be pleased to know that xdg-terminal-exec will respect your choice of terminal (Ghostty for example).

Updated applications include:

GNOME 48 user interface with support for HDR although that support is not enabled by default. You need to go to Settings > Display to make this change, but it only shows if your monitor is HDR-compatible.

Updated subsystems, the applications that work with the core Ubuntu OS to provide extra features include:

Support for Nvidia Dynamic Boost, which shifts power between the CPU and GPU depending on the workload. Gamers should see more performance when their laptop is plugged into the wall. Ubuntu 25.04 also brings “full support” for Intel Core Ultra Xe2 and Intel Arc graphics such as “Battlemage” B580 and B570 GPUs. If you rely on Intel graphics, then you'll see improved GPU and CPU ray tracing performance, along with full hardware accelerated video encoding for AVC, JPEG, HEVC and AV1 formats.



On my Lenovo X390 with 8GB of RAM and an Intel Core i5-8265U it ran smoothly and without issues. Installation from a USB drive took around 20 minutes and I elected to install third-party drivers for restricted video and audio formats. After the installation was complete, a quick reboot and I was presented with the glorious GNOME 48 desktop and the Plucky Puffin wallpaper.



The standard app launcher (dock) is to the left of the screen, and by default it takes up a thin column of the horizontal space. You can make this thinner, if your eyes are up to the job. I prefer to set this to 32 pixels via Settings >> Ubuntu Desktop >> Dock >> Icon Size. I also like to auto hide the dock when it is not needed, to free up a few extra pixels.



Pressing the Super (Windows) key will show a search box. Type in the name of your chosen application and Ubuntu will interactively search for it. It will suggest apps that meet the criteria. If you want to see all of your apps, click on the Ubuntu “circle of friends” icon in the bottom left. Pressing CTRL + ALT and then the left or right cursor key will swap between the two default workspaces. Handy for those of us who have a lot of applications open.



Speaking of the dock, here is where I have an issue. My issue is adding apps to the dock. If they are installed via the App Center or via APT, then all is good. But one application, the latest version of the Arduino IDE, had me scratching my head. You see, the app is not installed, rather it is delivered as a ZIP file or an AppImage executable. Both run on Ubuntu 25.04, but I cannot pin the icon to the dock. There is a means to do this using the GNOME debugging tool to hunt the app then create a new desktop file, but it is a shame that Ubuntu 25.04 hasn't made this issue easier to solve. Yes, I will make a short how-to covering just how I achieved this.



I was able to successfully install and use the latest version of the Arduino IDE, flashing code to my Arduino Uno R4 WiFi with relative ease.

In the top right corner is the Settings menu, and here we have quick access to common settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Volume and Brightness. This isn't new, but it is always welcome as it provides a single point from where we can tweak our setup. The “cog” in the Settings menu is where we can delve deeper into the configuration of our system and it is great to see that Ubuntu 25.04 continues to use a categorized list and provides a search function.

Software installation, via App Center and the terminal is a breeze. If you are new to Linux, stick to the App Center as it handles every aspect of application management for you. It can feel a little slow though. The progress bar when installing an application seems to take forever.

Under the hood though, Ubuntu is using one of two possible installation options. First it will look for a Snap, Canonical's sandboxed application installer which enables apps to talk to the underlying OS, but not make any major changes. The other option is good ol' APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) via the terminal. It shows everything as it happens, often at a dizzying pace. Sure the terminal is a confusing place for newcomers, but learn the basics and you will have a good foundation to build from.

If you want the latest Ubuntu experience, install Ubuntu 25.04. Nine months support isn't a long time, but you get a solid Linux desktop experience and a great selection of applications. If your work depends on stability, then the call is all yours. For enterprise / mission critical applications I would recommend sticking to Ubuntu 24.04 as it is an LTS and offers a longer period of support. If you work in production, and want to take the risk, go for it!

Home and hobbyist users can take the plunge with less risk, but always backup your drive(s) before undertaking the upgrade. Even with my now six year-old laptop, Ubuntu 25.04 feels fresh and speedy enough to get work done when on the go. Throwing Ubuntu 25.04 on my main desktop (a system with 32GB DDR4, AMD Ryzen 5600X with an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU) would provide me with an exceptionally slick experience. But right now I am rocking Kubuntu 24.04 as I am a sucker for KDE.

If you prefer other flavors of Ubuntu, the community has your back. There will be 25.04 versions of Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu MATE and many other respins available from today and in the coming days.

When it comes to cardiovascular health and shift work, when you eat may be as important as what you eat.

People who work night shift are known to be at risk for coronary heart disease and other potentially serious medical conditions. A new study, by researchers from Mass General Brigham in Boston, found restricting meals to the daytime could help avoid such problems.

“One way to understand our finding is that our body's internal clock is exquisitely organized to optimally coordinate virtually all aspects of our physiology with predictable cycling demands of the day and night,” said Frank A.J.L. Scheer, PhD, a professor of medicine and director of the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston.

Most people maintain the standard, synchronized cycle of sleeping and waking up, engaging in activity and resting, as well as eating and fasting, all in time with the rising and setting of the sun. “If we eat when our circadian system is supporting sleep, rest, and fasting, our organ systems are ill-equipped to cope with that,” Scheer said. “This is most obvious for metabolic processes such as blood sugar regulation but holds true for cardiovascular function as well.”

For the new study, published in Nature Communications, Scheer and his colleagues tracked 19 healthy men and women (age, 22-30 years) in a 2-week in-patient experiment.

To ensure simulated night work was the only outside influence on the participants' sleep cycle, Scheer and his colleagues imposed stringent restrictions on their behavior.

Participants had no access to windows, watches, or electronic devices that could clue their body clocks to the real time. They stayed awake for 32 hours in a dimly lit environment, eating identical snacks every hour. Afterward they engaged in simulated night work and were assigned to eat during the nighttime or only during the daytime.

The participants were then introduced to another routine to test the aftereffects of the simulated night work.

The primary outcomes were the percentage of consecutive heartbeat intervals > 50 ms (pNN50), the root mean square of successive heartbeat differences (RMSSD), and low/high cardiac frequency (LF/HF) ratio (< 60 beats/min and > 100 beats/min). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).

Meal timing significantly modified the effect of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (P = .001). For those whose timing of meals was manipulated, pNN50 fell by 25.7% (P = .008) and RMSSD by 14.3% (P = .02). Meanwhile, this group experienced an increase in LF/HF ratio by 5.5% (P = .04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (P = .04).

Nighttime meals also modified the effect of simulated shift work on blood pressure (P < .05), which dropped between 6% and 8% (P < .01).

“We hypothesized that maintaining the time of eating synchronized with the circadian system may alleviate the adverse effects of simulated night work on cardiovascular risk factors,” Scheer said. “We were amazed that meal timing could mitigate adverse effects even though sleep was still mistimed.”

Scheer and his team hope next to investigate the effects of meal timing in a more realistic simulation of a night shift. “These follow-up studies will help in the development of evidence-based countermeasures using food timing to improve cardiovascular health in shift workers and other populations with irregular behavioral rhythms,” he said.

Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is a disease linked to human papillomavirus (HPV)-related inflammation that leads to dysplasia and cancer, with symptoms including anal or pelvic pain, anal bleeding, prolapsed tissue, sensation of rectal mass, wetness and irritation, incontinence of flatus or stool, and obstipation. In 2025, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network published updated clinical practice guidelines for anal carcinoma.

Typical symptoms of ASCC — such as blood in the stool, a lump near the anus, and pain — can easily be misdiagnosed as benign anorectal conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. A change in stool caliber, resulting in pencil-shaped stools, is an indication of anal canal cancer.

Stigma associated with anal canal cancer may lead to delayed access to medical attention. Taking a thorough history of the patient's sexual activity and sexually transmitted disease is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

Best practices for ASCC screening vary depending on the healthcare setting, and it remains a challenge in high-risk populations. Men who have sex with men, immunocompromised patients, and patients with a history of HIV/AIDS should be considered for screening, given that 90%-92% of anal canal cancers are linked to HPV infection.

Accurate staging of ASCC begins with a thorough physical exam followed by a biopsy, which is essential for confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Unlike rectal cancer treatment, which often involves neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection, anal canal cancer treatment typically relies on chemoradiation with active surveillance. Pelvic MRI is the preferred imaging modality to assess tumor depth and anal canal wall penetration. However, distinguishing ASCC from rectal adenocarcinoma on MRI can be difficult, necessitating CT and PET/CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate lymph node involvement and distant metastases. For T1-stage tumors, endoscopic submucosal resection may be an option, though it often provides inadequate staging. Endoscopic ultrasound should be considered on a case-by-case basis if there is high suspicion of lymph node involvement.

For stages I-III (locally advanced ASCC), definitive chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin-C (MMC) remains the standard of care. If MMC is contraindicated, 5-FU with cisplatin is an alternative. Stage IV (metastatic) disease is managed with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, such as nivolumab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel. In 2024, retifanlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel showed significantly improved progression-free survival in the phase 3 POD1UM-303 trial, suggesting a potential new standard.

Patients with an inadequate response to chemoradiation require a 6- to 12-week observation period to assess delayed response. Persistent disease may necessitate salvage surgery, typically involving a permanent colostomy, though this is avoided when possible. Approximately 80%-90% of stage I-II patients respond to chemoradiation, while 35%-40% of stage III patients experience recurrence. Local recurrence is managed with salvage surgery, while metastatic recurrence requires combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Over 90% of anal canal cancer cases are due to HPV infection, yet standardized preventive care for ASCC is not recommended by guidelines (ASCO, NCCN 2025, ESMO). However, certain high-risk populations, especially immunocompromised patients, people living with HIV, and men who have sex with men, need preventive care.

A better understanding of anal dysplasia, including the diagnosis and treatment of patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), may be a means to prevent ASCC. Using the cervical cancer model as a guidepost, we can look at adapting colposcopy to anal cancer using high-resolution anoscopy to identify HSIL. Treating HSIL lesions could prevent cancer progression, mirroring the cervical cancer model, although evidence to support this is lacking.

HPV vaccination against oncogenic proteins such as 16, 18, 31, and 33, which has been incorporated up to age 45, is thought to reduce the incidence of ASCC as well as of cervical cancer and head and neck cancer. Treatment focused on targeting ablation or electrocoagulation may help prevent the development of ASCC.

In patients with metastatic ASCC, the phase 3 POD1UM-303 trial demonstrated that retifanlimab + carboplatin-paclitaxel significantly improved progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone, in addition to improving duration of response and overall survival. Findings of this trial will influence future treatment, suggesting that retifanlimab + carboplatin-paclitaxel may become a potential new standard of care for advanced ASCC.

In patients with treatment-naive metastatic ASCC, the EA2176 trial is investigating carboplatin + paclitaxel +/- nivolumab. Results are pending and will provide additional insights into the role of immunotherapy in this patient population.

 April 18, 2025  

Is racism a problem in Finnish healthcare? Finland tends to portray an image of egalitarianism, but there are indications it could be falling short in terms of providing equal healthcare to immigrants and people of color, and even when it comes to the experiences of healthcare professionals in the workplace.

A report published last year by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), for example, found that 33% of immigrants surveyed in 2022 said they had not received enough doctors' appointments to meet their needs, up from 25% in 2018 and higher than the rate among the general population (25%). Some groups fared worse than others: The proportion not receiving enough care was highest among people from the Middle East and North Africa (43%), followed by those from Russia and the Soviet Union (36%).

The survey also found that immigrants faced more discrimination of other kinds — for example, based on gender or income — in social and health services than the general population (9% vs 4%). But these statistics likely underestimate the rate of racial discrimination because Finnish population data do not include ethnicity. To address this, surveys use proxies such as native language or being foreign-born (defined as having both parents or the only known parent born abroad). But that overlooks the experience of Finns of mixed heritage, such as Finnish-born children of Somali or Arab immigrants. The statistics also don't capture the experiences of ethnic minorities in Finland, such as Sámi or Roma people.

“That's a challenge with our statistics because ethnicity is basically hidden,” Mona Eid, a development manager at THL, told Medscape Medical News. “There's been a lot of discussion on how to address that — for example, by asking people to report their ethnicity voluntarily in surveys, an idea, which has to be considered carefully because of historical injustices and misuse. But for now, a lot of experiences of racism don't show up in the statistics.”

The situation in healthcare reflects a deeper problem in Finland. Respondents from the country to the 2018 Being Black in the EU survey reported the highest (63%) prevalence of perceived racist harassment in the 5 years before the survey compared with the 12 other Western European countries included. The rate came down to 52% in the 2023 survey, dropping Finland to second place behind Germany (54%).

“We talk about how Finland is egalitarian and has the happiest people in the world. But then, at the same time, we have people here who experience discrimination on a daily basis in different fields of life. And somehow these topics aren't in the same discussion,” said Eid. “The myth of our exceptionality with regard to equality and equity hinders our self-reflection and self-perception when racism and discrimination are discussed.”

Racism and discrimination can directly affect patient care. “In my project, I spoke with a family of asylum seekers from a region at war,” said Lubica Vysna, PhD, who works at Moniheli, a Finnish network of multicultural associations. “One family member had a lot of mental health issues, and they were not getting any help. The healthcare professionals refused to speak with them in English, so they spoke through an interpreter, but somehow the meaning was lost, and their needs weren't sufficiently assessed. That person ended up without the help they needed for several months,” Vysna told Medscape Medical News.

Misdiagnosis or potentially dangerous incorrect treatments can result from problems in interpretation — or, worse yet, the lack of it. Hibo Abdulkarim, MBBS, a doctor based in Helsinki, shared the story of a patient who visited the emergency room three times in late 2020 with disorientation and odd behavior that was escalating. On his third visit, he was diagnosed with suspected psychosis and sent for evaluation to be sectioned. While routine blood tests and a CT had been done, none of the doctors who met him used an interpreter, which meant the diagnosis was missing crucial information, such as the patient's history or assessing his speech and overall orientation. “When he was finally met by a doctor who spoke his own language, that doctor immediately recognized that the case was a severe neurological issue and not psychosis. The patient had worked in a job that required fluent language skills, a fact that could be found in his medical record and should have raised alarms when he couldn't communicate in Finnish at all,” Abdulkarim told Medscape Medical News.

Abdulkarim added that this case offers an example of the problem of structural racism in Finland. “The issue isn't only some racist people but a system that allows a certain level of blindness to racism, as well as treating minority patients as second-class citizens,” she said.

Another case was reported by Finland's national broadcaster in a 2023 article about racism in healthcare. A doctor in the east of Finland consulted a surgeon about a patient with a possible fracture. Because the patient had a Somali background, the surgeon said they did not need strong pain medication or further imaging — but the doctor ordered further imaging anyway and found that the patient did in fact need surgery.

“In Finland, there's a widely used term, cultural pain, which is often applied to patients reporting pain. It's the idea that people from certain cultures exaggerate pain,” Ibrahim Ahmed, MD, a Somali-Finnish doctor who works in Helsinki, told Medscape Medical News. “It creates a huge barrier to seeking help and getting sufficient pain management,” he added, explaining that once a patient has had their pain dismissed as cultural, it creates mistrust. “What if someone has depression or something else that's difficult to talk about? They would think twice about telling the doctor about it.”

Vysna echoed this sentiment. “In our interviews with immigrants, I've quite often heard a lack of trust toward health and social services staff. They're afraid to tell their whole story because they feel they might get judged or face severe consequences, such as being separated from their children.”

The lack of trust goes in both directions. Ahmed shared the story of a patient who was brought in the middle of the night with chest pain and difficulty breathing — serious symptoms that call for immediate admission. Ahmed started with standard questions, and the patient immediately requested a different doctor. “He said he would prefer if the doctor were native-looking,” Ahmed said. “Those situations are very difficult to deal with because the patient doesn't want you because of your race, but at the same time, you have to remain professional and find a way to treat the patient.”

Fortunately, another doctor was present, so Ahmed handed off the case to his colleague. “But in this case, my colleague had less experience than me, so he ended up asking me what he should do,” Ahmed said. “I took care of the case but indirectly.”

Ahmed also described overhearing conversations involving patients requesting a native doctor when they hear that the one they have been assigned has an Arabic or Somali name. “Then I hear the nurse explaining my qualifications or saying that I speak Finnish well or telling the patient that I am Finnish to make me acceptable to them. It makes you feel small,” he said.

“I would want us to have zero tolerance for that. If you start justifying the doctor, that means accepting the situation, and it's absurd. Patients shouldn't choose what kind of doctor they want,” he said.

The accumulation of outright racism, microaggressions, and systemic racism takes its toll. Ahmed only remembers a couple of instances where someone has stood up for him at work. “In general, we get zero support for this. In the case of something like a sudden death or other shocking events at the hospital, we get a debriefing. But there's nothing for this,” he said. Ahmed wanted to specialize as a general practitioner, but because the higher patient volume in clinical settings means more racist incidents, he is now specializing in another field instead.

Finland has an aging population and a shortage of healthcare professionals. But workplace racism and challenges faced by foreign professionals in finding employment hinder addressing this problem. “There are trained nurses and doctors in Finland, but due to their foreign background, their potential is underutilized,” Katri-Leena Mustonen, MHC, a senior planning officer at THL, told Medscape Medical News. “We're working to train professionals not only in how to interact with patients and clients but also in how to collaborate with colleagues from foreign backgrounds.”

In fact, Finland is losing healthcare professionals that it desperately needs. “I know dozens of specialists and nurses who got their qualifications in Finland but have experienced racism, and so they've left the country,” said Ahmed. “People are making choices. The experiences accumulate and accumulate, and at a certain point, they decide they can do their job in better conditions elsewhere.”

Ahmed and Abdulkarim, who are married, are working to counter racism in Finnish healthcare and to spread anti-racist practices and attitudes. They have lectured about racism at universities in Helsinki, and they run an Instagram account where they raise awareness about structural racism in healthcare and how it affects people.

THL and other Finnish institutions are also working to tackle the problem. “We developed an online course on anti-racism for professionals, and it's been received well,” said Eid. “It's one of our most popular pages, and it's been incorporated into staff training in universities and other institutions.”

Eid said Finland's well-being service counties — the administrative units responsible for the country's health, social, and emergency services — recognize that discrimination affects their services and have shown a willingness to learn. But they are also facing budget cuts, making it harder for them to respond and adapt.

“There have been changes, but they're quite slow, and many of them are not immediately perceptible to the people who receive the services,” said Eid. In addition to anti-racism trainings, there is also a growing understanding of the need to provide appropriate communication materials for different groups or to use interpreters effectively for more inclusive healthcare, for example. “I am hopeful, but of course there's still a lot to be done,” said Eid.

Eid, Vysna, and Mustonen reported no relevant financial relationships. Abdulkarim and Ahmed reported occasionally receiving payments for lectures they give on racism.

Brexpiprazole was associated with a greater reduction in schizophrenia symptoms over 6 weeks in adolescents compared with placebo, with a tolerable safety profile, in a new phase 3 trial.

“The positive results of this trial, combined with previous extrapolation, pharmacokinetic, and long-term safety data, establish a body of evidence for brexpiprazole as a treatment option in adolescents with schizophrenia,” the investigators wrote.

The burden of side effects from antipsychotics is greater in children and adolescents with schizophrenia, wrote Maria Rogdaki, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, England, in an accompanying editorial. “In view of the unmet needs in the field of pediatric psychopharmacology in schizophrenia, this study makes an important contribution to the development of evidence-based pharmacological treatments in this age group,” Rogdaki wrote.

The study was led by Caroline Ward, PhD, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Princeton, New Jersey. The accompanying editorial and study were published online on April 7 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

The trial's generalizability was limited by its exclusion criteria, the underrepresentation of racial minorities, and restrictions on concomitant medications. It was also not powered to assess secondary endpoints or to statistically compare results of brexpiprazole and aripiprazole. The 6-week duration prevented the evaluation of long-term treatment needs, and recruitment took about 6 years because of ethical, regulatory, and competitive challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic further affected the study, with differences in site distribution before and after its onset limiting the establishment of conclusions. Additionally, individuals with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the research or reporting process.

The study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization and H. Lundbeck. All of the investigators reported having ties with various sources, and many declared being employees of the funding companies. Full details are provided in the original article.

Non-enhanced CT scans were deemed helpful in only 4% of haemorrhage cases, primarily in gastrointestinal bleeding, while contributing substantially to the overall radiation exposure. An analysis of 75 patients revealed that non-enhanced CT series accounted for more than 37% of the total radiation dose.

""Our findings suggest that a non-contrast CT scan as part of routine protocol for suspected bleeding can be safely omitted in most cases without compromising confident diagnosis of haemorrhage. Omission of the non-contrast scan results in a notable reduction of radiation exposure, which is therefore particularly desirable for young patients. However, it is important to acknowledge that in some cases non-contrast scan can be helpful, especially in suspected GI [gastrointestinal] bleeding or if oral contrast has been applied,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Johannes Bremm, Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. It was published online on April 11, 2025, in the European Journal of Radiology.

The retrospective study design and the moderate number of patients were some of the limitations. The inclusion of only cases with confirmed bleeding in interventional angiography could have resulted in selection bias.

No funding information was provided for this study. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

 April 18, 2025  

WASHINGTON — When a published case of auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) in China — caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae — received widespread publicity in 2019, patients reacted, sending emails to lead author Jing Yuan, in Beijing, China. Many of these inquiries were from patients in the United States who believed they might have ABS.

“Can you check to see if I have ABS?” patients asked Yuan.

For help, Yuan contacted Bernd Schnabl, MD, at the University of California, San Diego, whose research was addressing alcohol-associated liver disease and who was also interested in the gut-liver axis and the role of gut microbiome–derived ethanol in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

“She asked me, ‘Are you interested in looking into ABS?” Schnabl recalled at the Gut Microbiota for Health (GMFH) World Summit 2025. He dug in and formed what may be the largest research cohort thus far of patients with ABS — a group of 22 patients with their diagnosis confirmed through observed glucose challenge.

His soon-to-be-published research on this cohort has confirmed excess ethanol production — and elevations of both proteobacteria and fermentation pathways — in patients whose ABS symptoms had flared.

ABS is considered a rare condition, but “I'd argue that it's rarely diagnosed because many physicians don't know of the diagnosis, and many are actually very skeptical about the disease,” Schnabl said at the meeting, convened by the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

Patients experience symptoms of intoxication when ethanol produced by dysregulated gut microbiota exceeds the capacity of the liver to metabolize it and accumulates in the blood, he explained.

“Patients constantly talk about brain fog; they can't concentrate, and it can be very severe,” he said. “They don't get a firm diagnosis and go from one medical center to another, and they also suffer from complications of alcohol use disorder including serious family, social, and legal problems.”

The phenomenon of ethanol production by gut microbiota has been known for over a century, Schnabl wrote with two co-authors in a 2024 review in Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology of “endogenous ethanol production in health and disease.”

And in recent decades, he said at the meeting, research has linked endogenous ethanol production to MASLD, positioning it as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis. In one of the most recently published studies, patients with MASLD had higher concentrations of ethanol in their systemic circulation after a mixed meal test than did healthy controls — and even higher ethanol concentrations in their portal vein blood, “suggesting that this ethanol is coming from the gut microbiome,” Schnabl said.

The paper from China that led Schnabl to establish his cohort was spurred on by a patient with both ABS and MASLD cirrhosis. The patient was found to have strains of high alcohol–producing K pneumoniae in the gut microbiome. When the researchers transplanted these strains into mice via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the mice developed MASLD.

Schnabl's study focused just on ABS, which is alternatively sometimes called gut fermentation syndrome. The 22 patients in his ABS cohort — each of whom provided stool samples corresponding to remission or flare of ABS symptoms — had a median age of 45 years and were predominantly men, slightly overweight and not obese, and without liver disease. (About 48 patients with suspected ABS were screened, and 20 were excluded after an observed glucose challenge failed to establish a diagnosis; 6 withdrew from the study.)

During remission (no symptoms), patients' mean blood alcohol content (BAC) level was zero, but during a flare, the mean BAC level was 136 mg/dL. “To put it into perspective, the legal limit for driving in the US is 80 mg/dL,” Schnabl said. Within a mean of 4 hours after the oral glucose load used for diagnosis, patients' mean BAC level was 73 mg/dL, he noted.

To assess ethanol production by the patients' microbiota, Schnabl and his team cultured the stool samples — anaerobically adding glucose and measuring ethanol production — and compared the results with findings from stool samples collected from household partners who generally were of the opposite sex. Among their findings: cultures of stool from patients experiencing a flare produced significantly more ethanol than stool from household partners and samples from patients in remission.

To assess whether ethanol was produced by bacteria or fungi, the researchers measured ethanol production in cultures treated with either the antifungal amphotericin B or the antibiotic chloramphenicol. “Chloramphenicol clearly decreased the ethanol production,” Schnabl said. “So at least in this culture test, bacteria produced most of the alcohol in our patients.”

Taxonomic profiling, moreover, revealed “significantly elevated levels” of proteobacteria — with relative abundance of Escherichia coli and K pneumoniae — in patients who were flaring, he said. And functional profiling of the fecal microbiota showed much higher activity of fermentation pathways during patients' flares than in household partners or healthy controls. (Healthy controls were incorporated into the taxonomic and functional profiling parts of the research.)

Schnabl said at the meeting that stool cultures of both household partners and patients in long-term remission “all produced some low amount of ethanol, which was initially puzzling to us” but became less surprising as he and his colleagues reviewed more of the literature.

Asked during a discussion period whether ABS could explain chronic fatigue, a commonly reported chronic symptom in populations, Schnabl said it's possible. And in an interview after the meeting, he elaborated. “The literature clearly says ABS is a rare disease, but I argue that more patients may have ABS; they just don't know it. And I suspect some may have mild symptoms, like brain fog, feeling tired,” he said. “But at this point, this is complete speculation.”

Physicians should “be aware that if a patient has unexplained symptoms that could be aligned with ABS, checking the blood alcohol level” may be warranted, he said in the interview. A PEth (phosphatidylethanol) test — a biomarker test used to check for longer-term alcohol consumption — is an option, but it is important to appreciate it will not discriminate between exogenous alcohol drinking and endogenous ethanol production.

There are no standardized diagnostic tests for ABS, but at the meeting, Schnabl outlined a clinical approach, starting with a standardized oral glucose tolerance challenge test to detect elevated ethanol concentrations.

A fecal yeast test is warranted for diagnosed patients on the basis of some case reports in which ABS symptoms have improved with antifungal treatments. When the fecal yeast test is negative, “ideally you want to identify the ethanol-producing intestinal bacteria in the patient,” he said, using cultures and fecal metagenomics sequencing.

Treatment could then be tailored to the identified microbial strain, with options being selective antibiotics, probiotics and/or prebiotics, and — likely in the future — phages or FMT, he said. (These options, all aimed at restoring gut homeostasis, are also discussed in his 2024 review.)

Schnabl and his team recently performed FMT in a patient with ABS in whom E coli was determined to be producing excessive ethanol. The FMT, performed after antibiotic pretreatment, resulted in decreases in the relative abundance of proteobacteria and E coli levels, lower blood alcohol levels and fermentation enrichment pathways, and normalized liver enzymes.

After 6 months, however, the patient relapsed, and the measurements reversed. “We decided to do FMT every month, and we treated the patient for 6 months,” Schnabl said, noting that ABS had rendered the patient dysfunctional and unable to work. “He has been out of treatment for over a year now and is not flaring any longer.”

Schnabl and Elizabeth Hohmann, MD, at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, are currently recruiting patients with confirmed ABS for a National Institutes of Health–funded phase 1 safety and tolerability study of FMT for ABS.

Schnabl disclosed serving as an external scientific advisor/consultant to Ambys Medicines, Boehringer Ingelheim, Gelesis, Mabwell Therapeutics, Surrozen, and Takeda; and as the founder/BOD/BEO of Nterica Bio.

 April 18, 2025  

Abortion rates increased substantially from 2020 to 2023 in the United Kingdom and Europe, but not in Canada, a new study found.

“We are not seeing this kind of dramatic spike in abortion rates in Ontario, which has about 40% of the Canadian population,” lead author Laura Schummers, assistant professor of pharmaceutical sciences at The University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings suggested that Ontario's health services environment and Canada's regulatory and policy approach to preserving reproductive health services may have helped stabilize abortion rates, the authors wrote.

The findings were published on April 11 in JAMA Network Open.

The abortion drug mifepristone became available in Canada in November 2017. It had been widely used since 2000 in Europe and the United Kingdom, and its efficacy and safety profile were well-known. These circumstances enabled Canadian regulators to approve mifepristone's use without many regulatory restrictions, allowing it to be prescribed by an authorized prescriber and dispensed by a community pharmacist, Schummers said.

“Before mifepristone, most abortions in Canada, about 96%, were performed surgically in special clinics in urban centers. A large proportion of the Canadian population did not live in those urban centers and would have to travel, sometimes very long distances, to reach an abortion service provider. But availability of mifepristone changed that and made abortion more accessible,” she said.

To study abortion trends in Ontario, the researchers examined all medication and surgical abortions that were provided from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022, to women of reproductive age who had provincial medical insurance coverage.

They identified 422,867 medication and procedural abortions performed during that period among 225,540 reproductive-aged women (mean age, 28.5 years).

The abortion rate declined steadily from 15.6 abortions per 1000 women per year in 2012 to 12.3 abortions per 1000 women per year in 2021, and then increased to 14.1 abortions per 1000 women per year in 2022.

The introduction of mifepristone in 2017 was not associated with an immediate change in the abortion rate, but there were an additional 1.5 abortions per 1000 women by the first quarter of 2020 compared with pre-mifepristone trends.

Abortion rates increased more among women aged 15-19 years, less among those aged 35-44 years, and not at all among those aged 25-29 years.

During the early part of the pandemic (March 2020 to December 2021), abortion rates decreased by 1.2 per 1000 women per year. This decrease was most pronounced among women aged 20-34 years.

In 2022, the abortion rate returned to what it was before the pandemic, with a greater increase among women aged 20-24 years but no change among women aged 25-29 years. This increased abortion rate was consistent with 5-year trends following the availability of mifepristone, the authors wrote.

“Canada was unique during COVID because within weeks of the pandemic being declared, Canadian ob/gyns stated that abortion care was an essential service and ensured that no service disruptions occurred,” said Schummers. “We were well-positioned to seamlessly continue abortion service delivery through the pandemic and have had policies in place to support primary care and telemedicine abortion care since 2017.”

Efforts to restrict abortion are not successful in reducing abortion rates, she added. “Making laws to restrict abortion care is not the most effective way to lower abortion rates. When we preserve access to reproductive health services, when we prioritize these to include contraceptive care and abortion care, and we meet people where they are to provide access to those services as needed, we see over time a decline in abortion rates. Any increases that may occur tend to be small and short-lived.”

The reproductive health policies enacted by the Ontario provincial government could be contributing to the relatively stable rates of abortion, suggested Amanda Black, MD, past president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Ottawa, both in Ottawa.

Ontario has made contraception free for patients younger than 25 years. In October 2017, it began to provide mifepristone free of charge, she noted.

“We have improved access, we've improved coverage, and this has probably improved the ability for people who live in communities that otherwise would not have access to abortion services. Perhaps we are not seeing the abortion rate go up a lot because we're also trying to provide contraception for women under age 25 years,” Black said.

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, which is funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care. Schummers and Black reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Among patients with ulcerative colitis in remission who had been treated for a disease relapse, those who underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy combined with standard medical therapy had lower relapse rates at 1 year than those who received standard treatment alone.

""Appendicectomy is a viable and safe strategy for reducing the relapse rate in patients with ulcerative colitis compared with standard medical therapy at 1 year, offering a potential addition to standard medical therapies,"" the authors concluded.

""These findings suggest that the appendix might not only influence ulcerative colitis inflammation but could also serve as a therapeutic target,"" authors of an accompanying commentary wrote.

This study, led by Eva Visser, MD, from the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was published online on April 11, 2025, in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.

The absence of a sham-surgery control group may have introduced bias in the readouts of health-related quality-of-life measurements. Participation bias may have been present, as only patients in remission who were willing to undergo an additional surgery were included. Not all patients received follow-up endoscopy to objectively determine relapse.

This study was funded by Fonds Nuts-Ohra and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation.

Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the 2020 California wildfires was linked to an increase in mental health-related emergency department (ED) visits within 7 days of exposure, including increases of 8% for all-cause mental health, 15% for depression, and 29% for other mood-affective disorders, a new study showed.

“These findings suggest a potential link between wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure and mental health outcomes; healthcare professionals and systems should prepare for a possible increase in demand for mental health–related emergency services during wildfire events,” the investigators wrote.

“We need to make sure everyone has access to mental health care during wildfire seasons, particularly the most vulnerable groups and particularly as wildfires become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change,” lead investigator Youn Soo Jung, PhD, Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, said in a press release.

The study was published online on April 4 in JAMA Network Open.

ED visits may have been underestimated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding patients with both COVID-19 and mental health issues may have introduced bias. Limited data prevented the clear separation of wildfire smoke effects from evacuation effects. The use of retrospective billing data may have included coding errors. Additionally, data on individual-level exposure, lifestyle factors, and behavior changes were not available, and multiple comparisons were not adjusted for.

The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; John Rock Endowment; Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston; and the Sean N Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. Three of the 10 investigators reported having various ties with several sources. Full details are provided in the original article.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I want to briefly discuss a very interesting paper that is probably a bit controversial, but nevertheless, I want to point out the data. The paper is “Alcohol Consumption Patterns and Mortality Among Older Adults With Health-Related or Socioeconomic Risk Factors,” published in JAMA Network Open. 

This involved a little over 135,000 individual participants in a large, multiyear [research project] in the UK; it's part of the UK Biobank. This is a population-based cohort that they were looking at here and is only a small part of this huge effort in the UK. 

The particular participants that they were looking at here were 60 years or older and defined as current drinkers; that could be occasional all the way up to heavy. Again, that's the 135,000 individuals I'm referring to. 

The data were analyzed from September 2023 to May 2024. They divided the population into four groups, including what they call occasional drinkers, which I guess are social drinkers; it was not clear how they defined that. Then they defined three other categories, which were low risk, moderate risk, and high risk, which was much more clearly defined as it was stated in the paper the amount of alcohol consumption each individual had per day.

The question there was about the relationship between how much alcohol an individual stated they drank compared with the occasional drinker, and the risk for cancer in each group. The answer is that there was no protection from cancer by only being a low-risk or a low-level drinker. 

All of the populations had a higher risk for cancer compared with the occasional drinkers. The low-risk group was not protected. The high-risk group had a hazard ratio of 1.39, which is a 39% increase. For the moderate-risk group, the hazard ratio was 1.15, and for the low-risk group, 1.11. 

The risk was higher the more an individual drank. However, the point to be made is that if someone says, “Oh, I drink a certain amount each day, but there's no impact on my risk for cancer,” these data do not support that conclusion. 

There is much more to be discussed about this topic. It's an interesting, large population-based, very carefully controlled analysis being done here, but an important point for future conversation. 

Thank you for your attention.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Orforglipron, Eli Lilly's investigational oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), achieved positive phase 3 results for both A1c and weight loss, according to top-line data released by the company.

The findings came from Lilly's ACHIEVE-1, the first of seven phase 3 trials examining the safety and efficacy of orforglipron in over 6000 patients with diabetes and obesity. Full results will be presented on June 2025 at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 85th Scientific Sessions and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Orforglipron is a once-daily nonpeptide small molecule that can be taken any time of day without restrictions on meals or water intake. This contrasts with the currently approved oral GLP-1 RA semaglutide (Rybelsus, Novo Nordisk), a peptide which ideally should be taken fasting and with no food or water for at least 30 minutes after ingestion to prevent degradation.

Asked to comment on the new top-line data, independent consultant Charles M. Alexander, MD, told Medscape Medical News that the results are “Great news for Lilly. A pill taken daily is going to be much easier for patients compared to injections, even once-weekly injections. A1c and weight loss were at least as good as semaglutide phase 3 type 2 diabetes data, if not a little bit better.”

However, Alexander added, “We need a head-to-head study to really understand both comparative efficacy and safety. What is the price going to be? The presentation at ADA and the publication…will help fill in the gaps not included in the top-line results.”

In a statement from the UK Science Media Centre, Naveed Sattar, MD, professor of cardiometabolic medicine/honorary consultant, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, said, “These are important results. Having new oral agents that lower glucose but also meaningfully lower weight well beyond levels seen with most existing diabetes therapies is critical to future type 2 diabetes care.”

Sattar added, “Of course, one caveat is that we do not know the effects of this newer therapy on cardiovascular outcomes, but this will be forthcoming in future trials. It is also good to hear about the safety profile of these new oral GLP-1 RA drugs — especially the liver results — and it will be good to see the data in a full publication in due course.”

In ACHIEVE-1, 559 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of three orforglipron doses (3, 12, or 36 mg) or placebo for 40 weeks.

Percentage point reductions in A1c from baseline average 8.0% ranged from 1.3 with the 3-mg dose to 1.6 for the 12-mg dose vs 0.1 with placebo. All the A1c reductions were statistically significant. More than 65% of those taking the 36-mg dose achieved an A1c level of 6.5% or below.

Weight reduction, a secondary endpoint, ranged from 4.7% with the 3-mg dose to 7.9% with the 36-mg dose vs 1.6% with placebo. Absolute weight losses were 4.4 kg to 7.3 kg vs 1.3 kg, respectively. The results for 12-mg and 36-mg doses were statistically significant.

“Given that participants had not yet reached a weight plateau at the time the study ended, it appears that full weight reduction was not yet attained,” according to Lilly.

As with other GLP-1 RA medications, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Diarrhea was reported in 19% of patients with the 3-mg dose, 21% with the 12-mg dose, and 26% with the 36-mg dose vs 9% with placebo. Nausea was reported in 13%, 18%, and 16% vs 2%, respectively, and vomiting in 5%, 7%, and 14% vs 1%, respectively.

Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 6%, 4%, and 8% vs 1%, respectively. There were no hepatic safety signals.

Alexander noted, “The adverse event profile was GI [gastrointestinal]–related like semaglutide but somewhat different with diarrhea leading the list. Vomiting was not as frequently reported as with semaglutide.”

As of now, there is no information about pricing for orforglipron. But a nonpeptide GLP-1 RA could be mass produced and, therefore, potentially more widely accessible than the injectables, a phase 2 study investigator told Medscape Medical News after presenting those data at the 2023 ADA meeting.

According to the Lilly statement, “If approved, the company is confident in its ability to launch orforglipron worldwide without supply constraints.”

More results from ACHIEVE-1 phase 3 clinical trials will be released later in 2025, along with findings from the ATTAIN phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating orforglipron for weight management. “Lilly expects to submit orforglipron for weight management to global regulatory agencies by the end of this year, with the submission for the treatment of type 2 diabetes anticipated in 2026,” the company said.

 April 18, 2025  

Incorporating a polygenic risk score into prostate cancer screening could enhance the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer that conventional screening may miss, according to results of the BARCODE 1 clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom.

The study found that about 72% of participants with high polygenic risk scores were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancers, which would not have been detected with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing or MRI.

“With this test, it could be possible to turn the tide on prostate cancer,” study author Ros Eeles, PhD, professor of oncogenetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, England, said in a statement following the publication of the analysis in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Prostate cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men. As a screening tool, PSA testing has been criticized for leading to a high rate of false positive results and overdiagnosis — defined as a screen-detected cancer that would take longer to progress to clinical cancer than the patient's lifetime. Both issues can result in overtreatment.

Given prostate cancer's high heritability and the proliferation of genome-wide association studies identifying common genetic variants, there has been growing interest in using polygenic risk scores to improve risk stratification and guide screening.

“Building on decades of research into the genetic markers of prostate cancer, our study shows that the theory does work in practice — we can identify men at risk of aggressive cancers who need further tests and spare the men who are at lower risk from unnecessary treatments,” said Eeles.

The BARCODE 1 study, conducted in the United Kingdom, tested the clinical utility of a polygenic risk score as an adjunct to screening.

The researchers recruited men aged 55-69 years from primary care centers in the United Kingdom. Using germline DNA extracted from saliva, they derived polygenic risk scores from 130 genetic variants known to be associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer.

Among a total of 6393 men who had their scores calculated, 745 (12%) had a score in the top 10% of genetic risk (≥ 90th percentile) and were invited to undergo further screening.

Of these, 468 (63%) accepted the invite and underwent multiparametric MRI and transperineal prostate biopsy, irrespective of the PSA level. Overall, 187 (40%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer following biopsy. Of the 187 men with prostate cancer, 55% (n = 103) had disease classified as intermediate or high risk (Gleason score ≥ 7) per National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria and therefore warranted further treatment.

Researchers then compared screening that incorporated polygenic risk scores with standard screening with PSA levels and MRI.

When participants' risk was stratified by their polygenic risk score, 103 patients (55%) with prostate cancer could be classified as intermediate or higher risk, thus warranting treatment. Overall, 74 (71.8%) of those cancers would have been missed using the standard diagnostic pathway in the United Kingdom, which requires patients to have a high PSA level (> 3.0 μg/L) as well as a positive MRI result. These 74 patients either had PSA levels ≤ 3.0 μg/L or negative MRIs, which would mean these patients would typically fall below the action threshold for further testing.

Of the 103 participants warranting treatment, 40 of these men would have been classified as unfavorable intermediate, high, or very high risk, which would require radical treatment. Among this group, roughly 43% would have been missed using the UK diagnostic pathway. 

However, the investigators estimated a rate of overdiagnosis with the use of polygenic risk scores of 16%-21%, similar to the overdiagnosis estimates in two prior PSA-based screening studies, signaling that the addition of polygenic risk scores does not necessarily reduce the risk for overdiagnosis.

Overall, “this study is the strongest evidence to date on the clinical utility of a polygenic score for prostate cancer screening,” commented Michael Inouye, professor of systems genomics & population health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, in a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Centre (SMC).

“I suspect we will look back on this as a landmark study that really made the clinical case for polygenic scores as a new tool that moved health systems from disease management to early detection and prevention,” said Inouye, who was not involved in the study.

However, other experts were more cautious about the findings.

Dusko Ilic, MD, professor of stem cell sciences, King's College London, London, England, said the results are “promising, especially in identifying significant cancers that would otherwise be missed,” but cautioned that “there is no direct evidence yet that using [polygenic risk scores] improves long-term outcomes such as mortality or quality-adjusted life years.”

“Modeling suggests benefit, but empirical confirmation is needed,” Ilic said in the SMC statement.

The hope is that the recently launched TRANSFORM trial will help answer some of these outstanding questions.

The current study suggests that polygenic risk scores for prostate cancer “would be a useful component of a multimodality screening program that assesses age, family history of prostate cancer, PSA, and MRI results as triage tools before biopsy is recommended,” David Hunter, MPH, ScD, with Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, and University of Oxford, Oxford, England, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.

“To make this integrated program a reality, however, changes to infrastructure would be needed to make running and analyzing a regulated genome array as easy as requesting a PSA level or ordering an MRI. Clearly, we are far from that future,” Hunter cautioned. 

“A possible first step that would require less infrastructure could be to order a polygenic risk score only for men with a positive PSA result, then use the polygenic risk score to determine who should undergo an MRI, and then use all the information to determine whether biopsy is recommended,” Hunter said.

In his view, the current study is a “first step on a long road to evaluating new components of any disease screening pathway.”

The research received funding from the European Research Council, the Bob Willis Fund, Cancer Research UK, the Peacock Trust, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden and The Institute of Cancer Research.

 April 17, 2025  

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new indication for osilodrostat (Isturisa, Recordati) as second-line treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adults with Cushing syndrome.

Endogenous Cushing syndrome is a condition of excess cortisol that can result in complications such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, thin skin, and muscle weakness.

Osilodrostat, an oral cortisol synthesis inhibitor, was previously approved for treating adults with Cushing disease, a subtype of Cushing syndrome in which the hypercortisolemia is due to pituitary overstimulation. Both indications are for people who can't undergo surgery or who have had surgery that wasn't curative.

The new indication was supported by an “extensive clinical development program” involving more than 350 adults with Cushing syndrome, according to Recordati.

The most common side effects of osilodrostat are adrenal insufficiency, fatigue, nausea, headache, and swelling of the legs and ankles or other signs of edema. Its efficacy and safety in children isn't known.

In an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, a team led by researchers from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH) say public ignorance and apathy towards bird flu (highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI) could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a larger-scale public health crisis.

The authors, including CUNY SPH Assistant Professor Rachael Piltch-Loeb, Associate Professor Katarzyna Wyka, Professor Jeffrey V. Lazarus, Senior Scholar Kenneth Rabin, Distinguished Lecturer Scott C. Ratzan, and Dean Ayman El-Mohandes, conducted a population representative survey of U.S. residents from August 5 to 15, 2024, which used an in-depth sampling framework and intentional oversampling of rural populations.

The results suggest many respondents were unaware of simple food safety practices that could reduce the risk of HPAI infection. Over half (53.7%) did not know that pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, although almost three of four respondents (71.3%) did understand that cooking meat at high temperatures could eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses like H5N1.

Over a quarter (27%) of respondents said they were unwilling to modify their diet to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, and more than one in four respondents (28.7%) expressed reluctance to take a potential vaccine for H5N1, even if advised by the CDC to do so.

Participants who described themselves as Republicans or Independents were significantly less likely than Democrats to support either vaccination or dietary modifications.

Rural Americans, many of whom are more likely to work or live in or near livestock industries, were less likely to accept public health measures, including vaccination and dietary changes, compared to their urban counterparts.

""These attitudes could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a major public health crisis,"" says Piltch-Loeb, the study's lead author. ""The fact that responses vary significantly by political party and geography emphasizes the need for a carefully segmented health communications strategy to address the issue.""

Rabin, who has been engaged in health communications campaigns for more than four decades, adds that, ""Working closely with agricultural leaders, farm communities and food processing companies will be critical, and the fact that most of the agricultural workers who are at direct risk of exposure to the bird flu virus may be undocumented could seriously jeopardize efforts to track and control the spread of infections.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Smoking linked to higher risk of surgery complications","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250417/Smoking-linked-to-higher-risk-of-surgery-complications.aspx","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 03:07:00 GMT","

Smokers and people who recently quit are more likely to face complications after having an operation than non-smokers, a new study reveals.

Experts say there is an urgent need for focussed action to encourage people to stop smoking before undergoing elective surgery, after the pan-European research revealed that 19.5% of elective surgery patients are current smokers.

Backed by National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) funding, researchers discovered higher smoking rates among younger patients (18-40 years: 26.8%) and male patients (22.1%). Healthy adults without long-term conditions also exhibited higher smoking rates (24.6%).

Publishing their findings in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe, researchers at the University of Birmingham, working with the STARSurg Collaborative, reveal that current smokers and recent ex-smokers (those quitting within six weeks to one year before surgery) face higher odds of postoperative complications compared to patients who had never smoked.

Our findings highlight the high prevalence of smoking among elective surgical patients, particularly among younger and healthier individuals. Since we know that these patients are more likely than non-smokers to experience postoperative complications requiring extra bed days, the potential cost to the NHS is huge.""

Dr. Sivesh Kamarajah, Lead Author, University of Birmingham

""This presents a unique opportunity for healthcare providers to put in place effective smoking cessation strategies, improving both short-term surgical outcomes and long-term health. Embedding strong programmes to help people quit smoking into elective surgical systems may lead to more efficient, preventive care across the entire health system.

Researchers analyzed data from 16,327 patients across 442 hospitals in 29 European countries. The study was conducted as part of the CASCADE cohort study, involving a comprehensive analysis of smoking status and its impact on postoperative complications among patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery.

""We found high complication rates up to a year after quitting smoking, which is surprising and challenges current convention, added Dr Kamarajah. ""Poor short-term outcomes amongst current smoker exposes the urgent need to strengthen smoking cessation pathways for planned elective surgical care, where waiting times may be up to three to six months before surgery.""

Tobacco smoking remains a leading risk factor globally, contributing to over 10% of all deaths and nearly 142 million years of life lost annually. Despite concerted public health measures, Europe retains the highest regional smoking prevalence, with 36% of men and 20% of women actively smoking.

Within healthcare, elective activities in secondary care, including planned surgery, represent a critical but underleveraged setting for preventive interventions such as smoking cessation. Existing guidelines recommend smoking cessation up to six weeks before surgery to reduce risk of complications; however, this guidance is largely based on studies conducted over a decade ago.

Emmarie Huetteman KFF Health News Emmarie Huetteman, senior editor, oversees a team of Washington reporters, as well as ""Bill of the Month"" and KFF Health News' ""What the Health?"" She previously spent more than a decade reporting on the federal government, most recently covering surprise medical bills, drug pricing reform, and other health policy debates in Washington and on the campaign trail. 

The secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contradicted his agency's researchers this week with unsubstantiated or outright false claims about autism spectrum disorder and those with the condition. His public remarks were not the only recent example of Kennedy speaking against his employees; during an introductory appearance at the FDA, Kennedy said the staff — reeling from the layoffs of 3,500 colleagues — had become beholden to the industries they regulate.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices as his administration signaled that tariffs on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients could be on deck. And new data shows that the number of abortions performed nationwide increased slightly last year, as travel and telehealth prescribing maintained access for some patients in states with abortion bans.

This week's panelists are Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News, Jessie Hellmann of CQ Roll Call, and Shefali Luthra of The 19th.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Julie Rovner of KFF Health News interviews Krista Harrison and Robbie Zimbroff, health policy researchers at the University of California-San Francisco. They share some background on a case before the Supreme Court next week, Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, which challenges the ability of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to make expert recommendations for American health.

Plus, for ""extra credit,"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too:

Emmarie Huetteman: KFF Health News' ""States Push Medicaid Work Rules, but Few Programs Help Enrollees Find Jobs,"" by Sam Whitehead, Phil Galewitz, and Katheryn Houghton.

Anna Edney: ProPublica's ""Unsanitary Practices Persist at Baby Formula Factory Whose Shutdown Led to Mass Shortages, Workers Say,"" by Heather Vogell.

Jessie Hellmann: The Hill's ""Military's Use of Toxic 'Forever Chemicals' Leaves Lasting Scars,"" by Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin.

Shefali Luthra: The 19th's ""Trump's Push for 'Beautiful Clean Coal' Could Lead to More Premature Births,"" by Jessica Kutz.

PBS News Weekend's Ali Rogin spoke with KFF Health News contributor Michelle Andrews about what some people with missing limbs consider a disparity in health insurance coverage: Though a knee replacement likely would be covered, a prosthetic knee isn't always. A prosthetic device can be subject to cost caps and an amputee may be required to prove medical necessity for coverage. Andrews recently explored these issues in her article ""Health Insurers Limit Coverage of Prosthetic Limbs, Questioning Their Medical Necessity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Yale study links childhood thyroid cancer risk to air and light pollution","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250417/Yale-study-links-childhood-thyroid-cancer-risk-to-air-and-light-pollution.aspx","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 02:49:00 GMT","

A new study led by researchers at Yale University suggests that early-life exposure to two widespread environmental pollutants- small particle air pollution and outdoor artificial light at night-could increase the risk of pediatric thyroid cancer.

The study-a collaborative effort involving multiple Yale departments and institutions across the U.S.-found a ""significant association"" between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and outdoor artificial light at night (O-ALAN) and increased risk of papillary thyroid cancer in children and young adults up to 19 years old. The exposures occurred during the perinatal stage of life, typically defined as the time from when pregnancy occurs up to a year after birth.

These results are concerning, especially given how widespread both of these exposures are. Fine particulate matter is found in urban air pollution due to automobile traffic and industrial activity, and artificial light at night is common, particularly in densely populated urban areas.""

Dr. Nicole Deziel, PhD, MHS, environmental epidemiologist with the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) and study's lead author

The research team analyzed data from 736 individuals diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer before age 20 and 36,800 matched control participants based on birth year. Using advanced geospatial and satellite modeling, the team assessed individual-level exposure to PM2.5 and O-ALAN based on residential location at birth. All of the study participants were from California.

The findings showed that for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 exposure, the odds of developing thyroid cancer rose by 7% overall. The strongest association between exposure and thyroid cancer was found among teenagers (15–19 years of age) and Hispanic children. Similarly, children born in areas with high levels of exposure to outdoor light at night were 23–25% more likely to develop thyroid cancer, according to the study.

""Thyroid cancer is among the fastest growing cancers among children and adolescents, yet we know very little about what causes it in this population,"" said Deziel, an associate professor of epidemiology (environmental health sciences) and co-director of the Yale Center for Perinatal, Pediatric, and Environmental Epidemiology. ""Our study is the first large-scale investigation to suggest that these exposures early in life-specifically to PM2.5 and outdoor light at night-may play a role in this concerning trend.""

In addition to Deziel, the research team included experts from Yale's Departments of Biostatistics, Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and Pediatrics, as well as researchers from the University of Southern California, UC Berkeley, and the American Cancer Society. Deziel and several of the study's authors are affiliated with the Yale Cancer Center. The team's collective expertise ranged from environmental exposure modeling and biostatistics to pediatric endocrinology and cancer epidemiology.

The impact of papillary thyroid cancer on children can be extensive.

Compared to adults, children are often diagnosed with thyroid cancer at more advanced stages with larger tumor sizes. Pediatric survivors of thyroid cancer can suffer aftereffects ranging from temperature dysregulation and headaches to physical disabilities and mental fatigue. The disease can interfere with important life milestones such as education, employment, and raising a family and it can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression.

Both PM2.5 and O-ALAN are considered environmental carcinogens that have been shown to disrupt the body's endocrine system, including thyroid function, in animals and adults. The particles associated with PM2.5 pose a threat because they are small enough to enter the bloodstream and can interfere with hormone signaling, including those involved in regulating cancer pathways. Outdoor artificial light at night has been shown to suppress melatonin and alter circadian rhythms, which can also influence hormone-regulated cancer pathways.

The current research raises important environmental justice concerns. Communities of color and lower-income populations are often disproportionately exposed to both air pollution and light pollution-inequities that may contribute to the higher thyroid cancer burden observed in Hispanic children.

The researchers emphasized that more work is needed to replicate and expand on their findings, ideally using improved exposure metrics and longitudinal designs.

""In the meantime,"" Deziel noted, ""our results point to the critical importance of addressing environmental factors in childhood cancer research. Reducing exposures to air pollution and managing light pollution could be important steps in protecting children's health.""

The study appears online in Environmental Health Perspectives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Machine learning helps decode exercise motivation and behavior","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250417/Machine-learning-helps-decode-exercise-motivation-and-behavior.aspx","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 02:59:00 GMT","

Sticking to an exercise routine is a challenge many people face. But a University of Mississippi research team is using machine learning to uncover what keeps individuals committed to their workouts.

The team – Seungbak Lee and Ju-Pil Choe, both doctoral students in physical education, and Minsoo Kang, professor of sport analytics in the Department of Health, Exercise Science and Recreation Management – hopes to predict whether a person is meeting physical activity guidelines based on their body measurements, demographics and lifestyle.

They have examined data from about 30,000 surveys. To quickly sort through such a huge data set, they've turned to machine learning, a way of using computers to identify patterns and make predictions based on the information.

The group's results, published in the Nature Portfolio journal Scientific Reports are timely, Kang said

Physical activity adherence to the guidelines is a public health concern because of its relationship to disease prevention and overall health patterns. We wanted to use advanced data analytic techniques, like machine learning, to predict this behavior.""

Minsoo Kang, professor of sport analytics, Department of Health, Exercise Science and Recreation Management, University of Mississippi

The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggests that adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week as part of a healthy lifestyle.

Research shows that the average American spends just two hours per week on physical activity – half of the four hours recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lee, Choe and Kang used public data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a government-sponsored survey, covering 2009-18.

""We aimed to use machine learning to predict whether people follow physical activity guidelines based on questionnaire data, and find the best combination of variables for accurate predictions,"" said Choe, the study's lead author. ""Demographic variables such as gender, age, race, educational status, marital status and income, along with anthropometric measures like BMI and waist circumference, were considered.""

The researchers also considered lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption, smoking, employment, sleep patterns and sedentary behavior to understand their impact on a person's physical activity, he said.

The results showed that three key factors – how much time someone spends sitting, their gender, and their education level – showed up consistently in all the top-performing models that predict exercise habits, even though each model identified different variables as important.

 According to Choe, these factors are especially important for understanding who is more likely to stay active and socially connected, and they could help guide future health recommendations.

""I expected that factors like gender, BMI, race or age would be important for our prediction model, but I was surprised by how significant educational status was,"" he said. ""While factors like gender, BMI and age are more innate to the body, educational status is an external factor.""

During the analysis, the researchers excluded data from people with certain diseases and responses missing physical activity data. That culled the relevant data to 11,683 participants.

The researchers say machine learning gives them more freedom to study the data. Older methods expect things to follow a straight-line pattern, and they don't work well when some pieces of information are too similar.

Machine learning doesn't have those limits, so it can find patterns with greater flexibility.

""One limitation of our study was using subjectively measured physical activity data, where participants recalled their activity from memory,"" Choe said. ""People tend to overestimate their physical activity when using questionnaires, so more accurate, objective data would improve the study's reliability.""

Because of this, the researchers say they could use a similar method for future research in this area, but explore different factors, including dietary supplements use, using more machine learning algorithms or relying on objective data instead of self-reported information.

That could help trainers and fitness consultants produce workout regimens that people can actually stick with for the long haul.

Patients who take the common blood pressure medicine Lercanidipine HCI 20 mg tablets (lercanidipine hydrochloride) from the manufacturer Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited, should, as a precautionary measure, urgently check if they have the batch number MD4L07 with an expiry date of 01/2028 on any packs they have at home. The batch number is printed on the foil of the blister strips.

Image Credit: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

This follows an error in the strength of the product printed on some of the sides of the pack. The error is limited to one batch of the medicine only.

The packs are incorrectly labelled as 10 mg on some sides of the pack when they are 20 mg tablets. The correct strength (20 mg) is printed on the top of the carton and on the blister strips.

An alert, has been issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) today.

Patients prescribed 10 mg tablets and have received tablets with this batch number should contact their pharmacist or GP immediately.

If the GP or pharmacist cannot be reached, patients should call NHS 111 for advice on continuing their medication.

If a patient cannot speak to a healthcare professional before they are due to take their next dose, they should:

Patients who were prescribed 20 mg tablets should verify the strength of the tablets by checking the information on the foil of the blister strips prior to taking the tablet. Patients should continue to take the tablets as prescribed by their doctor.

Patients should not stop taking their medicine without consulting their healthcare provider. Patients who are concerned about the strength of the medication they have received should check it with their dispensing pharmacy.

Patients concerned they may have accidentally taken a higher dose of the medication than they were prescribed should talk to a pharmacist, their GP or call NHS 111.

Patients who experience side effects or have any questions about the medication should seek medical attention. Any suspected side effects should also be reported via the MHRA Yellow Card scheme.

Patient safety is our top priority. We ask patients to check their medicine packaging and follow our advice.

Healthcare professionals such as pharmacists are also being asked to stop supplying medicine from the affected batch and to return it to the supplier.

Please report any suspected adverse reactions via the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme.""

Dr Alison Cave, Chief Safety Officer, MHRA 

The alert was issued after the manufacturer, Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited, informed the MHRA of an error in the strength of the product printed on some sides of the product carton.

Recordati Pharmaceuticals Limited is initiating a recall of the specified batches as a precautionary measure.

            It has not been the easiest of times supporting the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) for former captain Clint Dempsey.
    


            After crashing out of the group stage at last summer's Copa América, the US was stunned by Panama at the CONCACAF Nations League and then lost to north-of-the-border rival Canada in the third-place match.
    


            Mauricio Pochettino's record since he took over the reins as head coach in September 2024 makes for difficult reading: five wins in eight matches with no draws and three defeats – those victories, though, coming against teams ranked well below the US in the FIFA rankings.
    


            So, how concerned is the ex-Premier League forward on a scale of one to 10? “I'm probably like a six or seven right now” Dempsey tells CNN Sports.
    


            “We're the first host country to not get out of Copa América in the group stage and the way that we lost CONCACAF Nations League (is concerning, but) I still believe in this team, and they have a lot of quality, and I think they can turn things around, especially with the coach Pochettino being in charge and what he did at Southampton and Tottenham.”
    


            While Dempsey has faith in the team's ability to get back on track, he recognizes some players might feel unsettled after the Argentine manager's recent interview where he revealed a desire to manage Spurs again one day.
    


            “I'm not in the dressing room, but at the end of the day, like when I was growing up, my dream was always to represent my country, it didn't matter who the manager was.
    


            “It is unfortunate that there might be question marks around (Pochettino), but at the end of the day, it's on the players to go out there and perform and represent their country and take pride in that,” Dempsey adds, speaking as an ambassador for American Airlines, an official partner of next year's World Cup.
    


            Joint USMNT top scorers Dempsey and Landon Donovan have not shied away from criticizing the current crop of players publicly. They've even gone so far as questioning squad members' commitment to the US badge.
    


            Dempsey recognizes his critiques come with an asterisk; the last time he played for the USMNT was a nightmare 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago that resulted in the US failing to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1986.

The world is coming to America for next summer's World Cup. There are big concerns over whether the US is ready



            “I've been a part of failures. I mean, 2018, we didn't qualify for the World Cup. It was a huge failure. It was a huge step backwards in the wrong direction, and all you can do is what the players did.”
    


            That failure triggered the influx of many of today's squad with only Christian Pulisic and Tim Ream remaining from the team that was humbled at the hands of the Caribbean nation.
    


            It was that wave of new talent and fresh faces that left some fans calling them “The Baby Eagles.”
    


            The team now boasts a plethora of players who ply their trade at European clubs and who experienced the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup together.
    


            “They fought hard. They qualified for the World Cup (in Qatar). They performed well in the last World Cup, got out of the group, and it looked like a team that was starting to build towards something. But since that World Cup, it looks like we've kind of taken another step back.
    


            “There's been players who are doing really well in Europe. You got Antonee Robinson at Fulham, who's having a great season. You have Christian Pulisic, AC Milan, who's having a great season. You have players like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie.
    


            “I want people to fight for each other. I want there to be competition for spots in the team and maybe things need to be shaken up a little bit in terms of who that starting 11 needs to be,” he tells CNN.
    


            While household names abound, the USMNT's historically deep squad no longer exists and a quick fix is difficult.
    


            “I think when you look back at the history of US men's national team, you normally had a goalie that was playing consistently week in and week out in Europe, whether it was Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. That's not the case for us at the moment.
    


            “(Also) when you think back, we had a number 9 that was solidified (at) that position and could score goals. We don't really have that in our team at the moment.”
    


            While the Texas native hasn't been afraid to voice his concerns, he does, however, push back on the idea that Pulisic's captaincy is one of the problems. The AC Milan winger has increasingly faced scrutiny that he may not be the right type of leader for the Stars and Stripes.
    


            Former manager Gregg Berhalter preferred to rotate the captain's armband among a leadership group – something that came under scrutiny as performances dipped before his dismissal. And despite Pulisic's “Captain America” nickname, Tyler Adams was ultimately named captain for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
    


            Dempsey, however, sees the merits in multiple locker-room leaders: “I think the team is not just one person who is a leader. I think there's multiple people on that team that are leaders.”
    


            He compares the current debate to his experiences at the 2014 Brazil World Cup, saying, “Tim Howard was on that team, and even though I was a captain, I saw him as one of the captains. He was one of the leaders as well, so it takes more than one captain to kind of step up and get everybody on track.”
    


            Despite lethargic performances against the likes of Panama, Canada and traditional rival Mexico, Dempsey believes the biggest problem facing the USMNT in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup is its strength of schedule.
    


            “I mean, Copa América, that's a big competition… and no disrespect to the CONCACAF Nations League, but it's kind of a new tournament that's been made up in the last few years.
    


            “I think the Nations League is kind of hurt. Around the world in terms of even, you know, the European Nations League, it's just the same teams playing each other over and over again. So (for) me as a fan, I think there would be more excitement around seeing other teams.”
    


            No need to start panicking yet, though, USMNT fans. Despite the laundry list of concerns – mentality and passion, Pochettino's potentially wandering eye, a lack of an elite goalkeeper and center forward, and the strength of opponents – Dempsey is adamant “it's not all doom and gloom.”
    


            “There's quality in the side; it's just getting the best out of them. And when your back's against the wall, just kind of fighting for each other.”

With just 15 months to go until the biggest World Cup ever, the USMNT is arguably in crisis. A torrid start to 2025 saw them lose all three games in the CONCACAF Nations League Finals with the pressure building on an underperforming set of players and Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino. The team's all-time joint scorer couldn't hide his concern at the team's recent performances but believes that eventually this squad can come good.

Fifa is facing complex negotiations with the US authorities before the Club World Cup after failing to secure tax exemptions for the 32 competing clubs.

The world governing body announced a huge prize fund for the tournament of $1bn (£754m) in March, including up to $125.8m for the winners, but without tax agreements clubs could be left with bills of tens of millions of dollars to the US tax authorities on top of tax payable in their home countries. At least 29 clubs from outside the US, including Chelsea and Manchester City, will be competing.

Fifa has obtained exemptions from a range of taxes for the 2026 World Cup games in the US, with competing nations exempted from many city, state and ticket-sales taxes, but with the schedule for the Club World Cup put together at shorter notice it has been unable to secure similar dispensation. The 12 venues were announced only in late September, less than nine months before the tournament.

Fifa is also grappling with other complexities, such as the differing tax rates between states, which could result in clubs losing out by virtue of where they have played. For example in Florida, home to two Club World Cup venues in Miami and Orlando, there is no state income tax. Most other cities which will stage matches are subject to a state income tax, although the rates vary from 3% in Pennsylvania to 7% in California.

Paris Saint-Germain play two of their three group games in Los Angeles so could end up the worst affected. Manchester City could also cash in because their final group fixture is against Juventus in Orlando, whereas Chelsea's group matches are in Pennsylvania and Atlanta, where income tax is 5.5%.

In another complication some US states do not recognise the federal government's “double taxation treaties” with other countries, which prevent individuals and companies being taxed twice for their earnings by different regimes. This anomaly could lead to certain clubs being hit financially but not others. Fifa is pressing for a solution which ensures they are all treated fairly.

It is understood to be confident of achieving that, having made great efforts in recent months to get close to important US decision makers. Gianni Infantino met Donald Trump twice in March and took the new Club World Cup trophy to the Oval Office, and last week Fifa's president visited the FBI.

Fifa declined to comment but sources with knowledge of the negotiations said it was supporting the competing clubs while complying with US tax rules.

Although the size of the prize pot, funded by a global TV deal with the streaming company Dazn, has led to concerns that the money could destabilise domestic leagues, Fifa is confident this will not prove to be the case. A significant proportion of the prize money will be swallowed up by tax bills, player bonuses and other operational costs, and for the biggest earning European clubs their Club World Cup income is replacing revenue they would have made from summer tours.

Fifa is allocating appearance and prize money according to a complex formula based on each club's historical performances and the size of their local market, but essentially the biggest European clubs will get paid most.

Chelsea and City will receive $38.19m before tax and expenses just for turning up, and clubs will get $2m for each group-stage win, $7.5m for reaching the last 16, $13.1m for reaching the quarter-finals, $21m for getting to the semi-finals and $40m for winning the final, with $30m for the runner-up.

Fifa has committed to assigning $250m of the $1bn Club World Cup fund to solidarity payments to clubs across the world not taking part. It is also paying $1m to each of the 11 host cities as a legacy payment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Inter Milan and Juventus are among the clubs who could face a hefty tax bill from prize money at the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

This according to UK outlet The Guardian. They report that there is still not agreement exempting the winnings from tax to US federal and state governments.

Inter Milan and Juventus will be participating in the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. They will be the two teams representing Serie A.

There will be 32 teams at the tournament in total.

And the prize money for the competition will be very high indeed.

On top of hefty revenues just for participating, the Nerazzurri, the Bianconeri, and the rest of the clubs in the Club World Cup will compete for significant further prize money.

The Guardian noted that FIFA will dole out more than €1 billion in prize money in total.

That is certainly a major incentive for the participating clubs.

The winner of the final would take home over €125 million in total.

However, The Guardian notes, that could come with a significant tax bill eating away into the revenues.

That is because the organizers of the tournament have yet to reach an agreement with US state and federal government regarding taxation.

Therefore, the winnings could be subject to the full state and federal taxes applicable in the US. That would be in addition to the taxes that Inter or Juventus would pay on prize money in Italy.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Eder Militao has had a difficult couple of seasons, having suffered back-to-back ACL injuries in 2023 and 2024, that have kept him out on the sidelines for extended period.

The Brazilian ruptured his ACL in November last year, during the game against CA Osasuna. Having undergone surgery, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season given the severity of the injury.

But things have been progressing well with his rehabilitation, and now MARCA reports that Militao is in the final stretch of his recovery.

Indeed, the 27-year-old is getting closer to returning to action for Real Madrid, having been working relentlessly on his recovery. In fact, all signs now point to him being available for Los Blancos' debut in the FIFA Club World Cup on 18 June.

The coaching staff are closely monitoring his progress and are determined not to take unnecessary risks.

However, Militao's recovery has been so positive that his return for the final stretch of the season is no longer a distant hope, it is becoming a realistic objective.

Barring any setbacks in the coming weeks, Real Madrid believe he will be ready to bolster the squad for a tournament they consider prestigious and highly important.

Beyond the physical recovery, Militao has remained emotionally invested in the group. In recent weeks, he has been ever-present around the team, offering support during key matches, celebrating victories, and sharing in the lows as if he were on the pitch.

The centre-back's continued presence has been a quiet but powerful boost inside the dressing room, reinforcing his role as a vital part of the squad.

Carlo Ancelotti and his staff regard the 27-year-old as a key figure in the defensive structure. His return would inject much-needed quality and experience into the side.

While the club will not rush him back under any circumstances, if all goes according to plan, his presence in the United States will be considered a major asset – almost like a new marquee signing ahead of the Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Real Madrid are reportedly considering three managers to lead their Club World Cup campaign should Carlo Ancelotti leave ahead of the tournament.

Ancelotti's future at the Bernabeu is in doubt following Real's 5-1 aggregate defeat to Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday night.

The 65-year-old is being strongly linked with the Brazil job after Dorival Junior was sacked in the wake of his country's 4-1 humiliation at the hands of rivals Argentina in World Cup qualifying last month.

Reports have claimed Ancelotti could leave Madrid as early as April 26 after the Copa del Rey final. 

Intermediaries have held talks with the Italian with Brazil are keen to install a new coach before the next international window in June rather than waiting until August.

Spanish newspaper Marca have reported that Real Madrid hierarchy are exploring managerial options for the Club World Cup, with the tournament seen as a priority for club president Florentino Perez.

The Spanish giants are claimed to have made Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso their top target for the role on a permanent basis, with the club's former star favourite to return to Madrid in the summer.

While Real Madrid are reportedly considering activating Alonso's release clause, there are doubts over whether the Spaniard would take charge in June.

Alonso would have minimal time with the players ahead of the tournament if he took charge, with La Liga's season ending on May 25 and Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign starting on June 18.

Several Real Madrid players would also feature in international fixtures ahead of the tournament.

Real Madrid chiefs are said to be weighing up whether to place club legend Raul or Santiago Solari in charge on an interim basis as an alternative.

Raul, who scored 323 goals in 741 appearances for Real Madrid, has served as the head coach of their reserve team since 2019.

Solari has been working as Real Madrid's director of football since December 2023, having returned to the club the previous year after being sacked as manager of Mexican side America.

The Argentine, who played 208 times for the club, previously served as Real Madrid manager for five months during the 2018-19 season.

Solari was sacked following a 4-1 home defeat to Ajax which saw the club crash out of the Champions League. 

Real Madrid have won the Club World Cup a record five times in its previous guise, with the summer's tournament in the United States the first under FIFA's expanded 32-team format.

Los Blancos will face Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, Pachuca from Mexico and Austria's Red Bull Salzburg in the group stages. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Players' union FIFPRO, Spain's LaLiga and the European leagues' group filed a joint complaint to European Union antitrust regulators earlier in October, accusing FIFA of ""calendar abuse"".

Critics argue FIFA's revamped quadrennial 32-team Club World Cup and other expanded tournaments will increase the number of matches each season and leave players with little time off between campaigns.

Infantino told CNN that the Club World Cup's impact on player welfare would be limited.

""It is a competition which takes place once every four years. The winner plays seven games, which is like one game and a half, almost, more a year, so it doesn't have a big impact,"" he added.

""What happens in world soccer is that there are many games for very few teams, very few players. Those who reach maybe the final stages of all competitions, which again is very rare ... So all in all, it balances itself out quite a bit.

""But we're very careful about the calendar and about the health of the players. I mean, we want to do everything for the players to be in the best conditions to perform in the best way ...

""That's what many players tell me as well, what you want is to play rather than to train, right?""

Infantino also said the FIFA taskforce, led by former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, was analysing the impact of the Club World Cup on player welfare.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Breaking news for everyone's consumption

Scientists have described the types of illness suffered by people who sought medical care during the latest soccer world cup in Qatar.

Researchers retrieved stool testing data from attendees of the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as long-term residents and Qatari nationals.

Qatar hosted the FIFA World Cup from Nov. 20 to Dec. 18, 2022. During this period, 1.4 million visitors arrived in the country. Scientists used stool testing data from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, that covered people who went to any health care facility with gastrointestinal illness.

Among 2,179 samples tested, one or more organisms were identified in 424 cases. The most frequent bacteria detected were Salmonella and E. coli.

Transmission pathwaysAccording to the study published in IJID Regions, an official journal of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID), the most common reasons for testing were acute diarrhea/gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, screening/surveillance of contacts, and fever.

Researchers did not investigate the routes of infection acquisition so it is unclear whether positive findings are because of eating behaviors or direct or indirect physical contact.

In a separate commentary on the study, two other researchers said the work lacks an in-depth analysis of food safety measures implemented during the event.

“Given the high volume of international attendees consuming food from various sources, including vendors and official catering services, a detailed assessment of food hygiene standards and possible contamination points should have been included,” they said. 

The main study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar, which was the national reference laboratory for microbiology testing.

HMC had rapid medical evaluation units at the eight stadiums where matches were held. Additional units were set up at multiple fan zones, which were publicly accessible areas hosting activities throughout the tournament.

Main agents detectedMedian age of tested individuals was 31 with a range of 5 to 45 years old, 59 percent were males, and 1,616 were non-Qatari nationals. Three-quarters of the people who underwent stool testing were not from Qatar.

A total of 424 samples tested positive for at least one organism by culture or PCR, with at least one bacterium identified in 393, virus in 33, and parasite in 12 of the individuals.

Of the 463 bacterial isolates, the most common organisms included Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Salmonella was found 185 times, E. coli 119 times, and Shigella on 41 occasions.

Among the viruses detected, the most common were norovirus 13 times, Sapovirus eight times and Astrovirus seven times. Of the 12 parasites found, seven were Cryptosporidium and five were Giardia. Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis is often self-limited, which may have led people to not seek medical care, said scientists.

“In summary, the number of individuals who sought care and underwent stool testing during FIFA 2022 was low. During the entire event, a total of 2,179 individuals underwent stool testing of the 1.4 million visitors who entered Qatar during that period. It is possible that some individuals with mild or moderate symptoms may not have sought care and recovered without any formal medical intervention. It is also possible that stool testing was not ordered for some individuals who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Bacteria were more frequently isolated than viruses,” said researchers.

With the next FIFA World Cup about a year away, American Airlines has bagged an important partnership deal with the tournament, joining as the Official North American Airline Supplier of the event. The carrier says that it is excited to carry fans across North America to experience the excitement of the tournament.



American already flies thousands of daily flights to the host cities of the 2026 event, which will be jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The airline is collaborating with Qatar Airways, which will be FIFA's Global Airline Partner, for several more years.

 American Airlines

 has announced that FIFA has made it the Official North American Airline Supplier of the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Canada, Mexico, and the USA. This is a significant partnership deal for the airline, as the FIFA World Cup is among the most-watched global sports events. American says that the agreement will strengthen the tournament's ties to North America and ensure world-class travel experiences for fans and teams across the USA.    


Dallas, which is the headquarters of American Airlines, is also one of the host cities of the tournament, and the agreement also marks an important collaboration of American Airlines with                             Qatar Airways

 to ensure seamless international and domestic connectivity for all stakeholders throughout the competition. Coincidentally, American is also celebrating its 100th anniversary next year. Caroline Clayton, Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President of Communications of American Airlines, commented,    

“We are proud to partner with FIFA and look forward to connecting fans to all FIFA World Cup 26™ matches. As the home team for this historic event, we look forward to flying fans across North America to experience the passion, energy and diversity of the beautiful game.”

As one of the big three US airlines, American Airlines has a huge network in the country and a significant presence in Mexico and Canada. The FIFA World Cup 26™ tournament will be played in June and July and, for the first time, will involve 48 teams. It will include 104 matches and is expected to be the most attended and watched sporting event in history.

American says that this partnership underscores FIFA's commitment to working with industry leaders to ensure that the FIFA World Cup 26™ sets new standards in terms of access, scale, and fan experience. The carrier also notes that it has more than 2,200 daily flights to the FIFA World Cup 2 host cities currently.

American is also offering loyal AAdvantage® members the opportunity to get tickets to matches through ongoing sweepstakes. Anyone who is 18 and over can sign up once daily on the American Airlines website to try their luck at winning a ticket. Spread across three countries, the tournament will be played at the following locations:

United States

Mexico

Canada

Atlanta

Guadalajara

Toronto

Boston

Mexico City

Vancouver

Dallas

Monterrey

Houston

Kansas City

Los Angeles

Miami

New York/New Jersey

Philadelphia

San Francisco Bay Area

Seattle

Airports across America are already making preparations for the festival of football.

Qatar Airways is the Global Airline Partner for FIFA through 2030. Speaking about the current deal with American Airlines, Qatar Airways' Chief Commercial Officer, Thierry Antinori, said that together, through their expansive networks and world-class loyalty programs, both airlines can offer millions of travelers seamless and convenient travel options during the FIFA World Cup 2026.


Qatar has been a FIFA partner since 2017, and in 2023,     

        
the airline extended its partnership
 about a year after the FIFA World Cup opening game in Qatar in 2022. The deal allowed Qatar to cover several FIFA events, including the two FIFA World Cups (the United States, Mexico, and Canada in 2026 and another in Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, and Uruguay in 2030), as well as all youth men's and women's tournaments.    

While Qatar's partnership with FIFA will run until 2030, other airlines, too, would be keen on partnering with the prestigious sports governing body. The 2034 FIFA World Cup will be held in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps one of the Saudi Arabia-based airlines could become FIFA's next Global Airline Partner.

The Olympics might not be the only global sporting event that has a presence in Oklahoma City

The Olympics might not be the only global sporting event that has a presence in Oklahoma City.

The World Cup is considering Oklahoma City and Norman as potential team bases.

It means teams have a lot of options for where they live and train during the World Cup. One option is on the old Oklahoma City Energy Football Club field, while another is in Norman.

Whether these sites are chosen from the list or not, the hosts are excited for the opportunity.

“We would have potentially FIFA here 2026 and then prepare for the Olympics 2028, so we're just thrilled that everybody wants to come embark in some of these adventures,” said Brittani Hunter, with Oklahoma City's Adventure District.

The World Cup is coming to the U.S. next year, and that means teams from multiple countries will be visiting and needing a place to train.

FIFA just approved two home bases for them right here in Oklahoma.

The University of Oklahoma's athletic complex and the soccer complex in the Adventure District. 

Video Below: OKC, Norman selected by FIFA to be potential team base camp sites for 2026 World Cup. Click here to learn more.

“We're just excited to be back on the world stage again,” Hunter said.

The Adventure District is already set to host world guests for softball in the 2028 Summer Olympics, but they're excited for the opportunity to host even more.

“Just to be able to say that we hosted a FIFA World Cup team here while they were getting ready to compete, that's something like who else can say that other than Norman, who else can say that, so we would just be grateful for the opportunity,” Hunter said.

Now it's up to the 48 teams to pick their spots out of more than 60 options and even though this won't necessarily bring visitors, they're hoping they get to show a team some Oklahoma hospitality.

“We're an amazing choice because we have so much positivity going on right now,” Hunter said.

Next year's World Cup starts in June, and these base camps will serve as the primary spot for training and rest as teams prepare for their matches during the first round.

Arlington, Texas, will host a few of those matches, making our area a nice option.

The Red Devils came back from the dead at Old Trafford on Thursday night but is the 5-4 win over Lyon their finest ever fightback?

""Football, bloody hell!"" - What is it about Manchester United and epic European nights? When it comes to the Red Devils, one should always expect the unexpected. Even by United's incredibly high standards, though, what unfolded at Old Trafford on Thursday night was beyond belief.

With Ruben Amorim's side trailing Lyon 4-2 with six minutes of extra time remaining, Rio Ferdinand said on commentary for TNT Sports that his old side needed ""more than a miracle"". Remarkably, that's exactly what they delivered. United scored three times during a ridiculously chaotic conclusion to triumph 5-4 on the night, and 7-6 on aggregate, to progress to the semi-finals of the Europa League.

It was pure madness. Ferdinand said he'd never seen anything like it, while his former team-mate Darren Fletcher labelled it ""one of the most remarkable nights this stadium has ever seen in European competition"". But where does it rank among United's most remarkable comebacks in continental competition overall?

After shining at last year's U17 Euros and World Cup, the winger has since signed a pro deal with the Blues and made her Champions League debut

Winners of the last five Women's Super League titles, a number almost certain to become six in the next few weeks, Chelsea have been England's dominant force for the best part of the last decade, claiming 16 domestic titles since the start of the 2017-18 season. It's fair to say that to be a part of the Blues' squad, you need to have something special. That's not just when it comes to talent, but also mentality. It is telling, then, that head coach Sonia Bompastor believes that Lola Brown, who is still just 17 years old, ticks those boxes already.

“I think she's one of the most talented young players for England and I'm really happy to work with her. She really has the right mentality,” the Chelsea boss said of Brown just last week. “I think you have this on yourself. If you don't have this mentality, it's really difficult to teach that to someone. You can make some progress, but if it's not inside yourself, it's more difficult. I think Lola has all this winning mentality, this ruthless mentality.”

Complemented by wonderful technical ability, a fierce work ethic and the ongoing opportunity to witness, first-hand, just what it takes to compete for an historic quadruple, it's no wonder fans of Chelsea - and England - are so excited about the player Brown could become. Given the Blues' emphasis on youth development, and Bompastor's own history in excelling in that area, there's even more reason to believe she's on the right path.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The jury is very much out over whether the Frenchman is the right man to lead the Blancos' line after his latest no-show on the biggest stage

Last summer, the best player in the world joined the best team in the world. Or at least, that's what Real Madrid thought when they signed Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer after his departure from Paris Saint-Germain.

It was certainly a major power play from Real after their Champions League and La Liga double success in 2023-24, and on paper, it felt like adding Mbappe to an attack already boasting Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham was borderline unfair. The expectation was clear: Mbappe would lead Madrid into its next dynastic era.

Let's start by giving Mbappe his due credit: Real's latest 'Galactico' has scored 32 goals in 49 appearances across his debut season, which is an impressive haul by any standard. He's also hit two-hat-tricks, including in a 3-1 win over Premier League champions Manchester City in the Champions League knockout stage playoffs that briefly had everyone believing Los Blancos would storm to their 16th European crown.

But that milestone is now out of Real's reach. Arsenal pulled off one of the competition's great upsets to oust the holders at the quarter-final stage, with Carlo Ancelotti's team looking a shadow of the all-conquering side they were last term.

That's partly because the Mbappe who bullied City didn't turn up in either leg against the Gunners. Madristas were left frustrated with their talismanic No.9, but anyone who watched PSG over the past seven seasons would not have been surprised; Mbappe is becoming kryptonite to winning the Champions League, and Madrid might not lift the trophy again if they continue to pin all their hopes on the 25-year-old.

Jannik Sinner will return to tennis next month at his home tournament in Rome.

World number one Sinner was banned from tennis for three months earlier this year, forcing him to skip several big tournaments.

The Italian won the only event he played before receiving the ban, as Sinner beat Alexander Zverev in the final of the Australian Open.

Sinner will return to action at his home Italian Open next month, where he will compete as the number one seed.

Ahead of his return to competition, Sinner trained with one of his fellow top-ten ATP stars in Monte-Carlo.

World number one Sinner trained in an indoor clay court facility with British star Jack Draper on Thursday, as he prepares to return to action.

The pair have become friends over recent years, with Draper defending Sinner when he received his ban from tennis in February.

“I know Jannik [Sinner], he is a good friend, I know with this whole thing, I am sure he would not have done something intentional,” said Draper in an interview with Sky Sports.

“I do not think it is good for the sport that the number one player in the world and someone who is doing incredible things is having a ban, but he will be back shortly, and I wish him all the best and hope he is going to be okay.”

Sinner and Draper have played twice before on the ATP Tour, with the head-to-head level at 1-1.

At last year's US Open, Sinner beat Draper to advance to the final at Flushing Meadows, as the Brit suffered from illness throughout the match.

It was Draper who came out on top three years earlier when the pair battled it out on the grass at the Queen's Club Championships.

Sinner's lead at the top of the world rankings is a sizeable one, currently heading his closest challenger, Carlos Alcaraz, by 2,210 points.

That gap could yet close, however, as the Spaniard continues to impress on the clay courts, having won the Monte-Carlo Masters last week.

If Alcaraz were to win both the Barcelona Open and Madrid Open, tournaments he has had success at before, he would narrow the deficit to Sinner to just 710 points.

Therefore, in this hypothetical scenario, Sinner could potentially lose the world number one ranking if the Spaniard were to win the Italian Open.

The likelihood of Alcaraz winning three consecutive tournaments is, of course, slim, and even if he were to become world number one, he would be up against it trying to hold onto the top spot.

Winning the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments last summer, Alcaraz accumulated 4,000 points, leaving him a lot to defend in 2025.

Only time will tell if we will see Alcaraz reclaim the number one ranking from Sinner in 2025, but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Alcaraz and Sinner will take to the court in Rome for the Italian Open, which begins on May 7.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The world number two stepped up a gear from his first-round win over Ethan Quinn to dispatch his 80th-ranked opponent on the Catalan clay as he prepares for his French Open title defence.

Alcaraz, who triumphed at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, has had an inconsistent start to the year and in March fell at the first hurdle in the Miami Open.

Home favourite Alcaraz saved both break points he faced in a first-set stroll, with Djere unable to produce a single winner, to the Spaniard's eight.

The four-time Grand Slam winner won five games straight to claim a 5-1 first-set lead and sealed it with his second set point.

In the second set, Djere offered more of a fight and even broke for a 4-2 lead, but Alcaraz bounced back quickly.

Djere could not handle the Spaniard in full flow and crumbled away as Alcaraz won the final four games to triumph, sealing his win when the Serb pushed a shot into the net.

""After going 4-2 down in the second, I played a bit more like what my level is,"" said Alcaraz.

""I am very happy that I could step up my level, and seem more like my best, and I want to continue.""

Alcaraz will face world number seven Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Friday. The Aussie eased past Briton Jacob Fearnley 6-1, 6-2 later on Thursday.

Earlier, in-form Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated world number eight Andrey Rublev 7-5, 6-4.

The Spaniard, ranked 30th, had never beaten the Russian before but triumphed at the sixth time of asking in straight sets.

Monte Carlo Masters semi-finalist Davidovich Fokina broke three times in a topsy-turvy first set, with Rublev twice reacting before the Malaga native held to love in the 12th game.

Rublev went a break down in the first game of the second set, but despite securing one of his own for 2-2, he was once again broken as Davidovich Fokina took a 5-4 lead and then served out for the match, again to love.

Spain's Jaume Munar came up short against Karen Khachanov, who also won 7-5, 6-4, and will face Davidovich Fokina in the next round.

The Russian, who trains in Barcelona, only converted four of 15 break points but eventually put the battling Munar to bed.

The 31-year-old Frenchwoman skipped this week's Rouen Open after second round defeats in Indian Wells and Miami and is also a doubt for the Rome event during the build-up to the year's second Grand Slam from May 25 to June 8.

Garcia, who won the WTA Finals in 2022 and reached the US Open semi-finals that year, has often carried French hopes for a home-grown women's singles champion at Roland Garros, but she has not crossed the quarter-final hurdle at the major.

""After more tests on my back, it's clear I won't be able to play in Madrid,"" Garcia wrote on social media on Friday.

""I need to take some time for treatment and recovery. I'll do everything I can to be ready for Rome, but the main goal is to arrive strong and healthy for Roland Garros.""

Garcia had prematurely ended her 2024 season in September due to anxiety and panic attacks. The world number 99 said being injured early in the current campaign was difficult to accept.

""After the break last year, I came back feeling happier, clearer and more motivated. The results weren't there yet, but I truly believed in the path I was on. This setback hurts - but I'll use it to come back stronger,"" she added.

""Right now, it's about controlling what I can, keeping perspective and finding ways to embrace the journey - even on the hard days.

""Paris is still the dream... I'll keep fighting for it.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

French Open organizers have “rejected an immediate opportunity to give players a greater share of tournament revenue this year” despite calls from the likes of World No. 5 Novak Djokovic and World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka for more prize money. The total amount of money offered at Roland Garros from May 25 to June 8 comes to $64.2M, an increase above inflation of 5.21% on last year. Of this, $2.9M will be “paid to each of the men's and women's singles winners” and $88,742 for all first-round losers. These figures are an “improvement on last year,” but they are “merely in line with the traditional increases that take place on an annual basis across the four grand slams.” This suggests that organizers were “not overly concerned” about a joint letter sent last month by top-ten players on the men's and women's tours asking for “a more appropriate percentage of tournament revenues.” Overall, the French Open ranks as the “lowest-paying grand-slam tournament” despite this year's increases (London TIMES, 4/17).

French Open organizers confirmed on Thursday that a ceremony for tennis legend Rafael Nadal “will be held on the Philippe-Chatrier Court on the opening Sunday,” May 25, after the day's matches have been completed. French Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton also revealed plans for Nadal to “take up an ambassadorial role at Roland Garros.” Tournament Dir Amelie Mauresmo also revealed a fan zone for 5,000 people will open on the Place de la Concorde from June 4 to June 9, from the quarter-finals to the finals (London INDEPENDENT, 4/17).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

Spain has long been a tennis powerhouse, producing legends like Manuel Santana, Carlos Moyá, and Albert Costa. Rafael Nadal stands as the crown jewel of Spanish tennis, with a career that rewrote the sport's history. Today, young sensation Carlos Alcaraz carries the torch, aiming to cement his place among the all-time greats. Yet, among the stars, there's a story often overlooked—that of Roberto Carretero, a talented player whose career was derailed by injuries.

Carretero, who captured the junior title at Roland Garros in 1993, was hailed as a future clay-court star. However, injuries and mental health struggles forced him to retire at just 26 years old. Despite his abbreviated career, Carretero remains connected to the sport, contributing as a broadcaster and staying active in the tennis community.

Roberto Carretero first made headlines in 1993 when he won the Roland Garros junior title, a moment he described as life-changing. “That moment changed my life,” Carretero told Relevo in 2024. “Until then, my parents had financed my career. Winning Roland Garros at 17 transformed everything, both financially and professionally. I wasn't even the favorite, but I went there and won”.

Transitioning to the professional circuit proved more challenging. By 1996, Carretero achieved his lone ATP title, winning the Hamburg Masters 1000 in a surprising run. “The transition from junior to pro wasn't easy,” he explained. “It took longer for me than for players like Albert Costa or Marcelo Ríos. Hamburg came out of nowhere—I wasn't even a favorite. I played qualifiers and went on an incredible run”.

Carretero's career was plagued by injuries, particularly recurring shoulder issues that required four surgeries. The constant setbacks left him ranked no higher than 53 in the ATP standings and eventually led to his early retirement. Reflecting on his struggles, Carretero shared, “I've had shoulder problems since I was 13, and in this sport, if you don't have continuity, it's incredibly tough”.

He also opened up about the mental health challenges he faced. “What today is diagnosed as mental health issues wasn't even recognized back then. People just said, ‘What's wrong with this guy?' But I was dealing with something very real. I started doubting myself, thinking I wasn't cut out for this, even though I had top-ten potential. That's a hard thing for a 20-year-old to handle”.

Despite an 11-year age gap, Carretero and Rafael Nadal share a close bond. “Rafa is a great person and a great friend,” Carretero said. “I've known him since he was 14. We've shared a lot of moments together. As a tennis player, he's a true example at every level. If we're talking about role models, he's possibly the greatest”.

Carretero also explained why he places Nadal above Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in tennis history. “Federer is flawless on the court, but given how good he is, he's won relatively little. Djokovic never misses, never gets injured. But Rafa? He's had to overcome so much—injuries, adversity, and more. He's had to be more strategic and work harder than anyone to reach the top. For me, that puts him above the rest”.

Since retiring in 2001, Carretero has stayed deeply involved in tennis. He transitioned into media, working as a commentator for Movistar+. A regular presence at major tournaments worldwide, Carretero has also embraced social media, sharing photos with past and present stars, including young phenom Carlos Alcaraz.

While his playing days ended prematurely, Carretero's contributions to the sport endure—whether in the broadcast booth or through his enduring friendship with Nadal. A player who once showed immense promise, Carretero remains a respected voice in the tennis world and a proud ambassador for Spanish tennis.

Rafael Nadal is to be honoured for his achievements at the French Open with a ceremony at this year's tournament.

The 38-year-old Spaniard, a 14-time Roland Garros champion, retired in November last year.

Organisers confirmed on Thursday that a ceremony will be held on the Philippe-Chatrier Court on the opening Sunday, May 25, after the day's matches have been completed.

Gilles Moretton, the president of the French Tennis Federation, also revealed plans for Nadal to take up an ambassadorial role at Roland Garros.

""Here we announce something that seemed a priority to us, to first pay tribute to Rafael Nadal,"" he said.

""It's a love story. I think it's important to talk about a love story because he has deep respect for the tournament, for clay, and we have the same respect for the player, for the ambassador he can become for Roland Garros and for the federation.""

Nadal won the last of his 22 Grand Slam titles at Roland Garros in 2022.

His final appearance at the Paris tournament was last year when, as an unseeded player, he was unlucky to draw the then world No4 Alexander Zverev in the first round and was beaten 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.

Zverev became only the third player, along with Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic (twice), to beat Nadal at the French Open, with his incredible win-loss record standing at 112-4.

Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo said the precise details of the tribute are being kept under wraps.

""Rafa has of course marked the history of Roland Garros in many different ways and his 14 titles will perhaps remain unequalled in a Grand Slam tournament,"" she said.

""He will not be playing this year at Roland Garros, but he will be very present by our side for this 2025 edition.

""Rafa has an important bond with Roland Garros. We want it to be a surprise.""

Mauresmo also confirmed there will be tributes paid to Mary Pierce to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her victory, and to another French player, 38-year-old Richard Gasquet, who will retire after the tournament.

Speaking at the annual pre-tournament press conference at Roland Garros, Mauresmo revealed the prize money this year has increased by just over five per cent to €56.3million (£48.36m).

It was confirmed the tournament will persist with using line judges rather than the electronic line calling used at the other three Grand Slams.

Mauresmo also revealed a fan zone for 5,000 people will open on the Place de la Concorde from June 4 to June 9, from the quarter-finals to the finals.

Carlos Alcaraz, the rising star of tennis, is gearing up for an action-packed schedule leading up to Wimbledon. The Spanish sensation has his sights set on defending his title at Roland Garros after an impressive victory in 2024, where he showcased his remarkable talent and resilience on the court.

Following the Barcelona ATP 500, Alcaraz will be showcasing his skills at the Mutua Madrid Open and the Rome Masters 1000 before heading to the French Open. The young ace will face the pressure of defending his championship title at Roland Garros, where he emerged victorious in a thrilling final against Alexander Zverev last year.

Not one to shy away from a challenge, Alcaraz has also confirmed his participation in the prestigious Queen's Club tournament. This will be his third appearance at the tournament, with his previous victory in 2023 propelling him towards his first Wimbledon triumph.

Despite facing setbacks in the past, including an early exit at Queen's last year, Alcaraz remains undeterred and is determined to make his mark once again on the grass courts. The Queen's Club serves as the perfect platform for Alcaraz to fine-tune his game ahead of Wimbledon, a tournament he has his eyes set on for further success.

Analysts have been impressed by Alcaraz's versatility and talent, drawing comparisons to tennis greats like Rafael Nadal. The young Spaniard has defied expectations and continues to impress with his exceptional skills on both clay and grass courts, solidifying his position as a formidable force in the world of tennis.

Jannik Sinner's former coach Riccardo Piatti has predicted that the world No 1 will turn the “very unpleasant” situation of his doping ban into “something positive.”

Piatti played an integral role in Sinner's development as a player, having coached the Italian from the age of 13 until 20. Sinner chose to end the collaboration in February 2022.

Sinner has been unable to play since defending his Australian Open title in January due to a three-month doping suspension that started on February 9 and runs until May 4.

The Italian tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol twice in March 2024 — during and after the Indian Wells Masters.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed in August that Sinner would not serve a ban after an independent tribunal ruled he carried “no fault or negligence.”

Sinner explained that the substance had entered his body when receiving a massage from his former physio, Giacomo Naldi, who had used a spray containing the steroid to treat a cut on his own finger.

However, WADA appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the verdict in September as they initially sought to impose a ban of between one and two years on the world No 1.

The appeal was set to be heard at CAS in April, but WADA announced in February it had reached an agreement with Sinner's legal team for him to serve a three-month ban.

The 23-year-old has missed tournaments in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, while he will also be unable to play the upcoming Madrid Open.

The Italian is set to make his comeback on home soil at the Masters 1000 tournament in Rome, which will begin on May 7. Sinner has also added the ATP 500 in Hamburg to his schedule prior to the French Open.

Speaking to SuperTennis TV, Piatti suggested Sinner has a plan to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam by winning the remaining three majors in 2025.

“This whole situation has been very unpleasant for Sinner, but I'm sure he'll turn it into something positive,” said Piatti.

“I think Jannik has a very important card up his sleeve in the coming months to win Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open.”

The Italian added: “I'm sure that during these months of hiatus, Jannik hasn't stopped.

“During the pandemic, for example, it was one of the most important moments of growth for him. He trained physically three times a week and played tennis every day.”

Jannik Sinner's three-month suspension is almost over. The world No. 1 is set to return to action this May at the Italian Open and is already back on the practice courts in Monte Carlo. However, the controversy surrounding his case continues to spark debate. It was Serena Williams who reignited the conversation in a recent interview with Time Magazine, and her comments quickly went viral.

On one hand, she praised Sinner's talent and his importance to men's tennis; on the other, she strongly criticized the way the case was handled–igniting heated discussion among fans and raising broader concerns about fairness and consistency in professional sport.

In her interview, Serena Williams was candid. While she expressed admiration for Sinner, she didn't hold back in pointing out what she sees as a double standard:

“I love the guy, I love this game. He's great for the sport. But if I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let's be honest. I would have had Grand Slams taken away from me.”

Her words highlighted long-standing frustrations over how disciplinary actions can vary drastically depending on an athlete's status, gender, or history.

Williams also mentioned former rival Maria Sharapova–who was suspended for 15 months in 2016 after testing positive for a banned substance–as an emotional comparison:

“Just weirdly and oddly, I can't help but think about Maria all this time. I can't help but feel for her.”

Sharapova was banned after testing positive for Meldonium, a drug she said she had been using for years and didn't realize had been added to the banned list. The reference adds emotional weight to Serena's remarks and draws attention to how similar cases can result in very different outcomes.

Of course, the two situations are very different: Sinner did not intentionally use Clostebol, while Sharapova claimed she was unaware of the rule change. Still, both athletes proclaimed their innocence–and both have become central figures in the ongoing conversation about equality and accountability in sport.

Serena Williams was actually not the first athlete to comment the Clostebol case and how it was handled. Italian Olympic swimmer Federica Pellegrini had already voiced her concerns earlier in an interview with La Repubblica, stating:

“Sinner was treated differently from 99% of other athletes. Jannik is much loved and therefore defended in every aspect. But… it becomes my responsibility if a physio uses a cream and I test positive. That applies to everyone.”

Serena Williams Named Among The 100 Most Influential People: Coco Gauff Applauds the Decision

Serena Williams, the former world number one in women's tennis, has been recognized as one of The Times' Most Influential People in the world, a decision that has garnered approval from rising star Coco Gauff. Gauff, who is making waves in the tennis world alongside other top players like Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, and Jessica Pegula, shared her admiration for Williams during the ongoing Stuttgart Open, where she secured a spot in the quarterfinals after a convincing victory over Ella Seidel.

Gauff, currently ranked fourth in the world, expressed her support for Williams' inclusion in the prestigious list, emphasizing the impact the tennis legend has had not only on the sport but also on women, especially women of color. “Most influential people of all time, I mean, that's an incredible accomplishment that she definitely deserves,” Gauff stated, highlighting Williams' widespread influence and role model status. Gauff added, “She probably influenced millions, and I'm one of them. Her photos looked really good.”

Williams, who retired from professional tennis in 2022 to prioritize her family, leaves behind a remarkable legacy in the sport. With 23 Grand Slam titles to her name, the most by any women's player in the Open era, Williams' dominance on the court is undeniable. Throughout her career, she claimed seven Australian Open and seven Wimbledon titles, showcasing her versatility and enduring excellence.

From her first major victory at the US Open in 1999 to her memorable triumph at the Australian Open in 2017, where she defeated her sister Venus Williams in the final, Serena Williams has left an indelible mark on the world of tennis. As Gauff and fellow players continue to draw inspiration from Williams' achievements, her influence transcends the sport, solidifying her place among the most influential figures globally.

Jannik Sinner's former coach Riccardo Piatti has predicted that the world No 1 will turn the “very unpleasant” situation of his doping ban into “something positive.”

Piatti played an integral role in Sinner's development as a player, having coached the Italian from the age of 13 until 20. Sinner chose to end the collaboration in February 2022.

Sinner has been unable to play since defending his Australian Open title in January due to a three-month doping suspension that started on February 9 and runs until May 4.

The Italian tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol twice in March 2024 — during and after the Indian Wells Masters.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed in August that Sinner would not serve a ban after an independent tribunal ruled he carried “no fault or negligence.”

Sinner explained that the substance had entered his body when receiving a massage from his former physio, Giacomo Naldi, who had used a spray containing the steroid to treat a cut on his own finger.

However, WADA appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the verdict in September as they initially sought to impose a ban of between one and two years on the world No 1.

The appeal was set to be heard at CAS in April, but WADA announced in February it had reached an agreement with Sinner's legal team for him to serve a three-month ban.

The 23-year-old has missed tournaments in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, while he will also be unable to play the upcoming Madrid Open.

The Italian is set to make his comeback on home soil at the Masters 1000 tournament in Rome, which will begin on May 7. Sinner has also added the ATP 500 in Hamburg to his schedule prior to the French Open.

Speaking to SuperTennis TV, Piatti suggested Sinner has a plan to complete a historic Calendar Grand Slam by winning the remaining three majors in 2025.

“This whole situation has been very unpleasant for Sinner, but I'm sure he'll turn it into something positive,” said Piatti.

“I think Jannik has a very important card up his sleeve in the coming months to win Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open.”

The Italian added: “I'm sure that during these months of hiatus, Jannik hasn't stopped.

“During the pandemic, for example, it was one of the most important moments of growth for him. He trained physically three times a week and played tennis every day.”

Serena Williams enjoyed a legendary tennis career, enjoying particular success at Flushing Meadows.

America's Williams won her first Slam at the US Open in 1999 as a teenager, becoming the sixth youngest woman to win a Major title.

She added five more US Open titles to her collection throughout the remainder of her professional career.

Dominating in New York during her time on the WTA Tour, players, young and old, dreaded seeing the 43-year-old appear in their section of the draw.

One young star faced the Williams test in 2019, as she now reveals the big mistake she made during their second-round match.

Speaking on the Inside In Tennis Podcast, doubles star Caty McNally shared her thoughts on her battle with Williams at the 2019 US Open.

“Yeah, I mean I just tried to keep my head down,” she said.

“I think I told myself before the match, just keep your head down.

“Don't look up at her because the second you look up at her, you're going to be like holy s— you're playing Serena Williams. Like, this is insane.”

McNally won the first set 7-5 and threw her arms up in celebration, a move she regrets six years later.

“Yeah, I won the first set, I think I like threw my arms up,” she said.

“I don't even know why I threw my arms up. I think I was just like, it was just pure adrenaline.

“I shouldn't have done that.”

The crowd was with the 17-year-old throughout the contest, something she was thankful for.

“You know, that was probably part of the reason why I threw my hands up, the crowd was loving it,” said McNally.

“They were supporting me, which was a lot of fun, you know, to not play against Serena and the whole crowd.”

Williams eventually prevailed to win in three sets, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, in what McNally still considers to be one of the ‘greatest moments' of her career.

“I think midway through the second set is when she started to run away with it,” she said.

“She started to play really well, and it was just, it was just an amazing experience, and yeah, it's always crazy to talk about it.

“It seems like it was so long ago but I mean this story will be one I can tell my kids one day.

“You know, I played Serena Williams, I won a set off her, not a lot of people can say that.

“So yeah, definitely one of the best moments of my career so far.”

Williams won her sixth US Open title in 2014, but had failed in her bid to add a seventh in her previous three visits to Flushing Meadows.

A losing finalist in 2018, Williams was determined to go one better in 2019, and looked in good shape to do so, having battled past McNally in the second round.

Standing between Williams and a seventh US Open title was Canadian debutant Bianca Andreescu, who was appearing in just her fourth Major tournament.

Andreescu started strongly in the final, taking the first set 6-3 against her more experienced opponent.

An early break for Andreescu in the second extended her advantage before Williams immediately broke back.

The Canadian failed to convert a match point at 6-3, 5-1, 40-30, as Williams began to mount an unlikely comeback.

Winning the next four games, Williams tied things up at 5-5 before Andreescu regained control of her serve, taking the lead once more at 6-5.

Running out of steam, Williams was unable to take the second set to a tiebreaker, falling to a devastating 3-6, 5-7 defeat on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Williams never returned to a Major final, retiring from tennis in 2022 as a 23-time Grand Slam champion.

Her legacy at the US Open still remains untouched, winning a record six titles during the Open Era.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have cracked the code to tennis longevity in a way previous generations could only dream of. These three legends of the sport have revolutionized the game with a “hack” that has kept them dominating well into their 30s and beyond.

Jim Courier, a former world No 1, delved into the secret during an interview, shedding light on how Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic strategically managed their schedules to ensure peak performance and extended careers. While players like Pete Sampras, Courier himself, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, and Jimmy Connors pushed relentlessly without breaks, the Big Three approached their careers with a different mindset.

Federer, who retired at the age of 41 after an illustrious career, set the standard for scheduling breaks to recharge and avoid burnout. This approach allowed him to stay competitive and enjoy a prolonged tenure in the sport. Nadal, at 38, bid farewell to his professional career after 23 years, while Djokovic, nearing 38, continues to excel and is ranked fifth globally.

The concept of strategically skipping tournaments to prioritize rest and recovery has been a game-changer. By understanding the importance of balancing physical and mental well-being, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic have rewritten the rules of tennis success. Their ability to listen to their bodies and minds has propelled them to new heights and prolonged their careers in ways unprecedented in previous eras.

While Sampras called it quits at 31, Courier retired at 29, highlighting the stark difference in approach between the past and current tennis superstars. The Big Three's method of self-care and selective tournament participation has not only prolonged their careers but also elevated the level of competition and inspired future generations of players.

The legacy of Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic extends beyond their numerous titles and records; it's a testament to their strategic brilliance and foresight in managing their careers. As the tennis world marvels at their continued success, one thing is clear – the hack they've discovered has forever changed the game.

Sixth seed Holger Rune produced the type of ‘explosive' performance he was looking for Friday to oust defending Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell champion Casper Ruud, 6-4, 6-2, in the quarterfinals.Rune jumped out with the first four games before Ruud settled into the contest. But after serving out the opening set, the Dane once again surged to a double-break lead in set two for a decisive 88-minute victory.

It cemented Rune's second win in eight career meetings with his Scandinavian counterpart, a stat he thanked for being played up going into this latest encounter.“It's no secret that ATP made a big deal about it on social media, our head to head. So thanks for that,” Rune told ATP Media on court afterwards.“But I just saw it as another match. Casper, I have bunch of respect for him, He's a great player and I'm very happy to be able to beat him today. I think I played on my terms. I was very explosive and this is the way I want to play.”

George Russell believes that there will be more “magic” to come from former team mate Lewis Hamilton – like that seen during his Sprint victory in China – as the seven-time World Champion continues to get to grips with his new car at Ferrari.

After deciding to bring his 12-year partnership with Mercedes to an end, Hamilton has started a fresh chapter with the Scuderia this season but is still in the process of adapting to the SF-25, with his best race result so far being a P5 last time out in Bahrain.

There was, however, a high point when the Briton triumphed in the first Sprint of the campaign in Shanghai, something that Russell feels was a demonstration of what Hamilton is capable of.

When asked during media day ahead of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix about how he views Hamilton's time at Ferrari so far, Russell responded: “I don't really know, to be honest. After Fernando [Alonso] he's the most experienced driver on the grid, a seven-time World Champion and he's an incredible person and racing driver.

Hamilton enjoyed his first triumph as a Ferrari driver by winning the Sprint in China

“We saw it in China, second race of the season, on pole in the Sprint, wins the race comfortably. I know what he's capable of, and it's not easy going into a new team and the competition is tough, but he's an amazing driver and I'm sure, when things start to click, as they did in China, we'll see more of that magic.”

In terms of his own season so far, Russell is pleased with his current level of performance, having stood on the podium at three out of the opening four races while Mercedes are second in the Teams' Championship to McLaren, albeit with a deficit of 58 points.

However, the Briton believes that some of those opportunities may have come from McLaren making occasional errors, with the papaya squad still being seen as the team to beat.

“My aspirations are to fight for the World Championship and, being realistic, we don't have a car to fight McLaren,” Russell explained. “They could probably have finished first and second in every race this year, but they've given the rest of us a few opportunities.

“Myself and Max [Verstappen] have jumped on the podium probably one too many times because of a few little errors and we'll take it, but I don't imagine those errors continuing for 24 races.”

Russell has stood on the podium three times so far in 2025

Looking back on his drive to P2 last time out in Bahrain, Russell suggested that he expects a tougher fight from the Silver Arrows' competitors during the weekend ahead in Jeddah.

“It was a great race, great weekend [in Bahrain],” the 27-year-old said. “It was sort of the validation we needed from the car going to a totally different track.

“A lot of tyre overheating versus the easy degradation of Suzuka and China to see have we built a more rounded car and we clearly have. But I expect this weekend, still the competition to be tough.

“Red Bull had an off weekend – I expect them to be fast here, similar to Suzuka because there are some similarities with the high speed, smooth tarmac. But then again, we've got the softest compound of tyres which is also good, it's what we've been chasing for a little while so [I'm] really happy to see Pirelli bringing that forward.”

WEEKEND WARM-UP: McLaren the favourites as intra-team rivalry hots up in Saudi Arabia with Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes all in the mix

Pierre Gasly has topped the timesheets during the first practice hour of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix weekend, the Alpine driver causing a surprise by going fastest from McLaren's Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.

The drivers and teams were greeted by hot and humid conditions as the session got underway at 1630 local time, with Haas' Esteban Ocon leading the pack out amid a busy start at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, the majority sporting the medium tyre for their initial laps.

There were some close encounters with the walls during the early stages for the likes of Gasly and Lewis Hamilton, while Oscar Piastri – the race winner last time out in Bahrain – faced an issue of a different kind after reporting that his drink was leaking in his helmet.

Ollie Bearman, meanwhile, experienced a lock-up in the Haas – on his return to the track where he famously made his F1 debut for Ferrari last year – before Piastri asked the McLaren team to check his car, having explained that he “touched a wall a little bit”.

Practice 1 results

George Russell had gone fastest after the first runs with a lap of 1m 29.674s, putting him 0.306s ahead of Norris, while Max Verstappen followed in third. Carlos Sainz went on to displace Norris in second following a switch to the soft tyres, the Spaniard seemingly getting more comfortable with the Williams as he continues to adjust to his new car.

Attentions then started to turn to the soft-shod runs for many others, with Norris promptly setting a new benchmark via his effort of 1m 29.246s – three-tenths ahead of Russell and four-tenths clear of team mate Piastri.

Gasly subsequently caused a stir by shooting to the top of the timesheets by a mere seven-thousandths from Norris, the Frenchman arriving into the weekend after scoring Alpine's first points of the season with a P7 result in Bahrain.

There was a moment for Sainz when the Williams driver encountered a slow-moving Ferrari on the track, the four-time race winner voicing his concerns about the incident over the radio. The Racing Bulls, meanwhile, left their soft tyre runs until late in the session, with Isack Hadjar unhappy after having to abandon his initial effort amid traffic on the circuit.

Bearman will be hoping to replicate his performance from his F1 debut at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit last year

It was ultimately Gasly who remained unbeaten in P1 thanks to his lap of 1m 29.239s, with Norris and Piastri putting their McLarens in second and fourth while Leclerc split the papaya cars in third. Alex Albon was the lead Williams in fifth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, who reported something feeling “weird under braking” in his W16.

Sainz claimed P7, ahead of Hamilton in P8 and the Red Bulls of Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda in P9 and P10. Liam Lawson was 11th – the Racing Bulls driver set to be investigated after the session for an alleged failure to follow the Race Director's instructions, namely allegedly entering the painted area between the pitlane and the track. Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg was 12th while the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Hadjar were 13th to 15th respectively

Jack Doohan took P16 for Alpine, while Lance Stroll was P17 for Aston Martin and the Haas duo of Bearman and Ocon were P18 and P19. Gabriel Bortoleto, meanwhile, brought up the rear in P20 for Kick Sauber.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 2000 local time.

The ABC show killed off a major character in Thursday's episode.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers for the April 17 episode of 911, ‘Lab Rats.']


	For the first time in eight seasons, 911 has killed off a member of its core cast.




	In the ABC drama's April 17 episode, titled “Lab Rats,” L.A. Fire Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause) sacrifices his own life to save members of his crew. Bobby shares a final moment with his wife, LAPD Sgt. Athena Grant-Nash (Angela Bassett), before succumbing to a deadly virus he and his fellow firefighters had been trying to contain.

	In a long statement about his departure from the show, Krause acknowledges that long-time viewers of the show may be “upset by this loss, and they have a right to be. It is a loss.” But he also defends the decision by co-creator and showrunner Tim Minear, who told The Hollywood Reporter that “It makes sense for his character to have a tragic sacrifice as a conclusion of his entire journey in the show. And also, if there's a character whose death is going to affect the most characters, who would that be?”

	











	Krause says in his statement, “It was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them.”


	Krause also thanks his castmates, the show's executive producers, crew and technical adviser, and the real-life first responders who do the work he has portrayed on 911 for the past eight seasons. His full statement is below. 


I would like to thank Dana Walden, Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear for entrusting me with such a complex character over these nine years. It has been my honor to portray Captain Bobby Nash. 


In October 2017, through him, we began tackling topics such as grief, guilt, anger and addiction while exploring his relationship with a higher power, forgiveness and grace. On his path of healing, we watched him join and embrace both his new family at the firehouse and his new family with Athena Grant where he found love and acceptance. We also had plenty of fun along the way. It was a joy.


Humbled by working in step with our technical advisor, Chief Mike Bowman, and real firefighters, I wish to thank you all for helping me bring a sense of dignity and realism to the character in our larger-than-life emergency landscape. Your kind and complimentary words have meant the world to me. 












I've heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be.  It is a loss. That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them. We at 911 salute all the incredible men and women who do these dangerous jobs and strive to keep us safe.


Our show is incredibly difficult to make at times with long hours, challenging stunts and elaborate disasters. We couldn't do it without each other.


I wish to thank everyone in every department and all those at ABC, 20th Television and Fox. We are a sprawling team.


I will miss all my 911 family. Our incredible crew whose professional excellence is second to none. All the writers who keep pulling rabbits out of hats. All the directors tasked with the same. All the incredible guest cast over the years as well as Jennifer Love Hewitt and the cast in the call center.


I will miss my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.


Tim Minear and Brad Buecker, you've been my pillars and are two of the best in the business. I will miss you both.


Finally, I will miss my beloved and unruly children of the 118. Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody: this is a tough goodbye. Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other. That's how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.












This has been one wild adventure. I thank you all, with all my heart.

The closer you look at HBO's TV series adaptation of J.K. Rowling's fantasy novels and its criticisms, the more it seems like this show has all the ingredients to silence its doubters.

The ABC show killed off a major character in Thursday's episode.

The action-packed first look for the Disney+ series spin-off returns 'Star Wars' to theaters and includes several familiar characters. 

“Other people online were pointing out that there's real-life alumni of Duke to be far more worried about than a fictional alumni,” the actor said.

A native of the Philippines — he and his family were imprisoned during World War II — he guest-starred on ‘The Brady Bunch' and, mentored by Gene Kelly, danced on ‘Hullabaloo.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Patrick Adiarte, the Philippines-born dancer and actor who appeared in The King and I and Flower Drum Song on Broadway and the big screen and had a recurring role on M*A*S*H, has died. He was 82.


	Adiarte died Tuesday in a Los Angeles-area hospital of pneumonia, his niece, Stephanie Hogan, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	When The Brady Bunch went to Honolulu for a family vacation in a three-part episode that kicked off the fourth season of the ABC series in 1972, Adiarte played a construction gofer who gives the kids a tour before they meet with all kinds of chaos after Bobby (Mike Lookinland) discovers a small tiki idol that could be cursed.

	Adiarte also was a popular dancer on the 1965-66 NBC musical variety series Hullabaloo, where he began a short-lived singing career with the pop tune “Five Different Girls.”

	In 1952, Adiarte joined the Broadway cast of Rodgers & Hammerstein's fabled The King and I, starring Yul Brynner and Gertrude Lawrence, as one of the royal children, then toured with the production across America.


	When the musical was adapted by 20th Century Fox in 1956, he graduated to the role of Prince Chulalongkorn, the son of Rita Moreno's Tuptim. Brynner starred in the film as well, and Adiarte would consider him a surrogate father.


	For Flower Drum Song, also from Rodgers & Hammerstein and directed by Gene Kelly, Adiarte was cast in 1958 as the wise-cracking, Americanized second son Wang San, and he sang “You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll” with Pat Suzuki as the nightclub performer Linda Low. He then returned for the 1961 Universal film that starred Nancy Kwan and James Shigeta.


M*A*S*H fans know Adiarte as Ho-Jon, the orphaned Korean houseboy who assisted Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) and Trapper John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) on seven episodes of the first season (1972-73) of the CBS series. His character presumably leaves to attend medical school in the States.


	Patrick Robert Adiarte was born in Manila on Aug. 2, 1942. He, his sister, Irene, and their mother, Purita, were imprisoned by the Japanese on the island of Cebu in February 1945 during World War II. Irene, then 5, and Patrick, then 2, were burned when the Japanese lobbed grenades at them when the family tried to escape.

	











	A month later, their father, working as a captain for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was killed.


	In June 1946, the family came to New York through Ellis Island so that Irene could have what would be the first of several surgeries to remove the extensive scars on her face caused by the grenade fire.


	While the Adiartes faced threats of deportation, Patrick (and his mom, as a dancer) would wind up in The King and I. (With the help of Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy, Congress finally granted the three American citizenship In February 1956.)


	After his stage work in The King and I, Patrick studied at the Professional Children's School, where his classmates included Liza Minnelli and Marvin Hamlisch.


	While promoting Flower Drum Song in 1958 with an appearance on the NBC variety show Omnibus, he and Kelly demonstrated how tap dancing had evolved over the years, with Kelly proclaiming, “If there's gonna be another Fred Astaire, I think it might as well be Pat.”


	Kelly also helped him get a job dancing on Italian television for about a year.


	Adiarte played the college student T.J. Padmanagham in the Blake Edwards-directed back-to-school comedy High Time (1960), starring Bing Crosby, Fabian and Tuesday Weld, then was another prince in a 1961 ABC adaptation of The Enchanted Nutcracker, starring Robert Goulet and Carol Lawrence.


	Later, he would show up in the Shirley MacLaine-starring John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1965) — he portrayed a Middle Eastern Prince and son of Peter Ustinov's character — and on episodes of It Takes a Thief, Ironside, Bonanza, Hawaii Five-O and Kojak. More recently, he taught dance, including at Santa Monica College.

	











	Adiarte was married to singer-actress Loni Ackerman from 1975 until their 1992 divorce. His sister died in 2016. In addition to his niece, survivors include his nephew, Michael.

'Star Wars: Starfighter' will open in the summer of 2027.



		By Borys Kit, Patrick Brzeski 

	April 17, 2025 6:27pm	




The Star Wars feature project that teams Ryan Gosling with director Shawn Levy has a name and a release date.


Star Wars: Starfighter will open May 28, 2027. That's just three weeks after fellow mega-Disney title, Avengers: Secret Wars, which bows May 7, 2027.




	The announcement was made at a packed Star Wars Celebration panel in Tokyo, at the biennial convention that fetes all manner of things related to Jedis, Siths and other creations from the galaxy far, far away. It's unclear if the title has any connection to the 2001 computer game of the same game.

	“The reality is that this script is just so good. It has such a great story with great and original characters,” said Gosling from the stage. “It's filled with so much heart and adventure, and there just really is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn.”




			Popular on THR		







	After Gosling, wearing a “never tell me the odds” Hans Solo-quote hat, took the stage, a picture flashed on the screen of his childhood Star Wars bedsheets, which were sent in by his mom.


	“She still has them, obviously,” Gosling joked. “Naturally, she thought that it might be something that the fans would appreciate, but I suspect that she just sort of wants to justify years of hoarding.” He added: “As you can see from the picture, I guess I was probably dreaming about Star Wars before I even saw the film. And it's probably framed my idea of what a movie even was.”


	Levy has been developing the Star Wars feature since 2022 and Jonathan Tropper, who collaborated with Levy on films such as This Is Where I Leave You and The Adam Project, wrote the script.


	It would take an IT-O interrogation droid to coax any plot details from the pair, but the movie has been heating up in Hollywood casting circles in recent weeks. While many names have bubbled up only to prove to be incorrect, there does seem to be a search for a teenage actor to play opposite Gosling's mystery man and for a male and female villain.


	The film is a stand-alone movie that will be unconnected to the so-called Skywalker Saga, the stories centered on well-established and beloved characters Luke Skywalker and his father, Anakin. The events of Starfighter take place approximately five years after the events of 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. 












	“This is a stand-alone. It's not a prequel, not a sequel. It's a new adventure. It's set in a period of time that we haven't seen explored yet,” said Levy. He added that production starts this fall.


	There is high interest in the Levy-Gosling project as it will be only the second feature made since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, a movie whose reception threw the Star Wars movie plans into disarray. The first movie since Skywalker will be The Mandalorian & Grogu, a spinoff based on the popular Disney+ series The Mandalorian. That movie is in postproduction and is scheduled for a May 22, 2026 release.

The departed actor says the character “was built for this,” as Tim Minear and Angela Bassett speak to The Hollywood Reporter about the immense loss on the ABC drama.


							By 

	Max Gao



[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from season eight, episode fifteen of 911, “Lab Rats.”]


911 co-creator and showrunner Tim Minear is afraid the rumors are true: Robert “Bobby” Nash (Peter Krause), the beloved fire captain of the LAFD's Station 118, has just answered his last call.




	“Bobby's dead,” Minear confirms to The Hollywood Reporter in an interview about the biggest creative swing he has ever taken in his three-decade career. Some viewers will want to believe that Bobby's death is a fakeout — after all, this is a show known for pulling its main characters back from death's door time and again — but the steward of the 911 franchise insists that he just killed off his male lead: “The body bag didn't convince you?”

	“I've heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be. It is a loss,” Krause said in a statement about his departure from the series (read it in full here). “That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them. We at 911 salute all the incredible men and women who do these dangerous jobs and strive to keep us safe. …


	“I will miss my beloved and unruly children of the 118. Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody: this is a tough goodbye. Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other. That's how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.”


	It's a seismic shift that will completely shake the foundations of the ABC first-responder drama, which earlier this month was renewed for a ninth season. In eight seasons, 911 had never killed off a member of the main cast — a rarity for a long-running procedural — but Minear admits that the thought had been lingering in the back of his mind for years.


	Once he devised his plan for a midseason, two-part thriller, which finds some members of the 118 injured in a lab explosion and trapped with a lethal strain of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Minear knew he needed to pull the (metaphorical) trigger on one of his characters. “Otherwise, the next time I turn over a cruise ship, or land a plane on the freeway, or take a city out with a tsunami, you're just going to be like, ‘Oh, everyone's going to be fine,'” he explains. “So it was time for there to be some real tragic fallout from a story.”

	











	Minear fittingly describes Thursday's episode as a knife in the heart. While attempting to keep three of his team members alive — Chimney (Choi), who had contracted the fatal strain of CCHF; Hen (Hinds), who had to get a makeshift chest tube to prevent her lung from collapsing; and Ravi (Pisharody), who collapsed due to a lack of oxygen — Bobby discovers a hole in the air supply line in his breathing apparatus.


	Accepting his own fate, Bobby makes sure the rest of his team is taken care of. When his wife, Sgt. Athena Grant-Nash (Angela Bassett), arrives with the single dose of antiviral that she seized from the mad scientist Moira Blake (Bridget Regan), Bobby chooses to give the medication to Chimney, who quickly recovers. After the rest of his team is extracted from the lab, Bobby, much to the horror of Buck (Stark), locks himself inside the lab and takes off his protective gear. It isn't until Bobby comes face-to-face with Athena through a glass wall that he reveals he began to feel the effects of the virus hours ago.


	“I'm not choosing to leave you. I chose to save my team because it was the right thing to do. It was never because I wanted to go. I don't want to go. If I could choose, I would stay with you. Always,” Bobby tells Athena through tears. “We don't have any more time. Mine was always borrowed. L.A. was supposed to be my penance, not my home. Then you said yes to a dinner invitation, and I started to live again.”


	Athena stays with Bobby as he takes his last breath while kneeling in a prayer position over a table, and Bassett herself made the decision for Athena to shriek in agony. “It was incredulous to me that it was Bobby, so it was just very surprising,” Bassett tells THR of her reaction to losing her character's other half. “Sometimes, you're just struck dumb — and that's one of those moments, because their bond has been so wonderful and so strong these past four or five years. I didn't see that coming. None of us saw that coming.”

	











	In his statement, Krause said of Bassett, “I will miss my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.”


	Bassett and Minear, who both serve as executive producers of 911, spoke with THR on Wednesday in separate conversations. Their chats have been edited into the conversation below.


Peter Krause has always talked about how much he enjoyed working on this show, so this storyline came as a real shock to longtime viewers like myself. Tim, given that Peter is the male lead and an executive producer, was it ultimately his decision to leave, or did you decide to write him off? Are there any specific reasons that led to your decision to kill off Bobby at this point in the show's run?


TIM MINEAR I would say it was our [collective] decision, but it was my decision because I felt like creatively, if the show became too inert, it would just die of inertia, right? So I felt like it just needed to happen. Otherwise, the next time I turn over a cruise ship, or land a plane on the freeway, or take a city out with a tsunami, you're just going to be like, “Oh, everyone's going to be fine.” So it was time for there to be some real tragic fallout from a story.


	Once I started thinking that somebody had to die, then the choice was, who? And the only choice that I thought made sense was Bobby. It makes sense for his character to have a tragic sacrifice as a conclusion of his entire journey in the show. And also, if there's a character whose death is going to affect the most characters, who would that be? So, go big or go home.

	











	Bobby's death gives new life to every single character's story. It changes everything. It's not a shock moment. It's not a superficial thing. It is a potentially game-changing thing. Is it a skinny branch I'm crawling out on? Maybe. But I will never be convinced that it wasn't the right creative move. So, no, it's not because Peter wanted to leave. I don't think he wanted to leave. We're great friends. He's fantastic on the show. He's so good that it made [the decision] a terrifying choice on my part, which is why I felt like, “OK, well, maybe that's the right choice. Do the scary thing.”


When exactly did you and Peter begin discussing his exit from the series?


MINEAR We had talked about Bobby dying for a while — and I had been thinking about it this year. I'd been thinking about a major character death, let's put it that way. At one point, it was this character, maybe it was that character, or possibly this character. I had been thinking about it, but I really had been thinking about Bobby because I wanted it to open up an opportunity for stories for all the characters.


	[Writer's note: In the first half of season eight, Bobby served as a firefighting consultant for a fictional show-within-a-show called Hotshots. That fake show's captain was played by an actor named Brad Torrance, who was, in turn, played by Callum Blue.] If you look at the episode where Brad Torrance is saying that his captain [character] is not going to wake up, and a fan of that show says, “You can't kill off Brad! You can't kill off that character. He's what holds the fire family together.” That was a little hint that that's maybe where I was going to go this year. But it wasn't until I was breaking this lab leak story that I realized I'm never going to probably have another opportunity for the kind of epic death that I think this story could give me. And then it just felt like it's time to jump out of the plane.

	











What was the rest of the cast's reaction to Bobby's death? Did you and Peter break the news together, or did you do it on your own?


MINEAR They were shocked. Peter and I had been talking about it for probably three weeks to a month before I let anyone else know. I had to clear it with the network and the studio. I had to pitch them out the whole story. Everyone was very nervous. And once I got everybody on board, I talked to [co-creator] Ryan Murphy about it, and once everybody was on board and Peter was on board, then I had to start calling the cast one by one. Each of those calls was a little bit different, and none of them were quick because practically nobody believed me. They all thought I was punking them. Aisha Hinds — it probably took me 15 minutes to convince her that I was not joking.


	I know I killed off a lot of characters on Angel, Buffy or whatever, but in this instance, we had never done it in eight years. Look, I've been on a lot of [shows] – geez, on American Horror Story, how many people got murdered? But that sort of doesn't count. This is a procedural, and characters die on network TV, except we had never done it before. So this was the most fraught version of killing off a character that I've ever been involved with. It literally felt like somebody that you loved was dying. We all felt that way. I know Kenny [Choi] just kept calling me, and he's like, “Can't his mother come back and bring him back to life with her faith healing skills?” Everybody was kind of trying to bargain with God. In this case, I would be God, and I am a just God and I am a benevolent God — but he died.

	











Angela, what was your reaction when you got that unexpected phone call? How did you react to the news that you would be losing your other half on the show?


ANGELA BASSETT Tim did pull Peter first and let him know. Then he pulled me and he gave me a call and was like, “OK, Angela, this is a big change in the season. We gotta do something really dramatic — and someone's going to die.” And then there's a pause, of course. And I said, “Is it … Athena? Is it me?!” He was like, “No.” And then I started going through the list: “Is it Hen? Is it Chimney?” And I think finally, after about three or four names, I was like, “What?!” — because it was inconceivable to me that it was Bobby. It was incredulous to me that it was Bobby, so it was just very surprising. Sometimes, you're just struck dumb — and that's one of those moments because their bond has been so wonderful and so strong these past four or five years. I didn't see that coming. None of us saw that coming.


	So I think [I got the call] maybe about a week before I actually saw Peter on set. He was doing a scene and I was doing a different scene, but we were on the same location, same set. And I just remember coming to set and asking everyone, “Where's Bobby? Where's Bobby?” “He's upstairs.” “OK. I'll get to this later, but let me find my man.” [Laughs.] And we just looked at each other. You know when your eyes just lock and you don't know what to say? And you just bear hug each other and then you just shake your head. And bless his heart — he had to comfort all of us. [Laughs] He truly had to comfort all of us while he's going through his own processing in the moment. But fortunately, everything's [shot] so out of order that you can shoot what will be the finality [of that character], but you still have more time together. So that's some measure of grace — a small measure.

	











In these last two episodes, Bobby has a one-on-one scene with almost all the important people in his chosen family, who he says are responsible for saving him from the throes of addiction and making his life worth living again. Tim, how did you want to find ways to honor that growth in the character in this storyline, particularly at the very end of his life?


MINEAR He came to L.A. thinking, “I'm going to save this number of people that would make up for the lives that were taken with my mistake back in Minnesota.” And then as he says to Athena in this episode, “And then you said yes to my dinner invitation. I started to live again.” I explored a lot of it last year too, in the Amir storyline. So I think he's a guy who came to L.A. with a death wish, and at the end of the day, he ends up sacrificing himself to save the people that he loves, but he no longer wishes to die — so that the sacrifice actually means something.


Angela, given all the time that you and Peter have spent playing these characters and building this relationship, what do you remember from the painful experience of having to shoot Bobby's death scene? Did you feel as helpless shooting that sequence in the moment as the audience will feel watching it?


BASSETT I think so. I just didn't know how emotional I would be. You're not trying to plan it and plot it. I think I remember saying, “OK, I'm not crying. I'm going to be stoic. I'm going to be strong. Athena's strong.” But being separated from him by that partition of glass and the hazmat suits, we're not only separated by glass, but we have these big bubble helmets on our head, so it makes it even more impossible to touch. So I really had to look and search for his eyes. You really have to just attempt to touch each other in whatever way you can, and that is gazing in the eyes and really looking into the eyes and the soul and the spirit of another human being and seeing their humanity.

	











	So I'm looking as a character, but I'm looking as Angela; I'm looking as a human being. It was a very rich moment, and all the emotion that needed to be there was there on both our parts take after take after take. However many takes [it took], you're like, it is still fresh and real. So as hard as it was, [there] was also something very cleansing about it, because we're human and we connected as characters and we connected as colleagues. It was just a bigger-than-life moment and experience.


What else stands out to both of you in Athena and Bobby's final moments together? Angela, how specifically did you want to play Athena's last moments with the love of her life?


BASSETT As strong as Athena has been, I think she wanted to express her love to him. Maybe she could express that in that moment — all that he has been and meant to her life, her family's life, her children's life. You want to be the pillar, a bit of strength for them, in that moment, and express your love, but it's so incredibly painful. But you're going to be there until the final breath, the final moment.


MINEAR What stands out to me is the way Peter played it. It was his idea to turn away and make his way to that table and just get into this prayerful posture. I thought that was brilliant because both Peter and I agreed that — and you'll see some of this when you see the final version, some effects that have yet to be in there — what we didn't want was for Bobby to die in an orgy of body horror, where he just looked like a zombie dying or something, you know what I mean? So I think it'll feel horrifying, but poetic and subtle in a way. And Peter's decision to move away from her and turn his back to her and just get into that position I just thought was such a great choice. That's what stands out to me — and also just his performance there, both of them, of course. But when he says, “I don't want to go,” it's a knife in your heart. It's certainly a knife in mine. I'm a murderer! [Laughs uneasily.]

	











Angela, you recently said that you couldn't imagine what 911 would look like without Athena and Bobby together, but now we're about to find out. We see Athena, Buck, Hen, Chimney, Ravi and Hen's wife Karen's (Tracie Thoms) immediate reactions to Bobby's death. How much are we going to see Athena and the rest of the 118's grief play out in these final three episodes of the season? And now that we have finally reached this point, going forward, what will this show look like without Bobby and Peter?


BASSETT She's going to try to be on her own. I don't know how it's going to play out at the beginning of next season, but initially, I think she has things [to lean on] — she has her kids, but they're pretty grown. She still has the home that they were building and is attempting to complete, so that's not complete. And there's still cases [of the week], so I think her [coping] mechanism is trying to dive back into work to distract herself. But we'll see how that plays out for her, and if that's going to work or not. Maybe she needs to go to therapy or something. [Laughs]


	This is the third love of her life that she's lost in some form or fashion. [Writer's note: Athena lost her fiancé, Emmett, in the line of duty decades ago, and her ex-husband, Michael, came out as gay in the pilot.] I am very curious to see how this plays out, and I know the audience will be as well. I know some of them are going to be so shocked, mortified, pissed off — all the things! But no doubt, it's going to give us something interesting to play when we lose someone so beloved in our lives.

	











MINEAR It was important for me that this wasn't a season finale. It was important for me that we had ideally three episodes. There were actually going to be four episodes, and then I shot episode 15 very quickly and aired it as episode 13, because I wanted it to line up right before the one week that we were off. That needed to happen, to give the audience a breath. But it felt very important to me that this couldn't even be a penultimate episode. You needed two or three episodes after this moment for the audience to process it and for the characters to grieve. I just felt like it would be a giant ripoff for the audience if, for instance, this happened at the end of a season and then you came back into a new season and you missed the grieving period.


	So every one of the episodes, for the last three, even though there's thrilling adventures and high stakes and season finale-level stuff happening, everything is about the fact that Bobby's not there and them all processing that. It's not like they're going to get to three episodes in, and they're like, “OK, we're good now. Bring in the new guy!” That's not what's happening.


Tim, we know you love a good ghost story. Will Bobby appear in these final three episodes of the season?


MINEAR What I would say is that episode 15 is not Peter Krause's last appearance this season.


Angela, you and Peter share the distinction of being the longest scene partners of each other's careers. What stands out to you about the evolution of Athena and Bobby's relationship in these eight seasons, and what will you miss most about working with Peter?












BASSETT It was surprising to me when they got together at the end of that [first] season. I was like, “What?! OK.” [Laughs.] And even more surprising that now they're parting, but hopefully there will still be fond memories and they'll still get together. We'll see how he revisits her, or if he does, or for how long. When we lose someone, we dream of them sometimes, or we can be doing the most mundane thing and something in our spirit hears them or feels them or senses them, so I can't wait to see what Tim comes up with. Tim usually mirrors life in a very beautiful and poignant way. A lot of times when I read some of the scripts, I've said, “Is he eavesdropping on my life or a portion of my life? Whether it's about the kids, or the ex-husband, or friendships, or relationships.”


	[Peter's] gentle. He's easy. He's warm. He's welcoming. He knows everyone's name. He is just a wonderful actor and a quintessential good guy, so I'll miss that. He's the best, and it's been great getting to know him and working with him is always an upside and a positive with him. He's honest — and he's good for a laugh. He doesn't mind being the point of a joke because the 118, they are all a bunch of characters and funny men and clowns. They love to laugh all day with each other, so I think we're all going to miss that. But he's a beautiful soul.


Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) absence was particularly noticeable in these two episodes — some of the issues that the 118 faced in this episode could have been fixed if there was an additional medic quarantined in that lab — but Eddie is still in El Paso happily rebuilding his relationship with his son, Christopher (Gavin McHugh). What can we expect from Eddie's reaction to Bobby's death and his return to L.A. for his former captain's funeral?












MINEAR Eddie experienced it in a different way. He wasn't there. He got a phone call. So in a way, I think what Eddie's feeling is, “Would it have been different if I had been there?” So that's not going to be easy for him, but we're going to see all that in these last three episodes.


Following Thursday's episode, ABC released a teaser for the next episode, which airs May 1 and will see the show's characters confronting the loss. Watch it below.

The action-packed first look for the Disney+ series spin-off returns 'Star Wars' to theaters and includes several familiar characters. 



		By Patrick Brzeski, Abid Rahman, James Hibberd 

	April 17, 2025 6:49pm	




	The debut footage for the first Star Wars movie in seven years has now been seen by fans.


Lucasfilm and Disney revealed the first-look at The Mandalorian & Grogu, the Star Wars film spun off from Disney+'s The Mandalorian TV series, at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan. Jon Favreau, who directed the movie and co-wrote it with Star Wars guru Dave Filoni, were on hand to introduce it.




	In the action-heavy footage, the audience sees snowtroopers inside an AT-AT preparing to engage in battle. Then, in what appears to be a sort of homage to the opening of the original 1977 movie, in which Rebels prepared for, and then were massacred by, invading stormtroopers, the Mandalorian cuts open into the hull of the AT-AT, then, in one continuous take, blasts, stabs, pyros, and fights his way through the snowtroopers, making his way through the hull and then hallway, ending at the door of the cockpit, which quickly closes.

	The sizzle reel also showed the mystery character played by Sigourney Weaver speaking to Mando and Grogu, reminding Mando that he works for her. Several grandly staged battle scenes followed — an AT-T falling off the side of a snowy cliff, Grogu using his powers, Grogu swimming underwater. The reel concluded with a brief look at Jeremy Allen White as Rotta the Hutt, the son of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, raising his hands in triumph in some sort of fighting arena, and then cutting to Grogu in the stands and eating what passes for the Star Wars version of popcorn.


	Stars Pedro Pascal and Weaver, both of whom were received by standing ovations (a very fashionable Pascal's entrance was greeted with ear-splitting screams), joined filmmaker Favreau on stage, who welcomed some small, surprisingly life-like animatronic BDX Droids to the stage.


	Favreau spoke about the significance of holding this event in Japan.


	“When I think about Star Wars and what inspired Star Wars, it's so inextricably tied to Japanese cinema, Japanese culture and tradition. George Lucas was very inspired by the filmmakers of Japan and to come back here, it feels like a homecoming,” he said.


	Pascal looked back at the beginning of his involvement in the franchise, recalling his first creative meeting about the project. “I'll never forget the first day that I got to sit down with Jon and Dave in the writers room, and they showed me, wall-to-wall story illustrations of the first season of Mandalorian, without me even understanding who they expected me to play. And I remember just seeing the greatest visual storyboards that I had ever seen, and knowing that people were going to lose their minds.”

	











	Weaver noted her journey on the film began with a Zoom call with Favreau, and included the director and Filoni giving her some homework: watch the TV show.


	“When I watched it, I fell in love with all the characters, but especially this man,” she said, putting her hand on Pascal's shoulder. “There's somebody else I fell in love with. May I just say that, of course, Grogu stole my heart. And you know, I just saw him in the green room. He looks a little nervous, but I bet he'd like to come out here.”


	A tiny animatronic Grogu then took the stage to rapturous applause and waved tentatively to the crowd.


	There's no official word as to when the footage will be released online, but Star Wars Celebration is scheduled to be covered by ABC's Good Morning America on Friday morning, so it's possible the footage could drop during the telecast. If that happens, we'll update this post with the footage, so keep checking back.


The Mandalorian & Grogu marks the first big screen effort by the franchise since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and is expected to include characters from other Disney+ Star Wars series, such as Ahsoka and Star Wars: Rebels.


	The project represents an interesting twist in Disney's handling of the franchise. The company proved that Star Wars storylines can be successfully extended to the small screen, starting with the launch of The Mandalorian in 2019. But can this also work in reverse — taking TV storylines and shifting them to a theatrical release?

	











	Once again, Pascal reprises his role as Din Djarin, the helmet-wearing rogue Mandalorian who travels the galaxy with his adorable Jedi-powered ward, Grogu (who is known pretty much everywhere as Baby Yoda).


	The cast also Jonny Coyne as an Imperial warlord. The rest of the cast has been kept under wraps.


	Originally, Favreau and Filoni had done some work on a fourth season of The Mandalorian, which was delayed due to the Hollywood strikes. During this period, Disney reportedly decided to opt for a Mandalorian film instead and announced the project in January 2024.


	Neither Favreau nor Filoni have said much publicly about the film. But last year at D23 Favreau said on the red carpet, “To come back together and have the scale and scope of the big screen to tell a story with characters people already know in a brand-new adventure that can … part of what we've set out to do is something that rewards people who have been with the show since the beginning, who have been with Star Wars since the beginning. But since we're on the big screen, it's an opportunity to reach out to a whole new audience with a whole new adventure and certainly with Grogu — certainly all the kids know who that is, and this is an opportunity to bring them to the theater.”


	The news comes as Disney+ prepares to release its highly anticipated second season of another Star Wars project, Andor, which returns April 22. Other Star Wars films in development include Ford v Ferrari filmaker James Mangold's Dawn of the Jedi movie, a new Star Wars trilogy from X-Men franchise writer Simon Kinberg, and Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy's stand-alone Star Wars film that was given and date and title at Star Wars Celebration. 












The Mandalorian & Grogu will be released on May 22, 2026.

Group ""immediately"" severed ties with the musician who joined the group in 2014.

The New Pornographers have “immediately” severed ties with drummer Joe Seiders after the longtime member of the rock collective was arrested in Palm Desert, CA for possession of child pornography.

	According to a press release from the Riverside Sheriff's office, Seiders was arrested after officers were dispatched to investigate a report of suspicious activity on April 7 at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant, where an 11-year-old boy told officers that an unknown man had recorded him on a cell phone while he was using the bathroom. Two days later, police said an employee at the same restaurant reported that the man was seen entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males.

	“Believing the male was the suspect from the previous incident, law enforcement was contacted. Upon arrival, deputies located the suspect, identified as 44-year-old Joseph Seiders of Palm Desert, and took him into custody,” read the release. After an investigation, officers served search warrants on Seiders' residence, vehicle and cell phone, where they reportedly found evidence implicating Seiders in both incidents and “additional crimes,” which they said included possessing child pornography. 


	Seiders was booked into the John Benoit Detention Center in Indio, CA for possession of child pornography, annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy. 


	In a statement on Instagram, the band wrote, “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders — and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.” When asked for further comment, a spokesperson for the band's management referred Billboard to the group's official statement.


	Seiders joined the Canadian indie power pop supergroup — which formed in Vancouver in 1997 — in 2014, joining charter members singer Neko Case, singer/guitarist Carl Newman and bassist John Collins. He appeared on their 2017 album Whiteout Conditions, as well as 2019's In the Morse Code of Brake Lights and 2023's Continue as a Guest, as well as their recent single “Ballad of the Last Payphone.” The drummer is being held at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility with bail set at $1 million and is scheduled to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday (April 22).

	Lady Gaga is seeing renewed success on Australia's charts this week, as her latest album Mayhem rockets back into the ARIA Top 10 following her much-talked-about Coachella appearance and the ongoing rollout of her Australian stadium tour.

Mayhem climbs from No. 14 to No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart, boosted by the pop icon's high-energy set at Coachella and a surge in demand tied to her recently announced Aussie tour dates. The album originally debuted at No. 1 last month, and this latest jump marks its fourth week in the chart's upper echelon.

	Earlier this month, Gaga announced her return to Australia with The Mayhem Ball, her first tour of the country in more than a decade—and her first stadium dates Down Under. After quickly selling out her initial shows in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, a second Melbourne and Sydney date was added on April 16 due to overwhelming demand. The five-date run kicks off Dec. 5 at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne and wraps Dec. 13 at Accor Stadium in Sydney.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The tour promotion, paired with Gaga's Coachella performance and social media buzz, has sparked renewed interest in the Mayhem project. The album, led by the global No. 1 single “Die With a Smile” (with Bruno Mars), has spent multiple weeks in the Top 10 worldwide, including a 15-week reign atop the Billboard Global 200.


	Gaga's resurgence on the ARIA chart comes amid a strong week for Aussie acts: hip-hop trio Bliss n Eso debut at No. 1 with The Moon (The Light Side)—their fourth chart-topper—while Australian Idol winner Marshall Hamburger lands at No. 50 with The Idol Collection, marking the first time since 2009 that an Idol champ has entered the Top 50 upon season close.


	Meanwhile, on the ARIA Singles Chart, Alex Warren notches a fourth consecutive week at No. 1 with viral hit “Ordinary,” and Gaga and Mars' “Die With a Smile” rebounds into the Top 5, climbing from No. 9 to No. 4.


	With Mayhem back in the Top 10 and her Australian stadium shows selling fast, Gaga's momentum in the region is only continuing to build, with a final tour date added to Sydney earlier this week.

Though its accompanying album might again be subject to a sense of mystery, ""Bluebird"" proves Lana Del Rey knows exactly what she's doing in her new era.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



Lana Del Rey fans have received a fresh taste of her new era, with “Bluebird” arriving as the latest preview of her forthcoming record.


	Dropping just a week after “Henry, Come On” gave fans their first insight of what to expect from Del Rey's self-described “country” record, “Bluebird” has ostensibly further confirmed that her sonic shift won't be one steeped in the standard trappings of a country record.


	Much like its predecessor, “Bluebird” is another soaring piece of emotional introspection from Del Rey, as she pairs softly-plucked acoustic guitars with stirring strings and her trademark reverb-laden vocals. Written alongside Luke Laird, and featuring production from Drew Erickson, it's a dream team of country and folk at play, and provides further indication that Del Rey's upcoming record is set to be another high point of her career.

	Currently, however, it's unclear just when that new record will arrive – or what fans will be specifically asking for at record stores. Initially teased under the name Lasso in early 2024 and given a September release date, the 13-track record was later given a fresh moniker by way of The Right Person Will Stay and an updated release date of May 10.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Following the release of “Henry, Come On,” Del Rey has since told fans her forthcoming 10th album is once again subject to a sense of mystery. “You know it's not going to come on time, right?” she explained on April 11. “Should I even tell you that the name changed again? Should I tell you that now, while you're so happy that you even have a song? Yeah, maybe I'll wait.”


	A late album is nothing new for the beloved singer, as her three most recent projects — Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, Chemtrails Over the Country Club and Blue Banisters — were all delayed for various reasons.


	Del Rey is currently scheduled to perform at Stagecoach on April 25, with a series of dates slated to follow across the U.K. throughout June and July. She'll return to the U.S. in the summer for a performance at Iowa's Hinterland Music Festival on Aug. 3.

The 17-track project includes collabs with Victoria Monét, Becky G and more.


													By
												

	Heran Mamo



Davido released his fifth studio album, 5ive, on Friday (April 18) via Davido Music Worldwide, RCA Records and Sony Music UK.


	The 17-track project includes previously released singles “Awuke” with YG Marley, “Funds,” featuring Odumodublvck and Chike, and “Be There Still,” and it includes more collaborations with Victoria Monét (“Offa Me”), Shenseea and 450 (“R&B”), Musa Keys and Victony (“Holy Water”), Chris Brown (“Titanium”), Becky G (“Tek”), Tayc and Dadju (“Lover Boy”) and Omah Lay (“With You”). 


	“This 5ive album? Man, it means everything to me. It's more than just a number — it's a statement of where I stand, five albums in,” the Afrobeats icon said in a press release. “Getting to work with artists that I love and respect from all over the world on this project was a blessing. Different sounds, different cultures, but one vibe! This one right here shows my growth, my journey and where I am now in my life and my artistry.”

	











5ive arrives two years after his last studio album, Timeless, which reached No. 2 on Billboard‘s World Albums chart and No. 37 on the Billboard 200. It was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards, while its Musa Keys-assisted hit single “Unavailable” hit No. 3 on U.S. Afrobeats Songs and was nominated for best African music performance. Davido was nominated in the best African music performance category again this year with Brown's “Sensational,” also featuring Lojay, which marked both Davido and Lojay's career-first entries on the Billboard Hot 100 last year when the song debuted at No. 96 (and later reached No. 71).

	Said Levy, “There are many rumors, some true, some not. … This is not a prequel, this is not a sequel. It's a new adventure.”

	Until now, the project which is being written by Jonathan Tropper for the last two years, has been under wraps. It's a standalone movie outside the Luke Skywalker core canon. While Disney's Lucasfilm has multiple Star Wars features in development with James Mangold, Simon Kinberg, and a Rey post Episode IX movie with Daisy Ridley returning and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy directing, the Levy Star Wars project is known to be in tip-top fastrack shape.

	It was recently reported that Anora Oscar winner Mikey Madison passed on a supporting role offer in the new Levy directed Star Wars movie. 


	Levy is a cornerstone filmmaker for Disney having delivered them the highest grossing R-rated movie of all-time with Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine which minted $1.33 billion worldwide.


	Levy's Star Wars movie would be the second after next year's The Mandalorian and Grogu to hit the screen following 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker which minted $1.077 billion.

SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about Episode 815 of ABC's 9-1-1, “Lab Rats.“


	Four Station 118 firefighters got trapped into a lab with a deadly virus on ABC's 9-1-1. Three of them, Chimney, Hen and Ravi, had a brush with death but it was the fourth who didn't come out alive: Captain Bobby Nash, played by series co-lead and executive producer Peter Krause.


	Thursday night's episode, “Lab Rats,” written by series executive producer Kristen Reidel, Molly Green and James Leffler and directed by Dawn Wilkinson, marked Krause's final appearance as Bobby sacrificed himself to save his team.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In an interview with Deadline, 9-1-1 executive producer/showrunner Tim Minear explained the decision to kill off the beloved character, which is certain to leave the series' legions of fans heartbroken, and what it would mean for the long-running drama, which has been renewed for a ninth season. He addressed the online leaks from the shoot of Bobby's funeral, along with the release of “The Last Alarm” title for that episode that tipped fans off to his fate, and that alternate (and fake) Bobby death script page that further fueled speculation that he may be gone. He also pointed out the clue to Bobby's looming demise early in the season, which you likely missed, gave an update on Bobby's mom and teased upcoming 9-1-1 cast addition(s).

9-1-1 co-lead/executive producer Angela Bassett, who plays Bobby's wife, LAPD Sargent Athena Grant, spoke of her shock and her meeting with Krause after learning of Bobby's fate. She revealed that — possibly as a redirect — there was another firefighter in the lab who they initially thought was going to die.


	Bassett detailed the filming of Bobby and Athena's emotional goodbye scene on opposite sides of a glass door and shared that they shot a different version of its ending after Bobby tells Athena, “You have to go, you can't be here for this next part” in which she complies with his request. 


	In the final cut, Athena replies with, “I'm here for all the parts that we have left” and stays with Bobby as he kneels to pray and dies, a final chord Krause had a key involvement in beyond acting, Minear revealed.

	











DEADLINE: For a long-running drama like 9-1-1 to kill off a major star the reasons are often financial, sometime creative and occasionally both. Which one do we have here?


TIM MINEAR: Creative.


DEADLINE: 100% creative?


MINEAR: 100%


DEADLINE: When and why did you make that decision to kill off Bobby?


MINEAR: Like you said, going into Season 9, I have all these perilous situations that I put the characters into, and I think maybe the writers but also the audience starts to get a little complacent because it's like, well, we all know it's going to all work out fine in the end. 


	I had been toying with the idea for a couple of seasons actually, maybe even longer, feeling like at some point I'm going to have to do this. And then once I came up with this idea for the lab leak episode, that's when it solidified for me that it was time to do it, it felt like a real opportunity to give somebody an epic Wrath of Khan-like death. When it came down to deciding who should that be, I wanted it to be a character that affected all the characters' stories in a very specific and yet different ways. There was only one man for the job, and it was Bobby.

	So that's why. It was a wrenching decision, and I think it was wrenching for everybody, because I adore Peter, and he's so great on the show, really the backbone of the show in so many ways, which is why it was both a terrifying decision but also, creatively, I just knew that it would be so meaningful and have such repercussions and give me so much story for the show. 


	Once I had made that choice, suddenly the world of the show seems so much more real to me, just feeling the grief of the characters and feeling just how that nuclear bomb going off in the center of that universe affected everything. Suddenly everything just felt weirdly more alive to me.


DEADLINE: There is this line in Bobby's final speech where he says, “I don't want to go.” I felt like Peter was not acting; the guy said just last last year that he wanted to do 100 more episodes of 9-1-1. What was his reaction to the news that his character is being killed off?


MINEAR: Peter is a friend of mine. He understands the realities of the creative process, and he knew it wasn't personal, he understood right away why I was telling him this. But I don't think it was an easy decision for any of us, it really felt like a loved one was dying in a way I never expected.


	When I was on Angel many, many years ago, I was known as the Tim Reaper because I would constantly kill off beloved characters. On a show about vampires, it's a little different, they can always come back. But here, because we'd all been in this together for over eight years, it's like, “Oh, it's TV, you kill off characters,” but when it came right down to it, I think we were all surprised at how incredibly emotional it was for all of us, crew, his castmates, me, him. And it remains that way right now, very raw.


DEADLINE: Angela, did you have any inkling that something of this magnitude might be coming this season? 


BASSETT: Absolutely not. Not an inkling, not a word, not birdies, nothing. This is near the end of the season. Sometimes near the end of the season, we're in this race against time to get our scripts, you're really getting it in real time. It's like get it today, and we're going to start filming it tomorrow. 

	











	So it was really a jaw-dropping moment when I read the script and saw that. Well, initially it was a different character, the whole bio lab. I mean, it could be anyone, it could be Chimney, it could be him, it could be Ravi.


	I remember Tim called. He said, someone's going to pass away. I said, Is it me? Self-preservation, you know. I went through the list, you start with yourself, but I was very surprised that it was my husband.


DEADLINE: You mentioned that there was a different character that initially was supposed to die. Did something change in the script?


BASSETT: That may have been just a misdirect, but initially it was Ravi, the probie; well, he is not a probie anymore.


DEADLINE: Angela, if I understood correctly, you literally found out about the death when you got the “Lab Rats” episode script, not earlier in the season?


BASSETT: Literally. Trust and believe, yeah.


DEADLINE: So when you were interviewed in March and said that you cannot imagine the show without Peter, you weren't being coy and protecting the secret, you were just being honest?


BASSETT:  I try to always be honest and never lie. Only after we'd received the episode we had to be a little bit coy. No, I can't imagine, that's true. And even sitting here today, I can't imagine it. I don't know how this is going to play out: Athena, her relationship with her job, herself, her kids, the 118. This is the second husband that she's lost and the end of her and Peter's tremendous bond. Where is she going? 


DEADLINE: As an actor, you see where this is probably going. Athena was in a great place, building a new home with her husband. And now she's lost a third significant other: a fiancé and a husband to death, and another husband to divorce. 


BASSETT: You're so right about that, I forgot about Emmett. 


DEADLINE: It feels like the writers want Athena back in a rocky, dark, emotional state. 


BASSETT: I think you're right, I think you might be on to something.


DEADLINE: This is a huge shock to the system of the entire team. We saw Chimney who clearly has survivor guilt; I can't even imagine what Athena will go through. Tim, can you talk about the impact of Bobby's death?


MINEAR: Well, not only is Bobby the captain of the 118, he is a father figure and mentor to Buck. He is an inspiration to all of them. He is seen as a husband. He is Athena's children's stepfather. It just reaches every element of the show. And as far as where we're going to go with all that, the story will tell me.


DEADLINE: Will you be adding somebody to the cast in the wake of Peter's exit? Somebody needs to lead the 118.


MINEAR: There will be changes in the universe. I'm still working my way through what those changes will be. I'm definitely going to be adding to the fire family but not necessarily in the way you might think.


DEADLINE: Did you adjust Bobby's story arc this season to give him a proper sendoff? Obviously he died a hero, saving his team, but he also had a heroic moment in the pre-lab leak episode, emerging from the smoke of a bus crash with a baby in his arms. He finally reconciled with his mother, too. 


MINEAR: Yes, a little bit actually. I'd really been thinking about it back during the first part of the season. There's a moment in the first part of the season when Brad Torrence, the Hotshots [TV show] star, says that his captain is never going to wake up from his coma, and a fan says, you can't kill him off, he's the father figure of the firehouse. So that was me hinting a little bit about where I might be going.

	











DEADLINE: Was Peter involved in crafting Bobby's ending? 


MINEAR: When I told him what was happening, like I said, he understood. And then I laid out for him how I felt this sacrifice would present itself. In a way, it's not arbitrary at all that this is Bobby, because it makes sense in the tragic arc of his character, for this to be his ending, that he ended up sacrificing himself to save the people that were closest to him. And if you want to talk about redemption, it's the ultimate redemption. We talked about every element of how we would accomplish it.


DEADLINE: Did Bobby die before his mother? Will we find out if she's still alive?


MINEAR: Yes, you'll see her at the funeral.  


DEADLINE: I assume that will be the May 1 episode “The Last Alarm”?


MINEAR: Yes.


	Following the airing of the “Lab Rat” episode, ABC released a promo for “The Last Alarm,” which deals with the immediate aftermath of Bobby's death and features his funeral.


DEADLINE: Speaking of the funeral. Didn't you guys learn anything from And Just Like That… and Succession about using decoys to throw bystanders off and protect a major death? As videos from the location shoot hit social media, online sleuths quickly deducted that Bobby is probably dead.   


MINEAR: We had our fingers crossed that when we went out and shot the procession, it wouldn't leak. I think we were just all being incredibly naive; I think I've underestimated the interest of the fans out there for this show. I think I've always been a little bit surprised by it. You know me, I'd worked in genre for so long, and that fan base is quite rabid and quite interested. Half the time I think, well, this is my network procedural, people aren't going to be as stanning about this show as they were about the other shows, but boy, I think the stanning on this show is bigger than anything I did in genre.


	I wanted the pageantry, I wanted the production value, I needed that. And so we rolled the dice, and we shot it in public. Now, the fact that I was literally watching the tap from the camera and Twitter, and I was like, hmm, which one's the tap and which one's somebody livestream TikTok-ing it, that was a bit of a shock.


DEADLINE: What about that fake script page with Bobby calling 911 from a coffin, which Oliver Stark posted on April Fools' Day that also riled fans up? How did that come about?


MINEAR: As far as that page, I don't know where that came from.


DEADLINE: Angela, what was your conversation like with Peter after finding out that Bobby was going to die. Did you call him right away?


BASSETT: No. I knew it was gonna be tough and sad and awkward, so I just preferred to see him face to face as opposed to on the phone. Part of us knows, we've been in this industry for a while, these kind of things have happened to our characters from time to time. I saw him, we looked at each other, it's like, oh well, and gave each other a big hug. We're just like, didn't see this coming.


	At that moment, we knew it's something that you have to process over the days and weeks, especially as you're still filming episodes and episodes. It's something that's coming but it's slowly revealing itself. It's a goodbye, but it's taking time. I guess it gave us all a chance to process and mourn. And we did, because we're an incredibly close cast, that team is very close. In scenes where Peter and I found ourselves with each other, it was like, “Oh my god, I can't believe it.” “I know, what are we gonna do?” “How do you feel?” Knowing the end and still having the ending scene to do.

	











DEADLINE: Let's talk about that ending scene for Bobby and Athena at the lab. Was this the last scene you two filmed? 


BASSETT: No, fortunately, it wasn't the last scene. Since we do everything out of order, I still had a few more scenes to do with him. It was a heart-wrenching moment, and then that's the goodbye. Cutting it off bit by bit, not a big chop as it were.


DEADLINE: How did you feel doing the goodbye scene, not even being able to be in the same space with your acting partner?


BASSETT: I actually enjoyed it. It added even more emotionality for me because I couldn't get to him, I couldn't touch him, embrace him, grab him. It's like there's this barrier so you're really trying to break through the glass. It really set something up for me that I didn't expect, because we had a number of scenes where, okay, I think this is where the emotion is going to be.


	We did two different versions [of the final scene]. There was also a version where, when he tells me to leave as he doesn't want me to see what he needs to do and what he's going to do in the lab, I go out and I'm by myself, and there's Buck, and then I have a breakdown there, like I was so strong for him inside.


	I was like, uh-uh. I said, well, I've done it now. I can't cry every single scene. I mean, you still have a funeral to go through.


	But when it came to that scene where I was actually in it with Bobby, you're separated by the glass, by the partition, by everything that separates people, your metaphor for whatever separates people, the virus, all of it. And seeing them, seeing their eyes, the memory of who they are, who they are to you, it was just there, every moment, every take for the two of us — the history, the bond.


DEADLINE: Knowing what happens with Peter brings additional meaning to some of the dialogue in that scene, Bobby saying “I don't want to go” and “I'm sorry, we don't have any more time” and Athena responding, “We need more time.” Was any of that improvised? It seems a bit like you're talking about you as actors not being on the show together anymore.


BASSETT: No, that's all Tim, those were the words. But yeah, it has that whole double entendre, double meaning that's come into play, absolutely, yeah.


DEADLINE: What about the touching of the hands through the glass, was all in the script too?


BASSETT: I believe that was in the script as well, a little of that, they wanted that moment.


DEADLINE: Tim, you mentioned redemption earlier. Bobby was praying as he died, also coming full circle as he and Athena first bonded when they went to church together. How did you come up with that ending?


MINEAR: That was Peter. That was Peter.


DEADLINE: Angela, how was it filming that? Was that the hardest part of that whole sequence?


BASSETT: Again, we filmed two versions of this, and I think that was the hardest part. But I always thought this version was the most right and heroic of Bobby, because that is such an integral part of his journey. And leaning in that moment still on his faith. That it is a tough, impossible situation, but there's still his creator, there's still hope. Never surrender that. And I thought it was beautiful and touching. He couldn't touch me, but he can still touch. He can still be in communion with his creator. So I love that.


	So I appreciate what the version of it that I longed for was [chosen]. Even with the separation of the glass, there's a tremendous bond and respect. And they're vulnerable with each other. They've had to be so strong for their team but they have that moment of vulnerability and still, you can go on your knees and pray.

	











DEADLINE: Who picked Hozier's “Work Song” for Bobby's final moments?


MINEAR: That was Kristen Reidel.


DEADLINE: Tim, are you afraid of fans' reaction to Bobby's death? Are you going into witness protection?


MINEAR: I I've been in witness protection ever since I stopped looking at social media. That's the way I protect myself, is I just don't look at that stuff.


	I'm definitely going out on a skinny branch in some way. We'll see what happens. I fervently believe that it was the right move creatively for the show. I didn't expect us to be going into a ninth year, and if the show has any hope of being creatively viable and alive going forward, then you need moments like this. You need them.

			By Glenn Garner, Anthony D'Alessandro 


	Director Jon Favreau, Pedro Pascal and Sigourney Weaver took the stage at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo today to show off more footage from their upcoming The Mandalorian and Grogu.


	For some time, all we knew is that the new movie will bring the bounty hunter and baby Yoda on a standalone mission.


	In the new footage, Weaver's character is teased, along with some action-packed battle scenes against stormtroopers. Fans also get a first glimpse at Jeremy Allen White as Jabba's son Rotta the Hutt.


	The last time we caught footage of movie which isn't due for release until May 22, 2026 was at D23 in Anaheim back in August. That clip showed the return of The Empire Strikes Back‘s AT-ATs stomping in the snow, the crazy voiced tiny alien tech Babu Frick from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and red alien, pointy eared Zeb from Filoni's animated series Star Wars: Rebels.

	











The Mandalorian and Grogu is the first Star Wars feature since Rise of Skywalker six years ago. Originally Lucasfilm had a plan to do standalone movies based on core canon characters, but with the tanking of Solo: A Star Wars Story, they pivoted, expanding the Star Wars universe on Disney+ and significantly taking a more patient approach to developing future Star Wars movies.

“The Real Housewives of New York City” star, Bethenny Frankel, told fans on April 17 that she's making a monumental change in her life.

“I have some news to share with you. I've been waiting 'til I got here to tell you, but I am moving to Florida for personal and professional reasons. Something has arisen that made this the best and healthiest decision for myself and my daughter,” she said in an Instagram reel. 

A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel)

The former reality star added, “We will maintain residences in the Hamptons and New York City because we love New York, but this will be our primary and permanent residence.”

Panning to the ocean, Frankel told viewers, “This will be my backyard.”

In the caption, she wrote, “Excited to share this with you … It's been a concept for a while, but personal & private circumstances have made this the healthiest life choice.”

A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel)

Frankel has been a New York City fixture for decades, but in 2022, she made the decision to sell her apartment in Manhattan, the New York Post reported. 

According to Frankel's rep, Jill Fritzo, the reality star is ready to leave the Big Apple. “Her residences will be in the Hamptons and Connecticut,” she told the publication.

A source revealed to the Post, “She will live in Connecticut, and when it's summer or the weather gets hot, she will head out to the Hamptons. I'm sure she will be back in New York City again. Just with the pandemic and everything else going on, it just won't be now.”

In March 2022, Frankel told Fox 5 New York, “I'm not going to lie. I walk with my daughter. We had multiple incidents. She cringes now. She won't walk down the street without digging into my hand. It's not what it used to be.”

The “RHONY” star shared, “It is not the same city that we used to have. It's got to get under control. I feel like it's the place to dip in for business and to maybe get a meal, but I don't feel like risking my life.”

A post shared by Ramona Singer (@ramonasinger)

“The Real Housewives of New York” star Ramona Singer is known for her love of Palm Beach, Florida, and is a frequent partygoer there.

“Toasting to another great time in #PalmBeach this season as always!!!! thank you @pbacchini for the best #cocktail party,” she shared in an April 16 Instagram post. 

On April 7, Singer posted a pic of her on an exclusive resort and wrote, “Sunday at the Breaker's. Love this golf outfit by my gf.”

“RHONY” star Sonja Morgan also left NYC for warmer weather and purchased a West Palm Beach condo in 2024 for $600,000, the New York Post reported. 

While smaller than her Manhattan townhouse, the condo features two bedrooms and two bathrooms, as well as a waterfront view. It also offers luxury amenities such as a doorman, swimming pool, and gym.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Josh Groban Reveals Most Rewarding Part of Being an ‘American Idol' Mentor","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/josh-groban-american-idol-mentor/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 01:06:57 GMT","

Josh Groban brings his wealth of experience to “American Idol” season 23 as a guest mentor. The talented singer shared what he loves most about imparting his vast knowledge to the young hopefuls.

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

In an April 2025 interview with Billboard, Groban shed some light on what it was like to mentor the “American Idol” hopefuls.

For Groban, it was a no-brainer to join the show. “They didn't even mention Hawaii before I said yes,” he explained. “I've done it before, whether it's on ‘Idol' or through my foundation, working with after school programs or kids that are just in need of that push and advice.”

He continued, “My favorite thing about having a platform is being able to impart some small amounts of wisdom that maybe will help them escape some of the trappings that I had to learn the hard way.”

Groban shared that making a show involves a lot of behind-the-scenes efforts that aren't seen. “The talent is genuine and the notes we give are genuine,” he noted. “I wish that audiences could see us when the cameras aren't rolling — working with Jelly [Roll] and the way we're talking about what the contestants need to do.”

He also provided some insight into how they are really “invested” as mentors. “We really care. It's not just for TV. Because we've been there and we know how special this is for them and we also know that these are notes that will travel with them beyond the competition,” Groban explained.

The singer pointed out that, although there's only one “Idol” winner, their guidance as mentors extends beyond the show.

“They may decide to not continue with music, but we can also note that having this experience will be a foundation of confidence for them for the rest of their lives and we want to make sure that the things we instill in them allow them to have that for whatever they do,” Groban added.

A post shared by Josh Groban (@joshgroban)

While Groban may have been mentored by music industry heavy-hitters like David Foster when he started his career, he also received valuable mentorship in school.

“I also want to give a huge shout out to my teachers,” Groban shared. “The unsung heroes were my choir teachers in junior high and high school, when I was at my most insecure. They were essential in helping me find my voice, find myself.”

He added, “And it just so happens that I went into it professionally, but even if I hadn't … it helped me as a human being. It helped me as somebody who was a little lost inside myself to realize that my voice had a place in this world and if I'd gone into veterinary medicine, which was my other dream, it still would've followed me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Bachelor' Couple Gives Big Update on New Baby","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-bachelor/arie-luyendyk-lauren-baby-reveal/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:33:57 GMT","

Former “Bachelor” Arie Luyendyk Jr. and his wife Lauren have given a big update on their new baby.

They shared a video on their Instagram page announcing that their fourth child will be a girl.

“We can't wait to meet you baby GIRL,” the video says. The couple also shared a photo showing them eating bright pink cake with their three kids. Another photo showed Arie with cake smeared on his face.

The couple is already parents to Alessi, 5, and twins Senna and Lux, 3.

According to E! News, the couple previously revealed that Arie “had undergone a vasectomy reversal to try for another kid.” The couple seemed shocked to find out they were having another girl especially because Arie had predicted they were having a girl in a previous video.

“I think it's a boy,” Ari said in that video. “This pregnancy feels different so, team boy.” Lauren also said in that video that she would be shocked if the baby wasn't a boy, and Arie's parents also predicted that she was having a boy. However, they seemed excited, although surprised, when they learned the baby is a girl. 

Lauren has taken fans through the journey of her pregnancy on her Instagram page.

In the video, Arie and Lauren both held balloons with their three kids standing in front of them. They then popped the balloons to reveal pink confetti, which showered down on them.

A post shared by Arie Luyendyk (@ariejr)

The couple then kissed, and the video showed their kids eating pink cake.



Other members of Bachelor Nation offered their congrats in the comment thread of the video post.

Tayshia Adams wrote, “Omg yayyyy!!! Congrats you two!! 🫶🏾💗🌸”

“I knew it! Senna and Lux were so adamant about it being a girl I was like it has to be! Congrats!! ♥️♥️” wrote another person.

“Congratulations! Your daughters are very lucky to have you as their daddy, you are such a caring/loving and fun girl dad! And now Lux and you will have a special bond forever of being the only boys!” wrote another person.

“STOPPPP!!! 3 GIRLS!!! 🎀🎀🎀 so excited for you guys!!” another person wrote.

SPOILER ALERT: Stop reading if you don't want to see potential spoilers for “9-1-1” Season 8 Episode 15 – “Lab Rats”

The latest episode of ABC's hit drama “9-1-1,” which aired on Thursday, April 17, saw four of the series' firefighters as they were trapped in a laboratory with a deadly virus in the air. While three of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) firefighters, Chimney (Kenneth Choi), Hen (Aisha Hinds), and Ravi (Anirudh Pisharody), had a brush with death, one character said their last goodbyes to the series. 

Captain Bobby Nash, played by co-lead and executive producer Peter Krause, became the series first major character death in the episode, titled “Lab Rights.” Co-written by executive producer Kristen Reidel, Molly Green and James Leffler, the episode saw Krause's character sacrifice his life to save his team as a deadly gas descended on them. 

“9-1-1” co-lead and executive producer Angela Bassett recalled hearing the news of Bobby's death in an interview with Deadline, calling the moment, “jaw-dropping.”

When asked if she expected a major character death to occur in Season 8, Bassett responded: “Absolutely not. Not an inkling, not a word, not birdies, nothing.”

“This is near the end of the season,” Bassett added. “Sometimes near the end of the season, we're in this race against time to get our scripts, you're really getting it in real time. It's like get it today, and we're going to start filming it tomorrow.” While “Lab Rats” is the penultimate episode of the currently-airing season, Bassett told Deadline that the series frequently films “out of order.”

Rumors of a major death coming in Season 8 have been making their rounds online since March 2025, when photos and videos leaked online showing the cast filming a funeral procession scene for a member of the LAFD. The scene has now been confirmed to appear in next week's season finale as the cast mourn the death of their Captain, Bobby Nash. 

“It was a jaw-dropping moment when I read the script and saw that,” said Bassett. “Well, initially it was a different character, the whole bio lab. I mean, it could be anyone, it could be Chimney, it could be [Bobby], it could be Navi.”

Bassett later added that she learned exactly who would be dying from “9-1-1” showrunner, Tim Minear. “I remember Tim called. He said someone's going to pass away,” Bassett told Deadline. “I said, is it me? Self-preservation, you know. I went through the list, you start with yourself, but I was very surprised it was my husband.”

The NAACP Image Award winning actress portrays the character of Athena Grant, a field sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department. In the Season 4 finale of “9-1-1,” Grant married LAFD Captain Bobby Nash (Peter Krause). Krause and Bassett have co-led the drama series since its debut in 2018. 

Speaking with Deadline, Bassett recalled the first time she saw Krause after hearing the news of his character's demise, saying, “I knew it was gonna be tough and sad and awkward.”

Bassett continued: “Part of us knows, we've been in this industry for a while, these kind of things have happened to our characters from time to time. I saw [Krause], we looked at each other, it's like, oh well, and gave each other a big hug. We're just like, didn't see this coming.”

Thursday's episode similarly featured a “heart-wrenching” final goodbye scene between Athena and Bobby. Separated by glass as the deadly virus takes hold of Bobby, he tells his wife, “I'm sorry, this isn't how I wanted to leave you. I'm not choosing to leave you. I chose to save my team because it was the right thing to do. It was never because I wanted to go. I don't want to go. If I could choose, I would stay with you always.”

Bassett told Deadline that, while the scene was emotionally difficult, she “actually enjoyed” the filming process, saying, “It added even more emotionality for me because I couldn't get to him, I couldn't touch him, embrace him, grab him. It's like there's this barrier so you're really trying to break through the glass.”

She added: “But when it came to that scene where I was actually in it with Bobby, you're separated by the glass, by the partition, by everything that separates people, your metaphor for whatever separates people, the virus, all of it. And seeing them, seeing their eyes, the memory of who they are, who they are to you, it was just there, every moment, every take for the two of us – the history, the bond.”

Bassett's role as Athena Grant-Nash continues on the finale of “9-1-1” Season 8, which is set to air on ABC on Thursday, May 2, at 8pm EST.

Talk show host and “American Idol” alum Jennifer Hudson's jaw hit the floor when Jelly Roll confessed his most embarrassing concert moment during a Q&A segment on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” airing on April 18, 2025.

Jelly Roll and fellow country star Luke Bryan appeared on the talk show together, promoting season 23 of “American Idol,” where Bryan is in his eighth season as a judge and Jelly Roll is serving as the show's first-ever “artist-in-residence,” mentoring contestants throughout the season. 

Hudson selected a random question from a batch sitting on her set's coffee table, asking the duo to name “the most embarrassing thing that's happened to you while performing,” Jelly Roll immediately blurted out, “I pooped myself one time” — and it was clear the “Amen” singer immediately regretted his answer. 

Hudson and Bryan could not hide their shock over Jelly Roll's answer, their mouths both agape as the audience gasped. They then crumpled into laughter as Jelly Roll apologized. 

“I'm sorry,” he laughed. “Listen, it was what they call a shart. I didn't know! I was confident it was all air, it was not. I watched this crowd go from loving me to just being completely out!”   

“That's why we love him, right there,” Bryan said, putting his arm around Jelly Roll. 

“I overshared again,” Jelly Roll laughed, covering his face in his hands. 

Bryan then quipped, “My problem is I didn't really get embarrassed about it when I did it!” 

As Hudson tried to move on, Jelly Roll asked her, “Are you saying you've never pooped yourself?” 

“Noooo, noooo! Oh my god, this is hilarious,” she replied, clearly flustered as she searched for another question to ask. 

After Hudson found a new question, she asked, “Okay, y'all ready for the next one?” and Jelly Roll hilariously quipped, “No!” 

Reading the question, Hudson noted that both men are married and asked what about them drives their wives “absolutely crazy.” Bryan has been married to his college sweetheart, Caroline Boyer Bryan, for nearly 19 years, while Jelly Roll has been married to Alyssa DeFord, known as BunnieXO, since 2016. 

At first, Bryan said that his snoring drives his wife crazy. But he later changed his answer to a habit in the kitchen that he said always sends Caroline reeling. 

“I gotta go with the simplest thing,” he told Hudson. “If I put the creamer in my coffee, stir the spoon and put the spoon down on the countertop … without a proper paper towel to absorb? It's worst than snoring, now that I think about it 'cause you can cure the snoring with a CPAP machine.” 

“Or less alcohol, but I'm not here to judge,” Jelly Roll laughed. 

The “Hard Fought Hallelujah” singer revealed that the thing he does that drives BunnieXO nuts is a habit he's trying to break. 

“I leave a trail of clothes from the front door to the shower,” he admitted as he looked at the audience. “Everybody's like, ‘We hate you!' I just heard women shaking their fists at me up there! I know! And I've been trying to break this habit, y'all, but it annoys her to no end.”

Check local listings for the April 18 airing of “The Jennifer Hudson Show.” Meanwhile, “American Idol” airs a three-hour “Songs of Faith” episode on April 20, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Things are looking up for longtime HGTV star Page Turner, who will take over for Hilary Farr on the new season of “Love It Or List It,” premiering on April 21, 2025. 

In addition to her new role on the iconic show, Page revealed during her April 15 appearance on “The Jennifer Hudson Show” that she also has a “new man.” Fans were thrilled to get a romance update from the designer, who co-starred with her ex on “Flip or Flop Nashville” for two seasons before hosting “Fix My Flip.” 

A post shared by The Jennifer Hudson Show (@jenniferhudsonshow)

Turner's admission about being in a new relationship came as Hudson teased her about getting to meet  hunky actor Aaron Pierre, who had the starring role in Disney's 2024 live action “Mufasa: The Lion King.”

As Turner demonstrated some DIY spring crafts on the talk show, Hudson said, “Did you show this to Aaron Pierre? Because I heard you met him at the Black American Film Festival?”  

“Who's that, Mufasa?” Turner teased as members of the audience squealed with delight. 

“Yes, Mufasa!” Hudson replied, and she and Turner danced in unison for a moment. 

“Oh sorry, I lost myself,” Turner joked. “Um, I didn't know whether to call him Aaron or Mufasa, to tell you the truth. And he's so tall. I had a whole hot flash.” 

Laughing, Hudson walked away and Turner said, “Wait, Jennifer! Don't leave! Ok, I'm having a hot flash again.” 

She then turned to the audience and exclaimed, “I have a man now, so I shouldn't have told all of my inside secrets. I have a man now!” 

Nevertheless, she whipped the crowd into a frenzy when she told Hudson that when she met Pierre, her girlfriend asked him whether he watched Turner's show on HGTV, and he responded, “No, but I will now!” 

A post shared by Page Turner (@pageturnerunlimited)

When Hudson's show posted a social media clip of her and Turner's funny moment of swooning over Pierre, fans and friends flooded the post with comments, thrilled to hear that the interior designer is in love. 

One person exclaimed, “Page got a man !!!!!!! 😂🥰❤️” and Turner replied, “Tell 'em bestie, I tried to 😂”

Another quipped, “Ok man now 😍 Mufasa is missing out!”

Someone else demanded, “Who is this man??? That's what I want to know! 🔥❤️”

Although Turner did not identify her new man on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” she gave her followers a glimpse of what one called his “anonymous shoulder” when she posted a video from a day on the beach in late March. 

Turner tagged FOX Sports and ESPN commentator Mike Hill as the person who photographed her playing in the ocean and wrote, “This joy. This peace. This love…. The world didn't give it to me .. and FOR SURE can't take it away!”

Turner and Hill have exchanged sweet notes with each other in their social media comments since then, including on April 3, when he posted a photo of himself by the beach. 

In the comments, she wrote, “Sooooo Blessed AND Highly Favored!! 🔥🔥🔥” and Hill replied, “so thankful for those blessings!! Especially the ones I've received over the last month or so!! ❤️😍🙏🏾”

In 2018 and 2019, Turner co-starred with her ex, former NFL player DeRon Jenkins, on “Flip or Flop Nashville,” a spinoff of HGTV's popular “Flip or Flop” series. Before the show's premiere, Turner told Us Weekly that they'd been together “for a long time” but found they worked better together as business partners rather than romantic partners. 

Turner has three daughters from a previous relationship, per Closer Weekly — Zaire, Qai, and Quincy. Hill, meanwhile, has two daughters from a previous marriage, per Page Six. He was married from 2020 to 2022 to “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Cynthia Bailey, the outlet reported.

Artificial or not, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has some ideas on how artificial intelligence could make films “better.” During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Sarandos said (via Deadline) that AI could help films be “10 percent better,” not just “50 percent cheaper.” Sarandos cited James Cameron‘s recent comments about how the technology could cut production costs in half.

“There's a ton of excitement about what AI can do for content creators,” Sarandos said. “I read the article too about what Jim Cameron said about making movies 50 percent cheaper. I remain convinced that there's an even bigger opportunity to make movies 10 percent better. So, our talent today is using AI tools to do set references, pre-vis, VFX sequence prep, shot planning, all kinds of things today that kind of make the process better.”

He added, “Traditionally, only big-budget projects would have access to things like advanced visual effects such as de-aging. Today, you can use these AI-powered tools to enable smaller-budget projects to have access to big VFX onscreen.” 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Sarandos pointed to Martin Scorsese's 2019 film “The Irishman” as an example of what AI could achieve. The film used VFX de-aging effects for its central characters, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, across decades. Sarandos explained that if the feature was made today, AI could have enhanced (and eased) the process for a fraction of the budget, and have had an “improved” result onscreen. 

“If you remember that movie, we were using very cutting-edge, very expensive de-aging technology that still had massive limitations, still created a bunch of complexity on set for the actors,” Sarandos said. “It was a giant leap forward for sure, but nowhere near what we needed for that film.”

“The Irishman” cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto later made his directorial debut with “Pedro Páramo,” which used “AI-powered tools” to de-age its stars. According to Sarandos, the effects cost a “fraction” of the tech for “The Irishman.” 

“In fact, the entire budget of the film was about what the VFX cost on ‘The Irishman,'” he said. “So, same creator using new tools, better tools, to do what was impossible five years ago — that's incredibly exciting. So, our focus is simple: Find ways for AI to improve the member and the creator experience.”

 










“Avatar” director James Cameron previously said during the “Boz to the Future” podcast that AI will be key to minimizing costs for films, and also make for shorter development time. “If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I've always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see — ‘Dune,' ‘Dune: Part Two,' or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films — we've got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half,” Cameron said.

He added, “Now that's not about laying off half the staff and at the effects company. That's about doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things, right? That's my sort of vision for that.”

What would it take to make you return to the one place you never wanted to go back to? To embrace the thing that everyone thinks they know about you? For Beirut's Zach Condon it took a circus—specifically, the Swedish troupe Kompani Giraff, which commissioned the 18 tracks on A Study of Losses for a stage show of the same name. On the company's website, you can see footage of acrobats tumbling, soaring, and gyrating to the harried croon of “Caspian Tiger,” the first single from Beirut's seventh album.

If you read that and cringed, you're not alone. Condon has said that when he was first approached about writing a soundtrack for a circus, “a certain amount of “Elephant Gun”-era trauma initially came rushing up,” a reminder of a time when he had been pigeonholed, he says, “as a whimsical circus waif,” accompanied by “sepia-toned images of penny farthings and perhaps lion tamers with handlebar moustaches.” But after seeing videos of Kompani Giraff's work and reading an abstract of German writer Judith Schalansky's Verzeichnis einiger Verluste, a novel steeped loss and impermanence on which Giraff's new project would be based, Condon changed his mind and composed the 11 songs and seven extended instrumental themes that make up A Study of Losses.

Something about writing in such atypical circumstances appears to have flipped a switch in Condon. About a third of the record does sound a lot like Gulag Orkestar. “Villa Sacchetti,” with its rousing brass, waltzing rhythms, and plucked strings, is pure early Beirut, as is “The Moonwalker,” all massed voices, accordion, and the lingering shade of ukulele. Elsewhere, though, Condon has hit on a new, Tangerine Dream-ish direction. “Ghost Train” ambles along over surging electronic pulses, like the German's synth pioneers' classic arpeggiated drift or perhaps even Barker's recent work. “Guericke's Unicorn,” meanwhile, sounds like an '80s synth-pop hit that's been overexposed to sunlight. Condon has worked with synths before, notably on 2019's Gallipoli, but they have never quite been this prominent, golden electronic lines unfurling over his songs in sunny coils.

Beirut's charm—or perhaps curse—is that Condon's baritone voice and gliding vocal melodies are so distinctive that even on 2023's Hadsel, an album that leaned heavily on church organ, recorded on a remote Norwegian island, Beirut still sounded a lot like Beirut. But this is no bad thing when Condon is in such rich songwriting form. It may be that Verzeichnis einiger Verluste's themes particularly resonated or, as Condon says, that he was inspired by the circus as a piece of art that transcends live music or theatre. But A Study of Losses has some of Condon's most effortless songwriting in years, melodies flowing with the easy appeal of the best of Lon Gisland and Gulag Orkestar. “Villa Sacchetti” and “Tuanaki Atoll” don't sound like the leftover scraps of Beirut's debut album, they sound like prime cuts, while “Guericke's Unicorn” is bittersweet yet rousing and addictive.

“Mare Nectaris,” the album's penultimate song, initially sounds like a low-key electronic ramble. Then Condon's voice comes in, repeating the phrase, “You can't be above all this,” as the music throbs below him. Is it a message to Kompani Giraff's high-flying acrobats? To Beirut's fan base? Or to Condon himself, a reminder to relax and let the ideas flow, no matter what other people might think? Whatever the case, it's good advice: A Study of Losses is an example of the peculiar magic that can happen under seemingly absurd circumstances.

On Send a Prayer My Way, Julien Baker and Mackenzie Scott, who performs as Torres, are falling off the wagon and staring at its wheels; they're reckoning with regret; they're wrestling hateful mothers. Longtime listeners of the two artists know that they often lay their struggles at the forefront of their music, from prying at religion to coming to terms with queerness to looking up from a bottle's bottom.

But here, they come at these themes from a new angle. About five years ago, Scott floated the concept of a country record to Baker, a la Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings—and was surprised when she said yes. “I was worried that Julien would say no, and I cannot stand rejection,” Scott told Garden & Gun. “So I framed it as, ‘Wouldn't that be hilarious if we made a country record?' And Julien was like, ‘Oh, hell yeah, I'm gonna send you some demos.'”

Country music played a formative role in both singers' lives: Scott grew up in Georgia, surrounded by church music and '90s country; Baker grew up in Tennessee on a steady diet of Merle Haggard and George Jones. (You can check out the duo's “Cuntry” playlists to see some lasting favorites.) But for the length of their respective careers, they've stuck to the rock/indie nexus.

Send a Prayer My Way, the result of their country collaboration, is an examination of religion, drugs, and love set in working-class Southern neighborhoods—both a tribute to their upbringings and an effort to reimagine the genre. At times, the blend of their individual rock styles with country creates something fresh, but some efforts feel more pastiche than inventive.

The album's obsessed with love, in every iteration—and how much you can make peace with it. Scott opens “Tuesday,” a slow-moving and tender paean to the titular woman, with adoration. But as the song reveals itself to be about queer desire, it also reveals the challenges its narrator faces: the hateful response from her crush's mother and the mournful self-excoriation that results, all grounded by Baker's accompaniment on a resonant dobro. “Sugar in the Tank,” meanwhile, is nothing if not self-assured. As Baker repeats “I love you” at the start of each line, underscored by banjo and a Hammond organ, the song ramps up in passion, insistent and rollicking. When it breaks into the chorus, the pair's voices come together, their twangy vocals layering in an earnest and honest country-pop element with tongue-in-cheek sultriness (“Put a little sugar in the tank,” a nod to queerness too) that cools down cleanly on “I'll love you all the way.” They thread classic imagery beside the love declarations: They're “tied up on the train tracks,” “strung out on the drying rack,” and “sitting outside with the engine runnin'.”

“Sylvia,"" about Scott's beloved dog, is a portrait of stable, enduring love that's honest, open, and all-encompassing (“A day for me is a week for you/And my life's already halfway through”), buoyed in warm, adoring harmonies. On “No Desert Flower,” a slow-moving, folksy promise to weather hardships, a more tremulous version of Scott's voice (often husky on this record) stretches over a soft-strummed, hollow-drummed production.

Certain tracks hark back to the darker hallmarks of Scott and Baker's songwriting. On opener “Dirt,” Baker is raw in the face of depression and substance abuse; she wryly repeats, “Spend your whole life getting clean/Just to wind up in the dirt.” With its spare, fingerpicked opening that slowly layers in violin and piano and her gentle remarks about observing an unbreakable pattern, it feels like a classic Baker song—the pedal steel representing the only outlier from her usual work.

Despite moments of darkness, Baker and Scott also mix in humor—another country staple—to mixed effect. While the honky-tonk “The Only Marble I've Got Left” winks hard at listeners, making “losing your marbles” sound cute and hokey, “Tuesday”—a more serious track, with its discussion of religion-borne homophobia—ends with the music cutting out as Scott sings, “Tell your mama she can go suck an egg.” It's a jarring admonishment that hangs haphazardly over the song's end. After a serious, introspective rumination, she spits out an unserious, childlike insult—it's not funny so much as awkward. The same goes for the spoken introduction to closing track “Goodbye Baby,” in which Scott tells Baker a lewd joke (with a censored punchline). It feels like a classic setup: studio banter caught on the record by accident. It's silly, and fine—except it's utterly disconnected from the song itself.

Baker and Scott wanted to honor the genre that was entwined with their upbringing, but since that's not quite the music they've spent their careers perfecting, the shoehorned-in motifs—like spoken-word-as-comedy—can come across less authentic. Maybe Baker and Scott will, inspired by this experience, incorporate more elements of country music into their songwriting going forward. Or maybe making this album will be a flash in the pan for them both, like a Stetson you try on that ultimately doesn't fit. Still, their reimagination of the genre incorporates queerness in a way that traditional country music often bucks against—which makes it, warts and all, an important entry in the style's expansion.

Joe Seiders, who played drums and keyboards in the New Pornographers, has been arrested for possession of child pornography, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. According to online records, Seiders was arrested on April 9 and remains in jail with his bail set at $1 million.

In a statement shared with Pitchfork, a spokesperson for the New Pornographers said: “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified, and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders—and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.”

According to the news release and online records, police officers responded to “a suspicious circumstance” at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Palm Desert, California, on Monday, April 7. An 11-year-old boy told the officers that “an unknown male adult recorded him on a cell phone while he was using the restroom at the location.”

Two days later, police responded to an incident at the same restaurant, where an employee said that “a male was entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males at the business.” The man was identified as Seiders, and he was apprehended by police and taken into custody.

Following Seiders' arrest, officials searched his residence, vehicle, and cell phone and found evidence implicating him in the two Chick-fil-A incidents and additional crimes, according to the news release.

In addition to the felony charge of possession of child pornography, Seiders was booked on misdemeanors charges of annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy. Records show that he has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is due in court on Tuesday, April 22.

Joe Seiders joined the New Pornographers after the release of their 2014 album Brill Bruisers, replacing longtime drummer Kurt Dahle. He played on 2017's Whiteout Conditions, 2019's In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, 2023's Continue as a Guest, and the recent single “Ballad of the Last Payphone,” and he toured with the band consistently until his dismissal.

Lana Del Rey has shared “Bluebird,” the likely second single from her long-promised new album. The fingerpicked ballad follows last week's “Henry, Come On,” the first clear signal that the follow-up to Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd might be imminent. Del Rey co-wrote “Bluebird” with Luke Laird, and she co-produced it with Laird and multi-instrumentalist Drew Erickson. Listen to the new song below.

The status of Lana Del Rey's next album, once known as Lasso, remains unclear. She had said, at one point, that it was called The Right Person Will Stay and that it would come out on May 21. In a since-deleted video, however, she said the title has changed again and that “it's not gonna come on time.”

Next week, Del Rey will play play the country music festival Stagecoach. She headlined Coachella in 2024.

7.6

Genre:

Every field recording is a virtual reality. Joshua Bonnetta understands that precept: The Canadian artist eschews “authentic” reproductions of any space, openly embracing subjectivity. “I abstract the sounds,” Bonnetta has said of his 2016 album Lago, “so that they would align more with my experience and the feeling of what I got from that place.” A personal perspective comes to the fore in his experimental documentaries, too. El Mar La Mar, his 2017 collaboration with director J.P. Sniadecki, placed oral histories alongside audio of the Sonoran desert, painting the U.S.-Mexico border as a landscape of trauma and bureaucratic racism. In 2020's The Two Sights, he portrayed the epistemological reality of clairvoyant townspeople in the Outer Hebrides by eschewing diegetic sound. More than most field recordists, Bonnetta finds truth in the edit.

The impossibility of objectivity is a central idea in The Pines, Bonnetta's monumental four-disc, four-hour album. Its premise sounds like a lark: Over a year, he recorded 8,760 hours of material from a single pine tree in upstate New York. Utilizing a passive monitoring device primarily meant for conservation research, he left the recorder alone for prolonged stretches of time, visiting periodically only to change the batteries and storage cards. After poring over his material, he spent three years constructing pieces that represent each season. The listening experience is dense but easy, obvious yet shrouded in mystique.

It can be daunting to press play on an album so large in scope, but the tracks flow smoothly and capture an incredibly active locale rife with varied textures. The beginning of “Spring” features the magnified sounds of something creaking—a result of the microphone's uncommon vantage—and it feels uncanny the way it recalls the noise of a slowly opening door. This teasing unknowability lurks amid the more standard sounds of birds, animals, and water. There's a low rumbling sound that I can only describe as a quickly dribbled basketball, and its repeated presence throughout the hour-long track is confounding. When a cloud of muted uproar arrives 42 minutes in, it's more than likely a multitude of animals making communal noise, but it also feels like the distant sound of a cheering crowd. Such ambiguity makes The Pines a constant thrill.

It is difficult to tell if Bonnetta simply stitched together waveforms in a linear fashion, or layered multiple noises from different moments. Sometimes we hear the lovely sound of a black-capped chickadee, its buoying melodic phrase puncturing the noise of other birdsong. It's akin to a riveting ensemble piece, but the richness of sound and species feels almost too dense—it could very well be a collage of pre-recorded sound, or a testament to how removed humans are from nature. Our invasiveness also comes to mind when we hear a noisy vehicle pierce the early minutes of “Summer”; very few birds can be heard at all. When rain pours down at the end of the track, animals falling silent as they take cover or scurry away from the soundfield, it is tempting to see humanity's impact as similarly transformative.

Despite Bonnetta's absence, these recordings raise certain assumptions about the sounds we associate with humans. Something is heard moving 32 minutes into “Autumn,” and it sounds slow enough that it could be a human walking. I found myself wondering if it was an animal and instinctively decided it wasn't, thinking an animal would sound somehow more other. There are also moments when it sounds like the recording device is being handled—is Bonnetta grabbing it, or is a bird interacting with this alien object near its home? In many field recordings, the author's existence reveals itself through the sounds of a hand grazing the recorder, but on The Pines, these muffled sounds are indistinguishable from any other animal touching it, too.

Ultimately, Bonnetta's fingerprints are all over The Pines. Sometimes they're obvious, like in the placement of a short, monotonous tone at the beginning of each track, which acts as a palette cleanser. Sometimes they're structural: “Autumn” ends with the sound of fighting animals, creating a loose narrative arc with a harrowing climax. His field recordings feel three-dimensional, exaggerating what our ears can regularly hear. His pieces aren't as hyperreal as Toshiya Tsunoda's works or as directly interwoven with people's histories as Annea Lockwood's sound maps, but they hover somewhere in between, reminding us what we project onto the sounds. “Winter” is a largely empty soundscape of wind, cracking ice, and falling snow. I think it feels empty but meditative—but that's because winters have always felt like that for me. Bonnetta encourages such inquiry and reflection, leaving the field open to interpretation.

J
enni Rose already cried once this morning. Before the sun goes down, she says, she'll cry again.


	The tears are of both elation and relief for Rose, who came out to her family as a trans woman in the summer of 2024. Later that year, she came out to Vandoliers — the Texas country-punk band Rose fronts after co-founding the group in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs in 2015.


	To be a trans person anywhere in the United States at this moment, when a new presidential administration is openly working to erase transgender people from existence, is dangerous. To be a trans person in Texas is especially fraught. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, there are currently 127 anti-trans bills in the Texas Legislature, and in February, the state's governor, Greg Abbott, proclaimed in his State of the State Address, “The state of Texas recognizes only two genders — male and female.”


	The timing makes Rose's decision to publicly transition especially courageous, and underscores a tradition of radical defiance and protest for punk musicians. But Vandoliers aren't only a punk band, and their ascending role in the masculine Texas-country and Red Dirt scenes will surely garner even more attention now. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Rose and her bandmates are ready.


	“I've always been very arm's length with people because of this,” says Rose. “I didn't want anybody to ever find out about it. For 36 years, I've tried to be anything but a trans person, and it never went away. And, now, it's going crazy, and I know that there are all these people who are kind of going back in the closet. But I'm going to come out and see what happens.”


	We're at a table in Rose's home near Dallas, joined by Vandoliers' trumpet and keys player, Cory Graves. Rose says she cried this morning in anticipation of what the day holds — a Rolling Stone interview and photo shoot for which a stylist has her in makeup, her hair styled, and dressed in a black denim front-slit skirt and black button-down with a single rose stitched at the top. The outfit is important, because after a lifetime of avoiding female attire, Rose is coming out to the world in clothing that makes her comfortable. If she's not outright happy, she's something very close to it.

	“It's been great,” Rose says. “Jenni has way more friends. I never had friends. You can ask Cory how many times I said I don't have any friends outside the band. Now, I have a lot.”

	











	Rose admits she's taken her time coming out, fearing the worst with nearly every person she has told — from family members to the Vandoliers' booking agent and brand-new label, the upstart Break Maiden Records. But she's been delighted to have been wrong nearly every time. There was one religious family member who disapproved, she recalls, but otherwise, she's been met with joy and support.


	Now, however, Rose is telling everybody who doesn't know her truth all at once. Vandoliers will release their fifth studio album, Life Behind Bars, on June 27, with the first single and title track — laced with Rose's journey through both addiction and gender dysphoria — dropping this morning.


	“I finally opened up, and I allowed myself to have friends,” Rose says. “I allowed myself to take care of myself, and I allowed myself to just be me, regardless of what people are going to say or do. It has taught me to stick up for myself. Once you get discipline and boundaries, all the people-pleasing stuff really falls off. That's when I gave myself permission to be who I am, and to be Jenni.”

	Rose's name is a callback to a band she fronted in high school called Jennifer. Her first musical love was punk, which she attributes to attending a Blink-182 concert in 1999 with her father and sister. She started her first band at age 12, and was drawn to the punk scene in Dallas's Deep Ellum before she was old enough to get into bars. Her first big break came in a ska band. In her 20s, she met drummer Trey Alfaro, and the two formed a “dirty rock” band called the Phuss. Then, in 2015, Rose and Alfaro founded Vandoliers.


	Today, Vandoliers are a six-piece: Rose, Graves, and Alfaro, plus bassist Mark Moncrieff, fiddler Travis Curry, and electric guitarist Dustin Fleming. Their music is a mix of country and punk — echoing the “cowpunk” style of Social Distortion or Old 97's. Rose considers Old 97's frontman Rhett Miller a mentor, and Vandoliers have opened several shows for Miller's band. They also opened for Turnpike Troubadours' 2022 comeback shows at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and later that year for Turnpike at the Ryman Auditorium. Since then, they have toured extensively as support for both Flogging Molly and Bowling for Soup.


	Despite country phrasing and a fiddle in the band, Vandoliers' live show leans heavily punk. Their songs are fast, and Rose — with guitar in hand — whirls around the stage in a blur of energy. By the end of the set, the band members are plenty sweaty, which Alfaro, Curry, and Graves address by doffing their shirts.

	











	Rose's shirt, however, stays on.


	“If you've ever been to a Vandoliers show, you know that there are band members that take off their shirts, and there are band members that don't,” Rose says. “The reason I don't is that I feel like I'm topless up there.”


	That feeling chased Rose throughout her life, starting when her hometown of Keller, Texas, was still a rural dot and continuing as the sprawl of Dallas-Fort Worth surrounded her as a teen.


	“When I was four, I didn't want to be a boy,” Rose tells Rolling Stone. “But it was weird. I was stopped. I was told it was bad, because that's what normal people would do: ‘Stop wearing dresses. Boys don't play with dolls.'”


	Hearing that instilled shame and fear in Rose. She avoided sports, especially locker rooms, and grew up self-conscious about her own body, even when onstage with her band.


	But in March 2023, something changed when a night of activism for Vandoliers turned into a moment of clarity for Rose.


	The band was scheduled to perform at the Shed, a barbecue-and-motorcycle joint in Maryville, Tennessee, not far from Knoxville. Days earlier, Tennessee's governor, Bill Lee, signed a bill restricting public drag performances in the state. In protest, the six members of Vandoliers bought dresses and performed the concert in drag.


	“I had worn a dress before, but it was in the dark, in private, or I was super ashamed of it,” Rose says. “Cory says, ‘We should wear a dress and protest this.' And I'm going, ‘That's a great idea!' Then, we went and bought dresses, and I was super happy about it. I got to try on a dress with my friends. Everybody was over there, like, giggling and having a good time, and I was kind of alone. I put it on, and I felt really good. Just, Oh, I look nice! And I walked out onstage and played a great show. When It was over, I thought, ‘I was really brave today.'


	“And then, it went fucking viral.”


	In an Instagram post that began with “Fuck a drag bill,” the band announced that it would auction off the dresses and donate the proceeds to LGBTQ+ charities in Tennessee. Regional news sites picked it up, but so did worldwide outlets like Yahoo! News. The sudden attention forced Rose to reckon with herself.


	“The entire world got to see me in a dress the first time I wore one outside of a locked door,” she says. “My shell shattered.”

	











	The whirlwind of press interviews that followed caught her off-guard. “I got really, really scared,” Rose says. “People kept asking me, ‘Is there anybody queer or trans in your band?' And I'd go, ‘No! We're just a bunch of hairy dudes!' But that wasn't really true.”


	In the summer of 2022 — the same year she got sober — she started keeping a journal during a European tour. “One day, maybe a week after the dress thing happened,” she says, “I wrote, ‘Fuck. I think I'm trans.' I closed the book and didn't make another journal entry for, like, two months, and when I did, my next entries were just what I was doing that day: ‘I'm in San Antonio today! Had tacos! They were good!'”


	Vandoliers had previously listened to Laura Jane Grace's book Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout in their van while touring, but in the months that followed that journal revelation, Rose reread it.


	“There was so much familiarity,” Rose recalls. “When I finished it, I realized, ‘Oh, shit. I think I have gender dysphoria.'”


	Even a year earlier, Rose believes she would have tried to repress those feelings with alcohol or cigarettes. But with neither a viable option, she sought therapy. Her first sessions were unproductive (”the wrong therapist,” she says now) and often involved her blaming the road for the personal sadness she felt, despite having a stable, loving family at home. She's married — to a woman — and the couple has a young daughter.


	Rose returned to therapy and this time chose a gender therapist named Renee: “Within two sessions, she goes, ‘You are very trans.'”


	As Rose processed it all, she began wearing shirts onstage that read “Protect trans kids.” The message was heartfelt, but it was also a trial balloon for her own journey. “Protect trans kids, but also protect me too,” she deadpans.


	Then, in early 2024, Vandoliers began recording a new album with producer Ted Hutt (Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly) at the famed Sonic Ranch studio outside of El Paso. Rose offered roughly 40 songs for the project, but when Hutt heard them, he found them shallow. He challenged Rose to dig deeper in her lyrics and make the songs more personal. Rose did, and that process became her final sign. She decided to come out.


	“That's when I knew that this wasn't going to go away,” she says. “Ted is making me go deeper and deeper, lyrically, and it hits gender dysphoria. Some of the things I put in were just, like, feelings. But some of them were pretty blatant.”

	











	Rose came out to Alfaro in the summer of 2024 while Vandoliers were on an extended West Coast run. She came out to the rest of the group on Nov. 4, days before the U.S. presidential election. Vandoliers were on tour, opening for Lucero. Rose gathered the members together in their van and told them she was a trans woman. She recalls Graves realizing what she was saying before she could finish telling the group, and seeing a look of giddy anticipation cross his face.


	“It's exciting,” Graves tells Rolling Stone. “It feels punk rock as fuck to be in the trans space but in a country band.”


	Graves says the days following the election of President Donald Trump, on the heels of Rose coming out, left him feeling uncertain about how to navigate the near-term future. But, one night, he went out and met a Vandoliers fan who brought up the dress protest, calling it inspiring.


	“I went, ‘Holy crap, maybe I don't have to save the whole fucking country,'” Graves says. “If I can narrow my lane to advocate for this one thing, I can have, like, a reason to exist for the next four years.”


	He sees that reason reflected in Rose.


	“After you told us,” Graves says to Rose, “you became, like, yourself again, but in this different person. You were wanting to hang out with the group all the time, you were gabbing away.


	“One of the things you said was, ‘I felt like I was going to come out and lose all my friends.' But I felt like you came out and we got a friend back that we didn't have before.”

	Vandoliers' next concert is April 26 in Forney, Texas. On May 16, they'll open for the Toadies at Skydeck on Broadway in Nashville, followed a day later with a spot on the bill at the Dusty Trails Country Festival in Kansas City. And this summer, the band will embark on a coast-to-coast run of more than 30 headlining shows, starting June 21 at Globe Hall in Denver. They're calling it the Life Behind Bars tour.


	Rose acknowledges she's slightly on edge over the possibility of frightened or close-minded promoters canceling shows. But any anxiety is outdone by the anticipation of simply getting to be Jenni Rose behind the mic, with the spotlight fully on her. “I'm going to try to stay in the moment,” Rose says. “In the last few years, I have always thought about this light emitting from my chest. I've been behind a mask, and I could still feel that light, and I could still share it with people, but now it is going to be, like, really fucking bright.”

	When five million demonstrators flooded the streets for the national “Hands Off” protests on April 5 — demonstrating against the unconstitutional actions and authoritarian aims of the Trump administration — a large fraction were mobilized by a leaderless grassroots collective that didn't even exist at the start of 2025.


	It's hard to speak of 50501 — pronounced: fifty, fifty, one — like a normal activist organization. That's because it's more like a meme that morphed into a movement. And while 50501 may be the upstart on the block, its first steps resemble those of a juggernaut.


	The coming out party for 50501 was a national anti-Trump rally on Feb. 5. The organizing concept for the protest popped up on Reddit in late January — as a call for 50 protests, in 50 states, on 1 day. It was introduced by an anonymous Reddior with the handle Evolved_Fungi, who posted that 50501 was intended as a “simple, self-replicating instruction set” and “something hashtaggable” that “organizes everyone regardless of their state and their location.” 

	











This viral organizing concept took off amid public revulsion against Trump and his billionaire DOGE hatchetman Elon Musk, as well as frustration at the feckless opposition of Democratic politicians. Under the 50501 banner, groups of activists self-organized demonstrations at state capitol buildings, and in big cities, across the country. As the founding Redditor reflected, “The idea of 50501 simply gave people permission to empower themselves at a time when everyone seemed to be struggling and asking, ‘What can we do?'” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But these protests — collectively dubbed the “Decentralized Self-Organizing Community Action Event” — turned out to be more than a one-off. The activists who mobilized for Feb. 2 quickly found a groove, and returned to the streets two weeks later with an even more-vigorous “No Kings” protest on President's Day. By early April, 50501 activists had become a driving force behind the national “Hands Off” protests, in coalition with established activist groups like the ACLU, Indivisible, MoveOn, Color of Change, and the Women's March. (Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin touted 50501 to Rolling Stone as a “very legitimate, organic, grassroots group of folks” with remarkable “energy.”)

	The snowball is still rolling. 50501 is organizing a new “National Day of Action,” combining protest and community building, this Saturday, April 19. 


	The originator of 50501 remains a cipher. Evolved_Fungi did not respond to an interview request and remains anonymous. But in other Reddit posts he's described himself as an engineer by day who also has a degree in marketing, and a fascination with virality. Calling himself “just a normal guy” who is “a little bit autistic,” the Redditor writes that he'd been kicking around the 50501 concept for about a decade (originally, when trying to build momentum around a far more niche cause, opposing infant-circumcision).


	Evolved_Fungi writes that he loves the “hive” intelligence of bees, as well as the ways mushrooms can spread effortlessly via spores, but remain connected through a “mycelial network” (think a root system, but for fungus). “50501 is an IDEA that spreads much like mushrooms,” he's written. “The IDEA can spread by telling friends about the IDEA. The IDEA can spread completely independent of any other person or group!” 


	As 50501 has flourished, Evolved_Fungi has eschewed any formal role. “I don't want to be the leader…. I stepped back and I've done very little to direct people. Intentionally,” he posted. “So the people could do it.” 


	With that spirit of self-empowerment, 50501 has evolved into a loosely organized coalition, with multiple grassroots groups and independent activists leaders operating under the same 50501 brand. There is no formal 50501 group,no 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 organization with board members or the ability to accept donations. Instead, several existing activist groups have stepped up to play support roles for grassroots activists, whether it's Political Revolution, which hosts an event finder for 50501 protests, or other nonprofits that offer activist training.

Rolling Stone spoke with two representatives of 50501: Sarah Parker a 32-year-old Black organizer who is executive director of Voices of Florida, a reproductive rights group, and now mentors new 50501 activists; and Hunter Dunn, a 22-year-old, soon-to-be political science graduate at Pepperdine University, who is acting as 50501's “national media liaison.” 


	Parker says her group got involved during the build-up to the original Feb. 5 action by providing guidance to a flood of young activists leading their first protests, including strategies for conflict de-escalation. “We're building the airplane while flying it,” she says. “It's amazing to see new people building this amazing infrastructure. It's bottom up, not top down.”

	











	There's no barrier to entry for 50501. The network is not based on formal enrollment, rather mutual recognition, and shared principles, says Dunn. “If you're pro-democracy, if you're in favor of preserving the Constitution, if you're against executive overreach, and you're nonviolent — you're 50501, if you say you are. Congratulations, you just got yourself involved.”


	Dunn describes the many “hubs” or “nodes” of local 50501 activists as being informally united. “Federated might be a good term,” he says, invoking a concept from decentralized social media platforms, where communication flows freely thanks to shared protocols, but no single entity is in charge. The people involved at the national level, Dunn says, think of themselves like a pantry, offering resources to support and sustain the local chapters.


	“I've been a part of multiple movements — Black Lives Matter and Occupy,” Parker says. “This is the first time I've seen what I'd call a living ecosystem. There are no leaders. We have different working groups. People are owning their lane, owning their state, and owning their city.”


	50501 is still rooted on Reddit, where its subreddit r/50501 now counts nearly 280,000 members. But the reach is amplified via Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and even NextDoor, a site more notable for neighborhood snitching than community organizing. “People are seeing what's happening to their country, and they want to take a stand too. We welcome them, even if they're on NextDoor,” laughs Dunn. 


	50501 activists communicate and coordinate through channels on the Discord platform, which are grouped by state and city, as well as group chats on the encrypted communication app Signal. Grassroots activism can be messy and fractious. Rolling Stone observed that much of the chatter on the Portland, Oregon, Discord channel was about the acrimonious departure of a splinter group. 


	But the threat posed by this authoritarian administration is a greater unifying force. “We're seeing Trump literally rip apart our Constitution with a stroke of his executive orders,” Parker says. 50501 represents “pushback against executive overreach” as well as “pushback against Project 2025.” This defense of democracy is resonating far outside of big cities and reaching into rural towns. “There were multiple locations in Wyoming where hundreds of people gathered on 4/5,” says Dunn referring to the “Hands Off”protests. “We're reaching every state in the country. Even in deeply red areas, there are nodes.”

	











	The upcoming “Day of Action,” April 19, is billed as a community-building opportunity as well as a protest. This is a reflection, Parker says, that past movements like Occupy fizzled out because they failed to organize for sustained action. “There was no interconnectedness. It was just protest, protest, protest, sleep outside,” she recalls. “They weren't involved in their community.” 


	By contrast, Parker says of 50501, “we're putting roots down immediately.” She insists: “This is a marathon. Not only do we have four more years [of Trump], but hopefully the movement will be around for 8 or 10 or 12 years, as we continue to push forward for more equal, equitable America. That's why 4/19 is happening — in order for us to reserve the energy and continue to push forward.”

	People who want to launch their own 50501 node don't need permission, Dunn insists. They just need to grab some friends and neighbors and plan an event. “You can either just go for it,” he says, “Or you can let us know beforehand and ask for help to get signal boosted” to bring out other activists in the area. 


	Parker insists this movement's strength is in empowering every individual to keep building. “50501 lives in every one of us. It's in our heart. It's in our energy. It's in the sad moments. It's in the angry moments. We are fighting against fascism,” she says. “We're definitely David to Goliath in this fight, right? But David won.”

	After reviewing the body camera footage from his recent arrest, Haley Joel Osment has apologized for his use of “disgraceful language” — including antisemitic language — when being detained for alleged public intoxication and possession of an unidentified controlled substance at a California ski resort.


	“I'm absolutely horrified by my behavior. Had I known I used this disgraceful language in the throes of a blackout, I would have spoken up sooner,” Osment shared in a statement to the New York Post. “The past few months of loss and displacement have broken me down to a very low emotional place. But that's no excuse for using this disgusting word.”


	In the footage of the arrest, Osment can be heard stating, “I've been kidnapped by a fucking Nazi,” and accusing the police officers of “torturing me.” In one instance, he refers to one officer using a particularly offensive slur against the Jewish community. “From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to absolutely everyone that this hurts,” he continued in his statement. “What came out of my mouth was nonsensical garbage — I've let the Jewish community down and it devastates me.”

	Earlier this year, Osment lost his home in the Eaton wildfire that ravaged neighborhoods in California. His previous run-ins with the law include a 2006 charge for a DUI and marijuana possession after being involved in a car crash. He was sentenced to three years' probation at the time. Years later, in 2018, the actor was involved in a verbal altercation at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Police were called about an “unruly passenger.” When he was arrested this week at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area by the Mammoth Lakes Police Department, he was referred to in the call as an “unruly skier.”


	Concluding his statement, Osment shared: “I don't ask for anyone's forgiveness, but I promise to atone for my terrible mistake.”

	A batch of letters and notes gives a glimpse into the lives of Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa, which have been released as part of the investigation into their tragic deaths earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reports.


	At the time of his death, Hackman had been battling Alzheimer's disease, and Arakawa was his primary caregiver. The notes between them offer not only a window into the relationship of a long-married couple (they wed in 1991), but also gesture towards the challenges of Alzheimer's, both for those living with it and those of their caregivers. 


	Arakawa, for instance, reportedly wrote detailed notes on Hackman's medication and doctor appointments. She also frequently left Hackman notes around the house, telling him where she was or what she was doing (such as taking one of their dogs to an obedience class, or doing yoga).




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The notes from Hackman, meanwhile, show that the actor seemed to retain a sense of humor that was light-hearted and occasionally self-deprecating. Of a doctor's visit, for instance, he told Arakawa — often referred to as “Lovely girl” — he was “off to see the wizard, the wizard of achievement pokie. She stabs me here, she stabs me there, she stabs me almost everywhere. But I'll survive, because after [all] I'm still alive. (But sometimes just barely).” 

	











	In another letter, Hackman even seemed to acknowledge, and make light of, his waning memory. “I'm going down to that building out past the hot water place where you sit and do whatever it is that people are supposed to do in such a building — maybe I'll remember once I get down there,” he wrote. 


	While frequently Hackman signed his letters “Love G,” he signed this one, “Love what's his name.” 


	Still, his notes occasionally hinted at more difficult moments, like when he wished Arakawa a belated happy birthday and wrote her, “Sorry still about the dinner and having to ask for your help, although it was appreciated.”

	Along with the letters, Santa Fe authorities investigating the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa released new photos of the couple's home, police body camera footage, and an environmental assessment. Hackman's estate had previously secured a temporary order to seal any records related to the investigation, but a judge later overturned that ruling on the condition that no photos or videos showed the couple's bodies. 

	











	Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home in February, with a medical examiner ultimately ruling that they died about six days apart. Arakawa likely died on Feb. 11 from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but fatal respiratory disease spread by rodents (the environmental assessment released this week revealed that rodent feces, nests, and dead rodents were found on the couple's property, but not the main home). Hackman died on Feb. 18 from heart disease, with his advanced Alzheimer's also a contributing factor.

	At times of political and cultural upset, literature has often been a way for society to process, understand, and push back against unethical policies or administrations. Many of the most well known books are direct political statements, like Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Octavia Butler's Kindred, and Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. These works easily break down some of the biggest political challenges Americans faced at the time of their publication. Books have power — and sharp authors aren't afraid to wield that. But what's just as important and often ignored is a book's ability to remove the reader from the real world entirely.


	Let's be honest — the nation feels like it's in absolute shambles. Ever since President Donald Trump's inauguration, opening any news app or website has felt like a nonstop barrage of blunt force trauma to the head. Being informed is important, but an oversaturation of constant bad news can make engaging with meaningful, political books difficult to stomach. Luckily, there's genre fiction, which not only holds endless opportunities for entertainment but a perfect distraction during times of disarray. What better way to forget about the political situations you can't change than with books practically steeped in magic, fantasy, love, horror, and mystery? So instead of picking up your phone for yet another doom scroll, here are five options that will get you onto the page and, hopefully, out of reality for a bit.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Vampires! Dark Academia! Secret Society! Kissing! A young Black author's debut! Immortal Dark is like a beacon of distraction practically calling from a bookstore near you. Kidan Adane already has enough problems. She's an orphan, living a life completely estranged from the rich vampire/human society she should rightfully be a part of. But when her sister goes missing, Kade is convinced she knows the exact blood sucker who took her: Susenyos Sagad.

	Finding her sister doesn't just mean setting off on an adventure. It means returning to the world she thought she'd left behind forever. Her mission requires her to infiltrate the secretive and exclusive Uxlay University, in the hopes that time at the vampire school will not only help her find her sister, but give her the perfect opportunity to kill Susenyos. 

	











	For new readers, diving into these kinds of fantasy-driven romances (“romantasy,” if you will) can be a fully engaging process. Knowing what city you're in might require a quick flip to the index. Other times, dense prose or consonant heavy character names require undivided attention to maintain reading momentum. You're not only meeting the new personalities that fiction can bring, but you also have to learn new vocabulary, rules, and a lot of interesting spelling. That'll keep you off your phone for at least two hours. 


	Need something a little lighter? In A Gentleman's Gentleman, TJ Alexander's frothy queer regency romance, Lord Christopher Eden was pretty confident he'd live his entire life free from the gossip, attention, and downright nosiness of British high society. But when he finds out that his inheritance hinges on him marrying, he's forced to head to London for the season. Sure, he's gay and isn't attracted to women. He'll have to do his hardest to fake it. But when he strikes up a deep friendship with his new valet James Harding, Christopher has to contend with his actual desires and the duty that will keep him from ending up on the street. What's better than countless scenes of two people putting on extremely fussy clothing and maybe falling in love? There's just so many buttons!


	Maybe scary times call for an ever scarier read. In Diavola, author Jennifer Marie Thorne takes the quintessential setting of a spooky haunted house and crashes it into the humorous tensions and anxieties of a family vacation. The Pace family are trying to relax in the Tuscan town of Monteperso. Siblings Anna, Benny, and Nicole have separate lives, and even more disparate personalities, which makes it hard for them to connect. Their time at a villa with their parents is supposed to be the answer, but the town is remote. The villagers are cryptic. And the house they're staying in can't protect them from strange sounds at night.

	Horror might seem counterintuitive to forgetting about the actual scary events going on outside your front door. But there are some instances when leaning into the dread of someone's else's bad week can offer a much needed distraction. There's also the personal draw: Not everyone has experienced a haunting, but complicated family dynamics are depicted so often in media that the setting feels both funny and heart racing. Diavola makes you linger in dread, but its international bent is more than enough to keep bad thoughts at bay. 

	











	Kate Fagan's newest work could technically be considered two books in one, since The Three Lives of Cate Kay is centered around a novel within the novel. The book in question is The Very Last, a pop culture success in the fictional world that has spawned on-screen adaptations and turned author Cate Kay into a household name. But Cate Kay doesn't exist. It's a pseudonym, one that has let the author live anonymously while experiencing massive fame and success. But when she finally decides — under slight duress from her agent — that she's ready to reveal herself in the form of a celebrity memoir, Cate has to revisit the story of her life that no one else knows. The Three Lives of Cate Kay gives readers a 360 view of the world Fagan has created, complete with the actress playing the lead role in The Very Last's films, the fans, and the friendship that brought Cate to the book in the first place.

	It's a whiplash of settings, from a crowded Hollywood season to a calm cross-country road trip, which makes it hard for readers to do anything but follow the threads of the story. This is a contemporary read and takes much of its inspiration from today's celebrity obsessed society, but places readers in such a compelling mystery that any nods to real life will be swiftly forgiven.


Deep Sky author Yume Kitasei's latest book The Stardust Grail takes the academic treasure hunting and style of Indiana Jones to new, space-inspired heights. Readers are introduced to Maya Hoshimoto, a former art and antiquities thief determined to leave her space travel days behind and finish her graduate degree in anthropology at an Earth university. But when her close friend Uncle — part of a nearly extinct alien species Frenro — tips her off that there might finally be a way to snag her most elusive and world saving artifact, she leaves her coursework behind for one last ditch effort to solve a galaxy-sized mystery. One of the best ways to fully escape from a convoluted world is to dive headfirst into a new and strange one, leaving the planet behind entirely. And doesn't that sound nice right now?

	Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on Thursday evening posted an image showing him meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland immigrant whom Donald Trump's administration illegally deported to El Salvador and refused to bring home, despite a Supreme Court order.


	Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador on Wednesday seeking to meet with Abrego Garcia. He said he was denied access to the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the Trump administration recently said Abrego Garcia is being held. 


	“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen posted on X. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.” 


	Trump is paying El Salvador millions to hold Abrego Garcia and hundreds more migrants in a prison system known as a “judicial black hole” rife with torture, while musing about sending U.S. citizens — “homegrown” criminals, in Trump's words — there, too.

	











	Abrego Garcia fled gang violence in El Salvador and came to the U.S. as a teenager in 2011. He was previously granted a “protection from removal” order barring his deportation to El Salvador, but he was among hundreds of immigrants whom the Trump administration last month shipped to El Salvador without due process, citing specious claims that the men had ties to gangs that the president has deemed terrorist organizations. The Trump administration has alleged he was mistakenly sent there as a result of an “administrative error.”


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Based on the withholding order, Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was “illegal,” the Supreme Court found last week. The conservative-dominated high court unanimously upheld a lower court order directing the Trump administration to “facilitate” his release from prison in El Salvador, and to “be prepared to share” what it was doing to bring him home.  


	The Trump administration has refused to comply with the orders from the Supreme Court and lower court, arguing it doesn't need to — while also claiming that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and leading a broader PR smear campaign against him. He has never been charged with a crime.

	Trump and his top officials and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele recently suggested in a meeting in the Oval Office that it would be impossible to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. 

	











	“How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?” Bukele said Monday. “Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.”


	An appeals court wrote on Thursday that the Trump administration's “shocking” arguments in Abrego Garcia's case “would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.”


	The three-judge panel added, “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”


	Van Hollen said Wednesday he had spoken with El Salvador's vice president, Félix Ulloa, and asked him why Abrego Garcia was being held in prison without any evidence that he's a gang member. “His answer was that the Trump administration is paying the government of El Salvador to keep him at CECOT,” the senator said.

	Bukele posted several photos of Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia, along with a sneering message: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' & ‘torture.' now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” he wrote. 


	Bukele, the self-professed “world's coolest dictator,” added in another post, “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.”

In the world of military and extraterrestrial encounters, few stories capture the imagination quite like the one involving Soviet soldiers reportedly turned to stone by aliens. This narrative, originating from a 1990s CIA report, has resurfaced, rekindling interest in UFO phenomena and the mysteries that surround them. The details of this incident, which unfold like a science fiction tale, have sparked discussions about the implications of such encounters. As we delve deeper into this astonishing report, we explore the intersection of military actions and possible alien retaliation, questioning how much we truly understand about the universe around us.

According to the CIA report, the tale is as chilling as it is intriguing. An agent described the event as “a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.” The incident allegedly took place during a training exercise in Ukraine, where Soviet soldiers encountered a low-flying spaceship shaped like a saucer. During the exercise, a surface-to-air missile was launched, successfully striking the UFO. What followed was an alleged act of retaliation that defies logic and science: the extraterrestrial beings reportedly turned the soldiers to stone.

This account, detailed in the now-declassified CIA document, suggests that the soldiers' transformation was both instantaneous and irreversible. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen the aftermath of this event, including stark images that depict the eerie scene. The report, while lacking corroborative scientific evidence, provides a captivating narrative that challenges conventional understanding and raises questions about the potential consequences of military engagements with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

“Elon Musk is panicking”: These 6 reusable Chinese rockets just leapfrogged SpaceX in the ultimate space race showdown



The CIA report that brought this story to light was compiled after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. This geopolitical shift allowed Western intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, to access previously classified documents, including a 250-page report from the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB). The KGB report contained detailed accounts of the event, complete with eyewitness testimonies and purported photographic evidence.

Originally declassified in 2000, the report was first brought to public attention by publications like the Canadian Weekly World News and Ukraine's Holos Ukrayiny. Despite its sensational nature, the story remained largely within the confines of UFO enthusiast circles until recent years. The establishment of the UAP Task Force by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2020 reignited interest in such reports, as the task force aimed to systematically study and catalog unexplained aerial phenomena. This renewed focus on UAPs, coupled with the release of new government files, has once again thrust the stone-turning incident into the spotlight.

The report is bolstered by eyewitness accounts from those who allegedly witnessed the Soviet soldiers' transformation. These individuals describe an event that defies rational explanation, one where the soldiers, moments after the UFO was shot down, were inexplicably turned to stone. The document claims to include images depicting the aftermath, showing soldiers frozen in lifelike poses, as if caught in a moment of time.

While the authenticity of these accounts and images remains a matter of debate, their inclusion in the report adds a layer of eerie realism to the narrative. The potential existence of photographic evidence provides a tangible, albeit unsettling, connection to the event. Yet, the lack of scientific analysis or verification leaves room for skepticism. Regardless, these accounts contribute to the story's enduring allure, providing a vivid illustration of the alleged consequences of human-alien encounters.

“An Unprecedented Leap in Aviation”: Epic Aircraft's E1000 AX with autoland steps up safety with this groundbreaking innovation



The resurfacing of this report has had significant repercussions in the field of UFO research and beyond. It has sparked renewed interest in the study of UAPs and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life. As governments worldwide release more information on UFO sightings, stories like that of the Soviet soldiers challenge us to reconsider our place in the universe and our understanding of its mysteries.

The incident also highlights the potential dangers of engaging with unidentified aerial phenomena. If true, the transformation of soldiers into stone serves as a stark warning of the consequences that could arise from such encounters. This narrative, while steeped in mystery, serves as a catalyst for discussions on the need for caution and further investigation into the unknown. As science advances and our ability to explore the cosmos grows, the questions raised by such accounts continue to provoke curiosity and debate.

As we ponder this tale of Soviet soldiers and alien retaliation, we are left with more questions than answers. The enigmatic nature of the event challenges our understanding of reality and the potential interactions between humanity and extraterrestrial life. Could this be a mere story, or does it hint at a deeper truth about our universe? As we continue to explore the cosmos, what other secrets lie in wait?

Stock Analysis

 When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early.  A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining.  This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well.  On that note, looking into UFO Moviez India (NSE:UFO), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going.  

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

 Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  The formula for this calculation on UFO Moviez India is: 

 Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 

0.062 = ₹248m ÷ (₹5.4b - ₹1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).

 Thus, UFO Moviez India has an ROCE of 6.2%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 6.2%, it's still a low return by itself.  

 Check out our latest analysis for UFO Moviez India 

 Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for UFO Moviez India's ROCE against it's prior returns.  If you're interested in investigating UFO Moviez India's past further, check out this free graph covering UFO Moviez India's past earnings, revenue and cash flow. 

 In terms of UFO Moviez India's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence.  Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 18% that they were earning  five years ago.  Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period.  Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last  five years.   So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on UFO Moviez India becoming one if things continue as they have.  

 All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine.      And, the stock has remained flat over the last  five years, so investors don't seem too impressed either.   With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.   

 On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for UFO Moviez India  that we think you should be aware of.

In February 2023, during routine operations off the coast of Southern California, the crew of the US Navy's Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Jackson recorded a sequence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) exhibiting anomalous behavior.

The incident involved four aerial objects that appeared to rise from the ocean without any visible means of propulsion. This event is similar to the well-known 2004 “Tic Tac” encounter.

Senior Chief Operations Specialist Alexandro Wiggins, a 23-year veteran of the US Navy and a radar expert, has come forward to share his firsthand account.

Wiggins, whose responsibilities aboard the USS Jackson included tactical airspace monitoring and identification, detected irregular radar returns while stationed in the ship's Combat Information Center (CIC).

To visually confirm the irregularities, he moved the topside of the ship.

He observed what appeared to be a luminous object surfacing from the sea and ascending, behavior inconsistent with any known aerial platform.

Upon returning to the CIC, Wiggins utilized the ship's SAFIRE system, a thermal imaging sensor designed for maritime surveillance, to acquire and track the target.

What initially appeared to be a single contact rapidly became a four-object formation, each resembling the cylindrical, tic-tac-like profile previously reported in US Navy engagements.

Wiggins reportedly said the objects displayed no exhaust signature or thermal trail, a critical indicator of conventional propulsion systems.

Moments later, all four objects accelerated simultaneously toward the northeast at a velocity and synchronization that he described as “two steps behind instantaneous.”

Wiggins clarified that the USS Jackson did not file a formal incident report.

The reason for not filing an incident report is that the objects stayed at a safe distance and showed no clear signs of aggression.

According to current Navy rules, these conditions do not require automatic threat reporting.

His account nonetheless contributes to a growing body of military-observed UAP incidents in the Southern California Operating Area (SCOA), which has been the locus of anomalous aerial activity in recent years.

This is not Wiggins's first encounter in high-interest maritime airspace.

He previously served aboard the USS Omaha, one of ten Navy warships that reported being swarmed by unidentified aerial contacts in 2019.

That series of incidents produced radar and thermal imaging evidence of multiple large, spherical objects maneuvering around the vessel for over an hour, one of which was observed submerging into the sea.

While Wiggins said he is not a whistleblower, he believes the continued public minimization of UAP incidents undermines operational transparency.

“I'm not trying to make waves,” he said. “I served with pride. But this happened, and it's operationally significant.”

The Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), created to centralize UAP investigations, remains the designated authority for analysis.

However, active-duty personnel and veterans have expressed skepticism regarding the office's credibility and effectiveness.

The absence of actionable feedback or follow-up investigations deteriorates trust among frontline warfighters who have experienced these encounters firsthand.

Analyst Marik von Rennenkampff, a former Defense and State Department official, reviewed flight records for the timeframe and confirmed no conventional aircraft were near the USS Jackson during the incident.

Rennenkampff concluded that the sightings cannot be explained by commercial, civilian, or military aviation activity.

Wiggins said, “Maybe one day, this will be like the stealth fighter or Area 51, classified for decades and then just accepted. But by then, I'll be 80 or 90, and it'll be too late to matter.”

Learn from experts about UFOs and more at this Butler event","https://www.dailyamerican.com/story/entertainment/events/2025/04/18/annual-butler-paranormal-conference-april-26/83099819007/","Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:14:36 GMT","

Six well-known experts in paranormal activity research will be the featured speakers at the 18th annual Butler Paranormal Conference on April 26.

""We cover all aspects of the paranormal, including UFO and UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena), aliens, Bigfoot, Dogman, cryptids in general and ghosts,"" said Daniel Hageman, founder and director of the Butler Organization for Research of the Unexplained (BORU), which organizes the annual event.

""This is the 18th year for the conference, and it's growing exponentially,"" he said. ""People are more interested than ever in these paranormal sightings. There are more shows about it on television than ever.""

The annual Butler Paranormal Conference brings in people from across the nation who are interested in the unexplained or who want to talk about an experience or sighting that they cannot explain, Hageman said.

Likewise, he said, BORU's core mission is to investigate and present truthful information to the public about UFO/UAP sightings, cryptid sightings and other unexplained phenomena occurring in western Pennsylvania and the tri-state area.

""Most of the time, we can explain (a sighting) as a manmade or natural phenomena, but there's a percentage that can't be explained,"" he said.

""Keep an open mind, come hear the guest speakers and hear what they've experienced. There are too many credible people from all walks of life who have had personal experience in a sighting for it to be anything but real.""

The day's five presentations (each an hour long) begin at 11 a.m. with paranormal researcher Stan Gordon, who is well known for his investigation of the 1965 UFO incident near Kecksburg and thousands of unexplained paranormal incidents across Pennsylvania. Gordon's presentation, titled ""Strange Aspects of Elusive Bigfoot,"" will offer new information on Bigfoot and the UFO connection.

At 12:30 p.m., folklore researcher and paranormal investigator Kevin Paul will speak on his experiences with the unexplained in his talk, ""Close Encounters of the Celtic Kind.""

At 2 p.m., James Krug, an Altoona area science teacher, astronomer and Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) field investigator, will share insights from his experience.

At 3 p.m., paranormal author and Bigfoot researcher Maxim Furek will speak about his latest book, ""The Lost Tribes of Bigfoot"" and his research into Bigfoot sightings in Pennsylvania, which he said has the third-highest number of sightings in the nation.

""I'm excited to be back in western Pennsylvania and sharing my research with folks at the conference,"" Furek said. ""I'm looking forward to meeting the folks at the conference, to answer their questions about Bigfoot and give my answers on what (a sighting) could be.""

The day's final presenters at 5 p.m. are Jean Vincent and Suzanne Vincent, known as the Psychic Vincent Sisters. They will discuss how their work has helped law enforcement solve crime investigations and share their experiences with the paranormal in researching missing persons cases and unsolved crimes. They will also conduct a live psychic gallery reading during their presentation.

In between presentations, the event includes opportunities for book signings by the presenters, raffles, door prizes and more than 50 vendors onsite selling CDs, books, T-shirts and other merchandise to those who attend. Food will also be available for purchase during the conference.

The conference will be from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. April 26 at the Tanglewood Senior Center, 10 Austin Ave. in Lyndora, Butler County. Tickets are $20.

The admission cost to attend the conference will be used to fund next year's conference, Hageman said.

""We're not in it for profit,"" he said. ""We believe the public has the right to know the truth.""

Anyone who wants to share an experience they've had with the unexplained can contact Hageman and BORU at the organization's Facebook page, in an email to vop4647@yahoo.com or call 724-282-1710.

""If you see something you don't understand or can't explain, report it,"" he said. ""We take what we do very seriously. The truth is out there – we are not alone.""","{'href': 'https://www.dailyamerican.com', 'title': 'Daily American'}","other"

Is there life after death? TV shows about mediums, who have the intuitive gift of being able to psychically connect with the deceased, have become increasingly popular, as more people open up to the belief that spirits do live on after death.

As studies have shown communication with those who have passed away is possible, it's not surprising that more people are seeking mediumship services on popular psychic platforms.

Turn these shows into reality by connecting with your medium through one of these trusted online psychic reading sites.

The Long Island Medium stars Theresa Caputo, who is known for walking right up to strangers to pass along messages from departed loved ones. From the grocery store to restaurants, Caputo is attuned to the spiritual realm and in service to bridging the realms of the living and deceased. The spontaneity of her approach leads to candid responses of those who are on the receiving end of the information she is sharing. (Although some of the best online psychic readings can be just as interesting and revealing!)

Caputo has become one of the most well-known reality TV psychics. Due to the popularity of this show, TLC produced 14 seasons between 2011 and 2019. The high-energy and unconventional approach of Caputo makes this show top-notch entertainment.

Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry chronicles the readings of clairvoyant medium Tyler Henry Koelewyn, who discovered his intuitive gifts at age 10. He started filming this TV series in 2016, when he was only 19 years old. Tyler Henry's popularity grew after he appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians to do a mediumship reading for the sisters. E! offered Tyler Henry the opportunity to do his own show. It was a hit from the get-go, and ended up running for 4 seasons until 2019.

The show documents Tyler Henry doing readings for A-List celebrities, such as Carmen Electra, Chad Michael Murray, Megan Fox, Bobby Brown, Kristin Cavallari, and many more. What's unique about this show is the glimpse it offers into celebrities' personal lives as they open up about their deceased loved ones.

Riffing off popular shows such as Cash Cab and Carpool Karaoke, Seatbelt Psychic features medium Thomas John picking up strangers and relaying messages from departed loved ones. John's goal is to touch the lives of as many people as possible, trusting he'll cross paths with the people he's meant to meet, so this on-the-move show is perfect for his mission.

Unfortunately, it only aired one season in 2018 on Lifetime before being canceled. However, the unscripted nature of the show has gone a long way in convincing skeptics and nonbelievers of the validity of mediumship messages. John's personal messages are often exactly what his passengers needed to hear to gain clarity and release. If you're curious whether a loved one on the other side might have something to say to you, the personal face-to-face mediumship readings on Keen are a great way to find out.

Children tend to have a stronger connection to the other side, hence imaginary friends and seeing things in the closet adults can't. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal explores the unique abilities of children with reported psychic ability and connects them with adult psychic mediums to help cultivate their gifts.

This show ran on A&E for three seasons from 2008 to 2010 and then had a reboot season in 2019. What sets this show apart from others is the special focus on psychically gifted children. Plus, all hosts of the show, Chip Coffey, Chris Flemming, and Kim Russo, are well-known in the paranormal scene. The fourth host, Edy Nathan is a licensed therapist, who ensures the children are integrating and processing their experiences in a healthy way. For anyone who's ever had to comfort a child who thinks they've seen something in the dark, this is a great show to learn from.

Pets quickly become valued family members, and their passing is often just as painful. The Pet Psychic features medium Sonya Fitzpatrick telepathically communicating with animals. From cats and dogs to horses and birds, Fitzpatrick uses her special gift to share messages with pet owners. (Explore some of the  best online psychic readings services to connect with your beloved pets today.)

This show ran for three seasons from 2002 to 2004 on Animal Planet. What was unique about this show is that she's not only communicating with deceased pets but also speaking with living animals to help them with emotional trauma and behavioral problems. If this sounds interesting, consider a reading with an expert pet psychic about your own beloved animal.

America's Psychic Challenge is a game show in which four contestants compete to see who is America's top psychic. In this exciting show, contestants must go through a series of tests to prove their psychic abilities. One challenge is finding a man hidden in the trunk of one car out of 50, while another requires them to correctly match five brides and five grooms.

Lifetime only produced one season of this show back in 2007, but there's also Britain's Psychic Challenge to watch if you like this one. This show is fun and a good start for nonbelievers to see the feats psychics are capable of.

Rescue Medium showcases international psychics Jackie Dennison and Christine Hamlett in seasons 1 through 3 and Alison Wynne-Ryder in seasons 4 through 7 as they help to guide lost spirits to the next realm. In the show, the psychics make house calls to ask spirits to leave haunted locations. Plenty of paranormal encounters occur throughout the seasons, including possessions, poltergeists, and ghosts that need to be dealt with.

This show aired on Canada's W Network from 2006 to 2011, but different seasons have also aired on WE: Women's Entertainment Network in the United States and Discovery Channel and CBS in the U.K. For those who want to see psychics handle a spooky paranormal activity, Rescue Medium gives an up-close look at real-life ghostbusting.

When cases get cold, sometimes it requires psychic investigation to solve the mystery. Psychic Investigators is a true-crime series in which psychics help to find missing clues, discover new leads, and figure out what really happened at the scene of the crime. Like many other popular true-crime shows, Psychic Investigators draws viewers in with dramatic reconstruction, intriguing crime details, and interviews with key characters.

This series aired on the True Crime Network from 2006 to 2008. From solving cold case murders from 30 years earlier to locating missing persons, this is the ultimate psychic show to satisfy the detective within.

Ghost Whisperer, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, is a supernatural television series about Melinda Gordon, who can speak with earthbound spirits. These spirits need Gordon's help in order to move on, and she must use her mediumship abilities to relay important information to the living. However, the messages she receives are often confusing, so she must piece together the clues to understand the spirits' needs.

The five seasons of this show were aired on CBS from 2006 through 2010. Although it's a fictional series, Ghost Whisperer does a great job depicting the struggles of mediumship, such as having to decipher unclear communication and carrying the emotional responsibility of imparting significant messages. Love Hewitt does a wonderful job in this role, portraying what it's like to be a medium with psychic abilities. The show depicts how it can feel more like a curse than a blessing at times to have such unusual gifts.

Medium is a paranormal drama about the character Allison DuBois, played by Patricia Arquette, who can speak with the deceased, foresee the future, and witness past events in her dreams. When interning as an assistant for a Phoenix District Attorney, DuBois has a dream about a murder, which leads to the successful solving of the case. The seven seasons are centered on DuBois using her psychic gifts to solve cases, convincing nonbelievers of her gift, and living her life as a wife and mother of three.

The show had 7 seasons between 2005 and 2011 - the first 5 on NBC, and the rest on CBS. Even though this is a fictional show, it has a fantastic plotline that gives viewers a glimpse into the life of a psychic. DuBois is a relatable character, and it's rewarding to follow along with her psychic journey.

From providing guidance in the time of loss or crisis to solving cold-case crimes, these shows demonstrate there's such a wide range of services that psychics can provide.

The comparisons will assist you in connecting with the perfect psychic for you.

A reanalysis of ancient DNA shows that a major cultural change took place in Ireland after four centuries of farming.

Archaeologists have long assumed that Stone Age tombs in Ireland were built for royalty. But a new analysis of DNA from 55 skeletons found in these 5,000-year-old graves suggests that the tombs were made for the community, not for a ruling dynasty.

In Ireland's Neolithic period, which lasted from about 3900 to 2500 B.C., people built ""megalithic monuments"" — large stone structures that contained human bones and cremated remains. While the monuments clearly marked burials, archaeologists have argued about who was interred in them and whether the tombs served other purposes, such as being focal points for rituals, ceremonies or performances.

Early DNA work found that the people who built these monuments were early farmers who herded cattle and grew grain. It also concluded that these tombs were built for ancient elite dynasties with incestuous marriages. But a study published April 2 in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal suggests archaeologists may have been wrong about the identity of the people buried in the tombs — and their relationships.

Instead of being royal tombs, the megalithic monuments may have been spots where people came together in different seasons to work, feast and bury their dead, study lead author Neil Carlin, an archaeologist at University College Dublin, told Live Science in an email. And this society built the tombs following a major shift away from four centuries of simpler burial practices, the study suggests.

Archaeologists have identified four different kinds of ancient graves in Ireland, including three simple types used in the earlier part of the Neolithic and a fourth type called the ""developed passage tomb"" that originated around 3300 B.C. Passage tombs consisted of a large circular mound entered through a stone corridor. They are older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids, and many still dot the landscape of Ireland, including the well-known Newgrange passage tomb.

Carlin and his team noted that most individuals buried in the passage tombs did not have close genetic ties. Given this, the researchers wrote in the study, ""we cannot say that these tombs were the final resting places of a dynastic lineage who restricted access to 'burial' within these tombs to their relatives.""

Because megalithic monuments were obviously important to Neolithic people but were not necessarily linked to biological relationships, the researchers wanted to ""develop a deeper understanding of changes in kinship during the Neolithic,"" Carlin said. By looking closely at the DNA evidence and at the subtle differences in burials throughout the Neolithic period, the researchers discovered a major shift after the first four centuries of farming in Ireland.

—Dozens of Neolithic burials and 'sacrificed' urns and ax discovered in France

—Remains of 4,000-year-old 'lost' tomb discovered in Ireland

In the early Neolithic, the small, simpler tombs are paralleled in the genetic work, which has shown that there were smaller communities with closer biological ties. But in the later Neolithic period, when people built larger passage tombs, most of the people buried there were relatively diverse and more distantly related, the DNA analysis showed.

""We argue that this reflects how the kin groups using these tombs were interacting on a larger scale and more frequently choosing to have children with others from within these extended communities,"" Carlin said.

What caused this shift isn't clear. But the researchers suggest that the clusters of passage tombs in Neolithic Ireland show that disparate groups of people came together, perhaps seasonally, to participate in ceremonial activities together.

Instead of seeing the Neolithic period as one ruled by powerful dynasties, the researchers view it as ""a more equal society,"" Carlin said. But more work is needed — including new studies of DNA, artifacts and monumental architecture — to fully understand the social changes that happened in Ireland after 3600 B.C., the researchers wrote in their study.
