Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on President Trump withdrawing her bid for the U.N. ambassadorship, Columbia University's interim president resigning and Iran signaling openness to 'indirect' nuclear talks. Kathy Hochul and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., have already begun trading barbs in the 2026 gubernatorial race amid reports that the Republican congresswoman is considering a run. When asked about Stefanik's potential bid, the Democrat responded by saying she's heard from "people in the North Country" concerned about Trump's tariffs policies and how that will impact the region, particularly with its relationship with Canada. "So, no matter who the GOP nominee is next year that I'll be running against, it'll be an extreme MAGA Republican and I look forward to that fight," Hochul said while taking questions on Wednesday. Kathy Hochul has been outspoken about her thoughts on the controversial tolling program. Stefanik, who has not officially announced a campaign, clapped back at the governor. They will not forget what she did to our farmers and our COs. Oh and one more thing … even Democrat candidates in the North Country refuse to publicly support her. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and former President Donald Trump at a New York event. Although Cook Political Report ranks the race as "Likely D," Hochul is currently facing scrutiny for a 39% approval rating, according to a recent Marist poll. The Democrat notably faced off against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in 2022 while he was in Congress. He had the best Republican gubernatorial performance since Gov. "I have been proud to be a team player. He and I had multiple conversations today, and we are committed to delivering results on behalf of the American people. And as always, I'm committed to delivering results on behalf of my constituents," she said on Fox News' "Hannity" last month. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., speaks to reporters ahead of a vote to pass the American Relief Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 19, 2024. Just hours before reports emerged that Stefanik was considering her next political move, Trump posted to Truth Social that "Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is GREAT!!!" Sources told Fox News that allies of the president have encouraged her to run. On the Republican side, Rep. Mike Lawler, Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman and Bethany town supervisor Carl Hyde Jr. are also considering bids. Antonio Delgado and Rep. Ritchie Torres may primary Hochul.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praises the courage of a guest at the briefing and calls out Democrats' hypocrisy on illegal immigration on Hannity. The White House released a splitscreen image overnight to underscore the stark contrast between where Republicans and Democrats stand on illegal immigration. One image featured distraught Angel Mom Patty Morin being comforted by President Trump in the Oval Office. Morin's daughter, Rachel Morin, was savagely beaten, raped and killed in Maryland by an illegal migrant from El Salvador in 2023. The other image showed Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., sitting and talking with deported illegal alien Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, in El Salvador. The White House released a splitscreen image overnight to underscore the stark contrast between where Republicans and Democrats stand on illegal immigration. Abrego Garcia was deported last month by the Trump administration, which says that he was an MS-13 gang member who also violently beat his wife. Van Hollen, who called the deportation "absolutely unjust," flew to El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia's release. The image of Morin was taken on Wednesday when she visited the White House and spoke to reporters from the White House briefing room, where she called out Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia meets with Sen. Van Hollen (X / @nayibbukele) "To have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge – barely acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, and now a grandbaby without a grandmother, so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that is not even an American citizen," Morin said. Following Martinez-Hernandez's conviction, Van Hollen issued a statement vowing to bolster border security while also "supporting our immigrant communities." Rachel Morin's killer, Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, allegedly committed a murder in his home country. Van Hollen flew to El Salvador this week to meet with Abrego Garcia and was denied multiple times. Patty Morin (L), mother of Rachel Morin, speaks as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt looks on during a daily press briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on April 16, 2025, in Washington, D.C. In 2023, Morin's daughter was murdered by Victor Martinez-Hernandez, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree rape on Monday. "I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar," Van Hollen wrote on X, along with the picture the White House posted. Van Hollen previously said that it was "absolutely unjust and illegal to have this Marylander detained one more day in a notorious prison in El Salvador." Garcia who was living in Maryland with his wife and children, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison "Terrorism Confinement Center" (CECOT) last month, and officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although now some top Trump officials say he was correctly removed and contend he's a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Abrego Garcia would not be allowed back into the U.S. unless El Salvador were to decide otherwise. "He is not coming back to our country."

Villatoro Santos was arrested less than a month ago in Woodbridge, Virginia, and was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm. His high-profile arrest was supervised by both U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel from a nearby tactical center. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia is seen in Alexandria, Va. (Photo by Bonnie Cash/Getty Images) ((Bonnie Cash/Getty Images)) Shortly afterward, however, the Department of Justice abruptly filed a motion to dismiss their case against Villatoro Santos – prompting speculation as to what would happen to him next. His counsel said during an April 15 hearing that the government had not clarified next steps for their client, and suggested the Trump administration might move to summarily deport him without due process. Alleged top leader of MS-13 was arrested in Virginia on Thursday, March 27, 2025. At the hearing, his attorneys also invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported last month to El Salvador for being an alleged MS-13 member. Two federal judges in Texas and New York also temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act law to deport certain nationals, siding with their contention that the plaintiffs in question are at risk of removal by the Trump administration, possibly without the opportunity to seek habeas relief in a U.S. court. Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, April 16, 2025. The updates follow a 5–4 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a lower court's restraining order, allowing the Trump administration to temporarily resume use of the Alien Enemies Act — albeit with new due process protections for migrants. The high court said individuals slated for deportation must have the opportunity to challenge their removal, with sufficient time to do so in a U.S. court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance voiced confidence that the United States would be able to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, even as others in the Trump administration express doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about negotiations. So the negotiations, I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close,” Vance said as he met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday in Rome, where he will spend Good Friday through Easter. Vance's comments stand in contrast to those made just hours earlier by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who warned that if there aren't legitimate signs of progress in the coming days, President Donald Trump could halt his efforts to negotiate a peace deal. “We're not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio told reporters after meeting with Ukrainian and European officials in Paris, France. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks.” Rubio also added that if a deal is not possible, “then I think we're just going to move on.” Trump told reporters on Thursday that a long-delayed minerals deal will be signed next week, which could help on the Ukrainian side of negotiations. Trump accepted Meloni's invitation to visit sometime in “the very near future.” While in Rome, Vance, a convert to Catholicism, is also meeting with the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, but he is not expected to meet with Pope Francis, whom he has feuded with over the Trump administration's immigration policies. “Every day since I heard of Pope Francis's illness, I say a prayer for the Holy Father because while, yes, I was certainly surprised when he criticized our immigration policy in the way that he has, I also know that the pope, I believe that the pope is fundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership,” Vance said.</p>

Chris Van Hollen's, D-Md., meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and the response from President Nayib Bukele. President Donald Trump is calling Sen. Chris Van Hollen a "fool" on Friday after the legislator flew to El Salvador to meet with deported illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia. "Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. Garcia, a 29-year-old illegal immigrant living in Maryland, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison "Terrorism Confinement Center" (CECOT) last month, and officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although now some top Trump officials say he had been correctly removed and contend that he is a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. "I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar," Van Hollen, a Democrat, said in a post on X on Thursday. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return." Kilmar Abrego Garcia, left, meets with Sen. Van Hollen, center. Van Hollen said earlier Thursday that "Kilmar Abrego Garcia had been illegally abducted and is being held in a notorious prison in El Salvador -- barred from contacting his family or lawyers." Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez said in a statement that "we still have so many questions, hopes, and fears," according to the Associated Press. Garcia, a 29-year-old illegal immigrant living in Maryland, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison "Terrorism Confinement Center" (CECOT) last month. The Trump administration also released information on Wednesday indicating that Abrego Garcia's wife has accused him of repeated abuse of her. Fox News obtained the written domestic violence allegations filed in court against Abrego Garcia by Vasquez in 2021. Van Hollen said earlier Thursday that "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was illegally abducted." In the filing, written in her own handwriting, Vasquez alleged that Abrego Garcia had repeatedly beaten her, writing: "At this point, I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he [has] left me." Fox News Digital's Greg Wehner, Jasmine Baehr and Bill Mears contributed to this report.

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri of Australia walks through the paddock ahead of the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Thursday, April 17, 2025. Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton of Britain steers his car during the second free practice ahead of the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Friday, April 18, 2025. Still, defending champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull says he hasn't lost hope. Norris has a three-point lead but admits he isn't at his best — though he had the fastest time of the day in practice on Friday — while Piastri has momentum after winning in Bahrain last week. Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes have all had their moments but none has been a consistent challenger, as McLaren's 58-point constructors' championship lead shows. Norris went fastest in the second practice session, while Yuki Tsunoda crashed to continue his difficult start with Red Bull. Norris was .163 seconds faster than Piastri in the second session, which was run under floodlights and more representative of race conditions than the hotter daytime session. Verstappen complained earlier in the day of his car feeling “very loose” in high-speed corners but ended Friday third fastest, .280 off Norris. Alpine's Pierre Gasly was the surprise leader in the first session, just .007 of a second faster than Norris. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari was .07 off Gasly in third and Piastri fourth, barely a tenth of a second off the pace. Lewis Hamilton was eighth in the other Ferrari. Verstappen is the only non-McLaren driver to win a grand prix this season, but in Bahrain he was struggling so much that Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said he was concerned the Dutch star might reconsider his future. So then naturally it's very tough to fight for a championship, but it's still a very long road ... I'm hopeful that we can still improve things.” Two-time champion Fernando Alonso dampened speculation Verstappen could seek to join his Aston Martin team after Red Bull car designer Adrian Newey made that move last year. Asked if he'd welcome being Verstappen's teammate, Alonso said Thursday: “Yes, but it's unlikely to happen. Jeddah hosts the fifth race in six weeks in a hectic start to the season, which stays at a record 24 races. There's a little respite after Saudi Arabia, with two weeks till the next event in Miami. It feels like race 10 already,” said Williams driver Alex Albon, adding it's especially tough on mechanics and other crew members. “As drivers, we travel better than everyone else in the paddock. The rookies are still enjoying their first taste of F1, though. “It's just the beginning of my career, so I just want to keep racing and keep driving,” Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States could be ready to move on from brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested on Friday that President Donald Trump will halt his efforts to work on a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war if there aren't legitimate signs of progress in the upcoming days. Rubio's warning comes after he met with Ukrainian and European officials in Paris. “We're not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said after meeting with officials on Thursday. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks.” However, the secretary of state said other consequential matters required just as much time and attention. “He has dedicated a lot of time and energy to this. … This is important, but there are a lot of other really important things going on that deserve just as much, if not more, attention.” The notion that the U.S. could walk away from brokering a deal came after Trump announced on Thursday that a minerals deal with Ukraine would be signed next week. “There's no one saying this can be done in 12 hours,” Rubio added later. “But we want to see how far apart it is and whether those differences can even be narrowed, if it's even possible to get movement within the period of time we have in mind.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a familiar, beloved scene for millions across America: snow drifting outside and Christmas music playing while families decorate their homes with string lights, stockings and a star atop the tree. But few know exactly where those iconic holiday items come from. Most of the time, they hail from just one city in China's Zhejiang province: Yiwu, nicknamed “Christmas Town,” which supplies nearly 90% of all decorative Christmas goods used in the United States, according to state media. It's a labyrinthine complex measuring nearly 1,000 acres, the equivalent of roughly 750 football fields. Inside, foreign buyers browse narrow corridors overflowing with merchandise, ranging from piano-playing musical Santa dolls to artificial Christmas trees — as well as countless other items destined for American homes, including “Make America Great Again” hats, massage guns and foldable camping chairs. These vendors are on the front lines of global trade — and are now grappling with triple-digit tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which have sent shockwaves across the world and upended relationships forged over decades between the US and China, two superpower economies. America's overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%, the highest trade penalties imposed by the US in nearly a century, with Trump's most recent “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese imports coming after earlier rounds related to fentanyl. For many vendors, the measures have already cost them customers, slashed their profits and forced them to pivot to other markets. When CNN visited the market earlier this week, many voiced both concern and bewilderment at Trump's actions, but also desire for a peaceful resolution as they pick up the pieces of their disrupted businesses. “Some of our long-term clients have stopped dealing with us and we are all very sad,” said Ran Hongyan, 43, who has been selling Christmas decorations for 15 years. Ran said the US exports made up only a portion of her total clientele, but they're not just numbers on a screen or an accounting ledger. She had met one American customer at a trade fair in China years ago, and they had worked together for nearly a decade; he even traveled to visit her factory where the products were made. “Because of the tariff issue, he said he had no choice but to cancel it this year and see what happens later,” she told CNN, standing amid rows of reindeer plushies and festive teddy bears in her small store. “We have been working together for a long time.” Much of President Trump's tariff rhetoric has been about restoring US factory jobs that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals. But it's difficult to see a future where the kind of products on display at Yiwu could be made by American hands — unless consumers are willing to pay much more for something as ubiquitous and currently inexpensive as plastic Christmas ornaments. The city of Yiwu is relatively small by Chinese standards, home to fewer than two million people, but it has an outsized footprint in global trade. Last year, it sent $81 billion of goods overseas, of which about $11.5 billion went to the US, according to local customs data. When CNN visited the wholesale market, it was still bursting with activity. The multi-story, multi-block complex boasts different types of goods on each floor, with coffee shops and snack stalls scattered throughout. Everywhere you turn, there is an explosion of color and sound, with an estimated 70,000 stalls crammed inside, according to local authorities. But the escalating trade war is already making a mark. CNN saw buyers from various countries perusing the booths and negotiating contracts with sellers, but there wasn't a single American in sight. Shopkeepers were on edge, too — with many declining to speak and cautious of local Chinese officials wandering the market. Even vendors who don't sell to the US are nervous. Trump may have delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other nations besides China, prompting many to suspend their own counter-measures, but talks are still ongoing, and there's no telling if the announced tariffs might be reinstated. Many economists, even Trump allies, are warning a global recession could still take place if the trade war continues. The back-and-forth means that the world's economies remain in flux, with consumers potentially tightening their purse strings and reassessing where they're spending their money. That could spell deep trouble for the people of Yiwu, whose livelihoods depend on overseas customers, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. Li Xinyao has been working at her family's imitation flower business at Yiwu market since it was established in 1993, selling plastic bouquets of roses, sunflowers, daisies and more. Though they don't currently have any American customers, their revenue has still taken a hit since the trade war kicked off. When they start the trade war, all the people will worry about that, and our customers will maybe hold on (orders).” The turbulent global economy could also hurt her sales, since decorations, like plastic flowers, could be first on the chopping block for clients needing to cut expenditures, she said. “If we cannot lead a happy life, who will care about decorations?” she asked. For many other vendors, whose customer base is concentrated in the US, Trump's trade war means they will now need to look for other opportunities. In some ways, this pivot has been happening for years on a national level. The idea of decoupling, a scenario where two countries have virtually no trade or investment, has been bandied about in US-China circles for years, though such a historic rupture would cause enormous pain for both of the deeply intertwined economies. Tensions have been rising since the US-China trade war during Trump's first term, and China has been quietly bracing for a showdown in the years since. This means China now relies less on US businesses than it did before, an attitude the Yiwu sellers are adopting too. “I am now taking all goods that are halted by my US customers to the EU route. I will push all these goods to our EU customers,” said 39-year-old Nie Ziqin, who sells Halloween decorations. I am also doing cross-border e-commerce online,” she said, gesturing to the walls of ghostly masks, pumpkin lanterns, dancing ghouls and giant eyeballs around her. Some of the vendors praised China's response to the trade war, echoing sentiments expressed on China's tightly controlled social media, where online users vented anger toward the US and supported Beijing's firm stance against Trump's tariffs. Last week Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125%, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping saying his nation was “not afraid.” Officials indicated Beijing would not raise rates further since it would be meaningless to continue escalating. “Our government is doing good in these things,” said Li, the imitation flower seller. But that doesn't lessen their fear, as they brace for impact and worry about what the trade war could mean for Yiwu and the families who live there. But as the trade war drags on, it's not clear whether that relationship can be repaired — or whether it will ever look the same again, even if vendors eventually resume selling to their long-time customers. “When we do daily shopping, if we want to buy a bag or buy some daily necessities, we will now start considering whether these products are imported from the United States,” said Ran, the Christmas decorations seller. And if those goods are American-made: “I will definitely choose not to buy them.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance is departing for a weeklong trip across Italy and India on Friday, just the latest in a string of diplomatic deployments President Donald Trump has assigned to his second in command. According to the White House, the vice president and second lady Usha Vance will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, along with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, in Rome and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. One day earlier, Meloni met with Trump in the White House for a bilateral meeting focused on trade. The Vances will specifically “discuss shared economic and geopolitical priorities with leaders in each country,” the vice president's office said of his trips to Italy and India. Ryan Walker, executive vice president of Heritage Action for America, told the Washington Examiner that Vance's ability to vocalize the “root” of Trump's “America First” foreign policy has made him a top “confidant” in crafting how the administration engages different foreign governments. “Having someone like that in the administration is almost like a superpower, being able to communicate, boil it down to the root of what those policies are derived from, and based on what they're trying to solve,” Walker said of Vance. Still, Vance's foreign relations input has produced a handful of hiccups. His remarks in Munich, and specifically accusations of free speech “backsliding” on the continent, were received icily by European allies. His recent comment that the United States is borrowing from “Chinese peasants” has apparently become an impediment to trade talks as well, with China asking that members of Trump's Cabinet remain respectful, according to Bloomberg. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian had called the remarks “astonishing and lamentable” last week. The president has hosted a series of world leaders at the White House since January, but he is not expected to make his first foreign trip, to Saudi Arabia, until May. “It's a great ‘one-two' punch,” one former Trump administration official said. “President Trump is trying to shake up America's relationships with allies and enemies alike. But he's also dealing with a ton at home, limiting his ability to travel and engage leaders on their own turf. A second longtime Republican operative suggested that Vance's “happy warrior” mentality keeps foreign leaders “on their toes.”</p>

Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni on President Trump's slated announcement on semiconductor tariffs and DOGE's new website enabling the American people to recommend potential cuts. A federal judge in Baltimore issued a preliminary injunction Thursday restricting the Department of Government Efficiency's access to Social Security data. U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander, an Obama appointee, said DOGE-affiliated staffers must purge any of the non-anonymized Social Security data that they have received since Jan. 20. They are also barred from making any changes to the computer code or software used by the Social Security Administration, must remove any software or code they might have already installed, and are forbidden from disclosing any of that code to others. The injunction does allow DOGE staffers to access data that's been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, if they undergo training and background checks. "The objective to address fraud, waste, mismanagement, and bloat is laudable, and one that the American public presumably applauds and supports," Hollander wrote in the ruling issued late Thursday night. "Indeed, the taxpayers have every right to expect their government to make sure that their hard earned money is not squandered." Demonstrators gather outside the Edward A. Garmatz United States District Courthouse in Baltimore, on Friday, March 14, 2025. "For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. The case was brought by a group of labor unions and retirees who allege DOGE's recent actions violate privacy laws and present massive information security risks. During a federal court hearing Tuesday in Baltimore, Hollander repeatedly asked the government's attorneys why DOGE needs "seemingly unfettered access" to the agency's troves of sensitive personal information to uncover Social Security fraud. Hollander said, questioning whether most of the data could be anonymized. He argued the DOGE access doesn't deviate significantly from normal practices inside the agency, where employees and auditors are routinely allowed to search its databases. But attorneys for the plaintiffs called it "a sea change" in terms of how the agency handles sensitive information. Hollander made clear that her order didn't apply to SSA workers who aren't affiliated with DOGE, so they can still access any data they use in the course of ordinary work. But DOGE staffers who want access to the anonymized data must first undergo the typical training and background checks required of other Social Security Administration staffers, she said. Billionaire Elon Musk leads the Department of Government Effeciency. Hollander, 75, is the latest judge to consider a DOGE-related case. Many of her inquiries Tuesday focused on whether the Social Security case differs significantly from another Maryland case challenging DOGE's access to data at three other agencies: the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. In that case, an appeals court recently blocked a preliminary injunction and cleared the way for DOGE to once again access people's private data. Hollander's injunction could also be appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with the Trump administration in other cases, including allowing DOGE access to the U.S. Agency for International Development and letting executive orders against diversity, equity and inclusion move forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. forces launched airstrikes against the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen on Thursday. Thursday's military strike reportedly killed at least 38 people and wounded over 100 others. “Today, U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” the statement read. This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.” These funds allow the terrorist group to carry out its military operations instead of being distributed to people in Yemen. “The Houthis have continued to benefit economically and militarily from countries and companies that provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,” CENTCOM's statement read. “Despite the Foreign Terrorist Designation that went into effect on 05 April, ships have continued to supply fuel via the port of Ras Isa. Profits from these illegal sales are directly funding and sustaining Houthi terrorist efforts.” “This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,” the Houthis' statement read. “It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as US and NATO troops were in the final weeks of withdrawing from the country after two decades of war. The Russian court's move was a diplomatic victory for the Taliban, who were put on Moscow's list of terrorist organizations in 2003, making any contact with them punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Russia as Moscow has sought to position itself as a regional power broker. The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Russian officials have recently been emphasizing the need to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan. In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terrorist groups. The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but started to enforce restrictions on women and girls soon after the 2021 takeover. Women are barred from most jobs and public places, including parks, baths and gyms, while girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade. The Taliban also have brought back their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, including public executions. Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and want to scrap harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the US under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases. Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with Crisis Group's Asia Program, said the Taliban's listing as a terrorist group was a legal impairment for trade and political ties with Kabul and its lifting reflected Moscow's desire to improve relations. “However, beyond making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage with Afghanistan, I am not sure what other major benefit this will have,” he said. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Russian move was not ground-breaking because many countries had never formally designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization. For Russia, he said it would serve as a confidence-building measure helping pave the way for more engagement and enabling Moscow to better protect its interests in Afghanistan, particularly concerns about anti-Russia terror groups like Islamic State-Khorasan. “Meanwhile, for the Taliban, the court decision is a legitimacy-boosting outcome they can leverage to point to international acceptance of their rule,” Kugelman observed.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff joined other top Ukrainian and European officials for hours of separate meetings at the French presidential palace before French President Emmanuel Macron brought them all together for a final round of talks at the end of the day. Macron described the talks as an important “convergence.” France announced that talks in the same format would continue in London next week. There is also frustration among Europeans over the Trump administration's other moves, from tariffs on some of its closest partners to rhetoric about NATO and Greenland. Rubio wrote on X that the American delegation in Paris was looking to “secure real, practical solutions to end the Russia-Ukraine war.” Rubio also spoke by phone Thursday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, conveying the same message he gave the delegations in Paris, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “The encouraging reception in Paris to the U.S. framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement.” Senior U.S. officials had previously made comments suggesting European representatives would not be involved in ceasefire negotiations. Experts said the talks are thought to be the first time Witkoff — Trump's chief envoy tasked with negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin — has met senior Ukrainian officials. And I think that is emerging because I think the U.S. process has stalled and ... they realized that you need European input because they have skin in the game.'' “This is not just about a swath of territory in Ukraine,” she said. “This is about broader questions of European security and you can't disentangle those.″ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wanted his representatives to raise the question of security guarantees for Ukraine, and said he gave his team a mandate to discuss a full and partial ceasefire — but not matters relating to the territorial integrity of Ukraine. A senior French official said after Thursday's talks that U.S. officials were ''ready to discuss security guarantees,″ without elaborating. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, also joined the talks. Around 30 countries led by Britain and France have been discussing a possible coalition to police any future peace agreement with Russia. Polyakova, from the Washington group CEPA, suggested peace efforts have so-far failed because Putin does not want a ceasefire and is stalling for time. France hailed Thursday's meetings as a diplomatic success borne from those relationships. Hours earlier, a massive drone attack hit the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Wednesday night, killing three people, including a child, regional authorities said. Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks. Rubio and Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace more than three years after Russia launched the war. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia, and Witkoff met last week with Putin. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.
