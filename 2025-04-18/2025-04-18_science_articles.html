(2025)Cite this article The immunoregulatory metabolite itaconate accumulates in innate immune cells upon Toll-like receptor stimulation. In response to macrophage activation by lipopolysaccharide, itaconate inhibits inflammasome activation and boosts type I interferon signalling; however, the molecular mechanism of this immunoregulation remains unclear. Here, we show that the enhancement of type I interferon secretion by itaconate depends on the inhibition of peroxiredoxin 5 and on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. We find that itaconate non-covalently inhibits peroxiredoxin 5, leading to the modulation of mitochondrial peroxide in activating macrophages. Through genetic manipulation, we confirm that peroxiredoxin 5 modulates type I interferon secretion in macrophages. The non-electrophilic itaconate mimetic 2-methylsuccinate inhibits peroxiredoxin 5 and phenocopies immunoregulatory action of itaconate on type I interferon and inflammasome activation, providing further support for a non-covalent inhibition of peroxiredoxin 5 by itaconate. Our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of actions and biological rationale for the predominantly immune specification of itaconate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They've been living above a German escape route for years. We can't say for sure that a recently discovered secret tunnel connecting historic townhomes in Belgium was created by the Germans during World War I after they commandeered the properties, but a recent Dutch-language report into the find makes that possibility quite likely. The shaft connected to a closed-off 18th century water well and, more interestingly, links to a nearly 32-foot-long tunnel only about four feet high that may have been built during the German occupation. Finding a 100-year-old tunnel underneath your home is surprising regardless, but slightly (only slightly) less so when considering the history of the townhouse complex. The site served as a crucial Fourth Army command center featuring a war room that scripted the first chlorine gas attack and flamethrower uses in 1915 while coordinating operations on the Western Front until French bombardment in 1918. According to the report, this context makes it “likely that this tunnel was built as an escape route.” The house was built in 1769 on a plot of land once housing a small community of Franciscans. But in summer 1914, German troops invaded neutral Belgium and in October 1914 decided to house military command for the Fourth Army in Tielt, out of the range of enemy artillery, but strategically located near road and rail infrastructure. One metal manhole cover gave access to a brick water well that featured the same bricks used when the house was constructed. But more surprising was a second manhole cover about three feet away. This one covered a vertical shaft with non-connected walls positioned between the well and house with supports made of bricks and beams that came well after initial home construction. “All these elements made it clear that this shaft is a later addition,” according to the report. At the bottom of the shaft, a northwest wall appeared to have been breached, featuring an opening over seven feet high that leads directly into a well. While the tunnel was still somewhat small for comfortable human use, the shape of the tunnel, neat finishes of the interior, lack of slope, dimensions, and use of construction elements such as iron and steel make its use as a water conveyance tunnel unlikely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's Next Major Space Telescope Is Ready to Launch. Trump Wants to Kill It and Other Vital Science In a triumph for NASA, reliable sources say that Roman could launch as early as the fall of 2026, well ahead of its May 2027 target and potentially under budget. But a leaked draft of the president's 2026 budget request, which Scientific American has reviewed, instead calls for canceling Roman. You've built it, and you're not going to do the final step to finish it?” says astrophysicist David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation and former co-chair of Roman's science team.

Roman isn't the only casualty in the president's draft NASA budget, which is still in flux and will ultimately require congressional approval. The draft budget includes an almost 50 percent cut to heliophysics, which studies the sun and space weather, reducing it to $455 million; a more than 50 percent reduction in Earth science funding, which includes climate monitoring, taking it down to roughly $1 billion; and a 30 percent cut to planetary science and solar system exploration, resulting in $1.9 billion. The last cut kills the upcoming DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission to Venus and NASA's beleaguered mission to bring rocks back from Mars. Notably, the document also cleaves off two thirds of the funding for NASA's astrophysics division, which studies stars, galaxies and cosmology, dropping it to $487 million and specifying that “no funding is provided” for telescopes other than JWST and Hubble. “This is a wholly unserious budget proposal,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking member of the spending committee for NASA, in a recent statement. Privately, space policy experts have been even less charitable about the proposal: “It sets back a program that is clearly the leading program in the world—in a historic fashion,” says a former government official, speaking to Scientific American on condition of anonymity because of concerns about retaliation. “You take that program and shoot it through the head.” Now observers suggest that instead of ushering in that golden age, the Trump administration simply seems to be trading in the entire universe. “If you want to take the most successful fleet of missions ever built, and the leadership that accompanies that fleet, and throw that all away, this is the budget to do it,” says another senior space scientist, speaking anonymously because of concerns about budgetary retribution from the Trump administration. But in each previous instance Congress kept the program alive. Observers are hopeful that lawmakers will again rescue the telescope because space science has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support. In 2020 NASA named the project, which until then had been called the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), after Nancy Grace Roman, an astronomer who played a pivotal role in developing Hubble. The Roman telescope has been ranked as a top priority in astrophysics since a National Academy of Sciences review in 2010—a status that was only bolstered two years later, when the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which builds and operates spy satellites, donated two large, unused mirrors and associated optics to the mission. Designed to survey our own planet, the NRO's 2.4-meter-wide mirrors match Hubble's in size. But they have a shorter focal length that makes them better suited for doing wide-field imaging surveys that monitor millions of stars and take broad looks at exploding stars, early galaxies and large-scale cosmological structures. “Every Hubble image you see—make it 100 times bigger,” Spergel says. We will survey the entire sky, with Hubble-quality images.” The project was initially overbudget, but after a hefty course correction, the team is on track to deliver Roman ahead of its planned 2027 launch—and, if so, below cost. That comes on the heels of repeated criticism from federal and congressional watchdogs over price tags and schedule overruns for large space agency missions in the past two decades. Like JWST, Roman sees the universe in infrared light—which means that it can spot very old, very faraway objects whose light has stretched into longer, redder infrared wavelengths as it has traversed the expanse. Crucially, recent results from other surveys suggest that this still mysterious dark energy, whose force is seemingly pushing galaxies apart at an accelerating rate, might surprisingly weaken over time. And Roman is designed to be complementary to the European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, which makes similar observations at visible wavelengths, and the U.S.'s powerful, ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is coming online later this year in Chile. “These are not missions that do the same thing,” says Henk Hoekstra, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies dark energy. “We have this strange universe—would you trust a single result and build our whole understanding of the universe on just this one measurement?” Another Roman instrument—a starlight-blocking coronagraph—is a key prototype for NASA's next major astrophysics flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Zeroing out Roman would mean losing all the information we'd get from that tech demo. Many of the budget's proposed cancellations do exactly that. “Why do we even plan on doing great things if, on a whim, we can just decide ‘nah'?” the senior space scientist says. “These things take a generation to build and enable multiple generations of scientists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strange Circles in the Sky Are Still Baffling Astronomers Stay connected to The Universe: Get email alerts for this weekly column by Phil Plait It's rare these days for astronomers to find a new class of object in the heavens. After all, we've been searching the skies for centuries, so all the easy stuff has already been found. Objects in newly discovered classes also tend to be faint because, again, bright objects will have already been spotted. It's also why they can be baffling—by definition, we've never seen anything like them before. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. The objects turned up in a pilot survey using the at-the-time newly completed radio telescope called the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (or ASKAP) telescope, a collection of 36 radio dishes, each 12 meters wide, located in Western Australia. The newfound celestial objects were relatively big and circular—a shape that's common in astronomical bodies. If the material glows, then it will look like a circle from any viewing direction. Dying stars that are blowing off winds of gas tend to make these kinds of structures, and many examples are known. These new objects in the ASKAP survey, however, didn't correspond to any previously known structure, didn't have an obvious source and, outside of radio emission, were invisible in wavelengths of light. Lacking any obvious mechanism for their creation, astronomers dubbed them ORCs: odd radio circles. Honestly, I give them credit for coming up with such a brief, descriptive moniker (and for presumably being fans of J.R.R. Searching images from other telescopes, the astronomers found an object emitting visible and infrared light right at the ORC's center. Later observations indicated it's an elliptical galaxy about five billion light-years from Earth. If it's the source of ORC 1, this first-of-its-kind odd celestial circle is a staggering two million light-years across—more than 15 times wider than our own Milky Way galaxy—making it vast indeed. It's also possible, however, that this galaxy may instead just happen to be coincidentally located near the apparent center of ORC 1 in the sky. “MeerKAT uncovers the physics of an odd radio circle,” Ray P Norris et al., Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. ORCs 2 and 3 are roughly the same size in the sky and happen to be so close together that they're nearly touching, strongly implying they're related to each other in some way. But while ORC 2 is ring-shaped and bright, ORC 3 is faint and more like a disk, an evenly filled circle. There are several galaxies apparently near to them, but again, these objects occupy a lot of real estate on the sky, so the odds of coincidentally finding galaxies in proximity to them are good. Astronomers have found more ORCs in the years since those initial discoveries, and some of them also appear to have a galaxy in their center, which does seem to strengthen the correlation. One possible driver is a supermassive black hole. Strong magnetic fields that spin like a tornado near the center can launch incredibly powerful beams of matter and energy that scream away from the black hole at high speed. In correspondence published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, astronomers reported they had found a diffuse x-ray emission at the location of an ORC they dubbed Cloverleaf, and its spectrum indicated that the high-energy light comes from hot gas typically found in low-mass galaxy groups that are somewhat heftier than our own Local Group (of which the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are the biggest members). This would put the ORC about 600 million light-years from Earth. Such a catastrophic event can dump a lot of energy into the gas around the galaxies, again creating an expanding wind that can take on a roughly spherical shape. If this interpretation of the Cloverleaf is correct, it indicates there's more than one way to make an ORC. These weird objects may, in fact, reflect a wide range of physical structures and distinctly differing origins. An association with the LMC would mean this ORC is only 160,000 light-years from us, which would make it only about 150 light-years in diameter! That would imply an entirely different formation history, making this ORC a likely supernova remnant, the expanding debris from a star that exploded long ago. What's odd is that it's located outside the LMC, where stars are sparse. Still, sometimes stars get ejected from galaxies; they can get catapulted away if they pass close to a massive black hole, for example, or if they were once part of a binary system and their companion star exploded, flinging them away at high speed. It looks like the ORC category can encompass several different kinds of objects. That's not too surprising; as we have discovered over and again in astronomy, a collection of phenomena that all look similar can have radically different causes. Some supernovae are from high-mass stars that explode when their core collapses at the end of their life, while others are from already dead white dwarfs that accumulate enough matter on their surface to cause a catastrophic star-wide thermonuclear explosion. Gamma-ray bursts can be caused by extremely massive stars exploding or from two tiny but superdense neutron stars colliding. Remember, the term ORC is descriptive, not explanatory. Although astronomers have studied ORCs for several years now, they are still a brand-new class of object, meaning we're likely to have more theoretical explanations for them than we do actual examples to study in the sky.

Systemic inflammatory conditions are classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase that elevates the susceptibility to secondary infections. Comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these phases is largely lacking. To address this gap, we leveraged a controlled, human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation encompassing both phases. Single-cell RNA sequencing during the acute hyperinflammatory phase identified an inflammatory CD163+SLC39A8+CALR+ monocyte-like subset (infMono) at 4 h post-LPS administration. The late immunosuppressive phase was characterized by diminished expression of type I interferon (IFN)-responsive genes in monocytes, impaired myelopoiesis and a pronounced attenuation of the immune response on a secondary LPS challenge 1 week after the first. The infMono gene program and impaired myelopoiesis were also detected in patient cohorts with bacterial sepsis and coronavirus disease. IFNβ treatment restored type-I IFN responses and proinflammatory cytokine production and induced monocyte maturation, suggesting a potential treatment option for immunosuppression. Systemic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of several diseases, such as sepsis and viral infections, including COVID-19, and contributes to 20% of global mortality1,2,3,4. Systemic inflammation is classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, often termed as ‘cytokine storm', followed by a late immunosuppressive phase5 that renders patients susceptible to secondary infections6. This sustained refractory state of the immune system is associated with high late-onset mortality7,8,9,10. Despite the substantial burden on healthcare systems, unraveling the molecular mechanisms underpinning systemic inflammation-related pathogenicity is extremely difficult, as a result of extensive heterogeneity in terms of inflammation onset time, etiology, site of infection and underlying comorbidities. Mouse models of systemic inflammation are ubiquitously used and valuable, but suffer from important interspecies differences and poorly replicate the human inflammatory response11, thereby limiting translatability12. The human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation13, also known as experimental endotoxemia, is a tightly controlled systemic inflammation model in which healthy volunteers are injected with bacterial LPS intravenously to elicit transient but profound acute hyperinflammation, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase14. In the present study, we combined massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cellular functional assays to characterize the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases after LPS administration in peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes. Our results identified conserved gene expression programs, mainly in monocytes and T cells, during the acute LPS-induced hyperinflammatory phase, early sepsis and COVID-19. In the immunosuppressive phase, we observed a significant impairment of monocyte functionality and maturation accompanied by decreased interferon type I (IFN-I) signaling that could be restored by IFNβ treatment. To study systemic inflammation in humans in vivo, healthy male volunteers (Supplementary Table 1) were intravenously injected with 2 ng kg−1 of LPS (n = 7, age 24 (19–30) years) or placebo (n = 4, age 19 (18–28) years; Fig. The appearance of clinical systemic inflammation symptoms, such as fever and tachycardia (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and a transient profound increase in circulating cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-10, CCL4, CCL3, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, IL-1RN (IL-1ra gene) (Extended Data Fig. 1b) up to 8 h after LPS administration, confirmed the induction of hyperinflammation. Severe monocytopenia was observed at 1 h after LPS administration (Extended Data Fig. 1c), with CD14+CD16− classic monocytes (cMonos) starting to repopulate the blood ~3 h post-LPS and returning to baseline levels (defined as immediately before the LPS challenge) at ~6 h post-LPS16 (Extended Data Fig. Between 6 h and day 7 (d7) after the LPS challenge, cMonos gradually differentiated into CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes (iMonos) and CD14−CD16+ nonclassic monocytes (ncMonos) (Extended Data Fig. 1d)16; however, the abundance of these subsets in blood remained significantly decreased at d7 after the LPS challenge (Fig. a, Schematic representation of the study and sample acquisition in healthy volunteers (n = 11). injected with LPS (2 ng kg−1) at baseline (BL, d0) and d7.

Genes were clustered (C1–C6) based on their behavior across the different time points. The bar plots in f and g are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. The P values were calculated using two-sided, paired Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests. Bulk RNA-seq of blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) showed significant perturbation at 4 h and 8 h post-LPS compared with baseline (1,459 upregulated and 1,222 downregulated genes), which substantially normalized at 24 h post-LPS (Fig. Gene ontology (GO) of upregulated DEGs at 4–8 h post-LPS was mainly attributed to inflammatory response (CXCL8 and IL-6) and IFN type I (IFN-I) signaling pathways (MX1 and IRF7) (Fig. 1e), whereas antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II was the most significant GO term of downregulated genes at 4 h (HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB5) (Fig. As decreased expression of the MHC-I receptor human leukocyte antigen isotype DR (HLA-DR) in CD14+ monocytes indicates the induction of T cell inhibitory, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a correlate of impaired outcomes in patients with sepsis17,18, we co-incubated blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers at baseline and at 4 h post-LPS (n = 6) with naive blood CD3+ T cells obtained from non-LPS-challenged healthy donors (n = 9) in the presence of CD3 and CD28 antibody-coupled beads to induce cytokine production and proliferation through T cell receptor stimulation. Co-incubation with cMonos obtained 4 h post-LPS strongly inhibited IFNγ and TNF secretion (Fig. 1f) and decreased T cell proliferation (Fig. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated a significant downregulation of IFN-I signaling at d7 compared with baseline in CD14+ monocytes (Fig. Nevertheless, very few genes were differentially expressed between these time points and, although the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was lower on d7 compared with baseline, this did not reach statistical significance at the level of individual genes (Extended Data Fig. To functionally investigate the late immunosuppressive phase, LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 7) were intravenously re-challenged with the same dose of LPS at d7. During the 8 h after this second LPS challenge, we observed markedly less pronounced clinical symptoms and TNF, IL-10, CCL4, CCL3, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2 and IL-1RN elevation compared with the same timeframe after the first challenge (Extended Data Fig. Bulk RNA-seq on blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) indicated that almost all DEGs (93.6%) from 4 h post-first LPS challenge showed a less pronounced response at 4 h post-second LPS challenge, with an average 30% decrease in responsiveness (Fig. GO terms associated with chemokine-mediated response and neutrophil activation were suppressed, whereas phagocytosis remained functional 4 h after the second challenge compared with 4 h after the first challenge (Fig. Next, bulk RNA-seq on blood CD14+ monocytes obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) at baseline and at 4, 8, 24 h and d7 post-LPS that were restimulated ex vivo with LPS for 4 h indicated that DEGs could be classified into responsive (FC < 2), semi-suppressed (2 < FC < 3) and suppressed (FC > 3). Approximately 43% of DEGs at 4 h and 17% of DEGs at 8 h were semi-suppressed or suppressed (Fig. The response of CD14+ monocytes at 24 h was similar to that at baseline (6% (semi-)suppressed DEGs), whereas 12% of DEGs on d7 were semi-suppressed or suppressed compared with baseline (Fig. Stimulation of blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 7) at baseline and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS administration with various pathogen-associated molecular patterns Pam3Cys, poly(inosinic:cytidylic acid) (poly(I:C)), LPS, flagellin and R848, and heat-killed pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans for 24 h indicated a marked attenuation in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL4, IL-10 and IL-1RN at 4 h post-LPS and a less pronounced attenuation at d7 post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 3e), suggesting broad immunosuppression in response to various triggers, not just LPS. GO analysis indicated that the cytokine production pathway was suppressed in all clusters (Fig. GO terms and individual genes related to the IFN-I signaling pathway were suppressed in LPS-restimulated CD14+ monocytes obtained at d7 (clusters C5 and C6) (Fig. Ex vivo stimulation of blood pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers at baseline and at d7 with LPS for 24 h (n = 3) resulted in loss of iMonos and ncMonos, in contrast to samples cultured without LPS, which retained iMonos (Extended Data Fig. Blood cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS administration that were ex vivo stimulated with LPS exhibited significantly reduced expression of the IFN-induced protein BST2 compared with LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at baseline (Extended Data Fig. The substantially attenuated in vivo and ex vivo monocyte responses at d7 suggested immunological rewiring in monocytes. To determine the acute hyperinflammatory and late immunosuppressive phase changes in the transcriptomic profiles of bone marrow-residing mononuclear cells in LPS-challenged volunteers, bone marrow aspirated from the posterior iliac crest and peripheral blood samples were obtained at baseline (bone marrow, 7 d before the LPS challenge; blood, immediately before the LPS challenge) and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS challenge (n = 3), and scRNA-seq was performed using the 10x Genomics platform. After quality control and in silico removal of potential doublets, we obtained the transcriptomic profile of 116,183 cells across the 3 time points and 2 compartments (Supplementary Table 4). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)19 embedding identified mononuclear cells (Fig. 4a), with relatively similar proportions of each cell type between donors (Extended Data Fig. a, UMAP representation of all single cells obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3 for each compartment at BL: bone marrow, 7 d before the LPS challenge; blood, immediately before the LPS challenge) and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS challenge, colored based on cell type. b, UMAP of all blood and bone marrow cells (n = 3) as in a, colored based on acquisition time point (top) and collected compartment (bottom). c, UMAP of blood and bone marrow HSCs and myeloid lineage cells at BL and 4 h (n = 3) as in a, colored based on cell type. e, Heatmap representation of pro-monocyte and mature monocyte genes in myeloid cells from the bone marrow and blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3) at BL and 4 h. f, NMF-inferred gene program enriched in blood and bone marrow infMonos from bone marrow and blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3) as in d. g, UMAP of blood and bone marrow T and NK cells at BL and 4 h (n = 3) as in a, colored based on cell type. i, NMF-inferred gene program enriched in Tinf cells from bone marrow and blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3) as in h. j, Normalized expression profile of several IFN pathway genes in blood and bone marrow HSCs and myeloid lineage cells, T cells and NK cells, and B cells and pDCs of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers at BL and 4 h (n = 3). Subclustering and batch correction of the HSCs and myeloid cells cluster revealed a strong displacement of the entire lineage at 4 h compared with baseline, with a prominent emergence of CD163+SLC39A+CALR+ monocyte-like cells (infMonos) at 4 h at the expense of cMonos present as baseline (Fig. Expression of pro-monocyte signature genes, such as RETN and ALOX5AP, was increased in the infMono cluster, whereas expression of mature monocyte markers such as MHC-II genes was reduced (Fig. The enrichment of the pro-monocyte signature was accompanied by an increased proportion of RETN+ pro-monocytes at 4 h (Extended Data Fig. 4f), indicating the emergence of newly generated immature monocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood at 4 h post-LPS. The gene expression profile of bone marrow and blood LYZ+ monocytes showed a high degree of similarity at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b), although blood monocytes had a slightly higher expression of mature monocyte genes, such as HLA-DRB5 and CLEC12A (Extended Data Fig. RETN+ pro-monocytes were the most abundant subset in the bone marrow at baseline, whereas cMonos, iMonos and ncMonos were more abundant in blood at this time point (Extended Data Fig. DEGs at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline were consistent between bone marrow and blood monocytes, with nearly all DEGs overlapping and having relatively similar fold-changes (Extended Data Fig. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) identified five main gene sets (DNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation, heat shock response, inflammatory response and myeloid cell differentiation) that were enriched throughout the myeloid lineage (Extended Data Fig. 5f), with heat shock response exhibiting the highest enrichment in all HSCs and myeloid cell types at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. An unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) defined a gene program mainly comprising inflammatory (CD14 and LITAF), heat shock, IFN response (HSPA1A and HSPB1) and immature pro-monocyte genes (RETN) that were specifically enriched in infMonos (Fig. In inflamed mice, granulocyte–monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived monocytes that express elevated levels of neutrophil-associated genes such as MPO and ELANE20 are generated predominantly, at the expense of monocyte–dendritic cell progenitor (MDP)-derived monocytes. Leverage of a public human neutrophil dataset21 (Extended Data Fig. 5i) indicated that neutrophil-enriched genes (for example, MPO and AZU1) were not significantly increased in human LYZ+ monocytes (Extended Data Fig. SsGSEA showed that the IFN-I signaling signature caused the UMAP shift in these subsets at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. NMF defined a gene program (inflammatory T cells (Tinf cells)) that consisted of IFN-I responsive genes (for example, MX1, IRF1 and ISG15) induced in T and NK cells at 4 h (Fig. Highly similar gene expression profiles were detected in bone marrow and blood T and NK cells (Extended Data Fig. Naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood exhibited a stronger response to LPS compared with their bone marrow equivalents (Extended Data Fig. 6g), whereas NK cells demonstrated comparable responsiveness in both compartments (Extended Data Fig. The proportion of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was substantially increased at 4 h relative to baseline in both compartments, whereas the abundance of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells declined (Extended Data Fig. Analysis of the B cell and pDC clusters showed a slight, yet noticeable, LPS-induced response in B cells at 4 h (Extended Data Fig. SsGSEA revealed four major signatures (IFN signaling, cell cycle, protein folding and oxidative phosphorylation) in B cells at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. The IFN-signaling signature was upregulated in inflammatory B cells and pDCs at 4 h post-LPS compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. Together, these observations indicated that LPS-induced specific signature gene programs were induced in monocytes and T cells during the acute hyperinflammatory phase after LPS administration. To assess the clinical relevance of the LPS systemic inflammation challenge model, we analyzed public scRNA-seq datasets from an early bacterial sepsis cohort which consists of blood samples from patients with sepsis (n = 29) and less severe nonseptic bacterial infection (n = 17) obtained within 12 h of presentation to the emergency department and healthy controls (n = 19)22. Furthermore, we analyzed a mixed early COVID-19 or sepsis cohort, which includes blood samples from patients with mild (n = 11) and severe or critical (n = 12) COVID-19, sepsis (n = 13) (all sampled within 7 d of diagnosis) and healthy controls (n = 10)23. The LYZ+ monocyte compartment from these two datasets was selected and embedded using UMAP (Fig. 3a,b) and the infMono gene program was projected on to each cohort (Fig. Enrichment analysis indicated a significant enrichment of the infMono gene program in patients with bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19, who had the highest enrichment scores, as well as in patients with nonseptic bacterial infections, but not in patients with mild COVID-19 (Fig. Conversely, the gene signature induced in the monocytes of patients with sepsis in the early bacterial sepsis cohort22, referred to as MS1, was also enriched in the infMono cluster in our LPS-challenged cohort (Extended Data Fig. 7a), indicating the high similarity of early induced genetic programs in bacterial sepsis and LPS-induced systemic inflammation. We also extracted CD3+ T cells from the early bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 sepsis datasets and embedded them using UMAP (Fig. 3g,h) and projected the inflammatory T cell (Tinf) cell gene program on these datasets (Fig. Enrichment analysis revealed significantly elevated Tinf cell gene program scores across T cells from both datasets, with T cells from patients with COVID-19 exhibiting the highest enrichment (Fig. Thus, the infMono and Tinf cell gene programs induced at 4 h post-LPS are significantly elevated during bacterial and COVID-19 sepsis. c, Enrichment of NMF-inferred infMono gene program in LYZ+ blood monocytes from patients with early sepsis and nonseptic infection and healthy controls as in a. d, Enrichment of the NMF-inferred infMono gene program in LYZ+ blood monocytes from patients with early stage mild and severe COVID-19 and sepsis and healthy controls as in b. e, Box plots of infMono gene program enrichment in LYZ+ blood monocytes from patients with early sepsis and nonseptic infection and healthy controls as in a. f, Box plots of infMono gene program enrichment in LYZ+ blood monocytes from patients with early stage mild and severe COVID-19 and sepsis and healthy controls as in b. g, UMAP representation of CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early sepsis and early nonseptic infection and healthy controls as in a. h, UMAP representation of CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early stage mild and severe COVID-19 and sepsis and healthy controls as in b. i, Enrichment of NMF-inferred Tinf cell gene program in CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early sepsis and early nonseptic infection and healthy controls as in g. j, Enrichment of NMF-inferred Tinf cell gene program in CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early stage mild and severe COVID-19 and sepsis and healthy controls as in h. k, Box plots of the Tinf cell gene program enrichment in CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early sepsis and nonseptic infection and healthy controls as in g. l, Box plots of Tinf cell gene program enrichment in in CD3+ blood T cells from patients with early stage mild and severe COVID-19 and sepsis and healthy controls as in h.

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the sustained immunosuppressive effects at d7 post-LPS challenge, we embedded and visualized all HSCs and myeloid cells from all time points (baseline, 4 h and d7 post-LPS) using UMAP (Fig. Overall, the transcriptome of d7 HSCs and myeloid cells was highly similar to that of baseline HSCs and myeloid cells, with the exception of baseline iMonos and ncMonos (Fig. Differential abundance analysis using neighboring graphs indicated a significant loss of iMonos and ncMonos at d7 compared with baseline (Fig. NMF identified two major programs highly active in iMonos and ncMonos (Fig. One comprised genes expressed solely by ncMonos, such as FCGR3A and CDKN1C, whereas the other comprised IFN-I-responsive genes, such as IRF7 and MX1 (Fig. The average expression per cell for genes associated with the ncMono and IFN-I programs was not significantly altered in LYZ+ monocytes, but the abundance of cells expressing these two programs was significantly reduced at 7 d compared with baseline (Fig. a, UMAP representation of HSCs and myeloid lineage cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3 for each compartment) at BL (bone marrow, 7 d before the LPS challenge; blood, immediately before the LPS challenge) and at 4 h and d7 post-LPS challenge, colored based on cell type. b, UMAP of all blood and bone marrow cells (n = 3) as in a, colored based on compartment. c, UMAP of all blood and bone marrow cells (n = 3) as in a, colored based on time point. d, Nearest neighbor graph-based, differential abundance analysis between BL and d7 of HSCs and myeloid cells from bone marrow and blood of LPS-challenged healthy volunteers (n = 3 for each compartment).

All patients had prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays and unresolved organ dysfunction24. 5a) and nearest neighbor differential abundance analysis unveiled a significant loss of ncMonos in patients with late sepsis compared with healthy controls (Fig. Genes related to the ncMono and IFN-I gene programs showed minor changes in average gene expression per cell, whereas the abundance of cells that expressed these programs, especially the ncMono program, was significantly reduced in patients with late sepsis compared with healthy controls (Fig. a, Combined (left) and separated (right) UMAP representations of LYZ+ blood monocytes from patients with late-stage sepsis (n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 5), colored based on monocyte subset. b, Nearest neighbor graph-based differential abundance analysis between LYZ+ blood monocytes from healthy participants and patients with late sepsis as in a.

The P values were calculated using unpaired, one-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests. 5e) and nearest neighbor differential abundance analysis showed a significant loss of ncMonos in patients who were convalescing from COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, both in patients who previously suffered mild and severe COVID-19 (Fig. 5f,g), with no significant changes in the average expression per cell of genes related to ncMono and IFN-I gene programs, but rather a reduction in the abundance of cells that expressed these programs (Fig. To test whether IFNβ, a type-I IFN, could reverse LPS-induced immunosuppression, in vitro blood cMonos obtained from healthy donors (n = 8) were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng ml−1 of LPS for 24 h, and restimulated after 6 d with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of various concentration of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1). TNF and IL-6 production by cMonos that had previously been exposed to LPS was significantly reduced compared with cMonos that had not been exposed to LPS (Extended Data Fig. All concentrations of IFNβ restored the production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos that had been previously exposed to LPS, whereas production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos not previously exposed to LPS was less affected (Extended Data Fig. Subsequently, we evaluated whether IFNβ could reverse the impaired cytokine production by monocytes observed at d7 post-in vivo LPS administration. To explore this, blood cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged healthy volunteers at baseline and d7 were stimulated ex vivo with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1) and analyzed at 4 h using RNA-seq (n = 3, 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ only) and at 24 h for TNF and IL-6 production (n = 6), as well as BST expression (n = 3, 250 U ml−1 of IFNβ only). TNF and IL-6 production by cMonos obtained at d7 was significantly reduced compared with production by cMonos obtained at baseline (Fig. All concentrations of IFNβ markedly enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF and IL-6 in cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS (Fig. Analysis of RNA-seq profiles indicated that IFNβ treatment strongly upregulated proinflammatory genes (for example, TNFSF10, IL6, TNF and IL1B) and ISGs (for example, IFI27, ISG15, IRF7 and MX1) in LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at d7 (Fig. Flow cytometry confirmed restoration of IFN-I responses by IFNβ, because the reduced cell surface expression of BST2 on LPS-stimulated cMonos obtained at d7 post-LPS compared with cMonos obtained at baseline was abrogated after IFNβ treatment (Extended Data Fig. a, Box plots of log2(fold-change) in TNF (left) and IL-6 (right) production by cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 6) on BL and d7 who were stimulated with LPS (10 ng ml−1) in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250, 500 U ml−1) for 24 h. b, Comparison of expression of inflammatory and ISGs between cMonos obtained from LPS-challenged volunteers (n = 3) at BL and d7 who were stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100 U ml−1) for 4 h. Data were normalized to the response of BL cMonos. The experiment was repeated in six donors (see d). Bar plots in d are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. The P values were calculated using two-sided, paired Student's t-tests. To investigate whether IFNβ modulated monocyte maturation, blood cMonos obtained from healthy donors (n = 6) were treated with or without 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence or absence of an IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) antibody (IFNAR Ab, 10 μg ml−1) for 3 d. We detected an increased abundance of iMonos in IFNβ-treated cultures compared with untreated cultures, an effect reversed by the IFNAR antibody (Fig. 6c,d), suggesting that additional factors are required for maturation to ncMonos or monocytes do not mature into ncMonos in these in vitro conditions. Culturing of blood pan-monocytes obtained from healthy donors (n = 4), with or without 250 U ml−1 of IFNβ in the presence and absence of IFNAR antibody (10 μg ml−1) for 24 h, resulted in the loss of ncMonos in all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8g), whereas IFNβ treatment significantly increased the expression of BST2 on cMonos and iMonos, compared with untreated cultures, and the IFNAR antibody reversed this effect (Extended Data Fig. In this paper, we have described the dynamic transcriptional and functional landscape of peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes during the acute hyperinflammatory and late immunosuppressive phases induced by LPS administration in healthy volunteers. In the acute hyperinflammatory phase, distinct subsets of monocyte-like cells (CD163+SLC39A8+CALR+ infMonos) and Tinf cells (MX1+IRF1+ISG15+) emerged, a phenomenon also observed in patients with sepsis and COVID-19. The late immunosuppressive phase was characterized by a severely suppressed in vivo cytokine response to a second challenge with the same dose of LPS, ex vivo hyporesponsiveness of monocytes to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, suppressed IFN-I signaling and impaired myelopoiesis resulting in decreased maturation of monocytes toward iMonos and ncMonos. The infMonos that emerged 4 h after LPS administration exhibited upregulated expression of inflammatory genes (for example, CD163, SLC39A8 and CALR) and immature pro-monocyte markers such as RETN, indicative of emergency myelopoiesis. This bears a similarity to the induction of immature MDSCs observed in patients with sepsis22,26. The acute hyperinflammatory phase was also characterized by activation of the IFN-I signaling pathway across multiple cell types, including HSCs, consistent with reports that LPS induces IFNβ and ISG expression27,28. IFN-I induction in murine HSCs can activate HSCs to proliferate and thereby contribute to emergency myelopoiesis, while inducing HSC exhaustion in the long term29,30,31. This immunosuppression is unlikely to be caused by direct exposition of (pro)monocytes to LPS because of the relatively short lifespan of monocytes (~1–2 d)16, their rapid disappearance from the circulation after LPS administration16 and the swift clearance of LPS from the blood (half-life ~30 min)32,33. Therefore, it is plausible that the immunosuppressed monocytes originate from stem or progenitor cells in the bone marrow exposed to systemic inflammation. A significant reduction in the abundance of iMonos and ncMonos was observed in the late immunosuppressive phase, suggesting a maturation impairment. As iMonos and ncMonos were the highest ISG-expressing cells and IFNβ treatment resulted in maturation toward iMonos, our results imply an important role for IFN-I signaling in monocyte maturation. A possible causal link between diminished IFN-I response and impaired myelopoiesis is substantiated by findings in mice deficient for either IFNAR1 or IFNβ that generate significantly less mature monocytes, which express fewer ISGs34,35. The infMono and Tinf cell gene programs identified during the acute phase of LPS-induced systemic inflammation were also significantly induced during the acute hyperinflammatory phase of bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. Furthermore, we detected a significant loss of ncMonos in patients with late-phase sepsis and individuals convalescing from COVID-19, akin to what we observed at d7 after LPS administration. These observations indicate that the LPS-induced systemic inflammation model recapitulated hallmark features of highly heterogeneous clinical complications, such as sepsis, rendering it a suitable in vivo model to both interrogate the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions. The impairment in IFN-I signaling during the late immunosuppressive phase was multifaceted, involving the aforementioned reduction in the number of ncMonos, which were high expressors of IFN-I genes, but also significantly impaired ISG induction in cMonos upon ex vivo restimulation with LPS. This underscores the complexity of immunosuppression in systemic inflammatory conditions and highlights the need for targeted interventions that can both restore monocyte maturation and reactivate IFN-I signaling pathways. IFNβ reversed the immunosuppressed state of monocytes by reinstating the expression of inflammatory genes, ISGs and cytokine production, and induced maturation of cMonos toward iMonos. A limitation of the present study is the use of a male-only study cohort, which limits the ability to apply these findings to female patients. Females make significantly more proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS administration than males36,37. However, despite the sex-based differences in the magnitude of the response, the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to LPS are highly conserved and there are no significant differences in the immune-related pathways enriched in both sexes36, so this model of systemic inflammation can guide future research in more complex disease models or clinical scenarios in both females and males. Overall, our findings highlight a critical role of diminished IFN-I signaling in impaired myelopoiesis and immunosuppression and reveal that IFNβ may represent a promising treatment option to reverse immunosuppression in systemic inflammatory conditions. The LPS-induced systemic inflammation (experimental human endotoxemia) study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Oost-Nederland (ref. Eleven healthy male volunteers were recruited. Smoking, medication use, previous participation in experimental human endotoxemia studies or signs of acute illness within 3 weeks before the start of the study were exclusion criteria. For in vitro experiments, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers after obtaining written informed consent. Blood withdrawal for this purpose was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Oost-Nederland (ref. All study procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, including the latest revisions. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled observational study in which participants were allocated to receive either an intravenous LPS injection (n = 7) or a placebo injection with 0.9% NaCl (n = 4). All LPS-challenged participants received a second LPS challenge on d7 after the first LPS challenge, using identical procedures. Bone marrow and blood were collected at baseline (bone marrow: day −7 compared with first LPS challenge, blood: immediately before the first LPS challenge), 4 h after the first LPS challenge (4 h) and at d7. Bone marrow aspiration from the posterior iliac crest was performed by a skilled physician assistant of the Department of Hematology at Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Bone marrow was collected in a sodium heparin solution (150 IU ml−1, ratio 3:1). Blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Additional blood was collected before and at several time points after the LPS challenges. During LPS or placebo challenge days, all participants underwent the same study procedures, except for administration of either LPS or placebo. An intravenous cannula was placed in an antebrachial vein to administrate fluids and LPS or 0.9% NaCl. 94332B1) or saline (placebo) was administered intravenously and hydration fluid (2.5% glucose/0.45% NaCl) was continued at an infusion rate of 150 ml h−1 for 8 h. During hospitalization (up to 8 h post-LPS administration), the heart rate was monitored using a four-lead electrocardiogram (M50 Monitor, Philips), core temperature was measured at 30-min intervals with a tympanic thermometer (FirstTemp Genius 2, Covidien) and LPS-induced symptoms (headache, nausea, cold shivers and muscle and back pain) were scored using a numerical six-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 5 = worst symptoms experienced ever) with the addition of 3 points in case of vomiting, resulting in a total symptom score ranging from 0 to 28. Blood cell counts were analyzed using a Sysmex XE-5000. For cytokine determination, blood was centrifuged directly after withdrawal (10 min, 2,000g, 4 °C) and plasma was stored at −80 °C until analysis. Concentrations of TNF, IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-10, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and IL-1RN (IL-1RA) were determined in one batch using a simultaneous Luminex assay (Milliplex, Millipore) on a MagPix instrument (Luminex). Blood from LPS-challenged healthy volunteers was phenotyped with antibodies against CD45-Cy5.5 (Beckman Coulter, cat. B46024) on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) at the Department of Hematology of Radboud UMC. Monocyte subtype populations were determined using the gating strategy depicted in Extended Data Fig. Classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−) were isolated from participants taking part in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration, d0) as well as at 4 h and 7 d after in vivo LPS administration. To this aim, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes (STEMCELL Technologies). All samples were kept on ice in between procedures. PBMCs were subsequently depleted from neutrophils and intermediate and nonclassic monocytes using CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hereafter, classic monocytes were positively selected using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were resuspended in culture medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX), and 1 × 105 cells were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells were incubated with culture medium or various stimuli (Pam3Cys (10 µg ml−1; InvivoGen), poly(I:C) (50 µg ml−1; InvivoGen), E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, serotype 055:B5), flagellin (10 µg ml−1, InvivoGen), resiquimod (R848, 0.35 µg ml−1, InvivoGen), heat-killed E. coli (107 per well, ATCC35218), S. aureus (107 per well, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), cat. 25923), P. aeruginosa (107 per well, PA01), C. albicans (106 per well, UC820) and Aspergillus fumigatus (107 per well (with 10% human pooled serum), V05-27)) for 24 h. Hereafter, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The concentrations of TNF, IL-1β, IL-1RN (IL-1RA), IL-6, IL-10 and CCL4 (MIP-1β) in supernatants of ex vivo stimulated cell cultures were determined in one batch using a simultaneous Luminex assay on a MagPix instrument (Luminex). Pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) were isolated from participants (n = 3) in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration d0) as well as at 7 d after in vivo LPS administration. To this end, cryopreserved PBMCs (isolated as described above) were thawed, and monocytes were isolated using a human pan-monocyte isolation kit (negative selection, Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX). Subsequently, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in round-bottomed, poly(propylene) 96-well plates and incubated in the presence and absence of E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1) and/or IFNβ (250 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h, after which samples were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter). PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and CD14+ monocytes were isolated by positive selection using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Unstimulated cells were lysed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored at −80 °C until preparation for bulk RNA-seq analysis (described separately below). For ex vivo stimulation, cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum) and seeded in flat-bottomed, 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well). Cells were left to attach for 1 h, after which culture medium was refreshed and monocytes were (re)stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. After stimulation, monocytes were lysed using TRIzol and stored at −80 °C until preparation for bulk RNA-seq analysis. PBMCs of nine healthy donors were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperatures, with brake) in SepMate-TM-50 tubes. Cells were washed with cold PBS (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, Gibco, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX) and counted on a Sysmex XN-450 (Sysmex Nederland). To obtain a pure lymphocyte fraction, PBMCs were depleted of monocytes using EasySep Human CD14 Positive Selection kit II (STEMCELL Technologies) in a 96-well, non-TC-treated, round-bottomed plate (Corning) in combination with the EasyPlate EasySep Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies). Lymphocytes were counted on a Sysmex XN-450 and brought to a concentration of 1 × 106 ml−1 in PBS for carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling using the CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lymphocytes were labeled with 500 nM CFSE for 5 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation in the dark. After incubation, ice-cold fetal bovine serum (FBS) Xtra (Capricorn Scientific) was added in a 1:1 ratio to quench any remaining dye. After washing, lymphocytes were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640, Dutch modification containing 10% bovine calf serum (BCS, Capricorn Scientific) and counted on a Sysmex XN-450. Lymphocytes were subsequently kept on ice until cryopreserved classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) obtained from participants in the experimental endotoxemia study were thawed. These classic monocytes were obtained from PBMCs isolated at baseline (before LPS administration, 0 h) and at 4 h after in vivo LPS administration, as described above. For co-culture experiments, cells were thawed and washed using pre-warmed (37 °C) complete medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 20% FBS Xtra and 100 µg ml−1 of DNase 1). Monocytes were then resuspended in ice-cold RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, containing 10% BCS and counted on Sysmex XN-450. Subsequently, 5 × 104 CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were cultured in the presence and absence of 1 × 105 monocytes (1:2 lymphocyte:monocyte ratio) in a 96-well, TC-treated, round-bottomed plate (Sarstedt). To activate lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, 5 × 104 CD3/CD28 Dynabeads were added to the wells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and lymphocyte or monocyte co-cultures were left to incubate for 3 d. Thereafter, supernatants were stored at −20 °C for analysis of TNF and IFNγ production using ELISA (R&D Systems), whereas T cell proliferation was analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter) after staining of cells with a mouse anti-human CD3-PeC7 antibody (Beckman Coulter). Classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) of eight healthy donors were isolated as described above. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX), and 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in flat-bottomed, 96-well plates. Cells were left to attach for 1 h, after which culture medium was refreshed with culture medium supplemented with 10% human serum. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 1 ng ml−1 of LPS. After 24 h, cells were washed with warm PBS. Thereafter, cells were incubated with culture medium supplemented with 10% human serum for 5 d and this culture medium was refreshed on d3. On d6, culture medium was removed and cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence and absence of IFNβ (100, 250 and 500 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h. Afterwards, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until determination of TNF and IL-6 using ELISA (R&D Systems). Cryopreserved classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−, isolated as described above) obtained from participants in the experimental endotoxemia study at baseline (before LPS administration, d0) and 7 d after in vivo LPS administration were thawed, washed (see above) and resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum). Subsequently, 3 × 105 monocytes were stimulated with 10 ng ml−1 of LPS in the presence or absence of IFNβ (100, 250 and 500 U ml−1) for 4 and 24 h in a 96-well, TC-treated, flat-bottomed plate. After 4 h, cells were stored in RLT buffer containing 40 mM dithiothreitol (QIAGEN) for future RNA isolation and, after 24 h, supernatants were stored at −80 °C until determination of TNF and IL-6 using ELISA. Maturation experiments: classic monocytes (CD14+CD16−) of six healthy donors were isolated as described above. Monocytes were subsequently incubated in RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 50% human serum for 30 min on ice to block unwanted antibody FC receptor binding. Thereafter, 2.5 × 105 monocytes were incubated for 1 h in 5-ml Falcon, poly(propylene), round-bottomed tubes (Corning) with culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 10% human serum) in the presence or absence of 10 µg ml−1 of mouse anti-human IFNα/-β receptor chain 2 antibody (Merck Life Science). Next, 100 U ml−1 of IFNβ (R&D Systems) or culture medium was added and cells were incubated for 3 d, after which they were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter). Responsiveness to IFNβ across subsets: pan-monocytes (containing all subsets) of four healthy donors were isolated as described above. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640, Dutch modification, supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 of gentamicin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX and and 50% human serum) was added for 30 min on ice to block unwanted antibody FC receptor binding. Subsequently, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in round-bottomed, poly(propylene), 96-well plates and incubated in the presence and absence of 10 µg ml−1 of mouse anti-human IFNα/-β receptor chain 2 antibody for 1 h. Subsequently cells were incubated with or without of E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, serotype 055:B5) and IFNβ (100 U ml−1, R&D Systems) for 24 h, after which samples were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry. The flow cytometry antibodies used are described above. Total RNA was extracted from monocytes using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN), incorporating on-column DNase I (QIAGEN) DNA digestion. Afterwards, ribosomal RNA was removed using riboZero rRNA removal kit (Illumina). The efficiency of rRNA removal was confirmed using a reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) with primers for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as internal control) and 18S and 28S rRNA. RNA molecules fragmented into ~200-bp fragments by incubating in fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris acetate, 500 mM potassium acetate and 150 mM magnesium acetate, pH 8.2) for 7.5 min at 95 °C. First-strand complementary DNA from fragmented RNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase enzyme (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol and followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. Gene expression libraries were prepared using KAPA HyperPrep kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, synthesized double-stranded cDNA was incubated with end repair and A-tailing buffer and enzyme initially for 30 min at 20 °C and then for 30 min at 65 °C. Library-specific adapters were ligated to tailed DNA molecules using DNA ligase enzyme by incubating for 15 min at 15 °C. Ligation reaction was cleaned up using Agencourt AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter) and subsequently amplified using ten cycles of PCR. Finally, 300-bp fragments were selected using a 2% E-gel selection system (Invitrogen). Size selection was validated with a 2100 BioAnalyzer system (Agilent). Prepared libraries were sequenced utilizing NextSeq 500 machine (Illumina) with a paired-end sequencing setup. Raw RNA-seq reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome and gene expression profiles were quantified using STAR aligner38. Genes with <50 mapped reads on condition average were excluded from the analysis. For each comparison of RNA-seq profiles, gene expression data of corresponding samples was normalized and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the DESeq2 (ref. To infer significantly enriched gene ontologies (GOs) for identified gene sets of interest, such as DEGs, we used the clusterProfiler40 analysis package. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the comparison of d0 and d7 monocyte gene expression profiles was done using the fgsea41 package. For scRNA-seq, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples using Ficoll-based density gradient separation (1,200g, 10 min, room temperature, with brake) in SepMate-50 tubes, as described above, and cryopreserved at −80 °C until further processing. No depletion or selection of a specific myeloid MNC was performed and the profiling was unbiased. Single Cell Gene Expression 3ʹ v.3 (10x Genomics) was utilized following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, approximately 10,000–15,000 single cells were loaded into a channel of chromium chip and the loaded chip was inserted into the chromium controller. After generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsion and reverse transcription of RNA, cDNA amplification, fragmentation and adapter ligation were done. The quality of prepared sequencing libraries was assessed using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Demultiplexing the raw BCL files was done using Cell Ranger mkfastq (v.3.1.0) software and the resulting fastq files were mapped to the human GRCh38 reference genome using Cell Ranger count software with default parameters. The output count matrix was imported to R analysis software and further analyzed using Seurat (v.4.0.4)42. Low-quality cells with mitochondrial percentage >15% or with <200 genes and <40,000 UMI (unique molecular modifier) counts were excluded from the analysis. Cells expressing multi-canonical lineage markers at the same time, such as T and B cell-specific markers, were identified as potential doublets and removed from the analysis. Afterwards, gene expression profiles were normalized to sequencing depth and scaled to 10,000 counts and log(transformed). Cells were embedded on a two-dimensional view using UMAP19 and clustered using the FindClusters function from the Seurat package with a resolution of 1. Cluster- or cell-type-specific marker genes were identified using FindMarkers function from the Seurat package with default parameters. Based on well-known cell-type markers, we annotated each cluster and visualized violin plots of gene expression for several cell-type-specific markers using the stacked_violin function of the scanpy (1.9.1)44 analysis package in Python. For lineage-specific analysis, the same steps were done by initial extract of corresponding lineage cells from the whole bone marrow dataset and further embedding and clustering. Unless specified, all figures were generated using the ggplot2 visualization package and all heatmaps were generated using pheatmap package in R. To perform differential abundance analysis and find out significantly reduced (or induced) populations we used the miloR package45. This package uses the k-nearest neighbor graph base differential abundance analysis, taking into account the metadata from different donors for each condition. In datasets with significantly different cell numbers between conditions, cell numbers were downsampled to the same number. Cells were visualized using the ggplot2 package and rasterized for visualization purposes. To identify signaling pathways responsible for variations observed between cell types and time points, we performed single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) using the VISION46 analysis package. We utilized hallmark, GO and Reactome gene sets from molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)47. After calculation of the enrichment of each gene set for each single cell, to cluster similar gene sets into one meta-gene set we measured Pearson's correlation of different gene sets and clustered highly similar gene sets into one meta-gene set, which we defined as the signature set. To identify the underlying gene program responsible for the generation of infMonos and Tinf cells at the 4 h time point of LPS systemic inflammation experiments, we performed non-negative mature factorization (NMF) using the RunNMF function of STutility48 package with the default parameters obtaining 40 factors per gene programs. Afterwards, highly similar gene programs were clustered together, generating a meta-gene program. The identified meta-gene program highly enriched in infMonos and Tinf cells was visualized using ggplot2. The top genes contributing to each of gene programs are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The same analysis procedure was done to determine gene programs that are highly active in the intermediate and nonclassic monocyte region. Top genes contributing to NCM-enriched and IFN-I gene programs are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile three-dimensional (3D) material platform to explore quantum phenomena and functionalities that emerge from an intricate interplay among magnetism, band structure, and electronic correlations. Here, we report the observation of a nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior and collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM) in V1/3NbS2. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify a commensurate, collinear AFM order formed by intercalated V moments. In the magnetically ordered state, the spontaneous AHE is tenfold greater than expected from empirical scaling with magnetization, and this strongly enhanced AHE arises in the NFL regime that violates the quasiparticle picture. V1/3NbS2 challenges the existing single-particle framework for understanding AHEs based on one-body Berry curvature and highlights the potential of magnetically intercalated TMDs to unveil new electronic functionalities where many-body correlations play a critical role. The interplay between many-body correlations and topology gives rise to new material properties and functionalities, triggering massive interest extending from condensed matter physics to a broad, multidisciplinary spectrum. One versatile material family for this theme is transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)1,2,3. These materials often exhibit strongly correlated states, and their two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures open up new pathways for correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from Mott and heavy-fermion physics to quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Another groundbreaking discovery based on TMDs is the zero-magnetic field fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) engendered by topological flat bands and enhanced electron correlation in moiré heterostructures, a discovery that could produce the next great leap in quantum computing and topological quantum devices10,11,12,13. Stepping from the 2D heterostructures to three-dimensional (3D) materials, the intercalation of transition-metal elements between van der Waals layers of bulk TMD compounds introduces magnetism and electron correlations. This offers an alternative means to tune the carrier density and engineer the band topology in TMD systems, similar to the effects of electrostatic gating applied in moiré heterostructures14,15. The magnetically intercalated TMD family has diverse magnetic structures and electronic properties15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. While the interplay between magnetic ordering and topological band structure is widely investigated, less is known about the possibility of realizing novel electronic properties driven essentially by strongly correlated electrons. Berry curvature—the intrinsic mechanism of AHE—is currently understood within effective single-particle theories of non-interacting electronic bands without considering electron correlations or many-body entanglement26,27. Thus, a realization of AHE emerging in an NFL state that defies Landau's paradigm and does not have well-defined quasiparticles may incentivize the establishment of a new framework to explain Berry-curvature-driven phenomena in strongly correlated quantum phases. Our focus here is V1/3NbS2, which comprises magnetic V ions intercalated between parent NbS2 layers (Fig. The shifted stacking between the two neighboring V planes breaks inversion and mirror symmetries, resulting in a non-centrosymmetric chiral structure (space group: P6322) (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). The combination of structural chirality and magnetism is known as a feasible pathway toward novel electrical transport phenomena. Band filling by 3d electrons of the intercalated V is predicted to modify the electronic band structure of the parent NbS2 dramatically, with the potential of realizing topological semimetal states14. Moreover, the band structure obtained by density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT) features nearly flat bands with a substantial density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, attributed to Kondo hybridization between V-3d and Nb-4d orbitals (Fig. Thus, V1/3NbS2 offers unique opportunities to engineer exotic quantum phases through the mixing of spontaneous symmetry breaking, electron correlation, and non-trivial band topology. a Schematics of the crystal structure depicting V, Nb, and S atoms with red, blue, and yellow balls, respectively. A unit cell (solid lines) contains two V layers. The magnetic moments of V (red arrows) form the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order; they are ferromagnetically ordered within the layer and antiferromagnetically stacked along the [0001] direction. b Six domain configurations of the Γ6 collinear AFM state, α+, β+, γ+,α−, β−, γ−. The x, y, and z directions, respectively, refer to the real-space crystal directions \([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\), \([01\bar{1}0]\), and [0001]. d The density of states (DOS) per unit cell. e The up-spin and down-spin DOS at a V site. Among the candidate AFM structures for V1/3NbS2, the collinear AFM is particularly intriguing20,21. Large zero-field AHE has been established in noncollinear and noncoplanar AFMs, presenting compelling new opportunities for ultrafast non-volatile information storage17,18,19,28,29,30,31,32,33. Widening the landscape of such functional AFM orders may yield broad scientific and technological impacts. Collinear AFM structures exhibiting sizable spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses (i.e., zero-field AHE), termed altermagnets34,35, have recently attracted immense interest, yet their physical realization remains elusive. Recent studies on candidate altermagnets, such as MnTe and Mn5Si3, have identified zero-field AHE36,37. However, these observations have been limited to thin films, which hampers experimental determination of the microscopic magnetic structure and crystal structure. In this work, we combine high-quality single-crystal synthesis with neutron and X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical transport measurements to demonstrate that the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 displays enhanced zero-field AHE. This constitutes the first experimental evidence for the anomalous Hall effect in a collinear antiferromagnet. We shall first determine the magnetic structure of our V1/3NbS2 crystals through single-crystal magnetization and neutron diffraction measurements. We use a right-handed coordinate system with axes x, y, and z to respectively represent the \([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\), \([01\bar{1}0]\), and [0001] real-space directions of the hexagonal V1/3NbS2 indicated through Miller-Bravais indices. Following Ashcroft and Mermin, we use square brackets for real space and rounded brackets for reciprocal space. The set of three symmetry-related x and y directions are labeled as 〈x〉 and 〈y〉, respectively. The magnetization M measured in a small field rises abruptly upon cooling below 50 K (Fig. 6), marking a transition to AFM order with a Néel temperature TN  =  50(1) K. Further cooling reveals anisotropic magnetic properties with small ferromagnetic (FM) components arising both in the xy plane and along the z-axis: While the out-of-plane M forms a plateau between about 10 K and 40 K and develops a weak upturn below about 10 K, the in-plane M decreases with T after reaching a 30 K maximum (Fig. Magnetization isotherms M(B) measured at 2 K show a spontaneous moment of about 0.01μB/V with finite coercivity for B∥z (Fig. 2b) and about 0.04μB/V without coercivity for B⊥z (Supplementary Fig. These weak ferromagnetic moments are less than 1% of the V3+ moment size (Methods) and may correspond to sample-averaged spin canting of less than 1∘ relative to a predominantly collinear AFM order. The M-T curves differ from those reported in a previous single-crystal neutron diffraction study21. There are also considerable differences between previously published magnetization data20,21,38 indicating differences in V composition and disorder. To facilitate interpretation here we report magnetic, electrical transport, specific heat, and neutron diffraction measurements on the same crystal. This crystal has near-perfect stoichiometry and exhibits the ideal ABAB stacking of V without the ABC-type stacking fault, as discussed in the “Methods” section, Supplementary Note 8, and Supplementary Fig. a Temperature dependence of the magnetization M of V1/3NbS2 measured for B =  0.1 T applied along the x (\([2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]\)), y (\([01\bar{1}0]\)) and z ([0001]) directions, respectively. Data obtained under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) protocols are shown using solid and open symbols, respectively. b Isothermal magnetization M loop measured at select temperatures by sweeping the magnetic field between B  =  ±7 T aligned along the z-direction. Inset: zoomed plot showing the hysteresis loop in M that develops at low T. c Magnetic Bragg peak at Q  =  (0001). The change in line shape reflects hysteretic changes in the magnetic domain size ξ along y under up- and down-sweeps of B∥x measured at 2 K. Relative to the zero field and 8 T state, ξ is strongly reduced upon raising the field from zero to 4 T. d Peak intensity of the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak as a function of temperature. The solid line in the main panel is a fit to the power-law form \(I \sim {({T}_{{{{\rm{N}}}}}-T)}^{2\beta }+{I}_{0}\), where β is the critical exponent, and I0 is the background intensity above TN. This fit yields β =  0.363(2), TN  =  50.1(1) K, and I0  = 247(5) counts per 1500 monitor counts. Inset: a log-log plot of the magnetic peak intensity vs. the reduced temperature (TN  − T)/TN. Error bars in all neutron scattering figures represent one standard deviation. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify an exclusively magnetic Bragg peak that appears at Q  =  (0001) upon cooling below TN  =  50.1(1) K (Fig. The temperature dependence of the peak intensity follows an order-parameter-like form (Fig. Temperature-dependent Bragg scattering is also detected at Q  =  (0003) but with weaker intensity (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with the V3+ magnetic form factor. The \((11\bar{2}\ell )\) (0  <  ℓ  <  1) scan at T  =  2 K shows no extra magnetic Bragg scattering at low T (Supplementary Fig. Based on the polarization factor for unpolarized neutron diffraction, this sets an upper limit of 0.1μB/V on the ordered z-axis moment in our sample. Thus, we can rule out the possibility of the Q = (000\(\frac{1}{3}\)) noncoplanar spin configuration reported in ref. The structure factor for a series of magnetic Bragg peaks in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) and \((hh\overline{2h}\ell )\) reciprocal lattice planes is best accounted for by the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR), that describes an antiferromagnetic stacking of ferromagnetic vanadium layers (Supplementary Fig. Refinement against the Γ6 structure yields a V moment of 1.7(1) μB/V, which is comparable with the moment size of 1.5(1) μB/V reported in ref. 20 and is consistent with the expected moment size gS  =  2μB with effective spin S  =  1 and g  =  2. The local easy axis of the collinear AFM structure is identified as \(\langle 2\bar{1}\bar{1}0\rangle\) through the field dependence of the \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) magnetic Bragg peak intensity under a magnetic field applied along the perpendicular \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) (〈x〉) direction (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. To detect a potential change in the antiferromagnetic structure associated with the weak upturn in out-of-plane M for T <  10 K (Fig. 2a), we first note that there is no anomaly in the temperature-dependent intensity of the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Fig. This shows the domain averaged in plane staggered magnetization does not change at 10 K. For sensitivity to the in-plane AFM domain distribution, we turn to the \((10\bar{1}0)\) Bragg peak. 5g, h shows there is no change in the field dependence of the \((10\bar{1}0)\) intensity around T  =  10 K. This precludes a substantial change in the magnetic structure or its easy axis at 10 K. Thus, our neutron diffraction experiments show that the Γ6 collinear AFM structure with a staggered moment lying along 〈x〉 is retained as the sample-averaged magnetic structure down to at least 2 K. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the specific heat, C(T), exhibits no noticeable anomaly around 10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. These findings exclude the possibility of a magnetic phase transition into a noncoplanar AFM order below 10 K. Because an out-of-plane uncompensated FM moment does not break symmetry elements of the Γ6 collinear AFM configuration (Supplementary Note 5), it must emerge concurrently with the collinear AFM order in a single phase transition, albeit potentially with a very small magnitude as indeed observed (Supplementary Note 6). However, the in-plane FM component associated with the enhanced in-plane M for T  <  50 K is incompatible with the symmetry properties of the prevailing AFM order and is likely associated with stacking faults, as detailed in the discussion section below. Though the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 state has a vanishingly small M, it hosts a sizable spontaneous (zero-field) Hall effect. Figure 3a shows the Hall resistivity ρxy measured for B∥z. The spontaneous component of ρxy(B  =  0) appears below 10 K and grows upon cooling, reaching  ≈ 0.1 μΩcm with a clear field coercivity of  ≈200 Oe at 2 K. For T  >  10 K, the spontaneous Hall effect vanishes, and ρxy shows nearly linear field dependence without hysteresis. Correspondingly, a spontaneous Hall conductivity σxy(B  =  0) ≈  ρxy/(ρxxρyy) only appears below 10 K, where it rises to approximately 3Ω−1cm−1 at 2 K (Fig. a Field dependence of the Hall resistivity, ρxy, obtained at various temperatures under a magnetic field B∥z for the V1/3NbS2 single-crystal exhibiting the ideal ABAB stacking. b Temperature dependence of the zero-field Hall conductivities, σxy(B  =  0) (red circles; left-axis) and σyz(B  =  0) (blue circles; right-axis), obtained under B∥z and B∥x, respectively. Inset: The Hall resistivity ρzy obtained at T  = 32 K with B∥x and I∥y. Error bars represent uncertainties in measured data. The Hall conductivity σxy(B = 0) of V1/3NbS2 (solid red circles) deviates greatly from the linear scaling for conventional ferromagnets (blue-shaded region), constituting the unconventional regime (red-shaded regime) associated with known Weyl magnets. In contrast, σyz(B  =  0) for V1/3NbS2 (half-filled red circles) is linearly related to the in-plane M as in ordinary ferromagnetic materials28,29. In ordinary ferromagnets, the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σH is proportional to M, and the ratio SH  =  σH/M is of order (0.01–0.1) V−1, constituting the conventional regime (blue shaded region in Fig. In contrast, the observed Hall conductivity σxy in V1/3NbS2, when compared to its tiny net ferromagnetic moment of  ~0.01μB/V leads to SH  ~  1 V−1 for T ≤ 10 K (solid red circles in Fig. 3c), which is well beyond the linear relation for conventional ferromagnets. Instead, the AHE in V1/3NbS2 falls in the same regime as topological magnetic materials such as the Weyl magnets Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge)28,29, Co3Sn2S239, and Co2MnGa40 (red shaded region in Fig. Note that the net magnetization, μ0M <  10−3 T, in V1/3NbS2 is about one-tenth of the value found in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals Mn3X (X  = Sn, Ge), and just 1% of that in the ferromagnetic Weyl magnet Co3Sn2S2. The deviation from the conventional scaling relation indicates that an order parameter other than the net magnetization (i.e., cluster multipoles as discussed below) characterizes the symmetry-breaking mechanism in the AFM state, and there exists a significant contribution to the Berry curvature that is independent of the net magnetization32. Moreover, with such deviation recognized as a universal signature in topological magnets32, we anticipate that the out-of-plane spontaneous AHE in V1/3NbS2 might arise from topologically non-trivial band features, though further confirmation through spectroscopic probes is required for a firm conclusion41,42,43. The in-plane spontaneous AHE, ρzy(B =  0), differs qualitatively from the out-of-plane AHE ρxy(B  =  0) in two aspects: (1) ρzy(B  =  0) peaks near 30 K and then decreases toward zero around 10 K (Fig. 3b); (2) the corresponding zero-field Hall conductivity σyz  ≈  −ρyz/(ρyyρzz) is an order of magnitude smaller than σxy(B  =  0) and lies within the regime for ordinary ferromagnets in the scaling plot for the anomalous Hall conductivity ∣σH∣ vs. M (Fig. Thus, the AHE ρzy(B  =  0) can be understood as driven by the in-plane FM component within the conventional scheme. Another striking observation in V1/3NbS2 is the emergence of pronounced NFL resistivity within the same temperature regime (T  ≲  10 K) as the disproportionately large spontaneous AHE. The zero-field longitudinal resistivity ρ (Fig. 4a) is T-linear in the paramagnetic phase between 350 K and TN. It then drops sharply for temperatures below TN, which we ascribe to a reduction in magnetic scattering. On further cooling, ρ(T) once again exhibits linear T-dependence for T  ≲  10 K (Fig. 4a, c) before settling into a T1.6(1) behavior below about 1 K for B  ≲ 1 T (Fig. a The zero-field resistivity ρ(T). The downward arrow denotes the Néel temperature TN  = 50(1) K. The two solid lines represent linear fits in two T regimes: TN  ≲  T  ≲  350 K and T  ≲  10 K, where T* (upward arrow) marks the upper limit of the low-T linear behavior. The dashed line and the downward arrow denote TN and T*, respectively. b Temperature vs. field (T  − B) phase diagram showing the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) regimes with ρ(T)  ~  T (orange) and ρ(T)  ~  T1.6 (red), and the field-induced Fermi liquid (FL) state (blue).

The zero-field electronic specific heat coefficient exhibits a logarithmic increase Cel(T)/T  ~ log(T*/T) below 1.3 K, which overlaps with the onset of ρ(T) ∝  T1.6(1) (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. As shown in the temperature-field (T - B) phase diagram (Fig. 4b), the NFL regime characterized by T-linear resistivity extends from approximately 10 K to 2 K within the AFM phase. The T-linear resistivity above 2 K persists for B∥z up to 8 T (Fig. 4b, c), with its onset temperature shifting to higher values with increasing B. In contrast, the T1.6(1) NFL phase below  ~1 K is replaced by a FL with T2 resistivity for B  ≳  2 T (Fig. In the field-induced FL phase, the coefficient A characterizing the T2 resistivity ρ =  AT2 increases by a factor of five with decreasing B and appears to diverge near  ~1.5 T, as indicated by the linear field dependence of 1/A  ~  ∣B  −  Bc∣, with Bc  =  1.2(2) T (Fig. Since A measures the quasi-particle effective mass m*, the divergence of A near Bc marks a quasi-particle breakdown. The NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 recalls observations in correlated quantum materials, ranging from high-temperature superconductors, heavy fermions, to twisted bilayer systems2,9,44,45,46,47,48,49. A generic feature of these materials is the T-linear resistivity governed by a universal transport scattering rate 1/τ that obeys the Planckian limit: ℏ/τ  =  αkBT, where ℏ and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively45,46,47,48,50. Following the procedure used in refs. 46,47,48, we obtained α  = 0.7  ±  0.2 for V1/3NbS2, which is of order unity as expected for Planckian behavior (Supplementary Note 4). The Debye temperature of V1/3NbS2 is as high as  ~380 K21, and the phonon contribution to the specific heat is negligible below  ~10 K (Methods, Supplementary Note 3, and Supplementary Fig. Thus, the observed T-linear resistivity at low temperatures cannot be attributed to conventional electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. We can also rule out extrinsic factors, such as impurity phases and chemical inhomogeneity, as the cause of the observed NFL based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction and chemical composition analysis (Methods and Supplementary Note 8). On the other hand, two unique aspects of the NFL behavior in V1/3NbS2 stand out: (i) Unlike typical quantum critical systems where the NFL behavior emerges at the margin of an ordered phase, the NFL regime in V1/3NbS2 occurs well within the AFM order without tuning (i.e., zero field and ambient pressure)51,52; (ii) The low-temperature T-linear resistivity covers a broad B range with the monotonically increasing onset temperature up to 8 T (Fig. This seems to defy straightforward explanation based on proximity to a magnetic-field-tuned QCP, for which the NFL behavior is typically confined near a critical field44,45. The symmetry properties of the underlying AFM spin texture provide an essential basis for understanding the emergence of magnetization-free spontaneous AHE. The collinear AFM state in V1/3NbS2 can be viewed as a ferroic order of cluster dotriacontapoles that belongs to the Γ6 irreducible representation (IR) (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. The two possible spin configurations Γ6(1) and Γ6(2) shown in Supplementary Fig. 10(a) are symmetrically distinct: Γ6(1) forces the spontaneous anomalous Hall conductivity σxy to be zero, whereas Γ6(2) allows out-of-plane spin canting and finite σxy. With the staggered moment lying along the x-axis, the observed AFM order corresponds to the Γ6(2) configuration at zero field, which breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and can exhibit a finite spontaneous AHE even with vanishing net magnetization (Supplementary Note 6). The presence of magnetic domains is evident from the hysteric behavior observed in ρxy(B) (Fig. 3a) and in the field dependence of rocking scans through the (0001) magnetic Bragg peak (Supplementary Fig. An out-of-plane magnetic field B∥z can shift the balance between  + and  − domain populations (Supplementary Note 6). This effect may result in a finite spontaneous AHE, σxy(B  =  0), which aligns with the experimental observation for T  ≲ 10 K (Fig. Aside from the unique characteristics of the collinear AFM order, our experimental findings, in combination with the DFT+DMFT calculation (Method, Supplementary Note 7), suggest that electronic correlation effects play a role in generating the novel electronic state at zero fields. The NFL behavior and signature of quasi-particle breakdown near zero fields are reminiscent of the strange metal state observed in various classes of strongly correlated materials. On the theoretical front, the DFT band structure features narrow V-3dt2g bands hybridizing with Nb-4d bands near the Fermi level EF (Supplementary Fig. Taking into account the electronic interactions between V-3dt2g orbitals within the DMFT, we obtain an itinerant AFM with the local magnetic moments of approximately 1.3μB at TN  ≈  50 K, comparable to the experimental staggered moment of 1.7(1)μB observed at T  = 2 K. With increasing on-site interaction U, the DFT+DMFT calculations predict that the ground state of V1/3NbS2 can be tuned through a quantum phase transition (QPT) separating the itinerant AFM and a correlated metallic paramagnet (PM); the latter hosts heavy quasiparticles with a significant mass enhancement factor of 50– 100 due to Kondo hybridization between the V-3d and Nb-4d electrons. The low-T specific heat data above the  ~log(1/T) upturn yields a large value of the electronic specific heat coefficient γ  =  40.6(3) mJmole−1K−2, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the DFT value of 0.14 mJmole−1K−2. By assessing γ under detailed tuning of the interaction parameters, we find that the experimentally observed mass enhancement can be reproduced only when the AFM ground state lies near the AFM-PM QPT. Thus, the experiment-theory comparison suggests that the zero-field AHE appears in a setting where correlated effects and quantum fluctuations play prominent roles. An effective non-thermal tuning parameter for accessing this anticipated QPT remains to be identified, with disorder strength being a plausible candidate. Below, we elaborate further on the nature and role of disorder in V1/3NbS2. Two of our experimental observations defy symmetry-based expectations for a single macroscopic domain of AFM order: (i) The small yet finite in-plane ferromagnetic moment observed in Mx(B)(B  =  0) and the resulting spontaneous Hall signal σyz(B  =  0) (Figs. 2a) are incompatible with the symmetry of bulk Γ6 AFM order (Supplementary Note 6, and Supplementary Fig. 10); (ii) The out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) becomes finite at approximately 10 K (Fig. 3a) where there is no peak in the specific heat nor a thermal anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic Bragg diffraction to indicate a thermodynamic phase transition (Supplementary Fig. This suggests that structural disorder plays a role. Refinement of a structural model of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data reveals  ~85% V occupancy on the 2d site and  ~15% V occupancy on the 2b site (Methods, Supplementary Note 5, and Supplementary Tables 1, 2). In an intercalated layered structure such as V1/3NbS2, occupational disorder typically takes the form of planar stacking faults; defect V layers interspersed within the prevailing ABAB stacking pattern. Planar defects can strongly impact Hall and magnetization measurements, which rely on macroscopic coherence. In analogy to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in multilayer magnetic thin films54, the localized DMI associated with a planar defect can introduce a local twist or phase slip in the otherwise collinear Γ6 AFM order. A low density of planar stacking faults thus might induce the unexpected Mx(B)(B  =  0) and σyz(B  = 0) (Fig. 2a) and suppress Mz and the out-of-plane spontaneous Hall signal σxy(B  =  0) (Fig. We thus hypothesize that the 10 K temperature scale is associated with a planar defect-induced crossover in domain wall dynamics of an otherwise collinear AFM. We next discuss the possible physical origin of the low-T NFL behavior. Inside an AFM phase, spin fluctuations typically cannot give rise to divergence in self-energy required for quantum criticality. Another relatively underexplored mechanism for NFL behavior is related to chiral spin texture with non-trivial topologies, such as a skyrmion lattice underlying the pressure-induced NFL behavior in MnSi55. The broad crossover around 1.3 K in ρ(T) of V1/3NbS2 and the subsequent power-law behavior ρ(T)  ∝  T1.6(1) aligns well with the MnSi case55. However, the spontaneous AHE occurring in the same T regime requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, a condition not fulfilled by magnetic skyrmion bubbles. Thus, the concurrent NFL and spontaneous AHE suggest the possibility that the aforementioned AFM domain walls represent a new type of topological nano-magnetic entity. The AFM domain structure and domain wall dynamics are expected to be sensitive to variations in the stacking order. Thus, if one can manipulate the type and strength of the V disorder, V1/3NbS2 may hold the potential to serve as a physical example demonstrating the controlled disorder-tuning of strange-metal behavior and Planckian transport, as recently proposed in ref. In summary, we identify a substantial zero-field AHE in a collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 with vanishingly small magnetization. This observation suggests that 3d band filling by V intercalants could lead to topological band features, for which spectroscopic evidence is worth pursuing. Most remarkably, this spontaneous Hall signal co-occurs with pronounced NFL behavior that defies a conventional quasi-particle description. Strong correlation effects play a vital role in the emergence of zero-field AHE inside the NFL phase, the description of which goes beyond the widely-used free fermion Berry-curvature framework. These findings showcase a promising outlook for magnetically intercalated TMDs to realize exotic electronic states characterized by a rich interplay of many-body correlations, band topology, and magnetism. Structural disorders are known to substantially influence the intrinsic quantum phases and properties of intercalated TMDs. Anticipating improved understanding and control of disorder-related effects, the unusual electronic states found in the collinear AFM state of V1/3NbS2 could lead to electronic and spintronic functionalities that extend beyond current paradigms. We first obtained polycrystalline samples by heating stoichiometric amounts of high-purity vanadium (Rare metallic, 99.999%), niobium (Rare metallic 99.999%), and sulfur (Rare metallic 99.9995%) in an evacuated silica ampoule at 1000 ∘C for 24 h. This heating process was done stepwise in a controlled manner before naturally cooling the material to room temperature. We then mixed 2 g of polycrystalline powder with 0.1 g of iodine in an evacuated silica tube (20 mm inner diameter, 15 cm length). Next, this ampule was loaded in a three-zone furnace in which the hot and cold zones were kept at 1000 ∘C and 800 ∘C, respectively, for 7 days. This resulted in several plate-like and well-faceted V1/3NbS2 crystals (maximum size  ~3 mm ×  ~2 mm) at the cold zone side of the ampoule. We determined the chemical composition of the V1/3NbS2 crystals using electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) JXA-iSP100 (JEOL). The measurements provide an average atomic percentage ratio of V:Nb:S = 9.97: 29.80: 60.23, which corresponds to a composition of V1.004Nb3S6.06. The structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data were collected on a single crystal of 0.16  ×  0.15  ×  0.02 (mm)3 on a Bruker Kappa D8 Quest diffractometer equipped with an IμS microfocus source (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å), a HELIOS optics monochromator, and a Photon II CPAD detector. The Bruker SAINT program was used to integrate the diffraction data. Scaling and multi-scan absorption corrections were performed using SADABS. The crystal structure of V1.00Nb3S6 was solved using intrinsic phasing methods in SHELXT56 and anisotropically refined using SHELXL57. All atomic parameters were refined anisotropically. The V content was restrained to 1.00 to match the total amount determined by EPMA. The data collection and refinement parameters are presented in Supplementary Table 1, and the atomic positions are presented in Supplementary Table 2. We further investigated the local crystal structure of the V1/3NbS2 samples using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM-2010F instrument operated at 200 kV at the Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP), the University of Tokyo. The specimen was put on a holder that allowed a tilt angle of  ± 30∘ for the TEM observation. Selected area electron diffraction patterns were obtained using an aperture of 10 μm diameter, being ca.125 nm in real space, and recorded using an imaging plate. Specimen for the TEM observation was initially prepared using a JEOL Ion-Slicer, but since it was altered during processing, a powder sample obtained by crushing the single crystal in an agate mortar was used instead. The powder was diffused into a solvent and dropped onto a microgrid together with the solvent to prepare an observation sample for TEM. The TEM results shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 confirm the non-centrosymmetric P6322 space group with (√3 × √3) V ordering at room temperature. The behavior of bulk magnetization reported across existing studies on V1/3NbS2 reveals notable sample dependence20,21. To ensure consistency, we report the magnetic properties of the same crystal used for measuring electrical transport and specific heat, which is stoichiometric to within 1%, as mentioned above, and exhibits ABAB stacking (Supplementary Note 8). The magnetization data shown in Fig. 2a were obtained on oriented samples using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) under both zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions. The ZFC data were obtained by cooling the sample from 300 K to 2 K at zero field. A magnetic field of 0.1 T was then applied, and measurements of the magnetization were conducted while warming the sample to 400 K. Maintaining the B  = 0.1 T magnetic field, the sample was then cooled to base temperature. The FC M(T) data were subsequently acquired while warming the sample to 400 K. To obtain the isothermal magnetization M(H) curves, we first cooled the sample in zero field from T  =  300 K to the target temperatures. We then measured M(H) while scanning the magnetic field between  ±7 T. The magnetic susceptibility measured at a magnetic field B  = 0.1 T exhibits nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures, as shown in Fig. The inverse susceptibility, 1/χ, is linear in the temperature range between 300 K and 400 K, yielding a Curie-Weiss temperature θW = −70(4) K and an effective moment per V atoms μeff  = 2.9(1) μB for both the in-plane and out-of-plane field directions. The negative sign of θW indicates antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state, and the fitting parameter of μeff  = 2.9(1)μB is close to the value of \(g\sqrt{S\cdot (S+1)}{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}=2.83{\mu }_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}\) expected for a V3+ ion with a spin-only local moment where g =  2 and S  =  1. This result is consistent with previous reports21,58. Zero-field specific heat measurements down to 2 K were carried out using a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) through the relaxation method. The corresponding data are shown in Supplementary Fig. The low-T specific heat data shown in Supplementary Fig. 8b were acquired using the quasi-adiabatic method at the International Megagauss Science Laboratory of ISSP. Details of this technique are described in ref. Each data point in the measurement was obtained within a short timescale of  ~5 ms under a 0.1 ms heat pulse, as shown in the inset of Supplementary Fig. The longitudinal and Hall resistivities were measured in six-point geometry. Crystals were polished into bar shapes, with their long edge parallel to the in-plane x and y directions, respectively. Electrical contacts to the crystals were made by attaching 20 μm gold wires with silver epoxy. Measurements in the temperature range of 2 K–400 K were performed using the DC option of the PPMS system (Quantum Design). The resistivity data in the 0.1 K–4 K temperature range were obtained using a dilution refrigerator (Kelvinox 25, Oxford Instruments) and the AC method with an excitation current of 0.1 mA. The Hall contribution to the resistance and vice versa were extracted by subtracting and adding the resistance of positive and negative field scans, respectively. A 20 mg plate-like single crystal with the z-axis perpendicular to the surface was used for neutron diffraction experiments. The sample was mounted on an aluminum sample holder with the [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction (〈x〉-axis) vertical and perpendicular to the horizontal scattering plane of the instrument for observing scattering signals in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane. All measurements were performed with a fixed final neutron energy of 14.7 meV, filtered through 25 mm pyrolytic graphite (PG) before the saggital focusing PG (002) monochromator and an additional 25 mm thick PG filter between the sample and the PG (002) analyzer. To determine the magnetic structure we used open-50'-50'-120' collimation and conducted rocking scans on the accessible magnetic and nuclear Bragg peaks. We inferred the fully Q-integrated intensity of Bragg peaks from rocking scans using Reslib. Specialized software was developed for the subsequent structural refinement to account for the resolution effect. A comparison between the calculated and observed structure factor is shown in Supplementary Fig. The magnetic Bragg peaks detected in the \((h0\bar{h}\ell )\) plane contain contributions from two out of three magnetic domains, which were taken into account in the analysis. The experimental moment size is within 15% of the spin-only value (see main text), confirming the assumption of a uniform distribution of domain size. To investigate the field dependence of the magnetic structure, we conducted rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) and (0001) at the base temperature of 2 K with a magnetic field between 0 and 8 T applied along the vertical [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] direction. To achieve sensitivity to the magnetic correlation length/domain size, we used tight collimation around the sample for these measurements: Open-10'-10'-120'. Rocking scans at \({{{\bf{Q}}}}=(10\bar{1}0)\) are sensitive to the correlation length along the c-axis, which was found to exceed 800 nm for all field values (Supplementary Fig. Rocking scans at Q  =  (0001) are sensitive to the in-plane correlation length along the \([10\bar{1}0]\,\langle y\rangle\)-direction, which shows strong field dependence (Supplementary Fig. The contrast between the in-plane and out-of-plane correlation length indicates the formation of magnetic field tunable domains extending in the z-direction, which survive up to a field of 8 T applied along [\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)0] (〈x〉). This is evident from the hysteresis observed in the field dependence of the y-axis correlation length (Supplementary Fig. In the negative field sweep, the applied field strength was not high enough to fully polarize the magnetic domains. This results in partial polarization, creating a minor loop. To look for changes in the antiferromagnetic structure upon cooling below 10 K where a small c-oriented magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect appears, we examined the temperature and field dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak. These data were acquired using 14.7 meV neutrons on the EIGER triple-axis spectrometer at the Swiss spallation neutron source SINQ, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland. With a field applied along the vertical \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\) direction, there is thus sensitivity to the in-plane domain distribution. Though data marked with blue symbols have lower counting statistics, Supplementary Fig. 5g shows the field dependence of the overall domain fraction is indistinguishable above (blue symbols, 12 K) and below (red symbols, 1.5 K) 10 K. Supplementary Fig. 5h shows the temperature dependence of the Q = (10\(\bar{1}\)0) magnetic Bragg peak intensity in the presence of a 2 T magnetic field along \([\bar{1}2\bar{1}0]\), which disfavors domains with staggered magnetization along that direction. The temperature dependence is indistinguishable from that acquired in zero fields at the (0001) peak, where all domains contribute equally to the scattering. These data show the magnetic structure of V1/3NbS2 is virtually unchanged across 10 K. We propose that the appearance of a zero-field Hall response and remnant magnetization along the c-axis for T  <  10 K results from a subtle change in domain wall dynamics at this temperature. The line shape and integrated intensity of a rocking scan is affected by all components of the resolution function, including the out-of-plane resolution. To account for these effects, we assume an infinite correlation length along the c-axis and adopt the following isotropic form for the in-plane correlation function: The corresponding Bragg peak profile can be obtained analytically by Fourier transformation and the result is isotropic in 2D in-plane q-space: where I0001 is the integrated peak intensity at Q = (0001). The experimental peak profile is obtained via convolution with the resolution function defined as: Here q0 = (q0,z, q0,y, ℏω0, q0,x) is the instrument-targeted energy and wave-vector transfer for each point in the rocking scan passing through Q = (0001). R0001 is the Gaussian resolution function at Q  = (0001). \(U(a,b,z)=1/\Gamma (a)\int_{0}^{+\infty }{e}^{-zt}{t}^{a-1}{(1+t)}^{b-a-1}dt\) refers to the confluent hypergeometric function61. The delta function within the peak profile and condition of rocking scans q0,x  =  0, q0,z ≈ 0 was applied from the first line to the second line of Eq. The qy integrated intensity is thus given by This one dimensional integral can readily be evaluated through numerical integration. To duly account for the field dependent correlation length κ, Iob,0001 was used to convert the measured (0001) rocking scan integrated intensity into a full integrated intensity measure of the total coherent staggered magnetization. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed by the ab initio code OpenMX. The generalized gradient approximations (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) were adopted for the exchange-correlation potential. An 8 × 8 × 4 k-point grid was used for the calculation. We employed the valence orbital sets V6.0-s3p3d2, Nb7.0-s3p2d2, and S7.0-s3p3d2f1, and set a cutoff energy of 150 Ry for the numerical integrations. The Wannier functions of the t2g vanadium orbitals and the \({d}_{{z}^{2}}\), \({d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\), and dxy niobium orbitals were constructed from an outer energy window of [−5 eV: 5 eV]. The dynamical mean-field (DMFT) calculation was performed with the finite-temperature exact diagonalization solver, where the dynamical mean field was represented by six bath sites. We chose a reasonable value of the intra-orbital Coulomb interaction U  =  3 eV and Hund's coupling J  =  0.5 eV for V-t2g orbitals; the inter-orbital Coulomb interaction was determined by \(U{\prime}=U-2J\). For the double-counting correction, we subtracted the self-energy in the high-frequency limit of the paramagnetic solution, which corresponds to a static mean-field value with inter-orbital components. The spectral function was obtained with 10 meV energy smearing. The bulk magnetization and electrical transport data supporting this study's findings are provided in the Source Data file.
