                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. has presented allies with potential plans for peace between Russia and Ukraine that include an end to fighting and rolled-back sanctions on Moscow, according to Bloomberg News. The U.S.' proposals were shared in Paris on Thursday, European Union officials familiar with the situation told Bloomberg. French President Emmanuel Macron talked with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff as part of the Paris talks, according to the news outlet. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security advisors talked with foreign negotiators. Ukrainian areas currently occupied by Russia would stay under the Vladimir Putin-led country's leadership, they said. Russia can see pared back sanctions as part of this proposal, according to Bloomberg. But Bloomberg's report noted that ending restrictions placed on the country from the EU, such as unfreezing immobilized assets, requires approval of all member states. European allies would not recognize Russia-controlled territories of Ukraine as under Moscow's rule, per the source. That official also said that the plan will need to be talked about more with Ukraine. Officials said Russia will need to agree to cease fighting and Ukraine will need security guarantees for a peace plan to be successful. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is moving forward with his promise to slash a top federal consumer watchdog. Over the past decade, the CFPB has filed lawsuits against major companies, including student lenders and banks like Capital One, over accusations of predatory behavior. It has also returned billions of dollars to consumers and introduced new rules to crack down on medical debt and overdraft fees. The notice added that employees will "retain access to work systems" until 6 pm ET on Friday, and that after that deadline, "system access will be discontinued, and you will be placed in an administrative leave status through your official separation date as outlined above." The National Treasury Employees Union wrote in a legal filing on Thursday that Vought sent reduction-in-force notices to "the vast majority of CFPB employees." "As one would expect with a RIF of that size, the plaintiffs have been told that entire offices, including statutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person," the NTEU wrote in the legal filing. These termination notices come just one week after a federal judge ruled on April 11 that the CFPB could move forward with firing some employees deemed unnecessary to carry out the CFPB's "statutory duties." It followed an earlier ruling from a federal judge that froze the CFPB's earlier attempts at terminations, calling them a "hurried effort to dismantle and disable the agency entirely." Business Insider reported on Wednesday that the CFPB laid out new priorities for the agency in an internal memo sent to employees. That included plans to "deprioritize" student-loan oversight, medical debt, consumer data, and digital payments. Elon Musk, DOGE's unofficial leader, has previously said he wanted to "delete" the CFPB entirely, writing "CFPB RIP" in a February post on X. Warren wrote in a statement on Thursday night that "Trump just gutted almost all CFPB staff, so the agency can't do its job of helping Americans who get scammed by big banks and giant corporations." "Dismantling the CFPB in the face of a court order blocking an illegal shutdown is yet another assault on consumers and our democracy by this lawless Administration, and we will fight back with everything we've got," she said. The OMB and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Hilton may be best known as a pop culture icon, but she has big plans to cement her place in the world of business and the future of entertainment. Among her many titles — including "The Simple Life" reality TV star and highest-paid female DJ — Hilton is founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global, next-generation entertainment company that spans albums, TV shows, books and consumer products. "I want to build the next Disney," Hilton, 44, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin at the recent 2025 Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. Among Hilton's more recent projects are a skin-care line, a cooking show on Netflix, an encore "The Simple Life" with Nicole Richie on Peacock, an upcoming true crime podcast, a new animated kids show, and continued appearances in commercials for Sonic and Crocs. "I don't want to be put inside one box." Hilton credited her family for instilling in her a hard-work ethic, one that propelled her great grandfather Conrad Hilton to found Hilton Hotels and his son, Barron, to scale the empire to success. "Business is something that really runs in my blood," she said. "I always wanted to build something on my own. I didn't want to be known as the Hilton Hotel granddaughter. Hilton went on to discuss how the alleged abuse she endured at a Utah boarding school as a teen drove her to seek success. "When I was in there, I just promised myself, 'I'm going to work so hard and become so successful that one day, no one will ever be able to control me or tell me what to do,'" Hilton said at the CNBC event. I always thought success would just make me happy and I would never have to depend on anyone but myself." In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for, aid and protect children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act and played a key role in the passing of 10 state laws reforming residential treatment facilities. "It was so scary," Hilton said of going public with her experience and speaking out against the treatment facilities. "It just made me realize that I could use my voice to help make a difference for so many children," Hilton said. Do you want a new career that's higher-paying, more flexible or fulfilling?

The US attacked a key Yemen oil port controlled by the Houthis overnight and killed dozens of people, according to the Iran-backed militants, raising the specter of a widening conflict in the Middle East.

The assault on the Ras Issa fuel-import terminal appeared to be one of the biggest and deadliest since US President Donald Trump ordered an aerial campaign against the Houthis in mid-March. The strikes have so far failed to stop Houthi maritime assaults in the Red Sea and missile attacks on Israel, causing the American military to consider supporting a ground offensive on the group by Yemeni factions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, backlash against Elon Musk has spurred a Tesla boycott movement, pushing some owners and shareholders to ditch the brand — and, in some cases, leading to vandalism incidents. Business Insider spoke to four Tesla owners about their concerns on ownership amid a growing campaign against the EV giant. While one owner returned his Cybertruck as a precaution for his kids, the other three owners said they don't plan to get rid of their vehicles, despite the rise in anti-Tesla sentiment. The following stories are based on transcribed conversations with Tesla owners. Business Insider has verified their identities and vehicle ownership. Their words have been edited for length and clarity. Ben Baker is a Tesla owner living in Sacramento, California, who sold his Cybertruck. Not too long ago, after the election, somebody keyed my Tesla Model Y, and I was like, "OK, that's no big deal." I live in California, which is a Democratic state, and so I kind of figured that there would be some of that stuff. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal until I went and bought a Cybertruck. My family went in and I took some cool pictures. As I was doing that, three people walked behind me and started looking at me and laughing. Then one of them called me a Nazi. Later on, one of my daughters told me that if I kept the Cybertruck, she was going to get bullied. I started thinking about if one of them is driving the Tesla Cybertruck and someone started vandalizing it. My daughter is young, she's had her license maybe a year. If I could afford to own a Cybertruck myself and then send them to school with another vehicle, then great, it would be on me if it got damaged. And who knows how far these guys will take it. To me, it just wasn't worth seeing my daughter live in fear of the vehicle getting vandalized at their school. I think people should have the right to protest — but they should have the right to protest without destruction. John VonBokel is a 45-year-old Tesla owner living near St. Louis, Missouri. Business Insider has verified his shareholder status. I have appreciated and admired Tesla for some time. I was under the impression that it aligned with my personal beliefs in terms of environment, which also overlaps with my personal political beliefs. The shift has been uncomfortable and difficult. After the election, the stock just started going up, and I couldn't figure out how Elon Musk and Trump being together was beneficial to Tesla — and certainly not to the degree that warranted its market capitalization to nearly double. For me, that meant it was overvalued and I needed to cash out. But I'm under no illusion that selling my shares had any impact on Elon's personal wealth or are somehow a repudiation of his actions. I feel like what Elon Musk is doing politically is negatively impacting the brand and the company. But I'm more interested in protests that are focused on Elon Musk and Donald Trump's specific actions, or politics in general. The name "Tesla Takedown" itself evokes something negative to me. They're trying to take down a company that I believe is still full of good people who just happen to be led by somebody I don't support anymore. While I'm not interested in taking down the company, I'm also not interested in supporting it. I drive a Tesla pretty much daily and haven't experienced vandalism, so I'm not worried about that. But I certainly would struggle to buy a new Tesla now. Coincidentally, though, they don't have anything that I really want. I have test-driven the newer versions, but there aren't any improvements that make me want to get a new loan at current interest rates. My decision to purchase another vehicle would depend partly on what they come out with. Mitchell Feldman is a Telsa owner living in the UK. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing. The guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, "Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?" I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say. I've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla. I hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO. It hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla, however. I'm hoping to have the new Model Y in a few months. Everyone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says. Michele Pierog, a 57-year-old Tesla owner from New Hampshire. I got myself a Tesla Model Y in 2023. I wanted something that was convenient, and I didn't think that any competitor brands had charging infrastructure as robust as Tesla's. After three months of driving it, I was amazed by how much I enjoyed never having to go to a gas station. There's plenty of room, and it has a "frunk" — a trunk and the front where I keep games for my granddaughter when we're traveling. I knew Elon Musk had been put in a position of power, and people weren't happy, but I wasn't aware this impacted Tesla drivers until a friend called me a couple of weeks ago. She asked how I felt about driving my Tesla. My response was that nothing had changed for me. I did some research afterward and saw that there were protests at Tesla dealerships and some violent acts around Teslas. Regardless of what people's political views are about my vehicle, I think it's wrong that people are vandalizing Teslas. Recently, when I was driving my granddaughter, someone in a truck behind me drove up aggressively close to me and sandwiched me between them and the car in front. I don't know if this was because of my Tesla, but I assumed that it was because it coincided with media reporting of Tesla vandalism, and there aren't many other Teslas in my area. Even though this is speculative, I'm now wondering whether my vehicle choice is putting me in a bad position safety-wise. I don't yet feel unsafe enough to get rid of my Tesla, but it saddens me that I may have to make a decision about changing my car based on other people's perceptions. Driving a Tesla doesn't automatically mean I support what Elon is doing or have a particular political view. Do you have a story to share about the anti-Tesla movement?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said both sides had signed a "memorandum of intent" that was the basis of an agreement that is likely to see Ukraine and the U.S. jointly develop the country's natural resources. "We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine," Svyrydenko posted on social media platform X. "There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries," she added. Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's deputy prime minister, gave no further detail on the contents of the outline deal but posted images of her and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent purportedly signing the agreement. Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Bessent had told reporters that a comprehensive agreement would be signed next week. "Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday — next Thursday [24 April]? And I assume they're [Ukraine] going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. But we have a deal on that," Trump said at a press conference at the White House on Thursday. Bessent added that "we're still working on the details. Asked for more details, the treasury secretary said the deal was "substantially what we agreed on previously [with Ukraine] ... We went straight to the big deal, I think it's an 80-page agreement, and that's what will be signed." CNBC has asked the White House for further detail on the deal and is awaiting a response. Trump has coveted a minerals deal with Ukraine since his inauguration in January, saying an agreement to jointly develop and monetize Ukraine's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas and other natural resources would act, effectively, as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine throughout the war with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signalled on Thursday that the outline of a deal had been reached, telling reporters, "this is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions," Reuters reported. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said there may be a point where he doesn't want to put higher tariffs on China because the move could deter buying. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he may not raise tariffs if China goes beyond the 125% duty it has on American goods. "At a certain point, I don't want them to go higher because at a certain point, you make it where people don't buy," Trump said when a reporter asked what happens if China raises tariffs on the US. Earlier on Thursday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it wouldn't pay attention to Trump's "tariff numbers game" after the White House said Chinese exports face a levy of up to 245%. Last week, Beijing called escalating US tariffs a "joke" and said they no longer hold "any economic significance." China is the third-largest buyer of US goods, behind Canada and Mexico. According to US government figures, China bought $143.5 billion worth of American products last year. China has curbed the import of Hollywood films, and earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Beijing asked its airlines to stop taking deliveries from Boeing. On Thursday, Trump added that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have a "very good relationship" and said Xi has reached out to him "a number of times." "We have a deal for TikTok, but it'll be subject to China, so we'll just delay the deal till this thing works out one way or the other," Trump said, responding to a question about whether he would consider reducing tariffs to complete a TikTok deal. "If we're making a deal, I guess we'll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok, it wouldn't take very long," Trump said.</p>

Donald Trump has indicated he's open to trade talks with China.

Hi, this is John Liu in Beijing, where the metaphor du jour is that the US and China are playing a game of chicken over tariffs and trade.

There's a lot that the metaphor gets right. Pride, for one, is fueling the impulse for escalation on both sides, as is the aversion to backing down, lest it suggests weakness. </p>

Volatility in the won spiked to its highest since the US presidential election in November. 

South Korea plans to more than double the amount of overseas bonds it can issue to fund currency market activity to $3.5 billion, with officials citing the need to respond to sharp fluctuations. 

The revised issuance ceiling is part of a 12.2 trillion won additional budget aimed at supporting the flagging export-oriented economy now faced with US tariffs. The Finance Ministry made the proposal on Friday, which must be approved by parliament. </p>
