Either way, we're still missing a few models, but every leak adds another piece to the Threadripper puzzle. The Ryzen 9000 Threadripper family, codenamed "Shimada Peak", is set to be built using AMD's latest Zen 5 microarchitecture. As the core and cache configuration per CCD remains consistent with Zen 4, we can infer the flagship will offer up to 96 cores / 192 threads (12 CCDs). There's a usual one-year cadence between AMD's desktop/server and HEDT/workstation counterparts, so Shimada Peak might be set for a reveal at Computex or later in the second half of 2025. One might find it surprising to see that AMD is offering consumer-level core counts with its top-tier Threadripper family. These models provide access to high PCIe lane counts, plenty of memory channels, along with enterprise management options, for users who don't need much CPU throughput (like AI), without breaking the bank. These lower-cost models also make more sense once you factor in the fact that most commercial licenses are billed on a per-core basis. Like their predecessors, the new 12-core 9945WX and the already leaked 24-core 9965WX are likely to utilize CCDs with several cores disabled (6-active out of 8-total), which can introduce interlink latencies. In this case, the 9965WX might be slower than a theoretical three-CCD option with all eight cores intact. In terms of compatibility, these products should be drop-in replacements for AMD's in-vogue sTR5-based motherboards. Even though the documents mention SP6, they're likely referring to sTR5: a physically similar but electrically distinct derivative of SP6 featuring 4,844 landing pads. We can expect to hear more about these processors at Computex or later this year. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some argue it's the only solution given that we've waited too long to reduce carbon emissions. The startup is basically two guys from Silicon Valley who have been releasing weather balloons filled with hydrogen gas and sulfur dioxide particles. The company sells “cooling credits” based on how much estimated warming each balloon release negates. It might seed rainstorms in one region while depriving other areas of rain. Plus, if sulfur dioxide particles drift closer to ground, they could aggravate people's asthma and cause other respiratory problems. Here, the EPA takes issue with Make Sunsets' approach to geoengineering. In an FAQ on its website, the company says, “Yes, our method to cool Earth falls under the Weather Modification Act of 1976 and report yearly to NOAA of our deployments as required.” When it was written, the Weather Modification Act was likely intended to cover the practice of cloud seeding, in which particles like silver iodide are shot into clouds to induce rain or snowfall. Most weather modification today is done by entities like ski resorts and irrigation districts in the West. It's not clear how the law applies to climate modification. Still, while the EPA might be justified in its investigation, it isn't exactly consistent with Zeldin's approach to pollution. The agency's efforts to boost coal are likely to generate far more sulfur dioxide pollution than Make Sunsets will release with its balloons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is paying software company Palantir $30 million to provide the agency with “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the United States, according to a contract justification published in a federal register on Thursday. The agency currently does not have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportation in near real-time. The agency does have a tool for tracking self-reported deportations, but Thursday's document, which was first reported by Business Insider, does not say to what degree this new tool may rely on self-reported data. This is particularly due to challenges in collecting "biographic and biometric" data from departing travelers, especially if they leave over land, according to Customs and Border Protection. Palantir is expected to provide a prototype of ImmigrationOS by September 25, 2025, and the contract is scheduled to last at least through September 2027. Its “Self-Deportation Tracking” function would have “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deporation,” the document says. The document does not say what data Palantir would use for such a system, but ICE says it aims to “accurately report metrics of alien departures from the United States.” The agency stipulates that this tool should also integrate with “enforcement prioritization systems to inform policy” but does not elaborate on these systems or policies. In a “rationale” section, ICE claims that it has an “urgent and compelling” need for ImmigrationOS's capabilities. Without them, ICE claims, it would be “severely” limited in its ability to target the gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, and abide by President Donald Trump's executive order to expedite deportations. ICE's document does not specify the data sources Palantir would pull from to power ImmigrationOS. Aside from ICE, it has worked with the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Internal Revenue Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. As reported by WIRED, Palantir is currently helping Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) build a brand-new “mega API” at the IRS that could search for records across all the different databases that the agency maintains. Last week, 404 Media reported that a recent version of Palantir's case-management system for ICE allows agents to search for people based on “hundreds of different, highly specific categories,” including how a person entered the country, their current legal status, and their country of origin. It also includes a person's hair and eye color, whether they have scars or tattoos, and their license-plate reader data, which would provide detailed location data about where that person travels by car. These functionalities have been mentioned in a government privacy assessment published in 2016, and it's not clear what new information may have been integrated into the case management system over the past four years. This week's $30 million award is an addition to an existing Palantir contract penned in 2022, originally worth about $17 million, for work on ICE's case management system. The contract's ImmigrationOS update was first documented on April 11 in a government-run database tracking federal spending. In recent weeks, immigration authorities have arrested and detained people with student visas and green cards, and deported at least 238 people to a brutal megaprison in El Salvador, some of whom have not been able to speak with a lawyer or have due process. As part of its efforts to push people to self-deport, DHS in late March revoked the temporary parole of more than half a million people and demanded that they self-deport in about a month, despite having been granted authorization to live in the US after fleeing dangerous or unstable situations in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela under the so-called “CHNV parole programs.” Last week, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people as dead, a tactic meant to end their financial lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans feared the long-awaited console would spike in price due to Trump's export rules on international goods, but Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2 will still cost $449.99 and come out on June 5, as originally announced. Most of the Switch 2 accessories seem to be getting a $5 price bump. As far as games go, Nintendo isn't changing the prices of the digital and physical versions of two launch-day heavy-hitters, Mario Kart World ($79.99) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($69.99). Though the changing prices of accessories may concern some customers, they won't find reprieve from other gaming companies. Certain electronics, like smartphones and laptops, are exempted from Trump's tariffs, but not video game consoles.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Alas, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, as it appears a new set of stability woes has surfaced with these new drivers, as indicated by user reports. It is important to understand that improved synthetic performance might not directly reflect real-world tests, such as games and content creation. Either way, with the onset of enablement drivers (R570) for the RTX 50 series in February, a wide range of stability problems affected nearly all RTX GPUs. Fast forward to March, and back-to-back hotfixes ironed out most of these quirks for Blackwell. RTX 40 and RTX 30 GPUs, still plagued by crashes linked with G-Sync and Frame Generation, had to hold out until the latest 576.02 release that is said to fix most of these problems. ComputerBase did some testing and revealed that these drivers also deliver better synthetic performance on RTX 50 GPUs. This is further backed by several user reports at r/Nvidia, though the numbers could vary. We're looking at uplifts ranging between 6%-8%, depending on the GPU in 3DMark's Steel Nomad benchmark. We won't say no to free performance, but user reports still indicate lingering game crashes, black screen issues, stuttering, and other anomalies across the RTX GPU stack. Some of the mentioned game titles include Monster Hunter Wilds, FFVII Rebirth, and Black Myth Wukong, just to name a few. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The prices will remain unchanged, with the system starting at $449.99 and a bundle with Mario Kart World for $499.99.US-based pre-orders were delayed shortly after the console's initial announcement "to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." Some Switch 2 accessory prices are going to get pricier. A pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers that was originally set at $89.99 will now be $94.99 and the Pro Controller has bumped from $79.99 to $84.99. "Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," Nintendo's announcement reads.The system is still set to launch on June 5.Pre-orders were originally set for April 9, but were delayed as Nintendo dealt with the fact that it announced the system on the same day as President Donald Trump announced a sweeping series of tariffs. On April 9, Trump called for a 90-day pause in many tariffs (with the exception of an increase on tariffs on Chinese goods).Nintendo's titles, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Banaza (launching July 17) are not set to see price changes.

When these drives reach the end of their useful lives, they are usually shredded, and the key materials they're made of – including several rare earth elements (REE) – end up as e-waste. And China, a major source of REE, recently announced export restrictions on seven of them, potentially limiting the U.S. tech industry's access to materials such as dysprosium, which is necessary for magnetic storage, motors, and generators. The new process reclaims Rare Earth Oxides (REO) containing dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium from hard drives, along with aluminum, steel, gold, palladium, and copper. Dubbed the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, WD's initiative has already saved 47,000 pounds worth of hard drives, SSDs, and caddies from landfills or less-effective recycling programs. WD was able to achieve a more than 90% reclaim rate for REE and an 80% rate for all of the shredded material. The drives came from Microsoft's U.S. data centers where they were first shredded and then sent to PedalPoint for sorting and processing. Magnets and steel were then sent to CMR, which uses its acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) technology to extract the rare earth elements. The reclaimed rare earth elements can then be sold back into the U.S. supply system where they can be used to manufacture new tech products. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, of the seven materials China is restricting – samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium – only dysprosium is commonly found in hard drives. “HDDs are vital to our data center infrastructure, and advancing a circular supply chain is a core focus for Microsoft,” Chuck Graham, Microsoft CVP, Cloud Sourcing, Supply Chain, Sustainability, and Security said in a press release. To get their recycling program up and running, WD and its partners went through 18 months of testing, with the initial study period beginning in 2023 and ending in December 2024 Now the company is working with more partners. "Western Digital is currently expanding the HDD rare earth material capture program based on the successful pilot with Microsoft," Jackie Jung, WD's VP of Global Operations Strategy and Corporate Sustainability told Tom's Hardware. "This program is now in development with a number of our hyperscale customers." The potential need for hard drive recycling is huge and growing. According to the Financial Times, there were 23,000 data centers with 70 million servers as of 2022. Each of these servers has multiple hard drives which reach their end of life, often after just three to five years. The amount of e-waste overall is expected to reach 75 million tons by 2030.

However, several reviewers discovered that the budget GPU performs poorly on older processors. Intel has acknowledged the issue and will investigate it. A moderator on the Intel Community forum started an Intel Arc Graphics and CPU Overhead thread, saying, “Thank you for your patience. We have increased our platform coverage to include more configurations in our validation process, and we are continuing to investigate optimizations.” It also used an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 as a control, and these are its results. The RTX 4060 now gets a 22% advantage over the Intel graphics card, with some games returning an unplayable 30 FPS or lower. Note that this doesn't include 1% low numbers, which are much worse for the B580. Hopefully, Intel can find a fix for this issue sooner rather than later, mainly as it affects the core market of the Intel Arc B580 — budget gamers. You might think that buying the B580 to replace your old GTX 1060, which was still the most popular GPU on Steam as late as 2022, will finally let you play some newer games. But you might be disappointed with this overhead issue, as it will preclude you from playing some game titles without upgrading your CPU. This might not be too big of a problem if you already have an AM4 motherboard, especially as AMD is still releasing new chips for this socket in 2025. But if you have an AM3+ or older motherboard (or older Intel chips), you'll likely need to spend on a new CPU and motherboard, increasing the cost of upgrading your system to play the latest titles. And with tariffs jacking up prices everywhere, this might mean you cannot afford to play newer games at all. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Food and Drug Administration has suspended quality control tests for a vital food safety program and is planning to end virtually all routine food safety inspections, according to a pair of reports from Reuters and CBS News. On top of that, NBC News has learned the FDA refused to publicize a recent E. coli outbreak in lettuce that ripped through 15 states. And it's all just the latest batch of bad news for essential government programs courtesy of President Donald Trump and his dipshit conspiracy theorist at the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. First up, the FDA is suspending quality control testing at the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Proficiency Testing Program, according to a report from Reuters. Kennedy is overseeing a reduction in force at the agency that's seeing about 20,000 people leave through layoffs and departures. Second, and perhaps even more troubling, is a report from CBS News that the FDA is currently making plans to end most food safety inspections at the federal level. The theory, if you can call it that, is that food safety is something that should only be done at the local level, and you don't want federal inspectors to just “duplicate” work already done by states. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections to dozens of states, and the assumption would be an attempt to do that at a much broader scale. CBS News quotes some former workers at FDA who say some “higher-risk” inspections, like baby formula, would probably still be overseen by the feds if Trump and Kennedy went through with the plan. The outbreak sickened dozens of people across 15 states and caused some to suffer severe illness, including a 9-year-old boy in Indiana who went into kidney failure. It's unclear to what extent Trump and Kennedy know what's going on at the FDA, given their ignorance of so many things happening under them right now. Kennedy recently suggested he didn't even know what was being cut at the federal agency when asked about specifics on CBS News. Over $11 billion has been slashed, and Kennedy didn't seem to have a firm grasp on any of it. Possibly because Elon Musk's DOGE is rampaging through government agencies, making cuts without any adults in the room. But this is where we're at with guys like Trump and Kennedy in charge. They're destroying the U.S. federal government and purging the federal workforce, all while making it much less safe to eat or drink anything in this country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turns out that Silicon Valley's tech bros can't take a joke. Comedian Seth Rogen found this out the hard way this month, when he presented at an awards ceremony for scientific innovation, the Breakthrough Prize, which annually doles out awards of dubious merit to various members of the field's gilded class. Rogan's attempt at a light roast directed at the well-heeled audience, which included the likes of Google co-founder Sergei Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, did not go over well. Rogen reportedly went off script when he took some shots at the tech bros in attendance who had contributed to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The Hollywood Reporter reports that Rogen said the following: “And it's amazing that others [who have been] in this room underwrote electing a man who, in the last week, single-handedly destroyed all of American science,” Rogen said. “It's amazing how much good science you can destroy with $320 million and RFK Jr, very fast,” the comedian said. The audience of wealthy tech magnates was not impressed. The comedian's “ad-lib landed with a thud,” THR writes, and only received light applause. The so-called “full video” was subtly edited to make it seem as if Norton's “light applause” comment was a reference to his entrance with Rogen. Gizmodo reached out to the Breakthrough Prize Foundation for more information about why they felt this was necessary. In a statement to THR, the foundation said: “This year's ceremony lasted longer than the prior few years, and several edits were made in order to meet the originally planned run time.” It should be noted that the YouTube video in question is quite long, at 139 minutes, but apparently not long enough to include another 30 seconds' worth of material. In the meantime, Kennedy is focused on commissioning a highly questionable study to help determine what can already be considered settled scientific ground: whether vaccines cause autism or not (they don't).

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to buy a premium MacBook Air, Amazon's current deal on the 2022 MacBook Air (M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage) is almost too good to be true. At $799 down from $1,119, this great model is now available for 33% off its original price point. Such a steep decline on an Apple device is very rare. This model boasts a stunning 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with more than 500 nits of brightness and a billion colors for vibrant images and stunning detail for creative work, watching movies, and everything in between. The M2 chip comes with an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, and it is coupled with 8GB unified memory (RAM) and a fast 512GB SSD for the model on sale at Amazon. For general use—web browsing, office work, streaming, and basic creative pursuits—there is not much functional difference between the M2 and newer chips. The M2's efficiency also yields up to 18 hours of battery life on a single charge so you can play or work all day and not worry about looking for an outlet. This MacBook Air's appearance is virtually indistinguishable from Apple's latest models with an ultra-slim and lightweight (2.7 pounds) design that is very portable for students or business travelers. The 1080p FaceTime HD camera, three-mic array, and four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio make you look and sound fantastic on calls. Obviously, this MacBook Air is built to last – both in terms of hardware and software. The aluminum chassis resists wear and tear and Apple's commitment to software updates means you'll continue to receive new features and security improvements for years to come. Compatibility with popular apps like Microsoft 365, Zoom, or Opera will also ensure your workflow remains seamless. With a design and performance capability (for day-to-day tasks) that's nearly the same as the latest releases, and a discount that's barely ever seen for Apple gear, this deal is the best MacBook deal on the market today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Operatives from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Labor (DOL) have access to systems that house sensitive data pertaining to immigrants, sources tell WIRED. This access comes as President Donald Trump's administration has continued its crackdown on immigrants around the US, and DOGE has played a key role in collecting personal data on them. WIRED previously reported that Miles Collins, Aram Moghaddassi, and Marko Elez are all DOGE operatives embedded at the Labor Department. This program offers funding to organizations that work with migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as organizations working on the state level to support job training for low-income farm workers. “When I say ‘migrant and seasonal farm workers,' that does not mean somebody who just arrived from Venezuela or something. “Maybe there's some misunderstanding even among the DOGE guys.” Data on visa applicants maintained in FLAG systems, sources say, could include names, work addresses, work history, phone numbers, email addresses, and an “alien registration number,” which is an identifier assigned to foreign nationals by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Permanent Labor Certifications (PERM) are also available in the FLAG system. Trump has since nominated Anthony D'Esposito, a former US congressman from New York, for the job. DOGE's access at the DOL also encompasses data that, while not directly immigration-related, could be used in conjunction with data that is. Collins, Moghaddassi, and Elez all have access to the DOL's Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program, WIRED has confirmed. If DOGE were to find crossover, a source at the agency tells WIRED, this “would fit so neatly with their messaging about immigrants being criminals and abusing government services.” (Despite claims from Trump's administration, there is no evidence that immigrants present threats to “national security” and “public safety” or that they abuse government services—in fact, research shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.) Moghaddassi, Elez, and Collins did not respond to requests for comment. Moghaddassi has worked at a number of Musk's companies, including X, Tesla, and Neuralink; according to previous WIRED reporting tracking DOGE operatives, he has also been linked to the Treasury Department and DHS. Elez, a 25-year-old engineer who has worked at Musk's X and SpaceX, has also appeared at the Treasury and Social Security Administration. Elez briefly resigned from DOGE after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez returned to DOGE after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X. Elez, despite his initial resignation from DOGE, has seemingly been tasked with a number of unusually sensitive assignments: He is also part of the DOGE team working on a system to sell the $5 million visas that Trump calls “gold cards.” Elez is on this team with Edward Coristine, the young DOGE operative known as “Big Balls.” Coristine also has his hands in many agencies and recently appeared at the Labor Department, sources tell WIRED. Coristine is another key DOGE staffer planted at DHS. “This is an administration that is happy to go after people with legal status if it dislikes something else about them,” says Victoria Noble, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It's just one more source of information that allows this administration to target people who are here legally, but target them for deportation or other more advanced investigations.” In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech Federal judge allows DOGE to take over $500 million office building for free Summer Lab: Explore the future of tech with WIRED WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'll be laughing it up like a fuzzball of another kind when you see this trio of Hasbro Star Wars figures up close—all somewhat inexplicably linked by their glorious manes. In Tokyo, Japan for Star Wars Celebration, Hasbro just wrapped up showing fans what's coming for its Star Wars action figures, and to celebrate, io9's got your first look clean and up close at three of those reveals. Carrying on the Black Series' latest update to the classic A New Hope cast, we've got your looks at the newest Han Solo and Chewbacca figures, with Han featuring a new headsculpt complete with a wonderfully fluffy take on Harrison Ford's hair in the first Star Wars, while Chewie, as always, is covered in the stuff, bringing some new paint decos and updates to Black Series' tried-and-true Wookiee formula. Continuing on the New Hope vibes in the 3.75″-scaled Vintage Collection, we've got your look at this furry epic: a Tusken Raider complete with Bantha mount. The deluxe set features the Tusken Raider figure with his own gaffi stick and rifle accessories, as well as cloth goods to make it easier for him to mount his fully articulated ride.

When news broke that OpenAI was in talks to acquire AI coding company Windsurf for $3 billion, one of the first questions on the mind of anyone following the space was likely: “Why not buy Cursor creator Anysphere instead?”

After all, OpenAI Startup Fund has been an investor in Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, since the quickly growing coding assistant's seed round in late 2023. (Anysphere is often referred to by its product name, Cursor.) It turns out that OpenAI indeed approached Anysphere in 2024 and again earlier this year about a potential acquisition, according to a report from CNBC. The talks failed. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital at about $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.

OpenAI's desire to move on to acquisition discussions with another coding assistant maker signals how important capturing a slice of the code generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. Windsurf is generating about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), TechCrunch reported in February. Meanwhile, Anysphere's Cursor reportedly makes about $200 million on an ARR basis.

While OpenAI's Codex CLI “agent,” which the company released Wednesday, can also write and edit code, its attempt to buy Windsurf suggests the company doesn't want to wait for CLI to gain traction with customers.
