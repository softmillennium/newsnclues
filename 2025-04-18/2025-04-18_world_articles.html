                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nayib Bukele posts images on social media of Chris Van Hollen's meeting with mistakenly deported man Nayib Bukele has been accused of planting margaritas on the table where a Democrat senator and a wrongfully deported man were meeting in El Salvador. Mr Bukele, the Salvadorian president, posted images on social media of Chris Van Hollen meeting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who has been imprisoned in one of the country's high-security jails since being deported from the US last month. The brightly coloured pictures show the pair sitting at a table with two glasses set in front of them, seemingly with salt-encrusted rims and glace cherries balanced on top. They show Mr Van Hollen and Mr Abrego Garcia greeting each other in the polished lobby of a hotel in San Salvador, the country's capital, the Maryland senator smiling at his companion over a cocktail, and the pair sitting at a table with their drinks in front of a lush green backdrop. By contrast, a photo posted by Mr Van Hollen shows the men with a glass of water and its colours are much more muted. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' and ‘torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,” Mr Bukele wrote on social media, adding a cocktail emoji. Prof Hany Farid, an expert in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, said the cocktail glasses looked “a little odd” in Mr Bukele's images but did not believe they were Photoshopped. “We find no evidence of manipulation in these images,” he told The Telegraph. Mr Trump was asked by a reporter on Friday what he thought about the images of Mr Abrego Garcia apparently sipping margaritas in El Salvador. Mr Bukele also retweeted a number of social media users who praised him for “trolling” the Democrats, including Mike Flynn, Donald Trump's disgraced former national security adviser. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia had a history of violence and was not the upstanding ‘Maryland Man' the media has portrayed him as,” it said in a statement, releasing court filings in which his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, sought a restraining order against him for allegedly punching and bruising her. Ms Vasquez, who did not continue with the process, has nevertheless campaigned for her husband's return and says he is a “loving partner and father” unfairly targeted by the Trump administration. Mr Van Hollen said on social media he had called Ms Vasquez on Thursday, and said he would provide a “full update” after returning to the US. Also on Wednesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released files apparently showing Mr Abrego Garcia had been detained as part of a murder investigation. An officer spoke with a “past and proven reliable source” who advised that he was an “active member” of MS-13, in which he had the rank of “chequeo” and went under the moniker “Chele”. The Maryland senator said he had travelled to El Salvador to “see if Kilmar Abrego Garcia is doing ok”, saying “nobody has heard anything about his condition since he was illegally abducted from the United States”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump said he'd stop the war in 24 hours if elected, but his team appears daunted by negotiation with ‘a lot of detail attached to it' But it isn't clear whether the Trump administration has threatened to give up on a Russia-Ukraine peace deal as a negotiating tactic or simply because it lacks the concentration for a complicated negotiation – a shortcoming that has dogged the administration's foreign policy through its first three months in office. That would be the latest about-face for an administration that has already taken a back seat on negotiating a peace in Gaza and retreated on implementing worldwide tariffs that shook financial markets around the globe earlier this month. There have been plenty of meetings: Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff has spoken three times with Vladimir Putin, during which he has listened to the Kremlin leader's thoughts on Ukraine for hours, and Rubio was on the phone with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and met with Ukrainian officials and European leaders in Paris on Thursday. But there are few indications that new ground has been struck, that the US has exerted any pressure on the Kremlin or that the negotiations have identified what kinds of security guarantees would exist to ensure that Russia wouldn't simply continue the war when it sees fit. One element of a “Trump deal” appears to be this: that it doesn't take very long or involve very much effort to achieve. “We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,” Rubio said, noting that the US wanted to stop “thousands” of people from dying in the next year. “So if they're serious about peace – either side, or both – we want to help. Rubio clearly wished to vent frustration on Friday, a day after Trump had said in the White House that he was waiting for Russia's response to the proposed framework for a peace deal and expected to have it this week. The White House appears to be increasingly frustrated with Moscow, something that both European and Ukrainian officials had hoped would take place. But if Trump walks away from a deal and the war altogether, the decision will still play into Putin's hands – relieving Ukraine of a key ally and financial backer in its fight against Russia. Moscow appears to see the situation as a win-win: either taking a favourable deal with the White House or waiting for Trump to lose patience. JD Vance, the Ukraine-sceptic vice-president, told Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday that he felt “optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close”. There had been “some things … even in the past 24 hours” that he said could indicate a chance to secure a ceasefire. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the United States had offered Russia some sanctions relief in exchange for a deal – something that Rubio had offered as far back as his confirmation hearings in January. And Witkoff appeared surprised on Fox News that Russia wanted “so much more” than just a ceasefire. “It's a complicated situation from, you know – rooted in some real problematic things happening between the two countries.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States and Iran are due to hold their second round of nuclear talks on Saturday, as what both sides are looking for in a deal begins to take shape. Delegations from both countries met in Oman last weekend for talks mediated by the Gulf Arab nation. Since last weekend's talks, which both parties described as “constructive,” remarks from various members of the Trump administration have flip-flopped, oscillating between maximalist demands that Iran has said were “red lines” and a more conciliatory approach the Islamic Republic may concede to. This comes amid threats by President Donald Trump that the US will resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors. A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US. That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities and has so far advanced its program of uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington. Related article Trump envoy stresses need for verification in Iran nuclear talks Comments from Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, have suggested differently as of late. But conflicting remarks from US officials before and after last Saturday's meeting have muddied Washington's demands. Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, said that moving forward, talks with Iran would be about verification of its nuclear program, but stopped short of mentioning a demand to fully dismantle Iran's nuclear program, as other US officials have said in the past. In other words, indicating a deal that would be similar to the Obama-brokered agreement. The first is verification of uranium enrichment, “and ultimately verification on weaponization, that includes missiles, type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb.” However, Witkoff later reversed his position in a statement on X in which he said any final deal with Iran would require it to “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.” Asked to explain Witkoff's apparent reversal, an administration official told CNN: “It's the most recent elaboration of policy.” Other officials have been hawkish on what the US expects from Iran. “Iran, come to the table, negotiate, full dismantlement of your nuclear capabilities,” he said on Fox News. Iranian officials have dismissed that proposal as a non-starter, accusing the US of using it as a pretext to weaken and ultimately topple the Islamic Republic. Iran this week doubled down on its right to enrich uranium and accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals. “Iran's enrichment (program) is a real and genuine matter, and we are ready to build trust regarding potential concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters on Wednesday, state-run Press TV reported. Related article US-Iran negotiators hold ‘constructive' nuclear talks, will meet again next week “It could be perceived as lack of seriousness, let alone good faith. Meanwhile, Iran's highest leadership has approached the talks with extreme caution. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement defending his aggressive policy towards Iran, saying, “Israel will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday that Witkoff spoke with Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs and Netanyahu's closest confidant, about the first round of US-Iran talks in Oman. Related article Netanyahu met Trump seeking wins on tariffs and Iran. Dermer was sitting beside Netanyahu in Washington last week when Trump suddenly announced the US-Iran talks would begin imminently. After relinquishing its nuclear program, Libya descended into civil war following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gadhafi's regime and led to his killing. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be rejected from the outset. Related article US intelligence agencies believe Israel is likely to strike Iranian nuclear facilities this year However, The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump had urged Israel not to strike Iran's nuclear sites as soon as next month in order to let talks with Iran play out, which could impact planned engagements for Trump's national security team in the coming days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a quarter of Canadians have been exposed to fake political content on social media that is “more sophisticated and more politically polarizing” as the country prepares to vote in a federal election, researchers have found, warning that platforms must increase protections amid a “dramatic acceleration” of online disinformation in the final weeks of the campaign. In a new report released on Friday, Canada's Media Ecosystem Observatory found a growing number of Facebook ads impersonating legitimate news sources were instead promoting fraudulent investment schemes, often involving cryptocurrency. Canada's federal election, on 28 April, is the first national vote in which Canadian news is not permitted to be shared on products owned by Meta, including Facebook and Instagram. The ban, which began in August 2023, is a result of a standoff between the tech giant and Ottawa over the Online News Act that forced intermediaries such as Meta and Google's parent company Alphabet to compensate journalism outlets for sharing their content. But media researchers found more than half of Canadians still say they get political news from Facebook, despite the platform's ban on news articles from reputable outlets. “People using Facebook aren't often thinking, ‘Am I reading the news?' They might see a post from a candidate or follow cultural news aggregating types of accounts,” said Aengus Bridgman, the executive director of the MEO. Neither is information that might contradict the views they hold. All of that just has been cut really – like, off at the knees.” Bridgman says that most of the content the team uncovered – including more than 40 Facebook pages promoting fraudulent ads, with new pages being created and identified every day – were meant to be humorous or ironic, instead of convincing. But Canada's Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (Site) is monitoring the election for disinformation and says it expects increased online political activity following the two closely-watched leaders debates. Last week, Site officials said they had found an information operation linked to China on Chinese-language social media platform WeChat, the popular news account Youli-Youmian. We monitor these platforms and our evaluation of that incident in particular doesn't feel as though it had any material influence or consequence,” said Bridgman. “We don't think one WeChat channel posting a couple times about Canadian politics articles consistent with their editorial line amounts to foreign interference.” Instead, researchers have focused their attention on a series of scams that appear to be a continuation of a trend replicated in other countries, in which ads showing “fake sensational political headlines” impersonate small business and personal accounts. Bridgman cautioned that the broader risk of deepfakes comes when a population is uninformed. “If you've never heard about this person before, you cannot distinguish audio or video of them in compromising situations or making offensive remarks. The article shows Carney meeting with a top CBC news anchor and includes a purported transcript of an interview, in which he promises to send money to Canadians if they register for what purports to be a newly formed government programme. In another, a page called Money Mindset, which uses the logo of the CBC/Radio-Canada, bought five French-language Facebook ads that were active from one to four hours between 4 and 9 April. In total, the five ads represent an investment of approximately C$1,000 and have received around 10,000 impressions. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams.” But researchers say the response from tech companies “appears to have been inconsistent and insufficient for preventing these ads from spreading” – pointing to the proliferation of ads in recent days. “Imagine that on TV there's an ad using clearly fraudulent content or is a deepfake. It would never get approved for use because of the advertising standards in this country,” said Bridgeman. And what worries me is that it feels like people are just okay with this.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A charity controversy and GOP unrest threaten Casey DeSantis's chances of succeeding her husband as governor in 2026 When Ron DeSantis was asked in February whom he would like to see succeed him as Florida governor when he is termed out of office in 2027, his answer was unequivocal: his wife, Casey. “There's no question about it,” he told a press conference in Tampa. A political initiative she founded in 2021 to improve welfare provision has become mired in controversy over its charity wing's failure to file required tax documents. There have also been probing questions from Florida Republicans over a “probably illegal” $10m donation from a legal settlement to the state that was secretly directed to the charity – some of which ended up in the hands of her husband's political cronies. It is a scandal that some observers believe has the potential to sink her possible candidacy for the November 2026 gubernatorial election before it even begins, or at least provoke some soul searching in the DeSantis camp about how and when to launch it. “This is really her first test of negative publicity, and some negative attention in the media, and we'll see ultimately how that plays out,” said Michael Binder, professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Florida. “I don't know that it's a death knell for her candidacy. Rick Scott was a Medicare embezzler and it didn't necessarily prevent him from not only winning a governor's race twice, but getting elected to the Senate. “But that being said, none of this is great for her. But I certainly see this being a tougher race than probably both parties might think,” he said. It is an unfamiliar position for Casey DeSantis, 44, one half of what some see as the fairytale couple of Florida politics since their Disney World wedding in 2009. A former television news reporter with a compelling story, including surviving breast cancer, she has been her husband's chief cheerleader, confidante and campaigner. She was at his side through his first election to Congress in 2012 and elevation to the governor's mansion in Tallahassee six years later on the back of a tweeted endorsement from Donald Trump. Donors were reportedly lining up to support her potential candidacy. Then came the hammer blow of Trump's endorsement of Donalds, before an alleged “kiss the ring” breakfast visit in March by both Ron and Casey DeSantis to the president's West Palm Beach golf club. That was quickly followed by the burgeoning charity scandal enveloping the Hope Florida Foundation, a non-profit supporting Casey DeSantis's flagship initiative to reduce government funding for welfare programs and replace it with more community and corporate input. The direction was in apparent contradiction of Florida law requiring such money to be paid into a trust or act as general revenue for state legislators to spend. It was subsequently revealed that two organizations that received money from Hope Florida gave $5m each to political committees that supported Ron DeSantis's ultimately successful efforts last November to defeat a ballot amendment calling for the legalization of recreational marijuana. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning “The reference to that $10m not being taxpayer dollars I find offensive,” he said, after Harris explained the money was a “donation” by Centene to Hope Florida on top of the settlement, and therefore exempt from state law. On Monday, Ron DeSantis lashed out at his fellow Republicans, adding more heat to a feud that has been simmering since legislators shut down his immigration proposals in January, then launched an inquiry into the DeSantis administration's spending habits. The next steps for Casey DeSantis are uncertain, but some observers believe the controversy has ended any hope she had of becoming only the second woman, after Wyoming's Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, to succeed her husband as a state governor. “It's clear, even at this point, that the Hope Florida scandal is going to kill her campaign in the cradle,” Peter Schorsch, publisher of Florida Politics, wrote in a post on X. Frank Orlando, political science professor at St Leo University, said Casey DeSantis had essentially been caught up in the escalating dispute between her husband and state politicians, who are making hay from the Hope Florida situation. “She's been a relatively popular first lady of Florida, and my feeling from talking with legislators in Tallahassee is that it's primarily a beef with Ron,” he said. I don't think this is being done to undermine Casey as much as it is saying to Ron: ‘We've been under your thumb for six years, and we're not going to take it any more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's patience with peacemaking for Ukraine, always painfully thin, now appears to be running out altogether. “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after meeting European and Ukrainian officials for talks in Paris. One option might be redouble US military support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's efforts to court the Kremlin, or perhaps because of them, Russian intransigence has emerged as the main obstacle to peace, such as Moscow's foot-dragging over Trump's proposed 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine alone has agreed. Admittedly, fresh deliveries of billions of dollars more of American arms to Ukraine may be an unpopular policy U-turn among some Trump supporters, but a newly invigorated Ukrainian push-back on the battlefield could encourage the Kremlin to reassess its negotiating position. New, properly tough US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and those who buy it, have also been touted as a potential means of applying maximum pressure on Moscow. Problem is, forging a peace in Ukraine is just one of the agenda items in what Trump and the Kremlin see as a much broader, lucrative reconfiguration of US-Russian relations – involving energy deals, space exploration and mining contracts – which Trump may be reluctant to jeopardize. Back in Paris, Rubio hinted at a possible second, more likely, option. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it's not our war,” Rubio stressed, alluding to the possibility that the US could simply walk away, leaving Ukraine and its European backers to face Russia alone. That would pose a huge challenge, given Ukraine's depleted resources and Europe's dire unreadiness, currently, to bolster the front lines with sufficient military supplies of its own. For the Kremlin, American disengagement is a double-edged sword. It may give its battered forces a freer hand in Ukraine, but it doesn't necessarily deliver the win that Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, insists that he wants, instead dragging out the pain. Russian troops, who are being killed and injured at an alarming rate, would continue to be fed into the brutal “meat grinder” of the Ukrainian front lines, increasing simmering social pressure on the Kremlin at home. Pressure on the Russian economy, already weakened by war, would also increase. If there is no peace deal, there is unlikely to be any easing of the punitive international sanctions already straining fragile Russian finances. Putin, bent on total victory, may regret passing up the extraordinary chance offered by Trump to end his disastrous Ukraine war and cut his country's substantial losses. The Trump administration insists it has not yet entirely given up – just hours after Rubio's comment, Vice President JD Vance said the White House was “optimistic” it could still end the war – but is signalling that that point may be drawing close. “We need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” Rubio said of peace in Ukraine before heading back to Washington.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROME, April 18. US Vice President JD Vance has expressed optimism about the end of the conflict in Ukraine and announced progress in its settlement over the past 24 hours. "I want to update the prime minister (Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - TASS) on some of the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on. Since there are the negotiations I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close," he said at a meeting with Meloni in Rome. Less than 24 hours after the talks at the White House, Meloni receives JD Vance, who has traveled with his family to Rome, where he will celebrate Easter (on April 20). He will also reportedly meet with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. On April 17, French President Emmanuel Macron met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US presidential special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris. According to the Elysee Palace, the "constructive talks" helped to "bring positions closer" on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. Another meeting of representatives of the five countries is scheduled for next week in London, the AFP news agency reported.</p>

MOSCOW, April 18. /TASS/. From the very first days that the West introduced its unilateral sanctions, Moscow and Tehran banded together, and the recent signing and ratification of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership can be seen as a culmination of this decision, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

"Regardless of when the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was signed and when it will take effect, such cooperation was launched from the very first days after the West imposed illegal restrictions on our countries," he pointed out at a joint press conference following talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

"Apart from political activities on the international stage, we have also long been consistently and effectively introducing the practice of financial and bank payments, logistics chains and other mechanisms serving trade and investment, which protect us from unlawful actions. Meanwhile, the enactment of the treaty simply reflects our determination to boost our friendly, strategic relations in all areas no matter what," Lavrov added.

The top Russian diplomat also emphasized that Moscow and Tehran "have a lot of supporters within the United Nations, including the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter that develops position documents, particularly demanding an end to illegal practices and a return to the norms of international law."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Related article Turkey detains more than 1,400 protesters and multiple journalists after jailing of leading opposition figure Some 189 people, including journalists, students and activists, were on trial across two overflowing court rooms in Istanbul's Caglayan justice palace, one of the city's main courts. Charges against the defendants stem from the protests that erupted after Imamoglu's arrest on March 19 on corruption allegations — a move critics see as an attempt to sideline a key rival to Erdogan ahead of elections expected to be held in 2028. Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the trials as politically motivated, citing a lack of evidence and calling the charges incompatible with democratic norms. A small group of parents and supporters gathered outside the court before the trials to demand justice for students who are among those being prosecuted, holding signs, releasing balloons and chanting “we want justice for our kids.” Related video Turkish protesters want ‘to defend democracy' after arrest of Istanbul mayor, says opposition leader HRW reviewed the indictments against 650 demonstrators “accused of protest-related offenses,” noting that 120 were charged for assemblies held after an eight-day protest ban expired. Potential sentences range from six months to five years, yet in some cases the evidence appeared thin. Protesters in the capital Ankara were met with police water cannons. In Istanbul, police doused people with pepper spray, and some officers kicked and hit demonstrators after several fireworks and other objects were thrown at riot police near the city's municipality building, according to Reuters. Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe director, criticized the trials as “a warning against exercising the rights to peaceful protest or free expression,” and urged prosecutors to drop charges without concrete evidence. Turkey's record on assembly rights has long drawn scrutiny, with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issuing over 70 rulings against Ankara since 2010 for disproportionate crackdowns, HRW said. Despite this, Erdogan's government has tightened control, with Freedom House, a US-based nonprofit research organization, labeling Turkey “not free” amid censorship and surveillance laws. As the trials begin, observers have warned of deepening authoritarianism. With 90% of Turkish media under government influence and journalists routinely targeted, the cases underscore a broader erosion of rights under Erdogan, who has ruled since 2003 and could remain in power until 2029. Elections are not scheduled until 2028 but would need to come earlier if Erdogan, 71, who has run Turkey for 22 years, wants to run again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting. He spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement. “Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on. He said the U.S. administration wants to decide “in a matter of days.” Rubio's comments stepped up pressure on both sides to reach a peace deal, even as the U.S. and Ukraine made progress on a minerals agreement that Trump has sought to recoup billions of dollars in military assistance that Washington sent Kyiv since Russia's full scale invasion in February 2022. U.S. Vice President JD Vance struck a more hopeful tone in Rome on Friday, ahead of talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. On the negotiations, “I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close.” Rubio's comments came as the U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a long-delayed deal granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Donald Trump's peace push. The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term co-operation. The framework of the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite apparent impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. He didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “fairly complex” negotiations are ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Trump and Putin are scheduled in the coming days. Peskov also stressed that a limited, 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington that both Russia and Ukraine last month embraced in principle has now lapsed, but did not say what steps Moscow might take next. While voicing their readiness to implement the agreement, the warring parties issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again after a peace deal is reached. Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy. One person died and 98 others, including six children, were hurt as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early in the day, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on Friday. He said cluster munitions struck a “densely populated” neighbourhood four times. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor. Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariann Budde, second right, arrives at the national prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, on Jan. 21, in Washington.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press Michael Coren is an Anglican priest, journalist and author of the memoir Heaping Coals. That's not a surprise – remember, even by Galilean standards he and his hometown were considered insignificant. Initially welcomed into Jerusalem, days later he would be rejected and disowned, suffering a grotesque execution reserved for slaves and traitors. I can't help thinking that there will be little of either among U.S. President Donald Trump and his people, even though theirs is the most ostentatiously and aggressively Christian administration in recent American history. These are mainly Christian nationalists (a painful oxymoron), conspiracy theorists obsessed with the end times, Catholics who condemn the Pope as being dangerously left-wing, prosperity preachers, and mere charlatans – Mr. Trump himself adopted the mantras of the Christian right only when he first ran for president. I'd quote the figure they mention so often, and how he said that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” I'd remind them of the rich young fellow who asked Jesus what he must do to obtain eternal life, and that Jesus replied that he should sell everything and give the money to the poor. I'd tell of Jesus in the Temple, who found people selling bruised animals for sacrifice and exchanging currency at fraudulent levels, and how he made a whip of cords, drove these exploiters out of the temple, poured their coins onto the ground and overturned their tables. I'd remind that when Jesus spoke of war and peace, he used words that in the original Greek are not passive but demanding and insistent. I'd speak of community and society, and how the MAGA cult of harsh individualism is antithetical to Gospel values. “How does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?” said Jesus. I'd ask them what they say to God during times of prayer. In those intimate, emotionally naked moments do they genuinely listen, do they open themselves up, ask for guidance, and question their bombast and abuse? Or do they use religion, rather than faith, as a justification for malice and division? It isn't the first time this has happened, though some of us hoped we'd embraced history's lessons. I'd ask if they wondered how Jesus would have reacted to a hard-working mother being arrested and deported even though all she wanted was a better life for her children. Ask whether the Son of God told us to lie. Ask why they were so opposed to women's choice when Jesus never mentions abortion. Ask why they were so intimidated by society's fringes when that was precisely where Jesus found his natural home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that at his recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he discussed the territorial aspect of the Ukraine conflict, and that the issue could be partially resolved in Russia's favor. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Witkoff said that "Russia might get some of the regions, but not all." The US envoy also suggested "that Ukraine might care less about some of the regions if they are Russian speaking," the newspaper notes. The US presidential envoy told Fox News earlier that he had already held three meetings with Putin. Witkoff noted that their recent talks in St. Petersburg had allowed him to understand that Putin wanted "permanent peace." However, in his words, "there's so much more to it." Putin and Witkoff met in the Russian city of St. Petersburg on April 11. The meeting, which lasted over four hours, was focused on the situation in Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly called for resolving the Ukraine conflict, highlighting the need to take Russia's interests into account when addressing the root causes of the crisis. According to him, this is the only way to establish long-term peace, which is what Moscow wants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is shutting down three of its eight operational bases in northeastern Syria, reducing its military presence from 2,000 to 1,400 troops, the New York Times reported on April 17, citing two senior U.S. officials. The closures include Mission Support Site Green Village, MSS Euphrates, and a smaller unnamed facility. U.S. commanders will reportedly decide within 60 days whether to further reduce the troop presence. U.S. President Donald Trump has "expressed deep skepticism" about maintaining any military presence in Syria. However, military analysts have recommended keeping at least 500 troops in the country to counter lingering terrorist threats. Since pro-Russian dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a rebel offensive and fled to Russia, Moscow also began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. A Russian delegation had since traveled to Syria to meet the new leadership, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin pledged support and cooperation to Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa. Bloomberg reported that Moscow is close to an agreement with Syria's new government to maintain a limited military presence in exchange for assisting with anti-Islamic State operations in eastern Syria. Ukraine has also reached out to Syria's new government regarding Russia's military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30, 2024, and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A full ceasefire in Ukraine is "unrealistic," Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said during an April 17 briefing, challenging diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting. The statement came more than a month after Ukraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposal, introduced during earlier negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. "We had an attempt at a limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure facilities, which was not observed by the Ukrainian side," Nebenzya claimed, referring to a partial deal reached during U.S.-mediated talks in Riyadh on March 25. "Under the current circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to talk about a (full) ceasefire at this stage." After meeting with U.S. delegates on March 11, Kyiv accepted the full ceasefire deal on the condition that Russia would also halt hostilities and refrain from undermining Ukraine's defenses. Moscow refused, demanding a halt to foreign military aid and restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Russia's rejection of the full truce has coincided with strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure. According to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Moscow has violated the energy ceasefire more than 30 times since its announcement. Russia claims that it has been upholding a 30-day moratorium on strikes against energy facilities since a verbal agreement in a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18. Kyiv has dismissed the March 18 truce announcement as a Kremlin propaganda stunt without any substance, saying Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian energy facilities since then. In turn, Russia accused Ukraine of targeting the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast and other energy facilities — accusations that Kyiv has rejected — as Moscow seeks justifications to continue its attacks on Ukraine. With U.S.-led diplomatic talks stalled, Russia continues to insist on maximalist demands, showing little readiness for a genuine peace agreement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chris Van Hollen shares photograph with Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was wrongly deported by the Trump administration A Democratic senator has met a man wrongly deported from the US to El Salvador and called on the Trump administration to speed up his return. Chris Van Hollen, the senator for Maryland, posted a photograph on X of him meeting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the United States in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting minutes before Van Hollen shared his post, saying, “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.” A spokeswoman for El Salvador's presidency said she had no further information. The meeting came hours after Mr Van Hollen said he was denied entry into a high-security El Salvador prison on Thursday while he was trying to check on Mr Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release. The Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about 3 kilometres (2 miles) from the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on. We were just denied entry into CECOT — the notorious prison in El Salvador where Mr. Abrego Garcia is being illegally held.We were there for one simple reason: to check on his well-being, which his family and lawyers have not been allowed to do. US government officials have said that Mr Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who was living in Maryland, has ties to the MS-13 gang, but his lawyers say the government has provided no evidence of that and Mr Abrego Garcia has never been charged with any crime related to such activity. Republicans have criticised Democrats for defending him and argued that his deportation is part of a larger effort to reduce crime. The Maryland senator told reporters on Wednesday that he met with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who said his government could not return Mr Abrego Garcia to the United States. “So today, I tried again to make contact with Mr Abrego Garcia by driving to the CECOT prison,” Mr Van Hollen said Thursday. “There has been no ability to find out anything about his health and well-being,” Van Hollen said. He said Abrego Garcia should be able to have contact with his lawyers under international law. “We won't give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected,” Mr Van Hollen said. He said there would be “many more” lawmakers coming to El Salvador. While Mr Van Hollen was denied entry, several House Republicans have visited the notorious gang prison in support of the Trump administration's efforts. Riley Moore, a West Virginia congressman, posted Tuesday evening that he had visited the prison where Mr Abrego Garcia is being held. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the US more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants — whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country's maximum-security gang prison just outside San Salvador. That prison is part of Mr Bukele's broader effort to crack down on the country's powerful street gangs, which has put 84,000 people behind bars and made the president extremely popular at home.</p>
