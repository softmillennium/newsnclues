                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's satellite internet service Starlink said it had a "network outage" on Thursday. The company said it was working on a solution. There were more than 60,000 reports of an outage on Downdetector, a site that logs issues. Musk apologized for the outage on his social media platform X and said, "Service will be restored shortly." Musk posted earlier Thursday that the company's direct-to-cell-phone service was "growing fast" following the announcement that T-Mobile's Starlink-powered satellite service was available to the public. T-Mobile said the T-Satellite service was built to keep phones connected "in places no carrier towers can reach." Starlink didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Starlink internet speeds and reliability decrease with popularity, a recent study found. It wasn't immediately clear if the T-Satellite service was affected by or involved in the outage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell went back and forth in front of the press Thursday over Trump's claims about cost overruns at the Fed headquarters in Washington. But Trump also suggested that he was abandoning any consideration of firing Powell, despite floating that unprecedented and legally contested idea earlier this month. "To do that is a big move, and I just don't think it's necessary," Trump told reporters after his brief spat with Powell. "I believe that he's going to do the right thing," Trump added. The president visited a construction area at the Fed where costly yearslong renovations of two historic Fed buildings are taking place. Shortly after his arrival, Trump and Powell were seen touring the site together, both wearing white hard hats. They approached reporters there, and Trump asserted that construction costs for the ongoing renovation of the two Fed buildings have topped $3.1 billion. "I haven't heard that from anybody," Powell replied. Trump responded, "So we're going to take a look. We're going to see what's happening, and it's got a long way." When a reporter asked if Powell could say anything that would get Trump to back off his criticism, the president said, "Well, I'd love him to lower interest rates." Trump struck a more conciliatory tone later Thursday, writing on Truth Social that it was a "Great Honor" to tour the site with Powell. Trump said before arriving that he would be joined by Republican Sens. Tim Scott and Thom Tillis, as well as a handful of administration officials, including Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Pulte is one of Powell's harshest critics and has been one of the Trump administration's most vocal advocates calling for him to be replaced. "Jerome Powell must resign," Pulte wrote on X earlier Thursday. Trump had been demanding that Powell immediately lower the benchmark interest rate while berating him with accusations of incompetence and political bias — even though it was Trump who originally nominated Powell for the role in 2017. The key interest rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but also spills over into multiple consumer products. The Fed lopped a full percentage point off that rate in the back half of 2024, taking it to a range of 4.25%-4.5%. But it has kept the rates steady since December — infuriating Trump, who claims that slashing rates will save the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars in interest costs. Markets largely believe that the central bank will stay on hold when it meets next week, but that it will likely cut rates in September and once more before the end of the year. Trump has tried to brand Powell with the nickname "Too Late." But Trump later backed off, saying it was "highly unlikely" that he would terminate Powell, "unless he has to leave for fraud." Trump's budget chief, Russ Vought, earlier this month alleged that Powell "has grossly mismanaged the Fed" as he questioned the "ostentatious" construction project. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is seen as a possible contender to replace Powell, said Monday on CNBC that the Fed under Powell requires a comprehensive review. And no prior appearance took place while the president was openly urging changes in monetary policy or threatening to investigate the Fed chair's conduct. The visit is also taking place as Trump seeks to divert attention from a growing controversy over his administration's handling of yet-undisclosed files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In-N-Out's billionaire owner, Lynsi Snyder, is moving her family out of California — the state where her grandparents founded the cult burger chain. Speaking on the "Relatable" podcast released Friday, Snyder said she was moving to Tennessee as the chain plans a southeastern expansion. Doing business is not easy here," Snyder said. While In-N-Out is opening an office in Tennessee as it plots an eastern expansion, Snyder clarified on Tuesday that the company's main headquarters would remain in Baldwin, California, near where the first location opened in 1948. In addition to our Baldwin Park office, we're expanding with an Eastern Territory office in Tennessee to support our growth," Snyder said at the beginning of a video titled "An update from Lynsi Snyder." "Where I raise my family has nothing to do with my love and appreciation for our customers in California," Snyder said. She cited COVID-era business restrictions, such as mask mandates and vaccine requirements, as particular elements of California policy that made it difficult to operate in the state. In 2021, health officials temporarily shut down several In-N-Out locations in California because the chain refused to require proof of COVID-19 vaccinations. Snyder didn't expand upon her current business challenges or the challenges she'd faced raising her four children in the state. "Now the bulk of our stores are still going to be here in California, but it will be wonderful having an office out there, growing out there, and being able to have the family and other people's families out there," Snyder said. While the chain is planning to expand in the Southeast with its operations in Tennessee, Snyder said she was "still saying no" to opening locations in Florida and other East Coast states. In-N-Out has more than 400 locations across eight states: California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho. Snyder said the company would continue to grow, but she's prioritizing sustainable expansion that maintains the quality of its products and service. "We don't want to be in every state, and we don't want to ever compromise our values and standards and the cornerstones that my grandparents laid down, so it's really just keeping those priorities at the forefront when we make decisions."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sent a note to employees on Thursday explaining why the company has cut thousands of jobs while generating huge profits and spending billions on AI. "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," Nadella wrote. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before." Microsoft this year has said it would shed about 15,000 employees and cut nearly 2,000 additional staff deemed underperformers. Microsoft is also spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure investments. The stock is up 21% this year, and hit a record earlier in July. "By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving—our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella wrote. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs." That year, Microsoft announced its first massive layoff of the post-pandemic era and also paused raises. This time, the CEO took a more balanced approach. As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead. Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations. These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful. By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving—our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right. We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before. The success we want to achieve will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of "unlearning" and "learning." It requires us to meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function. This is inherently hard, and few companies can do both. But I have full confidence that we can, and we will once again find the resolve, courage, and clarity to deliver on our mission in this new paradigm. When Microsoft is succeeding, the world around us must succeed too. This is why each of us chose to be here, and as a company it's how we earn our social permission to operate. When Bill founded Microsoft, he envisioned not just a software company, but a software factory, unconstrained by any single product or category. That idea has guided us for decades. We must reimagine our mission for a new era. What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before. That's the empowerment our mission enables, creating local surplus in every company, community, and country. To deliver on our mission, we need to stay focused on our three business priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. We are doubling down on the fundamentals while continuing to define new frontiers in AI. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world, and without them we don't have permission to move forward. We've made substantial progress across SFI, QEI, and Engineering Thrive this year, and they remain top priorities to ensure that we continuously improve our innovation velocity and our operational metrics. We will reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI—infrastructure, to the app platform, to apps and agents. Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Our performance this past year has positioned us well. Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade—the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. It starts with each of us as individuals and our personal drive to learn, improve, and get better every day. Professional rewards, growth, and pride in our craft will always be the prime drivers. Beyond that, we each have the opportunity to connect our personal passion and philosophy of how we derive meaning from the work we do with Microsoft's mission to empower the world. This is what makes it all worthwhile. It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. It reminds me of the early '90s, when PCs and productivity software became standard in every home and every desk! That's exactly where we are now with AI. Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you'll say: "That's when I learned the most. That's when I made my biggest impact. That's when I was part of something transformational." Our future won't be defined by what we've built before, but by what we empower others to build now. I look forward to sharing more at Earnings next week and addressing your questions at our next Town Hall.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday denied claims that he wants to wreck Elon Musk's companies and their work with the U.S. government. "Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government," he said in a post to Truth Social. The pair have continued a war of words that began with Musk's opposition to Trump's signature spending bill and evolved into the Tesla CEO attacking the president's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In June, the president threatened to cut some of Musk's government contracts as the two clashed over Trump's "big beautiful bill" and their relationship unraveled. On Wednesday, the tech CEO said on a second-quarter earnings call that automaker Tesla could experience a "few rough quarters" due to tariff costs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle benefits at the end of September. Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that the administration doesn't want federal agencies to work with Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI. Musk's aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX also has massive contract exposure in the U.S. The reusable rocket maker has received over $22 billion from work with the federal government since 2008, according to FedScout, which researches federal spending and government contracts. That includes contracts from NASA, the Air Force and Space Force, among others, but does not reflect contract revenue from confidential initiatives. The Trump administration recently reviewed SpaceX federal contracts to see if there was potential for cuts, according to The Wall Street Journal. Tesla has reported $12.24 billion in sales of "automotive regulatory credits," or environmental credits, since 2015, according to an evaluation of the EV maker's financial filings by FedScout CEO Geoff Orazem and CNBC. This included $439 million in regulatory credit sales during the second quarter of 2025. Such incentives were largely derived from federal and state regulations in the U.S. that require automakers to sell some number of low-emission vehicles or buy credits from companies such as Tesla, which often have an excess. Regulatory credit sales go straight to Tesla's bottom line. In its quarterly financial filing Thursday, Tesla mentioned the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by its initials, OBBBA, in the Risk Factors section. "The loss of previously available tax credits and carbon offset mechanisms may further negatively impact our financial results," Tesla's filing said. The company added that "provisions of the OBBBA could affect battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting demand." A previous version of this story misnamed the bill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Helping the federal government pay down the country's soaring national debt is now as easy as reimbursing your friend for a round of drinks. Earlier this year, the US Treasury Department began accepting Venmo payments on Pay.gov, where individuals can go online to contribute gifts to reduce the public debt. The department had already accepted payments via credit card, debit card, and bank account, and it has accepted charitable contributions for decades. According to Treasury data, the government has brought in roughly $120,000 a month in charitable contributions to pay down the debt since 2020. In the first five months of this year, the department brought in about $434,500. Reached by Business Insider, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service did not immediately provide comment on the change. According to the Wayback Machine, Venmo was added as a payment method between February 22 and March 8 of this year. NPR reporter Jack Corbett first identified the change on Wednesday. The United States government is more than $36 trillion in debt, a number that's only expected to grow in the coming years. President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," recently approved by Congress, is projected to add an additional $3.4 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quant hedge fund managers are experiencing one of the most prolonged droughts in recent memory. Systematic hedge funds have suffered a steady decline since June that managers are struggling to wrap their heads around. "It kinda crept up on everyone as there weren't many disastrous days, but it's been small loss after small loss," said one executive at a quant trading firm, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. "No one seems to know why this is happening." Qube Research & Technologies, the $28 billion quant firm started by former Credit Suisse traders, has lost 5% in July in its flagship fund through last Friday, a person close to the manager said. Point72's Cubist unit has experienced one of its worst stretches since the pandemic slammed global markets in March 2020, two people familiar with the firm said. Two Sigma's Spectrum fund is down roughly 2% this month through the end of last week, a person close to the manager said. At Man Group, the firm's AHL Dimension fund — a multi-asset systematic strategy — was down 2.5% in July through Tuesday, according to the London-based manager's website. From the start of June through this Tuesday, equity quant managers lost 4.2%, according to a report from Goldman Sachs' prime services unit. Quant distress doesn't necessarily signal broader market trouble, but severe losses can spill over — especially if a large firm dumps positions and sparks contagion. The S&P 500 is up nearly 8% since June, and the VIX — a measure of volatility — is at its lowest point since February. Luckily for the quant space, it had been a strong year performance-wise until summer began, so the sector's annual returns are still, on average, outpacing their human rivals. It has periodic slumps like any other trade, but they tend to be sharp and quick. Overcrowding can exacerbate losses, as it did during the so-called Quant Quake, in which systematic hedge funds such as Goldman Sachs' famed quantitative division suffered heavy, sudden losses in August 2007 while the rest of the market rallied. What's unusual this summer, industry sources say, is the accumulation of small losses over weeks. "This has been a long, slow bleed across the complex." That pattern isn't consistent with a large liquidation and its aftershocks, though losses so far this week have been more intense, including a 0.6% decline on Tuesday, according to Goldman Sachs. Intense losses could quickly pile up if sizable funds start cutting their exposure. "It's survival of the fittest, basically," said one quant trader at a multi-billion-dollar manager.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Musk, who once described himself as "First Buddy" after spending heavily to help elect Trump, has seen his business empire affected by the president's economic policies. A Washington Post analysis published in February said that Musk's companies had received at least $38 billion in federal contracts, subsidies, tax credits, and loans over the last two decades. Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" ends a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles later this year. On Tesla's recent earnings call, its chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said Americans looking to buy an EV should do so now. Trump's Truth Social post comes a day after the White House suggested xAI's government contracts could receive scrutiny. When asked if Trump supported federal agencies contracting with Musk's artificial intelligence firm, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded, "I don't think so, no." The Pentagon recently announced a contract with xAI worth up to $200 million. Musk's company also recently announced products aimed at governmental needs. Musk played a vital role in helping Trump take back the White House in 2024, spending upward of $250 million to boost Trump and establishing his own America PAC. Since then, Musk has floated starting a third party, named the America Party, which could complicate Trump's efforts to help Republicans maintain control of Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia said Thursday that data centers built with smuggled chips are a "losing proposition" and that it does not support unauthorized products. The statement came in response to a Financial Times report that at least $1 billion worth of its artificial intelligence chips illegally entered China. "Trying to cobble together datacenters from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically," a spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. "Datacenters require service and support, which we provide only to authorized NVIDIA products." According to the FT report, at least $1 billion worth of the company's chips entered China as President Donald Trump rolled out restrictions on shipments of the company's H20 chips to the world's second-largest economy. Nvidia's B200 chips, which are prohibited from being sold to China, have become popular on the black market despite restrictions, the FT reported, citing sales contracts, company filings and people familiar with the deals. Chinese distributors began selling the chips in May to data center suppliers whose customers include Chinese AI groups, the report said. China serves as a major market for chipmakers, but the U.S. has restricted many advanced processor sales there due to national security concerns. Last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it would soon resume selling its H20 chips to China after a breakthrough with the Trump administration on regulations. The U.S. government had effectively blocked sales to China in April when it told the company it would require a license. The chip was created to work around previous export controls on China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Thursday that TikTok will go dark for Americans unless China agrees to give the U.S. more control over the popular short-form video app. TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divested from it. Lawmakers had grown concerned that the Chinese government could access sensitive data from American users or manipulate content on the platform. Last month, President Donald Trump extended the deadline for a third time since taking office in January. Now, ByteDance has until Sept. 17. to divest TikTok's U.S. business. That's something Donald Trump is willing to do," Lutnick said. He added that if China doesn't approve the deal, "then TikTok is going to go dark." CNBC has reached out to TikTok for comment. It's not clear where deal talks stand. Trump told Fox News in an interview late last month that he has a group of "very wealthy people" ready to buy the platform. Earlier this month, the private equity firm Blackstone pulled out of a consortium bid for TikTok's U.S. operations, according to a report from Reuters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian luxury house Moncler said it's currently relying on "very slight price increases" to offset the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, but warned that broader economic weakness could cause it to delay its new store openings next year. The Milan-headquartered retailer said Wednesday that it had raised prices by "mid-single-digit" percentages for the second half of 2025 and will raise them for the first half of next year, while adding that it was awaiting further clarity on U.S. levies before setting out its full strategy for 2026. "We normally finalize our pricing strategy for the full Winter 2026 by October, more or less. So it's still early," Luciano Santel, group chief corporate and supply officer, said during an earnings call accompanying its second-quarter results. Shares of Moncler were down 4% by 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. Chief Business Strategy and Global Market Officer Roberto Eggs said he intended for those further price rises to be "more conservative," as the firm seeks to reconcile higher input costs with customer retention, but noted that it was also dependent on macro trends and currency movements. "Clearly, the pricing today for consumers is a concern. I think we need to pay even more attention on this," he said. Eggs also noted that the business would remain flexible on its plans for a dozen or so new store openings etched for 2026, based on the macro outlook and wider recovery of the beleaguered luxury sector. Regarding 2026, the plan is not completely finalized, so we have some flexibility, ... in case things will not get better, to postpone some of the openings," he said, adding that those plans would also be set by October. Moncler on Wednesday posted a dip in second-quarter sales after the market close, as weak tourist flows weighed on otherwise robust domestic demand in the key U.S. and China markets. Group revenues fell 1% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to 396.6 million euros ($536.7 million) in the three months to June 30, below the 427.2 million forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll. "To tell you that if this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you," Eggs said, noting other initiatives, such as a partnership with luxury department store Nordstom, which helped boost demand. The company attributed it to a rebalancing of the Japanese yen, with Japan the only Asian country to record negative sales growth, as well as soft tourist spending in Europe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actress Sydney Sweeney helped bring American Eagle Outfitters shares into the latest round of meme stock mania on Thursday. The "Euphoria" and "Anyone But You" star will headline a fall campaign for the clothing retailer, American Eagle announced Wednesday. Thursday's jump makes American Eagle poised to join the ranks of a new class of meme stocks that has emerged this week. American Eagle's high short interest and inherent brand recognition make it a prime candidate for meme-obsessed individual investors, who have been sending specific stocks on volatile rides in recent days. Earlier in the week, meme traders had focused attention on Opendoor Technologies and Kohl's. More than 13% of American Eagle shares available for trading are sold short, according to FactSet data. The stock generated discussion among users on the Wall Street Bets Reddit page, a popular forum for retail investors, beginning Wednesday night. As investors betting against the stock move to cover their hefty short position, it can fuel some artificial buying in the shares. Sweeney's campaign will center on American Eagle's denim jeans, according to the company. That comes as retailers lean into the growing preference for the fabric amid a boom in popularity for Western styles. "With Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure," Jennifer Foyle, the company's president and executive creative director, said in a statement. Thursday's action can provide a reprieve for the battered stock, whose shares have tumbled around 35% so far in 2025 through Wednesday's close.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New York startup that has built an AI agent for handling admin tasks in the construction industry has raised $40 million in funding. Trunk Tools takes unstructured construction industry data — such as documents, drawings, blueprints, and schedules — and turns it into structured datasets to feed into its AI. Construction workers can then ask the AI a question in layperson's language, such as, "Does this door require electricity?" "So it's a ChatGPT for your job site," Trunk Tools' CEO, Sarah Buchner, told Business Insider. In the last 18 months, Trunk Tools has rolled out AI agents that can autonomously handle entire workflows, such as scheduling and project tracking. Buchner told BI that the startup has built custom large language models because general-purpose AI struggles with construction data. "We trained multiple models completely from scratch from construction drawings, construction objects, room boundaries, and so on," Buchner said. The company mostly sells its software as a subscription service, but some of its newer AI agents are charged per business outcome. Buchner compared Trunk Tools' placement of its AI specialists into its customers' organizations to manage behavioral change and adoption from the inside to what "Palantir does with forward-deployed engineering." Insight Partners led the startup's $40 million Series B round, which included participation from Redpoint Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, Stepstone, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, and Prudence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the sound of workers mourning their choice to study English, psychology, or anything other than computer science, as a hiring war in tech escalates and AI engineers write their own tickets. As Big Tech and startups race to dominate the next frontier of artificial intelligence, they're offering money, perks, and equity to a limited pool of technical talent who will join them. Tech salaries range from eye-popping to borderline obscene. At OpenAI, technical staff can pull in up to $530,000 a year, according to data from federal filings. Over at Anthropic, research engineers earn up to $690,000. The numbers come from filings that companies must submit to the Department of Labor when hiring foreign workers through the H-1B visa program, which allows them to bring in 85,000 specialized workers annually through a lottery system. Because tech companies typically guard their compensation details closely, these government-mandated disclosures provide a peek into pay scales. The numbers reflect annual salaries alone, excluding the stock options, signing bonuses, and other perks that can often double or triple total compensation packages. For this list, Business Insider pulled filings from some of the top AI startups valued at over $2 billion, excluding companies in robotics, defense, and autonomous driving. See how your salary stacks up against someone's from Cohere, Glean, Thinking Machines Lab, and more. A spokesperson for Mistral said that while some employees do fall within that range, a more accurate salary band for US-based roles is $150,000 to $450,000. A recruiter at OpenAI said more accurate salary bands are listed on the company's careers page. According to those listings, research engineers earn between $295,000 and $530,000, while software engineers make between $255,000 and $590,000. A Synthesia spokesman said that the London-founded company is hiring in its New York office, given that more than half of its revenue comes from the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine was able to supercharge the production of a key homemade artillery system through a new way allies are employing to arm Ukraine faster and cheaper. It could be the new template for helping Ukraine arm itself against Russia. Ukraine has significantly boosted its production of the 2S22 Bohdana 155mm howitzers with funds from allies under the new funding system, industry bodies that represent Ukrainian defense companies told Business Insider. For much of this conflict, Western partners have sent their weapons to Ukraine, emptying stockpiles. This new model involves partners purchasing weapons for Kyiv's forces directly from Ukrainian manufacturers. The new system, pioneered by NATO member Denmark and nicknamed the Danish Model, has helped Ukraine get more weapons for it to fight back against Russia's invasion. In particular, it has had a really "significant impact" on Bohdana production, Serhiy Goncharov, the CEO of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI), told Business Insider. The Bohdana is a NATO-standard, self-propelled howitzer produced by Ukraine's Kramatorsk Heavy Duty Machine Tool Building Plant, and Goncharov described it as "a symbol of resistance and the symbol of Ukrainian industry." Funding weapons that are made in Ukraine is important given current challenges. So even funding new Western weapons doesn't help Ukraine in the short term. The model is also useful for NATO, with many countries in the alliance wanting to maintain and grow their own arsenals, worried that Russian aggression could someday extend beyond Ukraine. Goncharov said that the Danish model has helped Ukrainian industry scale production by giving it the finance it needs, as usually it is limited to what Ukraine's defense ministry can afford, which is out of sync with industrial capacity. That financial support, he said, gives producers "more confidence" to increase their production, knowing the funding is there. In addition to the homemade howitzers, the Danish model has helped fund more drones, as well as anti-tank and anti-ship missile systems. A host of countries, like Sweden and Iceland, are giving money to Ukraine through the model, which is growing. In 2024, the model finalized procurements for weaponry worth more than $550 million, and Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said last month that support through this model is expected to reach more than $1.7 billion this year. Troels Lund Poulsen, Denmark's defense minister, told Business Insider in March that the model so far "has been a great success" and that under it, the weapon prices are "quite low compared to buying the artillery systems in Europe." Goncharov called the model a "new vision of how you can support Ukraine" and said that work on the Bohdana was a big "success story." He said NAUDI has a list of weapons that it is ready to make more of through the Danish model or a similar model, including artillery, armored vehicles, jamming systems, and drones. And the capacity exists for increased total production, he said. Within Ukraine's defense industry, "there are huge hopes and expectations in terms of the Danish model, and we hope that far more countries will join it," Fedirko said. He said that would strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, "so this is why the private market is very much looking forward to its further unfolding." Private companies have been essential to Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion. The domestic defense sector has exploded, developing and testing new weaponry that is then purchased by Ukraine's military and sometimes by units buying directly. Fedirko said there are around 700 market players in Ukraine's defense industry, with just 76 of those being state-owned. The Danish model helps with a problem that is facing Ukraine's defense industry and military, which is that its defense companies have the ability to produce far more weaponry than Ukraine's government can afford to buy. The Danish model lets Europe arm Ukraine without emptying its stockpiles. "The European Union should understand that we are not fighting not only for Ukraine, that we are fighting for Europe."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altman was speaking to podcaster Theo Von in an interview that aired Wednesday when he was asked how parents could prepare their children for the AI age. Altman said what really worried him was the psychological impact addictive social media platforms could have on children. "I do have worries about kids in technology. I think this short video feed dopamine hit, it feels like it's probably messing with kids' brain development in a super deep way," he said. Altman said in his interview with Von that when it comes to AI, he was more concerned about how the older generation would adapt to it. The younger generation, meanwhile, "will be fine," Altman said. "If you look at the history of the world here, when there's new technology, people that grow up with it, they're always fluent. They always learn the new kind of jobs," Altman said. "But if you're a 50-year-old and you have to learn to do things in a very different way, that doesn't always work," he added. "Even if ChatGPT gives way better advice than any human therapist, something about collectively deciding we're going to live our lives the way AI tells us feels bad and dangerous," Altman said. Jonathan Haidt, a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business, told BI in January that social media apps were "severely damaging children in the Western world." Haidt is best known for his book "The Anxious Generation" where he argued that social media and smartphones were affecting the attention spans of young people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors clamouring for a budget Tesla just got more intel about it. The EV giant's CEO, Elon Musk, said on Wednesday that Tesla's long-awaited affordable model will resemble the Model Y. Musk was speaking to investors in Tesla's latest earnings call when an analyst asked for more details about the budget-friendly EV Musk has long been touting. Musk did not give further details on the model or its release date. Musk said during the earnings call that the "biggest obstacle" to getting more people to own EVs is that they "don't have enough money in their bank account to buy it." Musk told the analyst that the car's self-driving features would make it even more affordable for customers. "It will be a very big deal when people can release their car to the fleet and have it earn money for them," Musk continued. Musk said he felt confident that Tesla's customers would be able to rent out their vehicles "next year, in the US at least." Back in January, Musk said at Tesla's fourth quarter earnings call that he expects his vehicles to operate with unsupervised full-self-driving in several US cities by the end of this year, and "probably everywhere" in North America next year. If you have an Airbnb and you can rent out your home when you are not there, or rent out a guest room, or guest house, or something like that. The affordability of your house is much greater," he said on Wednesday. Tesla first launched the Model Y in 2020. In January, an updated version was released in China, the US, Canada, the UK, and mainland Europe. The Model Y was the world's best-selling car in 2023, though it has since ceded ground to its Chinese rivals. Tesla analysts said earlier this year that releasing a cheaper EV could help the company shore up its position against the low-cost EVs that its Chinese rivals are selling. Musk's company has struggled with sales in China. In June, Chinese tech giant Xiaomi said it received over 200,000 orders in 3 minutes for its new YU7 electric SUV.</p>
