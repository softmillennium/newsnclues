A three-judge panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed with a lower court's ruling that President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to redefine birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The lawsuit was originally brought before a district court in Washington State by the attorneys general of Washington, Oregon, Arizona and Illinois. Trump's order sought to define the term “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” differently, by claiming it applies only to children born in the United States who have at least one parent with citizenship. That interpretation has not been enforced for over 125 years, when the Supreme Court ruled that all children born in the U.S., regardless of their parents' citizenship status, are citizens. In addition to noting that precedent, which has been upheld in numerous cases since it was established, the court panel on Wednesday noted that the Trump administration's redefining of the term contradicted its “ordinary meaning” at the time it was adopted. But in reference to nations, ‘jurisdiction' was also defined as the ‘[p]ower of governing or legislating; the right of making or enforcing laws; the power or right of exercising authority;' … Defendants [the Trump administration] point to no contrary dictionary definitions that define jurisdiction in terms of allegiance and protection. After Trump issued his executive order in January, several district courts ruled in favor of similar arguments that it was clearly unconstitutional. The administration brought those cases to the U.S. Supreme Court, which, in June, ruled that individual district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions without certain conditions being met. The high court did not rule on whether Trump's executive order was constitutional. The Supreme Court suggested that lower-courts can issue nationwide injunctions through class-action lawsuits, possibly across multiple jurisdictional lines. In addition to a Washington State-based ruling on the matter, a federal district court in New Hampshire has placed a nationwide injunction on the executive order, based on a class-action suit filed in the state. He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a post on X. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, perhaps anticipating that the Trump administration will likely bring this case to the Supreme Court, too, promised to continue working to protect the rights of those who gained citizenship through 14th Amendment protections. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul also commented on the ruling, writing in a statement that “No president can arbitrarily pick and choose which children born in the United States are allowed to be citizens of this country.” “Birthright citizenship has been enshrined in our Constitution in unambiguous language for more than 150 years, and no president has the authority to override the Constitution,” Raoul added.

Approximately 100 incarcerated Iranian trans people are missing, presumed dead, after an Israeli strike on the infamous Evin Prison. Authorities inside Iran, and political prisoners from inside the prison, are saying these missing individuals were killed in the bombardment. Israeli officials and media have framed the attack on Evin as “symbolic”: Israel wanted to show Iranians that it supported their liberation by bombing the jail where many political prisoners are held. When I first came out as trans, I used to believe the story that Israeli pinkwashing tells us: that Israel is a safe haven for LGBTQ peoples. It was easy to believe: rainbow flags, Tel Aviv Pride, all of it seemed so magical and fun. These narratives showed up on many Persian-language queer and feminist pages. And when you're a queer person in Iran, terrified and trying to survive, you're desperate for something, anything, that looks like hope. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. But then I learned what it's really like to be queer under Israeli rule. What life is like for the millions of Palestinians who live under Israel's control. I learned about how Israel blackmails queer Palestinians, threatening to out them to force them into spying. I learned how their bombs don't check who's queer before the Israeli military drops them on Gaza, how genocide doesn't distinguish between straight and gay. I learned that queer Israelis also suffer from a homophobic government that calls them a threat to the family and refuses to let them get married. I learned that queer Palestinians live under siege and occupation with no rainbow safety anywhere. It took me a short time to learn all of this, but looking back, it makes me see how powerful the Israeli pinkwashing campaign was that it could even affect those of us inside Iran. And now I learn that 100 trans Iranians are gone, killed in a single strike. I don't know why those 100 trans people were incarcerated at Evin. Some may have been there because they were involved in political activism. Others may have been accused of public indecency due to their gender presentation, or sex work they engaged in for survival. Trans women are targeted disproportionately by these kinds of laws worldwide. We don't have many stories of those women in part because it seems their families haven't wanted to talk about them. The trans ward in Evin Prison has always been infamous for its cruelty. Trans prisoners are denied yard time, and there have been countless reports of sexual harassment by guards. It's the only trans ward in Tehran and holds transfem prisoners. I organized secret gatherings for queer and trans people, hosted underground workshops about DIY hormones and safety, and helped friends navigate the brutal court process to get the paperwork they needed to survive. I crowdfunded for unhoused trans people when they had nowhere to go. We had our own small network — group chats where we would warn each other about police presence in streets, share info about queer-friendly shops, or just send memes to keep ourselves going. We threw small underground parties, blasting all the queer bangers, drinking home-grown wine in paper cups, kissing in corners, sometimes sleeping around carelessly just to feel alive for a moment in a world that wanted us dead. We helped each other with makeup in cramped bedrooms, snuck out to the mountains to breathe for a day without stares, and found moments of real joy even under a system trying to crush us. One day I received a phone call from an unknown number. They told me I was causing trouble and the state would only tolerate so much. The trans ward of Evin Prison could have been where I ended up. Now I throw queer club nights and build community here in Stockholm, Sweden, too — safe from police raids, safe from being arrested. Yet when that trans ward was bombed, the guilt hit again. I'm here, breathing, trying to live my queer life, surrounded by a normal state of the world. I'm expected to work as if nothing has happened. They are going to be faceless victims, at least for now. But we can remember that they were here. The Iranian state and its prisons are a nightmare, but Israel is not our savior. We deserve better than being used as rainbow shields for bombs. We deserve a world where queerness isn't a tool for war, where trans Iranians can live free without fearing either the Islamic Republic's prisons or Israeli airstrikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five members of Canada's 2018 world junior team were acquitted after a judge ruled the complainant's evidence was not credible in a case that sparked national debate All five men – Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart and Cal Foote – were found not guilty on all offences. The charges stemmed from an encounter in a London, Ontario, hotel room in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala celebrating the team's world junior championship victory. “We will carefully review justice Carroccia's decision, and as this case is still within the appeal period, we have no further comments to make about the decision at this time,” she added. The case cast a long shadow over Canadian hockey, placing not only the players – most of whom went on to professional careers – under scrutiny, but also Hockey Canada, which later admitted it had maintained two secret funds to pay settlements in sexual assault claims. In her remarks on Thursday, Judge Carroccia pointed out inconsistencies in the accused's testimony, including around how much she had to drink. In early 2024, police charged each man with one count of sexual assault, and McLeod with being party to an offence for allegedly aiding the assaults, after an incident on 19 June 2018 in a hotel room in Ontario. The alleged offences took place after the woman, who was 20 at the time and is identified as “EM” in the case, reportedly met McLeod at a local bar, then had what she says was consensual sex in his hotel room – only for him to invite other players to join without her consent. Text messages shown to the court indicate McLeod asked a group chat of players if anyone wanted a “three-way” and gave out his room number. EM said she was intoxicated, naked and frightened when they entered, and prosecutors alleged that EM did not consent to various sexual acts that then occurred. Over nine days of testimony in early May, the woman – now 27 – said the sudden appearance of many large men surrounding her caused her to go on “auto-pilot” and take on a “porn star” persona as a form of self-protection. Prosecutors alleged that the acts constituted sexual assault, telling the court that McLeod, Hart and Dubé obtained oral sex from the woman, McLeod had sex with her a second time, Formenton did too, Dubé slapped her naked buttocks and Foote did the splits over her head causing his genitals to “graze” her face. EM also said in her testimony that the men placed a sheet on the floor and told her to masturbate while she was slapped and spat on. The 10 defence attorneys, two allocated to each of the men, alleged in cross-examination that EM was consenting the entire night, and even taunting the men for not all wanting to have intercourse – and that if she cried it was due to feeling rejected that not everyone seemingly wanted to participate. Hart, the only one of the five men to testify in court, said he asked EM for oral sex and that was she “super excited” to be in the room and “forward” with her offers for sex. One of McLeod's lawyers, David Humphrey, said in cross-examination that EM demanded sex and suggested she said to them: “Come on, you've got a girl here. EM denied saying it or asking them to have sex with her. “That doesn't even sound like how I would usually speak,” she told the court. A central feature of the trial was two “consent videos” that McLeod recorded on his phone an hour apart after the alleged assaults occurred. In the videos, EM says everything that took place was consensual. The Criminal Code says if an accused person does not take “reasonable steps” to obtain consent given the circumstances, then simply believing a complainant consented is not a valid defence. The trial was also beset by a series of scandals. Police dropped their initial investigation, which began in June 2018, after seeing surveillance footage of EM walking steadily and the two “consent videos”, which made them suspect EM was not too drunk to consent, as she told the initial police investigation. The organisation settled with her and launched its own internal investigation. A furore then erupted when, after a leak to the media, Hockey Canada admitted the existence of two secret funds to pay settlements for sexual assault claims. Police then reopened an investigation and charged the five men. But two separate juries were dismissed by Carroccia, the Ontario superior court judge overseeing the case – the first after a juror said a defence lawyer spoke to them at lunch; the second when they told Carroccia they felt two defence lawyers were mocking them in whispers. As she concluded her ruling, Carroccia reiterated that the court's task was not to determine whether something happened, but whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. “This is not about morality or optics,” she said.</p>

Speaking to MSNBC's The Best People With Nicolle Wallace podcast, Daniels addressed the president's supporters, saying: “I hope you're losing tons of money, those of you who thought this would be OK. My question is, ‘What are you guys going to do about it? Daniels continued by saying he believed Trump's slate of tariffs would cost him supporters. “‘Wait a minute, the grocery bill is what? “At the end of the day it would be about just the price of eggs, did it go up or down, because that's what he told me he was going to lower the price of eggs or my grocery bill,” Daniels continued, before describing the president as a “snake-oil salesman.” Daniels said he had been surprised by the pace of change since Trump took office again in January. “We have normalised verbal abuse on the internet. We've normalised bullying; much as the woke generation tried to, you know, change that, it's back … “I mean, nobody has great things to say about politicians. But ideally, we're supposed to elect the best of us. Daniels's most recent projects were TV series American Rust and A Man in Full. He plays Ronald Reagan opposite Jared Harris as Mikhail Gorbachev in a forthcoming take on the 1986 Reykjavik Summit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Siarhei Tsikhanouski and his wife Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya are reunited after five years apart. Mr. Tsikhanouski was suddenly released from prison last month.Anna Liminowicz/The Globe and Mail After five years of meagre meals in his Belarusian prison cell, Siarhei Tsikhanouski began to suspect he might soon be released when the food got better. For long stretches, the country's most famous political prisoner was fed so little that he lost half his body weight. I am free,” he told her, just before crossing from Belarus to Lithuania in the company of U.S. diplomats. It's a movement that Mr. Tsikhanouski can claim to have helped launch, but one that has coalesced around his wife during his absence. Mr. Tsikhanouski changed so much during his time in prison that the couple's 9-year-old daughter didn't immediately recognize her father. When she saw me after prison, I was a slim man with no beard. My spouse had to say: ‘That's your dad,'” Mr. Tsikhanouski recounted in an interview this week, sitting alongside Ms. Tsikhanouskaya at her office in Vilnius. Mr. Tsikhanouski shows what he looked like before being arrested in 2020. He lost so much weight in prison, his own daughter did not recognize him.Anna Liminowicz/The Globe and Mail Though they've been married for more than 20 years, the world went through extraordinary changes while Mr. Tsikhanouski was in prison. Five years later, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya is a veteran politician and diplomat, recognized by many as their country's legitimate president-in-exile. “I have a million questions for her,” Mr. Tsikhanouski says, returning the gaze. The struggle for democracy in Belarus – a landlocked country of nine million people wedged between Russia, Ukraine and the eastern edge of NATO – was a major international issue in 2020, though the spotlight has since shifted to other crises. It was Mr. Tsikhanouski, now 46, who set the family on this course by deciding to challenge Mr. Lukashenko's decades-old grip on power by running as an opposition leader. “We co-ordinate our watches,” he says with a laugh. “But I don't work in Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's office.” Others see it as a signal that Mr. Lukashenko wants to distance himself from ally Russia by showing U.S. President Donald Trump that he, unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin, is willing to make deals. Mr. Tsikhanouski was a nightclub promoter until 2019, when he launched a YouTube channel featuring clips of him talking to Belarusians about the problems they faced, ranging from potholes to corruption. Police began stopping his vehicle as he drove around the country filming interviews, and he was repeatedly thrown into jail for 15-day stints of what's known in Belarus as “administrative detention.” Mr. Tsikhanouski responded by hardening his attacks on the Soviet-style regime. On May 5, 2020, the day after he was released from another prison stint, Mr. Tsikhanouski announced he would run for president against Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since the country's only free and fair election in 1994. Ms. Tsikhanouskaya, then a political novice, registered in his place. In 2019, Mr. Tsikhanouski launched a YouTube channel featuring clips of him talking to Belarusians about the problems they faced.Anna Liminowicz/The Globe and Mail He said Belarus “wasn't ready to vote for a woman” and had Mr. Tsikhanouski jailed again on a string of charges such as “organizing riots” and “inciting hatred” that this time grew into an 18-year prison sentence. Two other leading opposition candidates, Viktar Babaryka and Valery Tsepkalo, were also barred from running. Mr. Babaryka received a 14-year jail sentence, and Mr. Tsepkalo fled into exile. Many Belarusians believe she won the race with upwards of 60 per cent of the vote, and consider her their country's duly elected president. But the regime, which has complete control of the electoral process and media, announced Mr. Lukashenko had won a sixth term with an improbable 80.1 per cent of ballots cast. Believing Mr. Lukashenko had stolen the election, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya's supporters launched weeks of protests in Minsk and other cities. In a 2020 interview with The Globe and Mail, she conspicuously named Princess Diana, another woman trapped in circumstances beyond her control, as her political hero. But five years in the job have given her new confidence and poise. Ms. Tsikhanouskaya in Brest, Belarus, during her 2020 run for president.Sergei Grits/The Associated Press Where her husband gives off-the-cuff answers, heaping praise on Mr. Trump “the businessman who is good at deals” for his freedom, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya keeps her eye on the longer game. She interjects to point out that it was not just the efforts of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kellogg, but five years of Western sanctions and political pressure on the Lukashenko regime that precipitated the release of Mr. Tsikhanouski and 13 other political prisoners on June 21. It's a thrust-and-parry that repeats itself throughout an hour-long joint interview with The Globe. Ms. Tsikhanouskaya, the diplomat and politician, making sure her less-polished husband doesn't stray too far off script. He says he will soon resume posting anti-regime videos on his YouTube channel, and will expand his efforts to TikTok as well. His goal, he said, is to burst the “information bubble” that Belarusians and Russians both live in, a sphere dominated by pro-regime narratives that allow Mr. Lukashenko and Mr. Putin to rule almost unchallenged. I reinspire them to fight for our freedom,” he says. In doing so, Mr. Tsikhanouski makes it clear that he won't be taking orders from his wife. Not working against or competing with her – it's about supporting and helping each other.” He's already planning a solo trip to Canada and the U.S. this autumn to meet with Belarusian exiles and consult with them about next moves. Though he sounds at times like someone relaunching a political career, Mr. Tsikhanouski, like Ms. Tsikhanouskaya, says he has no intention of running for the presidency again if and when democracy is brought to Belarus. Both husband and wife say that the hardest part about Mr. Tsikhanouski's sudden release has been finding time to reconnect as a family. “It's really hard to make time for talking,” Mr. Tsikhanouski says. Mr. Tsikhanouski's release has unleashed a mix of powerful feelings. The couple say they will now work to reconnect their family.Anna Liminowicz/The Globe and Mail Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Thailand launched airstrikes against Cambodian military targets along their long-disputed border, escalating tensions between the Southeast Asian neighbors. Thailand also accused Cambodia of launching rockets into civilian areas. Thailand's health ministry said that at least 12 people, including 11 civilians and one soldier, have been killed in clashes with Cambodian troops. • Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended this month and could face dismissal after the leak of a phone call she had with Cambodia's powerful former leader Hun Sen, in which she appeared to criticize her army's actions in the dispute. They share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border — largely mapped by France when it ruled Cambodia — that has periodically seen military clashes and been the source of political tensions. Cambodia's Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts has expressed its “strongest condemnation of the aggression” carried out by Thailand's military, saying that the targeting of Preah Vihear temple — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — “may constitute war crimes.” Cambodia's defense ministry said earlier Thursday that a Thai F-16 fighter jet had dropped two bombs on a road near the 11th-century temple as clashes erupted at several flashpoints along the two countries' disputed border. Japan has expressed “deep concern” over the ongoing military clashes between Cambodia and Thailand, urging both sides to show “maximum restraint” and resolve tensions through dialogue. If you're just joining us, Thailand has launched airstrikes against what it says were Cambodian military targets along the two countries' long-disputed border. It has also accused Cambodia of firing rockets into Thai civilian areas, resulting in at least one death. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Thursday urged his country's citizens living in Thailand to “maintain their morality and dignity” and to return home if they are “facing pressure from discrimination.” “I appeal to all Cambodian citizens to maintain their morality and dignity, and to avoid discrimination or any actions that could affect the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia, Thai companies, and Thai citizens living in Cambodia,” he said in a statement posted on Facebook. Thailand's health ministry said Thursday that 12 people, including 11 civilians and one Thai soldier, have been killed in clashes with Cambodian troops on the disputed border. A further 31 people, including 24 civilians and seven soldiers, have been injured, the ministry said. Cambodian authorities have not yet reported any fatalities on their side. French officials, during their colonial rule in Cambodia, drew a map of the border in 1907 that Thailand contested — saying France did not fully demarcate certain areas, including the sites of several temples. Here's a look at the events leading to today's conflict: 2011: Thai and Cambodian troops clashed in an area surrounding the Preah Vihear temple, displacing thousands of people on both sides and killing at least 20 people. May 28: Tensions resurfaced when a Cambodian soldier was killed during a brief clash between Thai and Cambodian troops in the contested border area of the Emerald Triangle, where Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet. July 1: Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended from duty and now faces possible dismissal after a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader in which she appeared to criticize her own army's handling of the conflict. July 24: Cambodia, in turn, announced that it was downgrading diplomatic relations with Thailand to the lowest level and recalling all embassy staff from Bangkok. No negotiation with Cambodia can take place until fighting along the border ends, Thailand's caretaker Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said. The acting premier said there had been no declaration of war and that conflict was not spreading into more provinces, according to Reuters. He added that Cambodia had fired heavy weapons into Thailand without clear targets, leading to civilian deaths. Thailand's government called for “international condemnation” of Cambodia in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. Government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub accused Cambodia of “being a war-monger that disregards human rights by continuously using heavy weapons against civilian targets.” The post claimed Cambodian forces fired heavy weapons into civilian areas — including a hospital and homes in Surin province — resulting in several casualties. “Security and administrative officials have since evacuated residents to safety.” Cambodia's powerful former leader Hun Sen said the country had “no choice but to fight back” against Thailand, as he urged the public to remain calm and avoid panic buying. In a later post, Hun Sen said he was participating in the military command via video link, following reports that he had left Cambodia for China. “Please, fellow Cambodians, don't panic, like rushing to buy rice, or hoarding goods, or selling goods at higher prices, etc.,” said the former leader and father of current Prime Minister Hun Manet. He also urged Cambodians to carry out normal work “except the border areas of Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear provinces, which have been shelled by the Thai invasion army.” Thailand and Cambodia have provided accounts of how the conflict escalated. Residents in Thailand's Surin province ran for cover as clashes erupted at the border with Cambodia, according to local news footage. The US embassy in Thailand warned Americans in or near the area to heed advice from Thai authorities who began evacuating conflict zones on Thursday. China's foreign ministry said at a press conference on Thursday it is “deeply concerned” about escalating tensions between its neighbors and stressed the importance of “maintaining friendly relations” with “long-term interests on both sides.” Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters China will “continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace and dialogue to help ease tensions.” Chhan Rorn Yon, a 45-year-old farmer in Cambodia, told CNN he had heard explosions since 9 a.m. local time. “The village is so quiet, people are running away. In Thailand's Surin province, Komsan Jaipeng told CNN that when the clashes began, he saw many schoolchildren rushing to escape. Komsan was opening up his motorcycle shop when he first heard a boom. His boss told him and the other staff to evacuate. “I told my wife that we are not going home tonight, we will stay at least a night at this shelter here. They have taught us where to go if the fighting broke out. That is why I have been carrying my small bag every day,” he said. Thailand closed its border with Cambodia after conflict between the neighboring countries intensified, according to Thai officials. “We have escalated the measures to level 4, which involves the complete closure of all border checkpoints along the Thai Cambodian border,” said Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, a spokesperson for Ad Hoc Centre for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation. Cambodia's Prime Minister has called on the United Nations Security Council to convene an “urgent meeting” to “stop Thailand's aggression,” after fighting intensified between the neighbors. Prime Minister Hun Manet said Thai armed forces launched “unprovoked, premeditated and deliberate attacks on Cambodian positions along the border areas,” accusing it of violating international law in a letter to Security Council President Asim Iftikhar Ahmad. “Facing this flagrant aggression, Cambodian troops had no option but to respond in self-defense in order to safeguard Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity,” wrote Hun Manet.“It is profoundly reprehensible that this act of aggression occurs while Cambodia is actively pursuing peaceful and impartial legal avenues to resolve outstanding border issues with Thailand through both bilateral and international mechanisms.” Thailand has accused Cambodia of violating both its sovereignty and international law by laying landmines within Thai territory on the disputed border, and by firing rockets into civilian areas this morning. “The Royal Thai Government calls upon Cambodia to take responsibility for the incidents that have occurred, cease attacks against civilian and military targets, and stop all actions that violate Thailand's sovereignty,” the Thai Foreign Ministry said. Cambodia has not yet reported any fatalities on its side. The conflict between Thailand and Cambodia is “likely to get worse before it gets better,” an analyst said, as relations between the Southeast Asian countries collapse to their lowest level in years. The next few days could see more “confrontation, clashes, escalation,” Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Thailand's Chulalongkorn University, told CNN. Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended this month after the leak of a phone call she had with Cambodia's powerful former leader Hun Sen, in which she appeared to criticize her army's actions in their long-standing border dispute. Some background: Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for almost 40 years, stepped down in 2023 and handed power to his son Hun Manet. But he remains a hugely influential figure in Cambodian politics: He serves as senate president and was a friend and ally of Paetongtarn's father, the former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The grouping, which includes Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, among other Southeast Asian countries, has faced challenges and setbacks in recent years, including internal conflicts, territorial disputes, and geopolitical tensions. “Apart from the Myanmar civil war (which) ASEAN was unable to solve, now you have an outright military confrontation, a clash between Thailand Cambodia,” he said. Social media videos geolocated by CNN showed several wounded people outside a heavily damaged 7/11 store, with smoke in the background. At least nine people have been killed and over a dozen were wounded in Thailand in Cambodian attacks, including an 8-year-old boy, according to the Thai army. They share a 508-mile (817-kilometer) land border — largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony — that has periodically seen military clashes and been the source of political tensions. In 2011, Thai and Cambodian troops clashed in a nearby area surrounding the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO world heritage site, displacing thousands of people on both sides and killing at least 20 people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MARK L. HAAS is Professor of Political Science at Duquesne University. A combination of low fertility levels and high life expectancies has led to a significant increase in the percentage of people 65 and older and with it, a steady rise in the median age of their populations. In 1950, around five percent of the world's population was 65 or older. Even if fertility rates stop declining and remain where they were in 2022—an unlikely development—the United Nations forecasts that by 2050 that percentage will have more than tripled. More than 40 countries have shrinking populations because of low fertility levels. As many analysts have pointed out, the aging of a population slows economic growth and necessitates new and greater public spending on the welfare of elderly citizens. But it also has an important unrecognized international benefit: aging significantly reduces the likelihood of war between states. The twenty-first century, widely predicted to be an “age of depopulation,” may also turn out to be a more peaceful one. But as countries grow older, governments will be forced to attend to their aging populations and contend with a shrinking pool of resources. All the while, as leaders and citizens age, studies indicate that they will be more likely to express a preference for peace. These factors will combine to create societies less capable and tolerant of waging war. Although there are certainly exceptions, the tendency to fight wars, in other words, is stronger in countries with younger populations. The coming wave of old and shrinking populations will fundamentally reshape geopolitics. In at least one way, that transformation will be for the better. Demographically older states have thus already demonstrated a reduced tendency to engage in violent conflict. A central way that an aging population reduces resources potentially available for war is by significantly slowing economic growth. By shrinking the number of workers in a society, slowing productivity, and reducing domestic consumption, aging makes countries less economically dynamic—and less capable of funding wars. An old workforce is a less productive one. As many cross-national studies have found, the size of this cohort relative to older and younger workers is a key determinant of countries' overall productivity growth. When the share of 40-to-49-year-olds rises, overall productivity gets a boost. This is bad news for the economic prospects of aging countries. A major technological advance, such as the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, could potentially help reverse these trends. Its total factor productivity, a measure of the economic value of innovation and technological advancement, grew by only one percent from 1995 to 2005, one-quarter as much as it did in the preceding decade. There is reason to expect that countries with similarly aging populations will face comparable problems in the AI revolution. Population aging will hinder economic expansion on the demand side, as well. Robust domestic consumption accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity in most high-income countries. The cohort most likely to purchase homes (people around 30 years of age) has plummeted by 30 percent since 2020. As a result, demand has crashed, straining household wealth, the government's ability to finance itself through taxation, and China's economy at large. But they will also reduce the ability of those countries to engage in war with another country. According to the economists Mark Harrison and Nikolaus Wolf, the number of militarized disputes that states have initiated has historically risen apace with GDP and GDP per capita expansion. Consequently, as the economic power of a state grows, it may be more willing to seek costly change, even by waging war. If increased growth tends to make state aggression more likely, lower growth caused by aging will tend to make such aggression less likely. Analysts predict that many developed countries' public spending on pensions, health care, and long-term care for the elderly is on track to hit roughly 25 percent of GDP by 2050. These trends are already affecting aging democracies with deep social safety nets and historically less generous authoritarian regimes alike. In 2009, China spent 4.4 percent of its GDP on pensions and health care. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s member states spend an average of 2.3 percent of GDP on child and family programs, many of which are designed to boost fertility (although few meaningfully do so). The rapid-aging demographics are also indirectly responsible for government spending on domestic security and welfare programs for the non-elderly because they powerfully contribute to many of the key sources of rising discontent in the developed world, including slowing economic growth, austerity, and growing ethnic and anti-immigrant tensions, as dominant groups fear their demographic demise. As countries spend more to address the causes and consequences of aging, other spending, including on the military, will likely be crowded out as budgets come under increasing strain. Although governments need not necessarily cut military expenditures to help pay for rising elderly welfare costs, they will have strong incentives to do so. Although military spending can increase economic growth by employing underutilized labor, stimulating aggregate demand, and funding research that ultimately helps civilian industries, as research by J. Paul Dunne and Nan Tian has shown, it is more likely to harm long-run growth by reducing expenditures on more productive investments and by contributing to higher levels of debt. Coupled with slow economic growth rates and tight budgetary constraints created by high levels of elderly welfare expenditures, military spending may emerge as an attractive pool of resources to reallocate. Statistical analysis of democratic and authoritarian countries indicates that once government spending on social welfare, including for the elderly, crosses 25 percent as a proportion of a country's budget, the likelihood that the country will initiate a militarized dispute declines significantly. Many aged countries are either on the verge of or have already crossed this threshold. Spending on old age, unemployment, and income maintenance (and related expenditures) as a share of general government spending averaged nearly 21 percent in OECD countries in 2021. In 2050, East Asia will have nearly 48 million fewer 18- to 23-year-olds than in 2020, a 42 percent reduction; Latin America will have nearly nine million fewer, a 13 percent reduction; and Europe will have over eight million fewer, a 17 percent reduction. With fewer prime-age recruits available, militaries will be forced to make difficult decisions about the size and quality of their fighting forces. If they do not boost recruitment rates when the number of potential soldiers is greatly reduced, they are unlikely to meet their personnel targets. However, if militaries increase recruitment rates by relaxing the requirements for age, health, and physical and mental abilities, they will sacrifice quality for quantity. They may also try to increase recruitment rates by increasing salaries and benefits, as Russia has in its war in Ukraine. But unless total military budgets increase, rising per-soldier labor costs will crowd out other areas of military spending, including for weapons development, procurement, and maintenance. Aging states with shrinking recruitment pools have consistently had trouble meeting their military personnel goals despite frequently relaxing standards and increasing compensation. From 2000 to 2021, Japan on average filled just 93 percent of its authorized personnel positions. Despite lowering standards for service and dramatically increasing soldier compensation after the country's 18-to-23-year-old male cohort began declining in 2009, China's military continues to experience a shortage of skilled soldiers. Russia in the 2010s consistently failed to meet its recruitment targets for both conscripted and contracted soldiers. Although these personnel problems did not prevent Russia from invading Ukraine in 2022, a shortage of high-quality soldiers has hampered the country's fighting abilities, making it harder to win the war. Russia continues to fight in Ukraine, but its manpower struggles could help deter other aged states from waging wars in the future. Militaries could try to work around shrinking military-age cohorts by substituting technology for personnel. Falling fertility rates make it harder to meet this need. A 2022 report issued by the Congressional Research Service, for example, concluded that unmanned aircraft systems in the U.S. military are likely to require an equal or greater number of military personnel than their crewed counterparts. Finding these highly capable soldiers will be difficult in a world of aging populations. Although a slower pace of economic growth and a decline in available military resources are likely to lead to less capable militaries in aging countries and, as a result, more peaceful international relations, the opposite is possible. Shrinking military capabilities could encourage leaders who see a closing window of opportunity to use force to achieve national objectives. Decades of survey data show that people tend to become more pacific and opposed to the use of force as they age. A 2006 Pew Research Center analysis of surveys conducted in the United States from the early 1960s to the mid-2000s concludes that “there is a generation gap over U.S. military interventions,” with elderly Americans consistently exhibiting “the greatest wariness about using military force.” Jessica Chen Weiss has similarly concluded, based on surveys from the 2010s, that older Chinese citizens were significantly less likely than younger ones both to believe that China relies “too little” on military power and to view the U.S. military presence in East Asia as a “major threat.” They were also less willing than younger individuals to “send troops and not shirk a fight.” Military casualties and the deaths of young people who have not yet had children may heighten fears that war will permanently weaken an already depopulating country. Mounting public opposition to military deaths and casualties is particularly important in democracies because it can jeopardize leaders' electoral support. But as populations age, it will also matter to authoritarian regimes, which may worry that wartime losses could incite domestic backlash. By 2030, for example, close to half of China's prime military-age cohort will be only children. The more Chinese leaders have reason to believe that bereaved single-child parents are likely to protest, the more cautious they may be about initiating a war. Population aging will not completely eradicate war, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrates. But it will reduce the ability of governments to fight or widespread support for them. All aging states, regardless of their revisionist ambitions or reliance on military aggression, will have no choice but to face squarely the effects of this demographic revolution. Demography goes a long way in determining the economically and militarily possible. Aging, then, is likely to become a powerful force for peace that has never before existed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Omar Fateh, a 35-year-old socialist, has called for abolishing the police department and replacing them with “peace officers” as part of a new “department of public safety”. Many Democrats are still sceptical about Mr Mamdani, notably governors Kathy Hochul and Josh Shapiro, and the party's leader in the House of Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, who have not issued endorsements and in some cases sharply criticised him. Some are alarmed by Mr Fateh's moves to institute a tax on wealthy Minneapolitans which could hammer businesses. No candidate has secured the party's backing since 2009 because it imposes a strict 60 per cent threshold in delegate support, but Mr Fateh, who has been endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, broke through. Mr Frey, a Democrat who has clashed repeatedly with Minneapolis' Left-wing council, has alleged voting irregularities and is seeking to challenge the result. But as it stands, it gives Mr Fateh a huge advantage in the race to win the mayoralty at the election in November because he will have the party's political muscle behind him, putting him in pole position to claim city hall. “‘We want you to send out a sample ballot. We want you to support the endorsed candidates. The final say, Mr Peppin continued, would be the decision of the party's chairman to decide how much support to provide and how much money to spend on Mr Fateh's political ambitions. Many are wary of the 35-year-old's hard-Left platform, however, chief among them his anti-police stance. Mr Fateh has denied wanting to defund the police, the rallying cry of Black Lives Matter protesters, but in the past he has supported a ballot move – later rejected by Minnesota voters – that would replace the force with a “department of public safety” staffed by “peace officers”. And on his political platform, he repeatedly hits out at the police, claiming they are responsible for “violence and brutality that has held our city captive for so many years”, have “over-criminalised” the LGBTQ community, and suggesting they are not “trustworthy”. “You may not say the word defund the police, but if they make that kind of move, it's exactly what will happen,” said Alex Plechash, chairman of Minnesota's Republican Party. Mr Plechash was baffled at Mr Fateh's anti-police stance in a city that only a few years ago saw businesses torched and cars set alight as violent mobs rampaged through the city, protesting Floyd's killing by officer Derek Chauvin. So it doesn't make any sense to me.” Mr Fateh has criticised Mr Frey, who has served as mayor of Minneapolis since 2018, for failing to “fight” President Donald Trump on immigrant rights and has previously introduced legislation to make Minnesota a “sanctuary” state. Like Mr Mamdani, he has pledged to raise the minimum wage – though to $20 an hour compared to $30 in New York – establish rent controls, and “protect our city from a hostile White House”. Accusing the mayor of criminalising homelessness in Minneapolis, Mr Fateh said he would increase funding for shelters and take a “compassionate approach” to encampments. With homeless encampments leaping up across many Democrat-run cities, notably San Francisco and San Diego in California, the issue is a politically-charged one and prompted many liberal bastions to swing right in recent elections. To pay for his campaign promises, Mr Fateh has said he wants to institute an income tax to “ensure the wealthy pay their fair share”, while floating a flurry of other levies including a commercial vacancy tax and a land value tax. Mr Peppin said he expected Minneapolis' business community to be in a “near panic” about the prospect of Mr Fateh becoming mayor. “The downtown business community – I wouldn't necessarily say they had an ally in Jacob Frey… but they had somebody who would listen,” he said. I think he's coming in with a socialist agenda, and he will do nothing but give lip service to any of them.” It is far from the first such controversy Mr Fateh has been involved in. In 2022, the candidate's brother-in-law, Muse Mohamud Mohamed, was convicted of perjury and sentenced to house arrest about his handling of mail-in ballots during his 2020 primary campaign. Mr Fateh, who ended up winning the election to state senate by around 2,000 votes, disclaimed any knowledge of Mr Mohamed's actions. He was also investigated by a state senate ethics committee for allegedly receiving free advertising from Somali TV of Minnesota, a YouTube channel. Mr Fateh said he had failed to include paying $1,000 for the adverts in his campaign reports. He was ordered to take part in campaign finance training but the committee did not find any evidence of a “quid pro quo”. Controversially, in 2023 he faced another ethics probe over allegedly suggesting Republican senators resembled violent terrorists who “advocate for the superiority of the white race”. Some suggest Mr Fateh, though in his mid-30s, does not have the social media savvy or charisma of his New York counterpart, and so far he has not been endorsed by leading Left-wing figures like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>

Walker is the executive director of Canadians for Tax Fairness. Silas Xuereb is a researcher and policy analyst with Canadians for Tax Fairness. Imagine, in our incredibly polarized times, a truly unifying issue. Imagine a policy proposal with 90 per cent popular support. This trick that allows Canada's ultrarich and big corporations to stash wealth and avoid paying their fair share of tax is almost universally loathed. In fact, the problem just keeps getting worse. A new report from Canadians for Tax Fairness finds that Canada's biggest corporations and wealthiest families have more than $682-billion in assets stashed in tax havens around the world, a 165-per-cent increase from 10 years ago. That's more than the value of every forklift, crane, MRI machine, tractor, transport truck, single piece of machinery and equipment in Canada, combined. Simply put, our laws and the people who make them haven't just failed to stop tax abuse, they've actively encouraged it. Those five agreements alone led to more than $47-billion in assets being drained from Canada and shifted to tax havens in the five years after. Opinion: Let's call Carney's Brookfield Bermuda move what it is: tax avoidance, now no longer allowed The scale of tax haven misuse makes it clear that this isn't an isolated problem exploited by a few bad apples. Our analysis found that more than three-quarters of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 have at least one confirmed subsidiary in a tax haven. Some of these companies have real, tangible operations abroad. But many simply set up subsidiary companies, divert their Canadian profits through a tax haven and then return it to Canada tax-free. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, that's enough to fund both our new dental care program and a single-payer universal national pharmacare program. This revenue is especially critical right now, at a time when the federal government has launched a comprehensive review of government spending, and is gearing up for tens of billions in cuts to the services Canadians count on. There are clear actions we can take to finally address the problem of tax haven abuse. Prime Minister Mark Carney and his government know better than past administrations that existing laws are not strong enough to prevent this abuse. The Prime Minister himself has firsthand knowledge of how tax havens work from his time in the Brookfield corporate empire, which has more confirmed subsidiaries in tax havens than any other company on the S&P/TSX 60. He is uniquely positioned to get this done. There's $15-billion a year on the table for a cash-strapped government to take on the affordability crisis that is hammering Canadians. To get it, Mr. Carney needs to end a near-universally loathed loophole that only the wealthiest people and largest corporations in Canada can take advantage of, and in doing so earn the admiration of 90 per cent of Canadians.

BLAGOVESHCHENSK, July 24. /TASS/. Crew error is being considered as the likely cause of an An-24 passenger aircraft crashing in the Amur Region, a source in the emergency services told TASS.

"As a potential scenario, crew error is being considered, with a hillside collision while landing in poor visibility. Other possibilities will be considered as well," the source said.

Today, about 1 p.m. local time or 4 a.m. GMT, contact was lost with the crew of an An-24 aircraft belonging to Irkutsk's Angara Airline en route from Khabarovsk to Tynda via Blagoveshchensk. While landing at Tynda Airport, the plane attempted a second approach, after which contact with it was lost.</p>

MOSCOW, July 24. /TASS/. All passengers and crew aboard the An-24 aircraft that crashed in the Amur Region are presumed dead, preliminary reports from emergency services indicate.

"Initial information indicates there are no survivors. Rescue helicopters have been unable to land at the crash site due to the challenging mountainous terrain. The area remains engulfed in flames," a source told TASS.

Emergency response services indicated that the aircraft was carrying 40 passengers, including two children, along with six crew members. In turn, the Governor of the Amur Region Vasily Orlov stated that there were 43 passengers (including five children) and six crew members on board.

The An-24 aircraft operated by Angara Airlines (Irkutsk) lost contact with air traffic control today at approximately 1 p.m. local time (4 a.m. GMT) while performing flight Khabarovsk-Blagoveshchensk-Tynda. During the landing approach to Tynda Airport, the plane initiated a go-around procedure, after which contact was lost.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JEFFREY MANKOFF is a Distinguished Research Fellow at National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies and a Nonresident Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is one piece of a broader campaign to restore a sphere of influence in post-Soviet Eurasia. The 2022 invasion came as a shock to many of Russia's neighbors in eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, confirming their fears that Russia remained a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their countries. Yet because the war in Ukraine has been a massive drain on Russian attention and resources, it has also presented many of these countries with an opportunity. Taking advantage of Moscow's distraction, they have enhanced their cooperation with one another, cultivated and deepened partnerships outside the region, and loosened some of the bonds tying them to their former imperial hegemon. As the Russian military's demand for weapons has left Moscow unable to fulfill promised exports, countries such as Armenia are turning to other suppliers in Europe and India; other regional states are purchasing weapons from Turkey and even China. And as Russia has withdrawn forces and equipment from its military bases in the Caucasus and Central Asia to redeploy them to Ukraine, countries in both places are resolving conflicts that Russia has long exploited for its own benefit. Improved cooperation within the wider region is also creating new opportunities to enhance trade connectivity and build alternatives to transit through Russia. By reducing the dependency that once defined their relationship with their former hegemon, countries in the region have become increasingly capable of engaging Russia (and other powers) on favorable terms. Today, the Kremlin maintains a proprietary view of not only Ukraine but also many other countries. Ukraine and Belarus remain Moscow's top priorities, but the Kremlin also aspires to a kind of suzerainty over Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova and maintains a more distant postimperial regard toward the remainder of Central Asia. The 2023 Russian Foreign Policy Concept, the strategy document outlining parameters and priorities for Russia's foreign policy, resurrected the term “near abroad” to describe these countries, pointing to their “centuries-old traditions of joint statehood, deep interdependence … a common language, and close cultures” as a justification for efforts to keep them within Moscow's sphere of influence. Once the fighting in Ukraine winds down, the Kremlin will almost certainly ramp up its attempts to coerce other neighbors to join Russian-backed multilateral bodies, strengthen economic ties, adopt Russian-style laws targeting civil society, and accept a larger Russian military and intelligence presence on their territory. The Eurasian interior may be increasingly interconnected, cooperative, and even taking steps toward peace, but it needs to keep moving in this direction if it is to resist future Russian efforts to reassert authority. That is why the United States, together with the European Union and countries such as India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, must make new investments in cross-border infrastructure, supply chains, defense, and sustained diplomatic engagement to reinforce regional stability. Countries in the region will continue to search for their own ways to reduce their historic reliance on Moscow—but Washington and its partners should help tip them the scales. Although Russia had previously been the primary broker keeping these conflicts from expanding, it was in no position to do so at that moment, as it was busy pulling forces out of both the Caucasus and Central Asia to shore up its frontlines in Ukraine. Moscow's inability to intervene in a significant way initially enabled long-running Kyrgyz-Tajik border clashes in the Fergana Valley to escalate. Earlier this year, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan finalized an agreement to settle their border disputes in the Fergana Valley. The agreement led to the first summit of leaders from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, held in March 2025 in Khujand, Tajikistan, to discuss enhancing cooperation in the territory that all three share. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia withdrew some of the peacekeepers it had deployed to Armenia under the terms of a 2020 Armenian-Azerbaijani cease-fire and refused repeated requests for military assistance from Armenia, a fellow member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a regional security bloc nominally committed to defending its members from attack. During the offensive, Azerbaijani forces even fired on Russian peacekeepers. Baku ended up fully reconquering Nagorno-Karabakh and dissolving the Armenian-run breakaway state there. Almost all the region's ethnic Armenian inhabitants fled. It would also ratify the departure of foreign peacekeepers, guarding against future efforts to redeploy Russian forces. But in Moscow's absence, diplomatic breakthroughs have become possible. Post-Soviet Eurasian states have exercised greater agency, chosen cooperation, and found themselves capable of resolving their own disputes. The war in Ukraine has also created space for other countries to get involved in Russia's traditional sphere of influence. Armenia, for example, has sought to end its reliance on Russian weapons by buying new systems from France and India (choosing the latter, in part, to counterbalance Pakistani support for Azerbaijan); Yerevan purchased $1.5 billion in Indian weapons in 2022–23 alone. The most prominent non-Russian player, especially in Central Asia, is China. Chinese trade with the five Central Asian countries rose from $89.4 billion in 2023 to $94.8 billion in 2024, more than twice the value of those countries' trade with Russia. China is also driving investment in key infrastructure projects, including gas pipelines from Turkmenistan through the rest of Central Asia and a railway from the city of Kashgar in China's Xinjiang province to Andijon, Uzbekistan. Central Asia has rapidly become an important market for Chinese automakers, especially producers of electric vehicles. Security ties have progressed furthest in Tajikistan, where Beijing has deployed forces from the People's Armed Police, China's main paramilitary force, along the frontier with Afghanistan; China also sells weapons and equipment to the country and participates in joint trainings and exercises with Tajik counterparts. The Anaklia port, for example, could significantly enhance Georgia's trade not just with China but also with other partners, reducing the country's economic dependence on Russia. And despite its close relationship with Moscow, Beijing has made clear that it opposes Russian activities that could disrupt its economic interests, including threats to a trading partner's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Another power player in the region is Turkey, a NATO member. At Ankara's behest, the Organization of Turkic States—an organization originally set up to foster cultural ties among Turkey, Azerbaijan, and the Turkic-speaking states of Central Asia—is increasingly pushing for trans-Caspian energy cooperation, including a potential project to export Turkmen natural gas to Europe and another to jointly invest in new production capacity on both sides of the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan's crushing victories garnered substantial attention across the region. With Turkey's support, other countries in the region may also be able to promote institutional and cultural change within their militaries and develop along NATO lines. For many countries, Azerbaijan's triumph has also generated new interest in Turkish defense technology. All the Central Asian states except Tajikistan have now purchased Turkish drones, and last fall the Turkish drone producer Baykar agreed to set up a production site in Kazakhstan. Ankara is also pursuing other forms of security cooperation with these countries, including training, advising, joint exercises, and providing professional military education. By normalizing relations, opening the long-closed Turkish-Armenian border, and unlocking greater Turkish investment, an Armenian-Azerbaijani peace deal could substantially enhance Turkey's influence in the South Caucasus—which is one reason Moscow may now be picking fights with both Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (following the accidental downing of an Azerbaijani jet by the Russian air force) and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan (over allegations of Russian support for a possible coup plot) to prevent a final accord. This income and market access reduce their economies' dependence on Russia. In March 2024, Kazakhstan signed a new agreement with Azerbaijan to further expand deliveries via the pipeline. Europe's shift away from Russian natural gas after 2022 could be a further boon for producers and transit states in the region. In July 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Aliyev signed a memorandum of understanding to double Azerbaijan's gas exports to the EU. European companies and governments are also looking to the region as a potential source of green energy, with Azerbaijan in particular pushing to develop solar and wind capacity to reduce its dependence on oil and gas exports. Challenging economics, a lack of infrastructure, and intraregional disputes have long slowed development along this route; much of the transcontinental trade that did occur passed through Russia's Northern Corridor, where infrastructure is in place and border crossings are fewer. According to the Asian Development Bank, the number of Chinese container trains passing through the Middle Corridor has expanded by a factor of 33 from 2023 to 2024, while freight volumes handled by Azerbaijan's and Kazakhstan's Caspian seaports grew by 21 percent. During the EU-Central Asia Summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, in April, Brussels pledged an additional ten billion euros as part of its Global Gateway Initiative to enhance regional connectivity. Meanwhile, the Houthis' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, the Taliban government's stated interest in opening Afghanistan to foreign investment, and long-term uncertainty about Russia are all strengthening interest in this route. But if Western states begin removing sanctions on Russia following a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, and if transit across Russia becomes less risky, governments and development banks may have less inclination to act. None of these developments suggest that Russia will cease to be a key player in what it regards as its traditional sphere of influence. Leaders of most countries in the region value good ties with Moscow, even if they oppose the invasion of Ukraine. Many of these states have profited from Russian efforts to evade Western sanctions since February 2022. In many post-Soviet Eurasian countries, remittances from migrant laborers working in Russia provide vital revenue, as well as a source of Russian leverage, even after Russia began cracking down on irregular migration following the March 2024 terrorist attack at a Moscow concert venue. Putin meets regularly with Aliyev, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and other leaders (and sometimes leaders' children who are being groomed as possible successors). The Kremlin has consolidated its de facto protectorate in Belarus and fostered close ties with politicians in Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, and the Moldovan opposition. Last year, in a stark shift in Tbilisi's political orientation, Georgian Dream adopted a Russian-inspired law cracking down on civil society and suspended EU accession negotiations. Moldova's fate, too, remains in the balance, with a Moscow-backed candidate narrowly losing last year's presidential election and Russian-backed groups seeking to unite ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for this September. Far from being locked out of the region's emerging transit infrastructure, Russia is also participating in and benefitting from these new structures. Russia is working with Azerbaijan and Iran to build out the International North-South Transport Corridor—a road, rail, and sea route that would connect Russia to the Indian Ocean through Azerbaijan, India, and Iran, none of which have sanctioned Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan's centrality to both this route and the Middle Corridor is indicative of many countries' approaches. In a 1997 speech at Johns Hopkins University, then Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott argued that the United States wanted “to see all responsible players in the Caucasus and Central Asia be winners,” rather than for the region to become an object of great-power contestation as it was during the nineteenth-century Great Game. Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack suggested that a private U.S. company operate the route connecting mainland Azerbaijan to its Nakhichevan exclave through Armenia. The idea of a neutral third party overseeing the route had been discussed in earlier rounds of talks, but Barrack's statement was the first time a U.S. official suggested Washington could play a role. A more comprehensive regional strategy could help the administration access energy resources and check its great-power rivals without overburdening the United States with new commitments. Washington, moreover, can give a boost to efforts already underway. It should discreetly encourage governments in the South Caucasus and Central Asia to pursue greater regional coordination. It can also work with countries in the region to lower barriers to trade and facilitate the involvement of Western firms, including American firms, in new energy, infrastructure, and critical minerals projects. Such trade and investment deals should be the focus of the next C5+1 ministerial conference, an annual meeting of U.S. and Central Asian foreign ministers held since 2015. A C5+1 summit of presidents has only been held once, in 2023; the Trump administration should take up the mantle of convening another one. Their domestic political systems may not all be to Washington's liking, and many of them will want productive relations with Moscow, Beijing, or Tehran. But these countries and their populations will also resist the Kremlin's attempts to incorporate them into a reconstituted Russian sphere of influence. For the United States, preventing the region's domination by Russia or other revisionist powers means supporting post-Soviet Eurasian countries' pursuit of diversified economic and political ties. Even though those efforts do not always happen on Washington's terms, their contributions to a freer, more open region align with Washington's strategic interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian and Russian delegations held a third round of peace talks in Istanbul on July 23, with the meeting lasting less than an hour. During the talks, Ukraine proposed holding a summit between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of August, according to National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation. The delegation also included Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, and deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skybytskyi. Our priority is always people, ceasefire and meeting of leaders," Umerov said after the talks, adding that Ukraine and Russia agreed to conduct a humanitarian exchange involving more than 1,200 people. Ukraine has clearly outlined its priorities, including a ceasefire, a full stop to strikes on civilian infrastructure, and "silence" along the entire front line, according to Yermak. "This is where the path to a genuine peace must begin," he added in his post on X. Commenting on a possible leaders' meeting, Medinsky said it was crucial to first determine the topics for discussion. Medinsky's delegation also claimed around 30 civilians from Russia's Kursk region, allegedly taken into Ukraine, have not been returned and called on Kyiv to clarify their status. Commenting on the third round of peace talks, Yermak said that "...It is clear that Russia is still not ready to end the war — but there is still time to reconsider and put an end to this madness." Ahead of the delegations' meeting, Umerov's team held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. The July 23 meeting followed earlier rounds of negotiations on May 16 and June 2, after more than three years without formal talks. Despite limited progress, both sides have managed to negotiate several prisoner exchanges since restarting discussions. The peace talks, characterized by great distance between the two sides' demands, have been given new energy after U.S. President Donald Trump's warning on July 14 that he would impose "severe" tariffs on Russia unless it agrees to end the war within 50 days. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has reiterated that Moscow's war goals remain unchanged, reflecting Russia's reluctance to concede from its maximalist demands. Ukraine has proposed a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in both rounds of talks — a position supported by the U.S. — but Russia has so far rejected the proposal. Starlink experienced a global outage on July 24, with the cause still unknown. "If we try to establish a ceasefire without building up our future defenses, the war will drag on for many more years," former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said. "China has an influence on Russia, like the European Union has an influence on Ukraine," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Lindsey urged Kyiv to reconsider the law as "one of the most widely used talking points for ending support for Ukraine is that it was awash with corruption." Ukraine's National Bank held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 15.5% while revising down economic projections, citing war-related damage and weaker harvests, the bank said on July 24. Among the Russian companies listed as recipients of the explosive substance octogen, also known as HMX, is Promsintez, an explosives producer that has ties to the Russian military, a Ukrainian Security Service official told Reuters. Kolomoisky, the former owner of Ukraine's largest bank PrivatBank, and five of his associates were charged in 2023 with money laundering and fraud. They are accused of embezzling Hr 9.2 billion ($250 million) from PrivatBank.</p>
