                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON, DC—Carlos Alcaraz has made Ibiza his annual summer vacation spot after Roland Garros. Daniil Medvedev made the trip after Wimbledon, eager for a reset after an underwhelming Channel Double.“It was my first time there, and I'd heard only good things from my friends,” Medvedev told me at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Thursday. “You can do anything there: you can sit and chill or go to the party. I always try to have some kind of time to relax, so I can come back to the practice court and meet with my team to work even harder.“It's great that it's been working for a couple of matches.”The former world No. 1 and self-proclaimed “hard-court specialist” is giving that vacation glow on his favorite surface this week, posting back-to-back match wins to kick off the US Open swing and erase memories of his first-round exits from both Paris and London. “It was my first time there, and I'd heard only good things from my friends,” Medvedev told me at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Thursday. “You can do anything there: you can sit and chill or go to the party.

Oh hey, @DaniilMedwed, welcome to DC!#MubadalaCitiDCOpen 😎 pic.twitter.com/0cq2SCfKUc “After Wimbledon, I was sitting there and felt like I didn't play that bad, but you're losing first round and you know that the guy is probably going to lose in the second or third round,” the eighth seed said with his inimitable candor. It does bother me.“At the same time, after a couple of days in Ibiza, you realize that the only way forward is to work hard. If it doesn't work out, then that's life. Life is ups and downs with some bumps on the road. I sometimes take a good example of some players who are 30 and doing amazing results. But if I want to try and be better, I need to do some things better.”Medvedev began the week by reuniting on the practice court with SW19 conqueror Benjamin Bonzi, getting some revenge over the Frenchman who had slid past the two-time semifinalist in four sets. “At the same time, after a couple of days in Ibiza, you realize that the only way forward is to work hard.

Maybe against Carlos and Jannik, the odds are going to be on their side but I can still beat them. Against any other player, I've beaten most of them many times. “He made one bad game on serve, which he didn't do at Wimbledon at all,” Medvedev recalled. I think I won the tiebreaker, which is actually funny because I lost the two tiebreaks at Wimbledon.“It was a little but funny how it came about because my coach came to me like, ‘Bonzi asked me to practice.' I was like, ‘Yeah, whatever, let's do it. After all, it was only 18 months ago that he was a set away from winning the 2024 Australian Open—and that was when he was in the midst of a 12-month shoulder injury that impacted his serve. “It was a little but funny how it came about because my coach came to me like, ‘Bonzi asked me to practice.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon star Leylah Fernandez is on the lookout for love and has invited one of her followers to ‘shoot their shot' by asking her out on a date in Montreal. The 22-year-old addressed them by writing: “This will be fun, right? I fully intend to go on a date in Montreal so go ahead and DM me… time to shoot your shot. PS: you may have to meet my dad beforehand (good luck with that).” She elaborated on her bizarre 'competition' in a follow-up clip, saying: "In Montreal, I would like to go on a date. You know what I really want to do and that I haven't done is going on a date. I am not a big fan of dating apps. “So, I actually am gonna do things my way. Fernandez, who according to Forbes had earned $6.5million (£4.8m) last year as the 18th highest-paid female athlete, later offered an update after getting past rising Australian star Maya Joint in her opening round match at the Citi Open in Washington DC. "There've been a lot of responses,” said the former World No. “I think the first day, there were maybe over 100 messages. He suggested I post a video on Instagram and have a date in Montréal where you feel at home and you feel comfortable. "At this age, we're all either studying or going to sports competitions, so reading those messages not only makes me feel better and like I'm not the odd one out, but it's also pretty cool that we're able to have those conversations together." The request comes just weeks after Fernandez's underwhelming performance at Wimbledon. However, she suffered an unexpected second round exit after losing to Laura Siegemund in straight sets, 6-2 6-3. Fernandez also teamed up with New Zealand's Lulu Sun for the doubles event. But they too endured an early exit, losing in the first round to Demi Schuurs and Asia Muhammad, who themselves were eliminated in the next round. Fernandez has had a shaky few months, with early departures from the French Open and Wimbledon indicating that she's not currently playing at her best. However, she set up a round-of-16 clash with world No. The hard-court tournament could provide Fernandez with an opportunity to find her groove before she heads back to Montreal. And victory would certainly give her something to chat about with any potential date back in her home country. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu, of Britain, returns the ball to Marta Kostyuk, of Ukraine, during a match at the Citi Open tennis tournament Tuesday, July 22, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Emma Raducanu dominated her first career matchup against Naomi Osaka, winning the showdown at the D.C. Open on Thursday between past U.S. Open champions 6-4, 6-2. “I did feel it had a bit of extra,” Raducanu said. I knew that ahead of the match, but I actually quite like these kind of matchups, where you're playing a great opponent. A lot of people have eyes on the match. I'm just pleased with how I was able to navigate playing a four-time Slam champ.” Raducanu, the first qualifier to claim a Grand Slam title when she did that in New York in 2021, saved the only two break points she faced and managed to break the big-serving Osaka three times. “I'm serving better, and that helps a lot. I always returned pretty decent, but the element of just when I serve well, it does add another dimension to my game,” Raducanu said. “I'm able to kind of start the points better and look for my forehand and get that into play a bit more and then dictate.” “I feel like from the baseline, I was doing pretty well,” said Osaka, who the U.S. Open and Australian Open twice each. “I think there are certain situations where she got one more ball back and I was kind of just looking and waiting.” Raducanu, who is ranked 46th, will face Maria Sakkari in the quarterfinals. Venus Williams, the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion back on tour at age 45, was scheduled to face Magdalena Frech at night.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maria Sakkari has made her thoughts clear on grass court tennis. But Sakkari has struggled to make it to the next level and she has just two WTA titles to her name, none of which have come on grass. Sakkari made no secret of her love for hard courts, and her last title came on the concrete at the Guadalajara Open in 2023. Her first title came on the clay in Rabat back in 2019, but Sakkari has yet to attain any success on grass. Following her victory over Emma Navarro in Washington D.C., Sakkari shares her view on grass court tennis and why she finds it scary. “You know, just being scared that something's going to happen to your body, playing on that surface [grass],” the 30-year-old told reporters. “You know, hard court is my best surface, for sure. I feel recharged and ready to go for, you know, full calendar now hopefully.” She took on Navarro, who was playing in front of her home crowd in America's capital city, and the former top 10 player stunned them into silence. Sakkari claimed a tight first set and the second set followed suit, as it was decided via a tiebreak, which she dominated to claim her third win in four meetings against Navarro. “I have mixed emotions about the ball. Obviously I've been serving well, so I'm not going to lie they have been good for my serve. “I just learn how to adapt with every ball used at every tournament, because that's the truth that we play with different balls every week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another tennis icon, Mansour Bahrami, revealed he spoke to Jannik Sinner before the Wimbledon final about his loss to Alcaraz in the French Open final. Mansour Bahrami, 69, has established himself as a figurehead for everything that is right with tennis. After travelling from Iran to France as a young man, he went on to have a successful professional tennis career. Bahrami, who reached the French Open doubles final in 1989, has transitioned into an exhibition player in his post-professional career, entertaining fans around the world with his infinite set of tricks and skills on the tennis court. Bahrami remains an authority on the tennis landscape. He shared a conversation he had with Jannik Sinner before the Wimbledon final, while speaking to Gigi Salmon on the Courtside Conversations podcast. Bahrami said: “I was talking to Sinner, just like the day before and walked together all the way to the locker room and I was telling him that ‘okay it happens again, you have three match points, don't let it go!' “I thought when he served for the match at 5-4… but he was very strong, a great job and, really seriously, I am happy for both of them because both of them are great guys, great champions. “I was very sad for Sinner to lose, I was very happy to Alcaraz to win in French Open and this was the same thing in Wimbledon. The ‘trick shot king' has been known for his wild and wacky invitational performances since retiring from his professional career. However, Bahrami achieved some notable things during his playing days.</p>

"I thought it was going to be a really difficult match," said Raducanu in her on-court interview. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Raducanu nudged ahead five games into the opening set when she converted the first of two break points courtesy of Osaka's double fault to lead 3-2. A love hold would consolidate her two-game cushion for 5-3 before Osaka's long forehand helped Raducanu wrap up the set in just 38 minutes. She strengthened her grip on the match with an immediate break of serve in the second set, before rescuing a break point to hold for 3-1. She finished with a first serve win percentage of 76 and, perhaps more importantly, a second serve win percentage of 61 to Osaka's 45 as she sought to take the game to her opponent from the baseline. Osaka was meanwhile scuppered by seven double faults in the match, and was unable to take either of her two break-point opportunities.

It comes after the Brit had upset the odds to beat world number seven and second-seeded Lorenzo Musetti, marking his first win over a top-10 player in two-and-a-half years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Bublik continued his march across the European Alps on Thursday afternoon with a straight-sets victory against Alexander Shevchenko at the Generali Open in Kitzbühel. The in-form Bublik led Shevchenko 3-2 in the second set when their match was suspended for more than one hour due to rain. “It's quite demanding, but at the end of the day we're tennis professionals and we are ready for that,” Bublik said when asked about competing in high altitude in consecutive weeks. Having last week gone on to lift the trophy in Gstaad, his first tour-level title on clay, Bublik is now on a six-match winning streak after reaching the last four in Kitzbühel, where he will face Botic van de Zandschulp or Thiago Seyboth Wild. Bublik, who is up three spots to No. 27 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, remains on track to notch 30 tour-level wins in a season for the first time since 2022. He now holds a 22-15 record in 2025 and is 15-2 since the start of Roland Garros in late May, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The other semi-final on Friday's schedule in Kitzbühel will be an all-French affair between Arthur Rinderknech and Arthur Cazaux. Sixth seed Rinderknech, who upset Alexander Zverev last month at Wimbledon, ousted former finalist Yannick Hanfmann 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 to reach his first tour-level semi-final in 12 months. Meanwhile Cazaux has backed up reaching his maiden ATP Tour semi-final last week in Gstaad by equalling that run in Kitzbühel. The 22-year-old on Wednesday overcame Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-4 to seal his last-four spot. 83 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his Kitzbühel exploits so far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The BBC could be at risk of losing its Wimbledon coverage for good, according to one television icon. You can check out at any time. Writing in his Telegraph column, the ex-Match of the Day host urged his former employers to introduce a pay-per-view channel as a method to fend off the likes of TNT Sports and rival broadcasters. “Unless the BBC is content to cover only minor sports they will have to get out into the marketplace. Whenever a major sport leaves the BBC it is usually with regret.

If there is someone at the corporation who agrees with me and has the courage to fight for that cause I mentioned, get ready to summon up the blood, disguise fair nature and prepare for the incoming rage.” TNT's parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, have already landed a blow on the BBC by slashing its Olympic Games coverage and there is talk they, or another broadcaster, could do the same with Wimbledon. TNT made their first big move into tennis earlier this year when they broadcast the French Open, while Sky Sports have made a similar splash by securing a five-year deal for exclusive rights to the ATP and WTA Tours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don't see a newsletter in your community? Check out all of our newsletter offerings! A local Coloradan is gearing up for her fourth and likely final run in the U.S. Open as a junior wheelchair tennis athlete. This year's U.S. Open Junior Wheelchair Championships are set for Sept. 3 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York. Living in Thornton with her family, Czauz trains at the University of Colorado tennis courts in Boulder. “I used to play wheelchair basketball, and when COVID hit, obviously we couldn't play anymore,” Czauz said. “But a teammate of mine started playing tennis, and he invited me down to play. And as soon as I came down for a practice, I just fell in love. And I just kept coming to practice. Therefore, a total of 16 players compete in the junior wheelchair divisions. “I wasn't really prepared for it or anything,” she said. I didn't think it was anything but just a hobby; I wouldn't really go anywhere with it. I lost first in both singles and doubles. But it was a great experience that just kind of opened my eyes to what was possible with wheelchair tennis.” Wheelchair tennis follows the same rules as able-bodied tennis, except that the ball can bounce twice. In year two, she ranked into the competition, determined to ruffle some feathers in her sophomore campaign. She began to study tennis more deeply to mentally prepare herself for the game, something she said was a big difference from her wheelchair basketball days. In tennis, you're relying mostly on yourself, with the help of your doubles teammate when you're in those specific competitions. Basketball is the epitome of a team sport, she explained, with several teammates coming together to make something happen. Plus, in a wheelchair, the basketball comes and goes, but you're always holding onto that racket in tennis, making pushing more difficult, she said. “It's a lot more mentally challenging because you don't have the support of like five other people on your side, helping you, playing with you,” Czauz said. They can't really help you when you're on the court … (In year two) I improved. Chitambar is the co-founder and director of tennis at the Rocky Mountain Tennis Center in Boulder. Her competitiveness and grit have been contagious, especially for someone relatively new to the sport. “Working with Sabina has been one of the most rewarding experiences and privileges of my coaching career,” Chitambar said. Thanks to the support from USTA Colorado, Colorado Wheelchair Tennis Foundation and the 5430 Kids Tennis Foundation, we've been able to create meaningful opportunities for athletes like Sabina to thrive on and off the court.” Last year (year three), Czauz said her doubles team made it to the finals before losing to the two top players on the other side. She's proud to keep inching closer, but said this year is likely the last dance. It's time to finish this journey with a trophy. After this year, I'm going to the University of Arizona in the fall, and I'm going to be playing on their wheelchair tennis team. You must be logged in to post a comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2022, Pablo Carreno Busta caused a shock by claiming his first Masters 1000 title in Montreal at the age of 31. The next year, Jannik Sinner finally broke through for his first big title that kicked off his rise to No. And then last year, it was Alexei Popyrin coming from nowhere to lift the trophy. Can it really happen four years in a row? For this edition of the National Bank Open Power Rankings, we're doing something a little different. We are exclusively ranking players who have NEVER won a Masters 1000 title in their careers based on who we think could claim their first over the coming fortnight in Toronto. With that in mind, let's take a look at the best players out there looking for their big breakthrough. *Note: Players who have withdrawn from the 2025 National Bank Open prior to publication of this article on July 24 were not eligible for this edition of the Power Rankings. These Power Rankings do not reflect any withdrawals that took place after July 24. Players who have won a Masters 1000 title are also excluded. Bizarre stat: Shelton has reached more Grand Slam quarter-finals (four) and semifinals (two) than he has at the Masters 1000 level, despite playing nearly twice as many 1000 events in his career. He has reached just three Masters 1000 quarter-finals, the most recent being in March in Indian Wells, and has never gotten to the final four. The power rankings panel certainly thinks so, as he was a unanimous pick as the most likely player to claim their first Masters 1000 title over the next two weeks in Toronto. His huge lefty serve is a nightmare for even the best returners. De Minaur was very nearly a part of that run of first-time champions in Canada, as he reached the Toronto final back in 2023, his lone Masters 1000 final to date. But he lost that title match to an ascending Sinner. He also reached four straight Grand Slam quarter-finals from Roland-Garros 2024 to this year's Australian Open. Injury struggles may have put a dent in Lorenzo Musetti's grass court season, but it's impossible to ignore the 23-year-old's Masters 1000 results in 2025 heading into the National Bank Open. Read also: 2025 National Bank Open Toronto Players - Meet the ATP Top 10 Summer hard courts are where Tiafoe plays his best tennis, which makes him a prime candidate to score his first Masters 1000 trophy in Toronto. Read also: Reliving Vasek Pospisil's greatest National Bank Open moments ahead of his final tournament In each of the last three years, Tiafoe reached exactly one Grand Slam quarter-final (or better) and one Masters 1000 quarter-final (or better). He already hit his Grand Slam quota for the year, but he's due for a deep run at a 1000. He also has a weird habit of playing Canadians in Toronto, having clashed with a local favourite every time he has made the trip to Ontario's capital. In the ATP's last visit, he was upset by a resurgent Milos Raonic in the first round, which was revenge for a 2018 clash between the two at Sobeys Stadium won by Tiafoe. Cobolli will have some extra expectations in Toronto this year. Cobolli made the third round at four big hard court events last year as he looks to be the second-straight Italian man to hoist the trophy at Sobey's Stadium. The local boy will look to carry his momentum back home and parlay it into his first deep run at a 1000 in years. He last reached the semis of a Masters 1000 back in 2020 in Rome and his lone final at this level came at the 2019 Paris Masters. Auger-Aliassime may need a good result in Toronto to remain the highest-ranked Canadian man. He is just one spot above Shapovalov heading into the National Bank Open and Gabriel Diallo is snapping at both of their heels. Like Shapovalov, Auger-Aliassime should be coming home with some confidence. Similar to his retiring countryman Vasek Pospisil, the Montrealer seems to find another level when representing his country and he showed it again last week, teaming up with Bianca Andreescu to win Canada's first Hopman Cup title. Now Auger-Aliassime just needs to pretend like playing on home soil is the same as playing for his country abroad so that he can find that extra gear. Sitting at a career-high 35th in the rankings, Diallo has had an impressive 2025 so far.

This year, maybe another milestone is in the cards for the 23-year-old in Canada's largest city – a first Masters 1000 title. The Rio de Janeiro-native also won his maiden ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires, defeating home favourite Francisco Cerundolo in the final. If fellow teenager Jakub Mensik could hoist the trophy in Miami, don't put it past Fonseca to do the same in Toronto.

The Paris Court of Appeal has confirmed the violation by Viagogo and Viagogo Entertainment, which illegally sold tickets to the Rolex Paris Masters.

The French Tennis Federation (FFT), which has the sole right to select which companies sell tickets for the event, expressed its satisfaction with this latest development, confirming the judgement that was reached on November 8, 2022 by the Paris Judicial Court.

The FFT has had a long-running dispute with Viagogo over the resale of tickets for its events, including the French Open at Roland-Garros.

Judges recalled in their most recent decision that any form of economic activity, the purpose of which is to generate a profit, and which would not exist if the sporting event was not held, must be considered as exploitation within the meaning of Article L.333-1 of the Sports Code.

In this case, generating a profit was done so without the permission of the FFT. The Paris Court of Appeal specified that the body's monopoly covers all ticketing rights, whether tickets are sold on the primary or secondary market.

The FFT reminded tennis fans that tickets for the Paris Masters are only available through the official Paris Masters website, or FFT-approved retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATP tennis's biggest headliners are players not in action this week at the Mubadala Citi Open. At issue with all three players is the internal changes to their teams. By now you have probably heard that Jannik Sinner re-hired his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara. Sinner previously parted with Ferrara for his part in the clostebol case: Ferrara purchased the spray, containing clostebol, which physio Giacomo Naldi then used on his own hand and inadvertently contaminated Sinner. People have shared their outrage at this decision including one of Sinner's biggest critics, Nick Kyrgios. Tennis players travel the world with their teams, and in many cases, they spend more time with this close circle than their family members. Clearly, he feels most comfortable with Ferrara and knows that the world and authorities that be in tennis doping will be testing him vigorously. I am still saddened that he and girlfriend Paula Badosa reportedly broke up. Probably the best news coming out of Tsitispas's camp is that he and Ivanisevic are going their separate ways. Hall of famers shocked by Goran Ivanisevic's critical comments towards Stefanos Tsitsipas 😳#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/ER4kdC9c8s Many speculated that Zverev was seeking new coaching after a disappointing 2025. Some more videos of Alexander Zverev's work with Toni Nadal Reports are surfacing that Toni Nadal will not be Zverev's next head coach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Open mixed doubles tournament keeps getting more intriguing. Amanda Anisimova, a finalist in singles at Wimbledon, wants to play with Holger Rune. Some notable names have also dropped off. Jack Draper and Zheng Qinwen are no longer on the list. Draper pulled out of the Canadian Open with an arm injury; Zheng just underwent elbow surgery. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa have taken a pass. They, too, have been dealing with chronic injuries. Also, after two years of romance, they recently unfollowed each other on social media and removed pictures from their individual channels — never a good sign for a mixed doubles partnership, on or off the court. For those who want romance from their mixed doubles, though, there is some relief. Alex de Minaur and Katie Boulter, the Aussie-Brit couple who are engaged, have signed on. Many of the biggest-name teams, several of which the USTA organized in a fit of match-making, seeking to bring attention and interest in mixed doubles, are still there. However, the new entrants include a slew of hardcore and successful doubles players. That means the USTA is going to have some hard decisions to make about its priorities for the 16-team field. Here's the issue: Kateřina Siniaková wants to play with Marcelo Arévalo; Desirae Krawczyk wants to play with Evan King; Hsieh Su-wei wants to play with Jan Zielinski; Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori had already signed up; Gaby Dabrowski wants to play with fellow Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. So is Taylor Townsend, the world No. She has teamed up with Ben Shelton. The reimagining included shrinking the tournament to a two-day event scheduled for August 19 and 20 to allow big-time singles players to use it as a competitive warm-up for their singles competitions. Also, the sets are first to four games rather than six. Several top doubles players have complained that the USTA has turned a legitimate competition into an exhibition. Now it appears the organizers may have made it too appealing, pitting committed doubles players against stars in singles. That said, they have also given themselves an opportunity to test the age-old question of whether two singles stars are better than doubles specialists at their own game. The question now, though, is how many of those doubles specialists will get the opportunity to represent their cohort and how the USTA will justify its choices. Williams put in a solid audition on Monday. Crowds packed a field court to watch her play doubles at the Citi Open in Washington, D.C. with Hailey Baptiste, who is nearly half Williams's age and a growing force on the tour this season. They notched a decisive  6-3, 6-1 win over Eugenie Bouchard and Clervie Ngounoue. It was Williams's first appearance in a tour event since March of 2024, when she lost an opening-round match at the Miami Open. **Denotes new entrant since initial announcement on 6/17 (Top photo of Alex de Minaur and Katie Boulter: Clive Brunskill / Getty Images) He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thursday's action at the 2025 ATP Citi Open features an impressive amount of third-round matches, with all 16 remaining talents playing for a spot in the quarterfinals in Washington, D.C. As always, LWOT previews and predicts the upcoming matches, with this set of matches featuring a Top 10 player and home favorite Ben Shelton. Recently, Norrie hasn't had the best couple of seasons on Tour, but his form has turned a corner, stunning No. The Brit won the pair's last three matches–not dropping a set–while Nakashima hasn't had to face as challenging opponents, taking out Ethan Quinn in his lone match this week. He should have the momentum he needs to reach the quarterfinals, and look for him to win in a minor upset. Evans, the 2023 champion at this tournament, played a solid match to defeat home favorite Alex Michelsen in the second round. However, Moutet has arguably looked stronger as of late; after appearing in the draw as a lucky loser, he brushed past Alexandre Muller 6-0 6-1. Moutet won the pair's two meetings, but they haven't played since 2021. He's clearly seemed comfortable with the court speed and conditions, and the 35-year-old's backhand slice and tricky serve can frustrate Moutet if the Frenchman can't replicate his earlier strong form. Lehecka struggled in his opening match win against Zachary Svadja, having to battle deep into a third set. De Minaur, the finalist here in 2018, took out Yunchaokete Bu 7-6(5) 6-2 in his first match, and his stronger second-set performance should give him confidence going into this match. While Lehecka cruised past the Aussie in their last meeting on grass this year, De Minaur prefers these types of hard courts and can grind down Lehecka with his defense in hot conditions, expected to hit 90 degrees on Thursday. There should be fireworks in this match, with two of the strongest servers and ball-strikers in the game facing off. While the two are vulnerable to unforced errors, they're both young and should be laser-focused given it's both their first meeting and a key event on their preferred surfaces. The serve should be the major factor in this match, and Shelton has a bit more experience on the big stage that could favor him deep in sets or in tiebreakers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>90, saved all three break points against Emma Navarro to score her third win over the American and move one step closer to a much-needed deep run. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Maria Sakkari hit the sweet spot of her career in 2022 and 2023, finishing as year-end No. This year, though, has been something of a slog. 2 seed Emma Navarro was added to her list of victims. Sakkari scored a 7-5, 7-6 (1) win over Navarro to advance to the quarterfinals of the Mubadala Citi DC Open. Sakkari, who received a wild card into the main draw, has now won three of four career matches against the 24-year-old American. She'll play the winner of Thursday's highly anticipated match between Grand Slam champions Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu on Friday. It turns out that Sakkari does have a special connection with the area. Her boyfriend went to Georgetown University graduate school and works in the city. “So now I'm actually going to spend my birthday on Friday here.,” Sakkari told reporters. “Hopefully with a win, but I'm just excited that I can be home and just feel how -- because I don't have a tournament at home in Greece -- just experience the whole, how can I say, atmosphere around playing at your adopted home.” Navarro is ranked 79 spots higher than Sakkari, but she could never get it going. Energized and bouncing around like it was 2022, Sakkari saved all three of the break points against her. Sakkari served well, winning 60 of 85, and had seven aces -- two in the tiebreak. Even before her heyday, Sakkari could hang with the best. In 2021, she posted a WTA Tour-high nine wins against Top 10 players. This year, it's been difficult; before beating Navarro, Sakkari had lost 11 of 13 matches to seeded players in 2025. Now, she's looking for a slice of history, trying to emulate the feats of Paula Badosa (2024) and Nadia Petrova (20112), who won the title here as wild cards. 90, saved all three break points against Emma Navarro to score her third win over the American and move one step closer to a much-needed deep run.</p>
