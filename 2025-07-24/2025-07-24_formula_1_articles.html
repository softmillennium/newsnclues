                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies sits down with F1.com Alex Albon went into 2025 facing one big question. With the arrival of Carlos Sainz at Williams, how would he measure up against his most competitive team mate since racing alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull? So far, Albon has answered that question on track – having the edge over Sainz in Qualifying and on race day in the first half of the season. So, is he a better driver than last year or are we just appreciating his talent more? Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Albon talks about what it's like having Sainz on the other side of the garage, what changes he has made to his approach this year, why the culture and energy at Williams feels different, and how his relationship with Team Principal James Vowles is growing. Plus, Albon also looks ahead to 2026 and the arrival of new cars and regulations. Will next season be his time to shine?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies sits down with F1.com Mercedes drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli have given updates on their contract situations for 2026 ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix Mercedes drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli have given updates on their contract situations for 2026 ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, amid ongoing rumours surrounding Max Verstappen potentially joining the team. Russell has faced questioning for several weeks about his future with Mercedes, as speculation grew that Verstappen could move to the Silver Arrows ahead of regulation changes next season. While reports suggest that talks between Verstappen and Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff have cooled in recent days, no confirmation was given on Thursday during media day ahead of the race at Spa. "It's not really having any impact on me whatsoever," said Russell when asked about the contract situation. Russell has enjoyed a relatively strong campaign for Mercedes in 2025 so far, consisting of five podiums which included victory in the Canadian Grand Prix. Despite the uncertainty of his contract situation, Russell claimed he has not looked to other options on the grid for 2026 and intends to extend his relationship with Mercedes for a fifth season. He added: "I'm not really exploring options at the moment. There's a lot been blown up in the media, I'm not even thinking about it really because I know everything will work itself out in due course. "[It] feels like everyone is more worried about my future than myself to be honest. Team mate Kimi Antonelli also provided an update on his contract situation, with the Italian rookie having yet to be confirmed for 2026 as well. The 18-year-old has made steady progress after 12 Grands Prix, which included taking his maiden podium in Montreal, and it's believed he will be retained given Mercedes' push to bring him up through the junior ranks. "One million dollar question," said Antonelli in the drivers' press conference when asked about his own future. Toto has been clear which is good to see.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies sits down with F1.com Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg has opened up on the "overwhelming" messages he received after his maiden Formula 1 podium. On his 239th start, Hulkenberg stood on the podium for the first time in a Grand Prix earlier this month at Silverstone having survived the changeable weather and late pressure from seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton to claim a popular and unlikely result. The German also confirmed he had visited Sauber's factory back in Switzerland in order to enjoy the moment with those who had not been at Silverstone. It was good, amazing memories, amazing emotions for us and I hope that they can boost us for the rest of the season," he said. Sauber has been on a strong run of form of late, scoring more points in the last four races than Red Bull thanks to a run of points finishes for Hulkenberg, while team mate Gabriel Bortoleto bagged his maiden points in Austria. "I think you also have to remember on Saturday [at Silverstone] both cars were out in Q1 and it didn't look that fantastic and had it been a dry race, it would have been a totally different story and outcome," admitted Hulkenberg. "You always have to remember that, but definitely from Barcelona we gained some momentum. We made a big step forward with the car and especially in the long stints we have a good race car now and we can do something even with not the best starting position. "I think many teams can aim for that [P5 in the championship]. I think there's probably all the midfield teams that can have a crack at it and realistic chance. It's always going to be a little bit track dependent maybe who is going to be more competitive that weekend but I feel that we're all in a very tight battle."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies sits down with F1.com What do Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc think is possible for Ferrari as they prepare to run a revised rear suspension at the Belgian Grand Prix? Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc have given their verdicts on the upgrade that Ferrari have brought to the Belgian Grand Prix, with the SF-25 set to run a revised rear suspension. I think for me the positive thing is arriving at the filming day where you see that new bits are coming, you see that we are getting development. “In general we had an upgraded floor in Bahrain, then it was quite some time before we got another upgrade, I think it was Austria, so pace-wise it wasn't necessarily what I would have thought we would have. “If you look at some of the other teams, they bring small pieces every weekend. Red Bull often do and Mercedes do, for example, whereas these are more like big chunks along the way. “I think I was just really happy to see that there clearly is a big pushback at the factory, there are a lot of changes, and then to see the results with those changes takes time, so I was just really grateful to see we've got new parts. We'll try and put them to use this weekend.” Leclerc was also cautious when asked if the revised rear suspension could help Ferrari to move closer to winning this year. I would be careful of saying that,” the Monegasque responded. “I don't think there's anything in the car that today, even if we put the best of the best parts [on], will give us three or four tenths which is what we are lacking compared to McLaren, so that's not the only thing that will make us go back to winning. “It's a Sprint weekend so we've got to be on top of things very, very quickly, and we also have some new parts which we'll have to understand how they work as quickly as possible, but I'm not too concerned about that part,” the 27-year-old added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: New Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies sits down with F1.com Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, including potential race winners, podium finishers and more. But who might emerge triumphant at Round 13? Here are what the odds tell us... Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. Team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have notched up 20 podiums and nine wins in the first 12 rounds. However, Norris is the in-form driver, with three triumphs in his last five starts. Lewis Hamilton is a five-time victor at Spa, but his last win was bittersweet. While three-time winner Max Verstappen can't be ruled out, he is still enduring braking issues and challenges with oversteer and understeer this season, which makes him too unpredictable to tip this weekend. The Briton has sprayed champagne five times this year, including once as a winner, averaging 4.92. Despite his success in Canada, his average has risen to 6.20 over the previous five rounds. Nico Hulkenberg surprised many with his top three at Silverstone, but Spa is the type of track where the German could pull it off again. No driver has won the Grand Prix starting from pole at Spa since 2021, showing that anything can happen. The result handed Alpine their single biggest haul of points in a round, despite his team mate's car failing to start the race. Alex Albon will start in Belgium off the back of an eighth place return last time out, helping him terminate a three-race DNF streak. The Thai driver is a three-time top-six performer this year, averaging 7.67 in the nine races he's completed. Isack Hadjar, Esteban Ocon and Carlos Sainz are tied on five top 10s apiece. Hamilton prevailed on his last trip around Spa from third place, and Verstappen the previous two, from sixth and 14th, respectively. Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri are joint leaders in Qualifying with four pole positions each in 2025 followed by Lando Norris on three. Red Bull have bagged the spoils in three of the previous seven trips to Belgium. McLaren haven't featured in the conversation of this race in recent years, but that changed last year when Piastri claimed runner-up. In addition, the Woking outfit have lifted the constructor trophy in 75% of events this year. They are undoubtedly the team to topple in Belgium. After two races, Ferrari and McLaren each have a scalp, thanks to Hamilton in Shanghai and Norris in Miami. Despite his struggles in the big races, the seven-time World Champion has started the Sprint season strong, taking podiums in both outings and averaging 2.00.</p>
