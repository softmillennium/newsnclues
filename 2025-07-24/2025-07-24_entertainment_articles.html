                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chuck Mangione, a leading figure in contemporary jazz and the musician behind crossover hit “Feels So Good,” has died. The instrumentalist died two days prior, with Bartolomeo & Perreto Funeral Home noting that he passed away in his sleep. Born Nov. 29, 1940, Mangione grew up listening to jazz music and learning from the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, who was a “family friend,” according to Mangione's bio on Spotify. An alum of Eastman School of Music — where he would later serve as faculty director of the Eastman Jazz Orchestra — Mangione played in a quintet called the Jazz Brothers with his brother, keyboardist Gap, and performed in Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson's big bands. Sabrina Carpenter Reveals 'Man's Best Friend' Tracklist via Golden Retriever 4 on the chart in 1978 — a rare feat for an instrumental pop-jazz recording. Mangione charted 17 albums on the Billboard 200, with Feels So Good earning him his career highest peak at No. Mangione was also a Grammy winner, taking home two of his 14 total nominations. In 1977, he won best instrumental composition for “Bellavia,” and two years later, he was awarded best pop instrumental performance for “Children Of Sanchez.” Voicing himself as a recurring character on King of the Hill, he was always depicted with his signature hat and long hairstyle on the animated series. Two years later, he performed “Give It All You Got” at the 1980 Winter Games closing ceremony in Lake Placid, N.Y.

Although they're not explicitly introduced, fans will quickly recognize the group as human wizard Caleb Widogast (Liam O'Brien), half-orc warlock Fjord Stone (Travis Willingham), human monk Beauregard Lionett (Marisha Ray), half-demon humanoid cleric Jester Lavorre (Laura Bailey), goblin rogue Nott the Brave (Sam Riegel), and horned blood hunter Mollymauk Tealeaf (Taliesin Jaffe) — all reprising their roles from the original actual play campaign. Critical Role Chief Creative Officer and resident Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer, also appears off-screen as the voice of the interrogating guard. Not shown in the clip is aasimar barbarian Yasha Nydoorin, voiced by Ashley Johnson, whose character is confirmed to appear but may not be involved in the trouble at hand. Also rejoining the group is voice actor Robbie Daymond, a newer member of the Critical Role community who's played a major role in recent livestreams and stage shows. The first, The Legend of Vox Machina, adapted the group's first major actual play campaign that originally aired live on Twitch, and has already run for three seasons on Amazon Prime, with a fourth expected next year. News of the show has been scarce since its initial announcement, but fans of Critical Role have been clamoring for more of their favorite “nerdy ass voice actors,” whose most recent Dungeons & Dragons campaign came to its conclusion in February. Since then, the Critical Role cast has been very busy, hitting the road for a string of live shows as well as launching a new mini-series of actual play called Age of Umbra, utilizing their own tabletop platform Daggerheart rather than D&D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Patrick Aiello and Timur Bekmambetov‘s reboot of War of the Worlds is debuting around the world on Prime Video on July 30. Wells' classic novel follows Will Radford (Ice Cube), a top cyber-security analyst for Homeland Security, who spends his days tracking potential threats to national security through a mass surveillance program, until an attack by an unknown entity leads him to question whether the government is hiding something from him … and the rest of the world. The Rich Lee-directed movie also stars Eva Longoria, Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage, Henry Hunter Hall, Iman Benson, Devon Bostick and Michael O'Neill. “When catastrophes happen today, we experience them through our devices. That insight shaped the storytelling and tech used to create this immersive thriller.” He adds, “For the first time ever, a studio-scale sci-fi epic has been produced using a format that places audiences inside the action through the lenses of phones, computers, and tablets. It's a visceral, first-person experience designed for big screens in a language and format that is now natural within our daily lives.” “It'll be exciting for audiences to watch the movie and ask themselves: If aliens invaded today, how would we experience it? Most likely, we'd be watching it on our phones,” says Bekmambetov. Today, that medium is the screen of our devices.” Bekmambetov's feature credits include Unfriended (2015), Searching (2018) and Missing (2023), which have collectively grossed more than $200 million globally. His latest Screenlife production, the digital heist thriller LifeHack, premiered at SXSW in March and currently holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. As a director, he is set to release his new techno thriller Mercy in January; the Amazon MGM Studios project stars Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson and is produced by Bekmambetov and Oppenheimer's Charles Roven. Cube is repped by UTA, Prospect Park and Ziffren Brittenham. Lee is with Paradigm and Anonymous Content. Hyman is represented by Independent Artist Group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump, whom creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone avoided directly depicting for years, finally made his South Park debut on Wednesday night. Colbert Teases Trump After Name Reportedly Listed in Epstein Files: "Mystery Man Known Only as Micropenis DJT" 'South Park' Lampoons Trump in Shocking Season 27 Premiere as Creators Ink $1.5 Billion Deal The president was depicted similarly to South Park's portrayal of Saddam Hussein in its 1999 feature-length movie, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut: ill-tempered, conniving and cruel. The depiction of Trump's fully nude, small penis, which is on full display while he is in bed with Satan, is topped only by a show-capping phony public service announcement in which an AI-rendered Trump walks through the desert, his penis soon exposed and speaking to him. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. Ratings numbers are not yet available for Wednesday night's 27th season premiere, but according to Nielsen's ratings for April 2023, the first month that South Park's 26th season was available on HBO Max, it logged 700 million minutes of viewing time. This made it the most watched adult animated series that month. Trump's appointed FCC chair, Brendan Carr, said Thursday that he does not watch South Park but added that Trump is of the opinion that “a handful of national programmers” should not “control and dictate to the American what the narrative is, what they can say, what they can think.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Metrograph Pictures, the upstart distributor that launched in 2019 with an eye toward restorations and re-releases before pushing into new acquisitions ahead of Cannes 2024, is pausing all theatrical releases, IndieWire has learned. This is the distribution arm of Metrograph, Alexander Olch's company, which also operates a successful two-screen indie theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side that opened in 2016. With theatrical releases on hold, IndieWire understands via sources that Metrograph Pictures is handling payments to third parties in due course as the distributor pauses business operations. In better news, David Laub, the former A24 executive whom Olch tapped as Metrograph Pictures' distribution film chief in February 2024, has now been hired by Neon to serve as senior vice president of publicity and marketing. Prior to Laub's hiring, Metrograph Pictures was primarily focused on re-releasing unsung classics, such as Andrzej Żuławski's 1981 film “Possession” and Tsai Ming-liang's 2003 film “Goodbye, Dragon Inn.” The company hired Laub to expand its output, including distribution and financing, into current films.

Former Cinetic marketing head Werner began his Cannes-announced tenure as Neon's president of global cinema this summer. At A24, Laub oversaw the marketing and distribution of success stories like “Aftersun” and “First Reformed.” Laub will work on campaigns for Neon's fall awards slate, including Cannes winners “Sentimental Value,” “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sîrat,” and “The Secret Agent,” as well as Park Chan-wook's Venice premiere “No Other Choice.” In response to IndieWire's inquiry, Metrograph shared an exclusive statement: “We are thrilled for David and Neon as they continue to build their business and look forward to working with them closely, and we are grateful for everything David has done for Metrograph Pictures. Laub oversaw a handful of independent film releases in his 17 months at Metrograph Pictures. It has been the primary brick-and-mortar for select Metrograph Pictures premieres, too, although they also screened at other theaters in New York and Los Angeles and nationwide. Films Metrograph Pictures distributed in 2024-2025 include Dea Kulumbegashvili's “April,” India Donaldson's “Good One,” and Ryan J. Sloan's “Gazer,” all critical hits off the 2024 festival circuit. Sources close to the productions told IndieWire that Metrograph Pictures returned the films to their sales agents; IndieWire confirmed “Happyend” has found a new U.S. distributor that will be announced soon ahead of a planned fall release. Earlier this year, Metrograph Pictures acquired distribution rights to Christian Petzold's 2025 Directors' Fortnight premiere “Miroirs No. Metrograph Pictures otherwise had no other forthcoming releases on its docket. The dissolution of Metrograph Pictures is another sign of a contracting independent and studio film space, as layoffs continue industry-wide and buzzy festival acquisition titles remain without a home. Encouragingly, 1-2 Special acquired Harris Dickinson's much-talked-about directorial debut “Urchin” earlier this month. A 35mm Friday night screening of Josh and Benny Safdie's New York City-set “Heaven Knows What,” accompanied by an intro from Josh, is also sold out.

But the South Korean auteur's twelfth feature, which was reportedly not ready in time for Cannes, appears to be making up for lost time with a fall festival run. Neon has released the first teaser for Park's new film, which stars “Squid Game” villain Lee Byung-hun and Korean actress Son Ye-jin as a married couple whose lives take a dark turn after he is fired from a paper company and struggles to find other work.

A fall release date could put it on the road to landing an Oscar nomination — a goal that evaded Park's previous film, “Decision to Leave.” Maybe you can have more freedom and a bigger budget, depending on how big the award is.” “Decision to Leave” was praised by critics following its 2023 Cannes premiere, with IndieWire's David Ehrlich writing “Here's a sentence I never expected to write: The most romantic movie of the year (so far) is a police procedural. Then again, I wasn't aware that ‘Oldboy' director Park Chan-wook — whose operatic revenge melodramas have given way to a series of ravishingly baroque Hitchcockian love stories about the various ‘perversities' that might bind two wayward souls together — was making a detective thriller.

Lee has, over the years, amassed an enviable body of work adapting King's work, including It and It: Chapter Two, as well as Doctor Sleep, and Salem's Lot. Long Walk, which will have a panel in Hall H Friday at San Diego Comic-Con, adapts King's 1979 horror novel and stars a list of next generation Hollywood talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deal includes partial rights to some of Clarkson's most recognizable hits: "Since U Been Gone" and "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)." HarbourView Equity Partners, the Newark, NJ-based music and media investment company that owns rights to the catalogs of Fleetwood Mac, Nelly and Kane Brown, said on Thursday it acquired a stake in the catalog of powerhouse singer and original American Idol queen Kelly Clarkson. The acquisition includes partial rights to some of Clarkson's most recognizable hits: “Since U Been Gone,” which spent its first seven weeks at No. Details including financial terms the types of rights were not disclosed. A three-time Grammy Award-winner, including two for her sophomore album, 2004's Breakaway, Clarkson's career has gone full circle, with her returning to television with her The Kelly Clarkson Show recently getting renewed for its seventh season. Her success across multiple music and entertainment platforms — Clarkson is currently doing a residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas — compliments HarbourView's multi-platform investment strategy, founder Sherrese Clarke tells Billboard. She like us is more than one thing. In a statement, Clarkson said, “My music is such a huge part of my journey – not just professionally, but personally. I'm grateful to HarbourView for valuing and supporting this catalog.” Last month, HarbourView announced it raised $500 million through the sale of a private asset-backed securitization (ABS) to insurance vehicles managed by global investment firm KKR. Since Clarke founded HarbourView in 2021, the firm has acquired more than 70 music catalogs and accumulated approximately $2.67 billion in regulatory assets under management. Their portfolio includes stakes in songs by artists like Wiz Khalifa and Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie, as well as stakes in the production companies MACRO and Mucho Mas Media. Through its entertainment-focused arm, Harbourview is financing a slate of hip-hop biopics — including one about Queen Latifah — for Will Smith's Westbrook Studios, Flavor Unit and Jesse Collins Entertainment. The company also recently announce a strategic partnership with Issa Rae's ColorCreative and it led an $85-million investment round into the children's content company Animaj, powered by proprietary, creator safe, GenAI, reflecting its broader vision for media innovation. Clarke acknowledges the marketplace for content remains challenged by the industry's shift to streaming economics, but says HarbourView's investment strategies rely on vigorously vetted data. “The media landscape is undergoing a massive shift,” Clarke tells Billboard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As fans and friends continue to mourn the tragic passing of beloved actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, new details have emerged about what exactly happened in the star's final hours. Warner died at age 54 in an accidental drowning caused by a rip tide on July 20, 2025. Officials have been piecing together the details ever since, and those at the scene have reported that Warner was enjoying a day of surfing and swimming when he died. At the time of his death, Warner had been in Costa Rica for a week, according to TMZ. TMZ reported that Warner had flown to Costa Rica from Atlanta. A source confirmed to People that Warner was on a family vacation with his wife and daughter, whom he has never identified publicly. However, TMZ reported on July 23 that Warner's wife was not in Costa Rica at the time of his death. A “source with direct knowledge” told TMZ that Warner and his daughter had been in the country for a “home-schooling program.” The source said his wife had been with them “a few weeks prior to his death,” but had left before July 20. TMZ was told she learned about the tragedy via a phone call. Mike Geist, vice president of Caribbean Guard, a group of 35 volunteer lifeguards in the area, told Us Weekly that Warner and “a group of unidentified individuals” were at the beach for a surf lesson earlier in the day. “They had a good surf lesson,” Geist told the outlet. The Costa Rica Red Cross said it responded to a “water-related” incident at the Playa Grande resort in Cahuita, Limón around 2:10 p.m., per People. Officials have since said that a strong rip tide swept Warner offshore. He has since been treated and released, People reported on July 23. Dr. Mauricio Solano Corella, Medical Director for the Talamanca Health Area, told People that the man was a 29-year-old  from Nicaragua who had also been trying to rescue Warner. “(He) gave him five emergency breaths — which is always our best chance of bringing someone back — when he got him above the water and then was able to bring him into shore quickly where they started CPR.” Geist told Us Weekly the emergency responders arrived within 11 or 12 minutes. In a statement to the New York Times, a Costa Rican Red Cross spokesperson explained that after Warner was found and pulled from water, he was given CPR for more than 20 minutes, but said rescuers were not able to resuscitate him. Police, meanwhile, told ABC News that CPR efforts lasted for 45 minutes. Warner's body was transported to a local morgue for an autopsy. The Judicial Investigation Department in Costa Rica confirmed that Warner's death was accidental, caused by “asphyxiation by submersion,” per the New York Times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Gisele Bündchen split from Tom Brady, her husband of over a decade, she moved on with boyfriend, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. The pair have been romantically linked since 2023, and in February 2025, they welcomed their first child together. Now, she is sharing a glimpse into their lives. She chose not to share her child's face, but she did show photos from the side and back, including a picture of herself and her children embracing. Bündchen posted several pictures on Instagram, where she has 22.9 million followers. “I've been quiet over here but very busy living life..Sometimes, the most beautiful moments aren't shared — they're simply lived,” she wrote. She commented that it was also Mother's Day and that her “heart is full.” She continued, “Being a mother it's been my greatest gift, a journey that humbles me, teaches me, and fills me with gratitude every single day. Fans have reacted to the post with messages of praise, congratulations, and heart emojis. Bündchen is a dedicated mom, but she has also spoken openly about her struggles with motherhood. It was like a part of me died,” she wrote in her 2018 memoir, “Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life,” Us Weekly reports. But now I had this little being, and I suddenly felt l couldn't do other things, and that was very hard for me. She has also reminded fans that it's OK not to have everything figured out. “I believe that bringing a life into this world is the single most important thing a person can undertake, and it can also be the most challenging,” she wrote in a blog post in August 2010, Us Weekly reports. “I think as mothers we are all just trying our best.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans missing the vibes of Peacock's two-season sitcom Rutherford Falls—and hopeful that a new TV project from series co-creator Sierra Teller Ornelas, co-star Bobby Wilson, and comedian Jackie Keliiaa might scratch the itch left behind by its cancellation—are out of luck, turns out. Deadline reports that NBC has just passed on the pilot for Untitled Ornelas, Keliiaa, And Wilson Project (probably not the final name), which would have been an ensemble comedy about folks trying to keep a Native community center going in Oakland, California. As noted by Deadline, the untitled project was one of three comedy pilots NBC ordered this year, alongside Tracy Morgan and Daniel Radliffe's The Fall And Rise Of Reggie Dinkins—in which “A fallen football player star seeks redemption and a chance to restore his tarnished reputation” which is somehow not Hulu's Chad Powers—and single-camera cheerleading comedy Stumble. (Both of the other pilots have since been picked up to series.) It's disappointing news, in so far as Rutherford Falls (which Ornelas co-created with Mike Schur and Ed Helms), was a funny, smart look at people attempting to come to terms with America's history (and present), with a ton of focus on indigenous representation. (Also: Just a lot of very funny jokes.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Action plan” is one of those phrases you can only really trust when it's coming out of Keanu Reeves or Jason Statham's mouth; left to the ministrations of a guy like current White House incumbent Donald Trump, the in-isolation cool words—action! plan!—tend to shift and mutate, transforming from thoughts of diving through windows or not looking at explosions to something far grosser and more corrupt. Take, for instance, the White House's new “AI Action Plan,” which Trump has begun rolling out this week, including in a speech at an AI Summit where he encouraged U.S. copyright holders to pretty much give up on their dreams of actually getting paid when AI tech folk train their large language models on copyrighted works. Citing an old standby—the classic “Treating people with respect for creativity or ownership of their own stuff is just asking for China to beat us” defense—Trump stated in a press conference today that “You can't be expected to have a successful AI program when every single article, book or whatever you've studied you're expected to pay for.” He failed to follow-up that up with what would seem to be a natural corollary—i.e., that any business model that's entirely reliant on theft in order to function may have some fundamental issues—and instead stated that, “You just can't do that because it's not do-able. Per Deadline, the actual Action Plan mostly sidesteps the copyright issue, although Trump wasn't shy in his remarks about suggesting “common sense solutions,” including trying to float a line that we don't pay authors every time we learn something from their books, right? In case that wasn't sufficiently distracting from the whole “just give up and let 'em take it” element, Trump also issued one of his periodic executive orders this evening, titled “Preventing Woke AI In The Federal Government,” and, yeah, there's the ol' familiar headache that sets in every time we have to read something off that increasingly recognizable dark blue letterhead. The EO is exactly what it sounds like: A call for any LLMs the U.S. government works with to be free of “ideology” or DEI, which should be a neat trick when Trump is actively encouraging developers to dump copyrighted works—often considered a pretty hefty breeding ground for “ideology”—straight into their machines.
