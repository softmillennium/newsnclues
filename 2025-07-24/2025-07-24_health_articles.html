Much of the hubbub in health care this year has been focused on Medicaid, which faces dramatically reduced federal funding as the result of the huge budget bill signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month. But now the attention is turning to the Affordable Care Act, which is facing some big changes that could cost many consumers their health coverage as soon as 2026. Meanwhile, changes to immigration policy under Trump could have an outsize impact on the nation's health care system, both by exacerbating shortages of health workers and by eliminating insurance coverage that helps keep some hospitals and clinics afloat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a central role in maintaining energy balance in cells, especially under energy stress. While upstream activation by the kinase LKB1 is well recognized, the precise mechanism by which LKB1 is mobilized under energy-deficient conditions has remained elusive. A recent study published in Life Metabolism reports that ROS, molecules often associated with oxidative stress, serve as critical signaling intermediates in this process. Under conditions such as glucose deprivation or metformin treatment, intracellular ROS levels rise, promoting the S-glutathionylation of PKCζ at cysteine 48. This post-translational modification facilitates the interaction of PKCζ with the nuclear transport protein KPNA2 and its translocation into the nucleus, where PKCζ phosphorylates LKB1 at serine 428, triggering its export to the cytoplasm and activation of AMPK via phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172. Disruption of ROS homeostasis with antioxidants like NAC or vitamin E blocks this cascade, indicating the essential role of ROS in AMPK activation. In high-fat diet-fed mice, NAC treatment exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation and blunted AMPK signaling, effects that could be reversed by overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK. Moreover, the hypoglycemic effect of metformin was abolished by NAC in diabetic mice, underscoring the importance of ROS in mediating AMPK-dependent metabolic benefits. This work uncovers a novel redox-sensitive pathway that governs AMPK activation during energy stress. It suggests that interfering with ROS signaling might inadvertently compromise the efficacy of metabolic therapeutics like metformin. The findings not only deepen our understanding of energy-sensing pathways but also offer a framework for future interventions targeting redox-AMPK signaling in metabolic diseases. Energy stress-induced PKCζ S-glutathionylation is essential for LKB1 cytoplasmic translocation and AMPK activation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, with a three-year, $1.2 million grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Penn State will study the underlying mechanisms of nightmares and their relationship with anxiety-related mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). "To me, the exciting thing about this research is that we now have a way to gain insight into the purpose of dreams," said Drew, who also has affiliations with the biomedical engineering, neurosurgery and biology departments at Penn State. "The question of why we dream has puzzled mankind for millennia, and by looking at what changes in neural circuits and behaviors nightmares cause, we hope to be able to figure out the biological purpose of dreaming." Though effective in preventing malaria, the drug is no longer prescribed due its serious neurological side effects, including inducing nightmares. The researchers will test mice treated with the drug for two weeks while monitoring them for unusual behaviors. "In the past, it has been hard to study dreams, because it is hard to determine what is a regular dream state and what is a nightmare," Zhang said. Led by Drew, researchers will use novel imaging techniques to map the mice's facial expressions and pupil sizes to know which sleep stage they are in. The team will also use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), led by Zhang, and calcium signal recording, led by Drew, to record the specific neuron type that might be underlying the dream or nightmare. Through the various imaging methods and behavioral observations, researchers will record what is happening within the animals' brains at each sleep stage, including rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement stages. Through these observations, the researchers said they hope to determine if there is an indication of nightmares having a relationship with mental health disorders, like PTSD. "Most people believe that nightmares are a consequence of having PTSD, but there is also the possibility that nightmares could exacerbate symptoms or even cause the presence of mental disorders," Zhang explained. If successful, their model could lead to sleep intervention-based treatments for people suffering with these conditions, according to the researchers. Penn State is distinctively suited to carry out this research, both in the capabilities of our team and in possessing the resources and intellectual space for a high-risk question like this one. Our post-docs and grad students, in particular, have an opportunity to contribute to a fascinating philosophical and biological research question that very few scientists will ever get to work on in their entire career." As a philanthropic institution, the foundation supports discoveries in science, engineering and medical research that are distinctive or novel in their approach or promise to develop new technologies, instrumentation or methods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike earlier studies that mainly focused on heart health or overall death rates, this research, published in The Lancet Public Health journal, is the first to comprehensively examine how taking more steps per day can reduce the risk of several different health outcomes. The study also revealed that even modest step counts (around 4,000 steps per day) are linked to better health compared to very low activity (around 2,000 steps per day). For some conditions, such as heart disease, health benefits continued to increase beyond 7,000 steps, but for most conditions, the benefits tended to level off. The authors highlight that 7,000 steps per day may be a more realistic target than the current unofficial target of 10,000 steps per day, particularly for those who are less active, suggesting that this target can still provide significant improvements in health. The systematic review included 57 studies, of which 31 studies were included in meta-analyses, providing the most comprehensive evidence to date of the association between the number of daily steps and a wide range of health outcomes. The authors caution that the evidence for health benefits for most conditions, such as cancer and dementia, is supported by a small number of studies, meaning there is a low level of certainty for those results, and many of the studies included did not account for some confounding factors, like age or frailty, that could bias the findings. The authors say that their study underscores the value of using daily step counts as a straightforward way to measure physical activity. They suggest these results could help shape future public health guidelines and recommendations, encouraging more people to track their steps as a practical way to improve their health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The BOHEMIA trial, the largest study on ivermectin for malaria to date, showed a 26% reduction in new malaria infection on top of existing bed nets, providing strong evidence of ivermectin's potential as a complementary tool in malaria control. Malaria remains a global health challenge, with 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths reported in 2023. Current vector control methods, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), have become less effective due to insecticide resistance and behavioral adaptations in mosquitoes to bite outdoors and during dusk or dawn, when people are not protected by these measures. This underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions to combat malaria. Ivermectin, a drug traditionally used to treat neglected tropical diseases like onchocerciasis, which causes river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis, which causes elephantiasis, has been shown to reduce malaria transmission by killing the mosquitoes that feed on treated individuals. Given the rising resistance to conventional insecticides, ivermectin could offer an effective new approach to tackle malaria transmission, especially in regions where traditional methods have become less effective. The Unitaid-funded BOHEMIA project (Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa) conducted two Mass Drug Administration (MDA) trials in the high-burden malaria regions: Kwale County (Kenya) and Mopeia district (Mozambique). The trial involved over 20,000 participants and more than 56,000 treatments, demonstrating that ivermectin significantly reduced malaria infection rates-particularly among children living further from cluster borders or in areas where drug distribution was more efficient. Moreover, the safety profile of ivermectin was favourable, with no severe drug-related adverse events and only mild, transient side effects already seen with ivermectin in campaigns against neglected tropical diseases. "Ivermectin has shown great promise in reducing malaria transmission and could complement existing control measures. With continued research, ivermectin MDA could become an effective tool for malaria control and even contribute to elimination efforts," Chaccour, who is now a researcher at the Navarra Centre for International Development at the University of Navarra, adds. "These results align with the World Health Organization's (WHO) criteria for new vector control tools", states Joseph Mwangangi, from the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme. The findings suggest that ivermectin MDA could be a valuable complementary strategy for malaria control, particularly in areas where mosquito resistance to insecticides is a growing concern." Marta Maia, BOHEMIA's lead entomologist, University of Oxford In contrast, the implementation of the Mozambique trial in the rural district of Mopeia faced severe disruptions due to Cyclone Gombe (2022) and a subsequent cholera outbreak, which significantly disrupted operations. "One of the most important lessons we learned from the trial in Mopeia is that strong community engagement is essential," states Francisco Saúte, director of the Manhiça Health Research Centre (CISM). "Building trust with local communities and fostering close collaboration with the Health Ministry, National Malaria Control Program, and local authorities was key to ensuring acceptance of the ivermectin MDA." In addition to reducing malaria transmission, ivermectin MDA offers significant collateral benefits. These effects are particularly valuable when ivermectin is integrated into existing delivery systems, maximising its impact on public health. The study is part of a larger global effort to assess ivermectin's potential in malaria control. Findings were also shared with national health authorities as they evaluate the potential inclusion of ivermectin in malaria control programmes. "This research has the potential to shape the future of malaria prevention, particularly in endemic areas where existing tools are failing", concludes Regina Rabinovich, BOHEMIA PI and Director of ISGlobal's Malaria Elimination Initiative. "With its novel mechanism of action and proven safety profile, ivermectin could offer a new approach using a well-known, safe drug that can add to the effect of other mosquito control tools available today."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers led by UC Davis Health scientist Sanchita Bhatnagar have developed a promising gene therapy that could treat Rett syndrome. The therapy works on reactivating healthy but silent genes responsible for this rare disorder and possibly other X-linked conditions, such as fragile X syndrome. Their findings were published in Nature Communications. Rett syndrome is a genetic condition that affects mostly girls. It is caused by a defective MECP2 gene located on the X chromosome. This gene contains instructions for the synthesis of MeCP2 protein. Girls with Rett syndrome may have too little of this protein or their protein may not work properly. This protein deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, including loss of speech, impaired hand movements, breathing difficulties and seizures. In each cell, one X chromosome will randomly be silenced in a process known as X chromosome inactivation (XCI). In girls with Rett syndrome, the silenced chromosome carries a healthy copy of MECP2. Bhatnagar is an associate professor with the UC Davis Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology and runs The Bhatnagar Laboratory. She is an assistant research program leader at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and a researcher at the MIND Institute. The new study did a genome-wide screening to identify small RNA molecules (microRNA) involved in XCI and X-linked gene silencing. It found that microRNA-106a (miR-106a) was active in switching off X chromosomes and the MECP2 gene. For that, they used a female mouse model of Rett syndrome and a gene therapy vector developed by Professor Kathrin Meyer at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. "The diseased cell holds its own cure. With our technology, we are just making it aware of its ability to replace the faulty gene with a functional gene," Bhatnagar explained. "Even a small amount of this gene expression (activation) has therapeutic benefit." "Our gene therapy-based approach targeting X chromosome silencing showed significant improvement of several symptoms of Rett syndrome," Bhatnagar said. "Girls with Rett exhibit a wide range of symptoms, limited mobility and communication skills. It would be life-changing if we can help reverse some of their symptoms so they can speak if they're hungry or walk to get a drink. What if we can prevent these seizures and apnea episodes, or simply reduce them?" For families affected by Rett syndrome, this discovery brings some hope that a treatment could one day change lives. This approach could also work for similar conditions caused by X-linked genes. Targeting microRNA-dependent control of X chromosome inactivation improves the Rett Syndrome phenotype.
