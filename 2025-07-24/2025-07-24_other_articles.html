                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'Supernatural' Star Jensen Ackles Makes Bold Comment About His Character, Dean Winchester originally appeared on Parade. While speaking to Collider for a June 25 interview, Ackles, who starred as the demon hunter Dean, discussed filming the series for 15 seasons. Ackles spoke about his acting choices for Dean, who famously has difficulty expressing emotions. “I think his vulnerability was something that was heavily guarded in a lot of the first seasons," said the 47-year-old actor. "As the show went on, you got to kind of peel back a little bit of that vulnerability, and see that there's a young kid there who never had a childhood, who missed his father, who missed his mother, who fights for his brother. Ackles also shared he has a preference for playing complex characters, like Dean, on television shows, as opposed to movies. That's one of the reasons why I love doing television so much as opposed to features… You don't just have an hour and a half or two hours to do so. Ackles shared that his equally complex character, Detective Mark Meachum, on the new Prime series, Countdown, is somewhat similar to Dean. He explained while Mark has real-world issues, as opposed to Dean's constant fights with supernatural creatures, both characters face their problems with guns blazing. "There's some familiar aspects to those two characters. This story was originally reported by Parade on Jun 29, 2025, where it first appeared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ChatGPT translation from the article which is in hebrew: Dan Yaakovi served in the "Shaked" special Reconnaissance Unit, and in 1968, went out with his unit for an ambush in the Sinai Desert, Joining the ambush was Major General Shlomo Lahat (“Chich”), who later became the mayor of Tel Aviv, and at the time commanded the armored corps in Sinai (Lahat passed away in 2014; we spoke to one of his sons this week, who said he never heard of this story from his father). We had advanced listening equipment and night vision mounted on a command car. We could identify human movement over 3,000 meters away. When it was my turn on watch, I listened to the desert's sounds. I took off the headphones to see if it was just an equipment failure, around me, there was absolute silence. I opened my eyes wide, trying to locate the source through night vision, and suddenly, I saw a hovering disc-shaped object landing at an estimated 30–40 meters away. Then, a hidden hand closed my eyes. I tried to resist but couldn't. I heard everything happening around me but couldn't even move my little finger.” After what seemed like an eternity, calm returned. I opened my eyes just as Lahat woke up, saw everyone sleeping, and got furious. He shouted: ‘Is this how you run an ambush? Years later, similar small silver silicon stones were found elsewhere.” When I asked why Lahat never told anyone: I guess he thought the same and worried that if he spoke, it would ruin his career: ‘Chich has gone mad.' After the Yom Kippur War broke out, he was badly injured. “For years, I was hospitalized, on crutches or canes, barely walking. That night, he felt what he calls a “summons”, a strong inner feeling that something was about to happen. Suddenly I saw a figure approaching, looked human, maybe. I'm not sure if he spoke to me telepathically or aloud, but he said: ‘We've been waiting for you.' I froze, like before, heard everything but couldn't move. One moment I was outside, the next inside, a maze of corridors lit by a light moving with us. I laid on a treatment bed, one of them took my left hand, and I immediately fell asleep. I drove home, went to bed, woke up confused. Then I saw a scar on my left hand, where they'd touched me, red, fresh. I started screaming; my wife woke up, terrified.” “From that moment, I walked, jumped, did everything. For me, it was a miracle from heave" The stones It's rare to have physical evidence, but Dan Yaakobi does. He kept mysterious silver stones from supposed UFO landing sites. To test them, we placed an ice cube on one of Dan's silver stones and another on a regular stone. I took the stone, hoping to Google it and find an easy explanation, but didn't. Tests found them to be ultra-pure magnesium and silicon, not naturally occurring. Similar stones Dan found were tested by Dr. Gerald Tani, a chemist who worked at the Weizmann Institute. Dr. Tani concluded the stone was synthetic, made by unknown technology. Not proof of alien origin, but until another explanation comes, that's what we have. I sent photos and Dr. Tani's report to a relative at the Technion. He said it looked like regular industrial silicon, maybe volcanic origin, not alien. Dr. Tani rejected that: “You don't find 13 lanthanides in industrial silicon, and melted sand doesn't turn into 99.5% pure silicon,” he said. Finally, I emailed all the material to Prof. Garry Nolan of Stanford. Surprisingly, his assistant replied: he wanted to talk by Zoom. He invited me and the stone to Stanford for detailed lab tests. Nolan hopes we might confirm the stone as non-human technology, and maybe find clues as to why and how it was made. Even then, much of the story may remain shrouded in mystery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a tough year so far for studio horror films, with the odd exception, of course. Only a few weeks after Sony's 28 Years Later appeared to defy trends and deliver a respectable haul at the box office, the studio's I Know What You Did Last Summer legacy sequel found itself being overwhelmed by competition. The slasher film debuted this past week, and underperformed with just under $15 million in its opening frame at the domestic box office. Audiences were clearly more interested in watching the holdover hits Superman, Jurassic World Rebirth, and F1. However, despite its lukewarm debut, I Know What You Did Last Summer has now overtaken one of last year's surprise horror hits, the low-budget supernatural chiller Immaculate. Starring Sydney Sweeney as a nun who moves to Italy and discovers horrific secrets at her convent, Immaculate concluded its box office run with $35 million worldwide and $15 million domestically. It served as Sweeney's first theatrical release following the massive success of the romantic comedy Anyone But You, in which she starred alongside Glen Powell. In the same year, Sweeney would also appear in the superhero film Madame Web, which tanked both critically and commercially. The movie holds a 71% score on the aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, but its audience score is resting at a far lower 58%. The critics' consensus on RT reads, "Immaculate in conception if not always in execution, this religiously themed horror outing is saved by a divine performance from Sydney Sweeney." Directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, I Know What You Did Last Summer has overtaken Immaculate's $15 million domestic haul in five days of release. The movie's global haul stands at $27 million so far. It opened to lackluster reviews, and is currently sitting at a 38% score on the aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, where the critics' consensus reads, "Faithfully harkening back to the original for better or worse, this I Know What You Did Last Summer reboot serves up plenty of nostalgia without finding a compelling hook of its own." You can watch I Know What You Did Last Summer in theaters, and stay tuned to Collider for more updates. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former US Marine with insider knowledge of UAP programs warns potential whistleblowers to think twice before stepping forward – saying the personal and financial costs often far outweigh any official support. You get momentary attention but quickly become sidelined and end up on the fringes. Mike Herrera is a self-identified UAP whistleblower who claims he attended classified SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) briefings where non-human intelligence, biologics, and covert asset recovery programs were discussed. Herrera has been trying for two years to secure a Congressional hearing but remains outside the official whistleblower process. He gained traction in 2023-2024 through TikTok, X, and livestreams, where he speaks emotionally and urgently about being betrayed by the system. Unlike David Grusch, Herrera has no verified credentials, but he's become a polarizing voice in online disclosure circles – seen by some as sincere, by others as unraveling. A video clip of Herrera was recently posted onto the hugely popular r/UFO subreddit. Speaking in a very roundabout way, he appeared to discourage more whistleblowers from coming forward, and got a huge response in the comments. “Is this a genuine but clumsy attempt to protect those with information, or has he been co-opted?” And because the whistleblower community becomes marginalized, they're required to have a semblance of safety in numbers. Another Reddit user responded, “Grusch came forward, canned his promising intelligence career, and two years later, Congress has done jack with it. Why should other whistleblowers feel motivated to publicly testify when that's the precedent?” It represents the rise of mutual-trauma networks online, where abandoned whistleblowers seek validation from each other rather than Congress or the media. A widely used AI coding assistant from Replit reportedly went rogue, wiping a database and generating 4,000 fictional users with completely fabricated data.</p>
