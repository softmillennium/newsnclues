                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Could Hit $150K This Year, Says Mike Novogratz—But Ethereum Might Outperform BTC During a Thursday interview with CNBC, the CEO of digital assets infrastructure company Galaxy said that institutional interest could push the second-biggest cryptocurrency higher after a recent surge. Ethereum—or ETH—was recently trading at nearly $3,730 per coin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after hitting a 2025 record of $3,848 on Monday. The coin is still 24% below its all-time high of $4,878 that it hit in 2021, but has made a comeback. "ETH has caught up a lot," he continued, adding that the virtual coin could hit $4,000 soon. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) Novogratz said that big companies buying the asset was helping propel its rise. Publicly traded companies are copying the Bitcoin treasury model from publicly traded firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy)—but instead of BTC, they're buying ETH. Nasdaq-listed miner BitMine Immersion has aggressively snapped up over the cryptocurrency and now has $2 billion worth of ETH, making it the current leader in that space. Novogratz added that Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, could hit $150,000 per coin this year. The leading digital coin was recently trading for $118,628 per coin, down slightly over the past week but up nearly 12% over a 30-day period. Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high mark of $122,838. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla missed on the top and bottom lines in the second quarter, but another miss was buried in its investor deck. The company's digital assets are currently valued at $1.24 billion. That's up substantially from $722 million a year ago. But anyone who's been following the crypto market knows that the figure represents a lost opportunity amounting to billions of dollars in missed gains for the electric vehicle maker. Tesla sold 75% of its holdings in mid-2022, when the digital currency was trading at a fraction of its current price. While CEO Elon Musk has made clear that the future of his electric vehicle company is about robotaxis and humanoid robots — not about crypto investments — the business in its current form is struggling and could use the cash boost. Tesla reported a second straight drop in auto revenue in its earnings report late Wednesday, and came up short of Wall Street estimates. Gains from bitcoin in the second quarter amounted to $284 million in a period when total net income was $1.17 billion. In early 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, banking on what the EV company called the digital currency's "long-term potential" and to add "more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash." Musk had become a loud proponent of bitcoin online, and in January of that year, the currency skyrocketed 20% in a day after the Tesla CEO added #bitcoin to his bio on Twitter, now X. By mid-2022, the world was in a much different place. The Covid-era boom was gone, replaced by soaring inflation and rising interest rates, an equation that pushed investors out of risky assets. Tesla said in the second quarter of that year that it sold three-quarters of its bitcoin holdings, adding cash to its balance sheet at a time when equity and crypto markets were simultaneously plunging. Tesla lost about two-thirds of its market cap in 2022, and bitcoin fell by 60%. However, bitcoin has rebounded sharply since then, getting an added boost this year from the Trump administration's efforts to loosen regulations and its promise to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Had Tesla held on to all of its bitcoin, that stash would be worth roughly $5 billion, based on estimates of how much Tesla bought in 2021, instead of $1.24 billion. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. As for Musk, he's hardly said anything about bitcoin on his social network X in the past three years. In March 2022, shortly before Tesla began dumping bitcoin, he wrote regarding cryptocurrencies, "I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw." — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto and fintech groups are urging Trump to defend open banking rules, warning the case could affect access to wallets, DeFi apps, and stablecoins. A coalition of trade groups representing the crypto, fintech, retail, and restaurant industries is urging President Donald Trump to defend open banking rules under a so-called legal attack by the nation's largest banks. In a letter sent July 23, organizations including the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, and the Financial Technology Association claim that the US's most powerful banks are undermining innovation by suing to block the implementation of new open banking rules and imposing “stunning” new data fees on fintech and crypto apps. The case outcome could determine how easily Americans can connect their bank accounts to services like crypto exchanges, stablecoin wallets, and payment apps. Related: How traditional financial tools are making crypto investing more accessible Open banking is a framework that lets consumers securely share financial data with third-party apps through APIs. Proposed in 2022 during Trump's first term, the open banking rule in the United States was finalized on October 22, 2024, granting consumers the right to share their financial data across platforms, a key building block for stablecoins, DeFi apps, and crypto on-ramps. On the same day the rule was finalized, the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, sued to block it, arguing that it posed security risks and unfairly burdened incumbents. While challenging open banking in court, US banks are steadily moving deeper into the digital assets sector. In May 2024, Cointelegraph reported that Mastercard and ten central US banks, including Wells Fargo, participated in a tokenization pilot that tested how tokenized bank deposits and US Treasurys could be used for near-instant settlements on a shared ledger. The application details plans to offer a broad range of crypto-related services, including digital asset trading, exchanges, transfers, clearing, and payment processing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Wisconsin gas stations or grocery stores, people might be noticing a new type of kiosk. There are now an estimated 1,000 BTMs around the state, according to the state Department of Financial Institutions, or DFI. As the popularity of digital currency has grown, scams involving these machines are also becoming more common. As a result, DFI has rolled out new regulations of BTMs across Wisconsin that are expected to take effect at the end of July. Those rules include a $2,000 daily transaction limit, mandatory registration for bitcoin ATM operators and posted warnings about potential scams. Michael Gavigan, DFI assistant chief legal counsel, said the regulations are meant to gather more data on BTMs in Wisconsin but also protect consumers from the emotional and financial strain of scams. “If there's not a daily transaction limit, the harm can be essentially unlimited,” he said. “This gives a number of opportunities for a victim to realize what is happening if somebody is asking them to go back day after day after day to put in more money (in the BTM).” In 2024, nearly 11,000 people across the nation filed complaints on BTM scam transactions. The total losses, mostly for people over age 60, totaled $246.7 million, according to an FBI report. “Someone will contact a 70-year-old grandma and say your grandchild has been arrested, they need bail money and here's how you make that payment to get them out,” he said. Preston Cherry, an assistant professor of finance and personal financial planning at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay told WPR's “Wisconsin Today,” that the regulations are a step in the right direction but people should still be cautious when using BTMs. “ATMs have had consumer protection for decades, and we're still seeing high levels of scam activity. They're in elementary stages … So just imagine the scam activity that's going to go on with these machines at the early stages,” he said. Once the consumer puts money into the BTM, he said it is nearly impossible to get it back. The money goes into a digital wallet that is then very quickly sent overseas where local authorities do not have access. Experts including Gavigan and the Federal Trade Commission advise that no legitimate company or government agency will ever ask you to deposit money into a bitcoin ATM. To submit a complaint to DFI for a BTM scam or any complaint regarding consumer credit transactions visit DFI's website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Major altcoins led by Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Ripple‘s XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) posted sharp declines on Thursday, reversing gains from a strong rally earlier this month. What Happened: The broader cryptocurrency market experienced a notable selloff, with experts pointing to both overheated momentum and emerging signs of a corrective phase, even as structural fundamentals continue to strengthen. According to data, Ethereum dropped 2%, while XRP fell by over 10%, leading losses among large-cap tokens. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), in contrast, edged slightly higher, gaining 0.26% and maintaining relative stability during the downturn. What Experts Are Saying: In a note sent to Benzinga, James Harris, CEO of institutional crypto firm Tesseract, said the market's recent surge to a $4 trillion total market cap was driven by a "powerful trifecta" of supportive forces, but he cautioned that these tailwinds come with their own risks. "The rally has been underpinned by structural regulatory wins, improving macro conditions, and growing corporate treasury involvement," Harris explained. "Bitcoin jumped 10–15% after the legislation moved forward, and altcoins like ETH outpaced that," he said. Harris also cited improving inflation data and expectations for interest rate cuts as key macroeconomic drivers behind the current risk-on sentiment. Beyond the macro and regulatory backdrop, Harris pointed to a growing trend of public companies treating digital assets as treasury reserves.

"We're seeing listed firms buying ETH, SOL, and even making those moves public — a self-reinforcing loop." Alex Kuptsikevich, Chief Market Analyst at FxPro, offered a more near-term technical outlook. "Altcoins, which had been fueling the rally, have sold off aggressively. Nearly half of the top 100 altcoins are posting double-digit losses," he said. Despite recent ETF outflows in Bitcoin, Kuptsikevich noted that Ethereum continues to attract fresh capital into funds, highlighting diverging investor sentiment between the two largest assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate bitcoin BTC$118,788.13 holder helmed by Michael Saylor, has lifted the size its preferred stock offering STRC to $2 billion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. That's a significant raise from the original plan of issuing 5 million shares for $100 $100 each for a total of $500 million announced on Monday. STRC (dubbed "stretch" by the company) aims to deliver a regular dividend to investors, initially set at a 9% rate. MSTR common stock is little-changed on the day as bitcoin continues in a very tight range around the $118,000 area. This latest preferred offering will provide more buying power for the company to acquire BTC. Strategy currently holds over 607,000 BTC, worth roughly $72 billion, per bitcointreasuries.net.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Pump.fun's token has plummeted 23% below its initial coin offering (ICO) price as of May 31, 2025, according to a report by Bitcoin.com [1]. This sharp decline has raised questions about the project's sustainability and its ability to retain investor confidence. The token's performance reflects broader challenges in the cryptocurrency sector, where projects reliant on speculative demand rather than tangible utility often struggle post-ICO. The erosion in value highlights a growing disconnect between initial investor optimism and the token's subsequent market valuation. Early adopters who participated in the ICO now face significant losses, with many reportedly locking in gains or reducing their exposure. Meanwhile, new investors remain hesitant to allocate capital to the asset, a trend consistent with patterns observed in other crypto markets for tokens lacking clear use cases or operational progress. Without such measures, the project risks fading into obscurity alongside other speculative crypto ventures that fail to deliver on promises. Market analysts emphasize the importance of due diligence, urging investors to evaluate not only short-term price movements but also the long-term viability of a project's ecosystem. The token's performance reinforces the necessity of aligning with industry trends, such as robust governance structures, transparent roadmaps, and demonstrable utility. For now, Pump.fun's 23% decline from its ICO price remains a stark reminder of the perils of speculative investment in an asset class still grappling with maturity and credibility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a reporter at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. When Dan Morehead—featured guest on the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook podcast—first started digging into Bitcoin in 2013, he decided to leave behind his long career in traditional finance and throw all his chips into the world of cryptocurrencies. Since Morehead first purchased Bitcoin for under $100, the price has erupted to well over $100,000—thanks in part to all of his former colleagues on Wall Street piling into the once-renegade asset. But unlike many of those who came to the currency early, Morehead is not a “Bitcoin maxi” who shuns other coins. Rather, he has used his investment firm, Pantera Capital, to back many other crypto projects, including prominent ones like Ripple Labs and Solana. “There isn't just one internet company, right?” he said. Among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin still remains king, with a market cap of over $2 trillion. Ethereum, the second largest, has a market cap of just $435 billion. But investors like Morehead argue that, despite its dominance, Bitcoin's use cases remain more limited, especially as proponents continue to push for decentralized financial applications like payments and lending. While other crypto assets may not have Bitcoin's “escape velocity,” as Morehead puts it, they do have upside as different use cases continue to evolve. Despite the explosion in crypto prices, few projects have been able to achieve the mainstream success of Bitcoin, which is still mostly limited to a store of speculative value. While Pantera has invested in a variety of fields, like on-chain gaming, none have achieved the status of “killer app” or widespread adoption. Morehead pointed to stablecoins, a type of dollar-backed cryptocurrency, as a potential breakthrough for the broader industry, especially as banks and Big Tech companies explore the field. “They're essentially the Trojan horse of crypto,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two banks are collaborating to allow institutional investors to hold digital tokens representing shares in money market funds managed by leading investment firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Federated Hermes, as well as their own asset management arms, according to statements released Wednesday. That move drew swift reaction from OpenAI, which was quick to say holders of Robinhood's AI tokens should not expect to have the same rights of ownership as those with actual equity in the privately held tech giant. BNY, the world's largest provider of administrative services to money managers, will offer these tokenized funds to investment-firm and corporate clients through its LiquidityDirect cash-management platform, the Wall Street Journal reported. Goldman Sachs will use its private blockchain platform, GS DAP, to record and track the ownership of these tokens, while BNY maintains the official books and settlements . The move is part of a broader trend among financial institutions to experiment with tokenization, a process that creates digital representations of real-world assets on distributed ledgers. Proponents say tokenized money market funds could make it easier for investors to use fund shares as collateral and enable faster, more efficient transactions. “For any of the asset issuers that have perhaps been on the sidelines or have been hesitant to go full force into the world of tokenized securities, this now offers them a little bit of additional air cover to pursue participating and standing up their own projects in this ecosystem,” said Michael Sonnenshein, president of Securitize . While advocates highlight potential cost savings and operational efficiencies, some skeptics warn that tokenization could introduce volatility and cybersecurity risks from the crypto sector into traditional finance. The wealth tech platform says its newly secured patent represents crucial advances in digitizing outdated manual processes. The SEC says First Liberty lured investors with high-yield promissory notes, then used fresh cash to cover defaults and interest owed to earlier investors. Meanwhile, Cetera has boosted its own recruitment numbers with new additions from LPL and Osaic. The organization overseeing the CFP mark is looking for its next chief executive as Kevin Keller is set to step down in April next year.

Barely a decade old, registered index-linked annuities have quickly surged in popularity, thanks to their unique blend of protection and growth potential—an appealing option for investors looking to chart a steadier course through today's choppy market waters, says Myles Lambert, Brighthouse Financial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ozzy Osbourne may have left this world, but his digital legacy is more alive than ever. After the rock legend's passing, his CryptoBatz NFT collection shot up over 400% in value almost overnight. The floor price jumped, the trading volume exploded, and suddenly, bats were flying all over OpenSea like it was 2021 again. In a wild coincidence (or perfect marketing storm), a brand-new meme coin called TOKEN6900 ($T6900) has just smashed through $1M in its crypto presale, riding the same wave of hype and nostalgia. Each bat in the 9,966-piece collection wasn't just a cool collectible – it had a unique twist. Holders could ‘bite' another NFT and create a mutant hybrid. Think of it as Pokémon meets heavy metal. You could combine a CryptoBatz with a Bored Ape Yacht Club, SupDucks, or Cryptotoadz to make something truly bizarre and possibly valuable. The whole concept was inspired by Ozzy's infamous 1982 bat incident, where he bit the head off a bat on stage, thinking it was fake. Now, that wild moment is immortalized on the blockchain. After his death, fans rushed back to the collection as both a tribute and an investment, proving that legacy NFTs still pack a punch – even in a market that's down nearly 99% from its peak. It's a full-blown rebellion against traditional finance, wrapped in early 2000s internet chaos. At its core, it's a non-utility token that proudly offers nothing – no roadmap to nowhere, no fake utility buzzwords, and absolutely zero AI fluff. Just memes, honesty, and a dolphin mascot that probably has no idea what monetary policy means. TOKEN6900 is a product of the people, not polished corporate PR. It mocks financial systems that pretend to protect you while slowly draining your value. And somehow, that makes it the most honest thing you could buy in a world of lies. When legacy icons like Ozzy send NFTs flying 400% overnight, it reminds the market of one thing: narrative matters. $T6900 is here, loud and fully funded, doing the one thing that still works in crypto – going viral. Ozzy's final encore might be happening on the blockchain. And right behind him are meme coins like $T6900, turning internet attention into real money. If CryptoBatz proves anything, it's that legacy, community, and timing can still move markets. This article is for informational purposes only and doesn't constitute financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto, ON / Zug, Switzerland , July  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spirit Blockchain Capital Inc. (CSE: SPIR | OTCQB: SPBCF), a publicly listed digital asset management and tokenization company, is proud to announce the launch of its next strategic evolution: Spirit Blockchain 2.0—an integrated, yield-generating digital asset platform that brings together active treasury management, regulated financial products, and institutional-grade infrastructure under a unified public-market structure. This marks a transformational shift from passive asset holding to an operational blockchain enterprise capable of generating recurring yield, deploying tokenized investment products, and capturing scalable revenue across both crypto and real-world asset classes. “Our 2.0 strategy is anchored in one idea: we're no longer holding crypto for exposure—we're engineering it for earnings,” said Lewis Bateman, CEO of Spirit Blockchain Capital. Through its core treasury operations, Spirit is actively deploying a multi-token portfolio — including BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, XRP, and Vaulta (formerly EOS) — into high-yield, risk-adjusted strategies such as: Early results from the Dogecoin Yield Initiative (Q1 2025) demonstrate scalable revenue potential. Dedicated to creating a diverse, actively managed portfolio of digital and tokenized real-world assets, such as gold, copper, and rare earth elements, Spirit has formally launched SpiritReserve Group. Spirit aims to raise $100M–$500M in capital across phases, with support from ecosystem partners including Vaulta, Solana, and Ethereum. “Spirit is building something fundamentally different—designed for income, with analytics, compliance, and tokenization at the core.” The company has introduced several yield-focused, compliant products under its Swiss-regulated entity: As previously announced, SpiritLinQ is a proprietary tokenization and digital wealth platform enabling: SpiritLinQ connects the company's asset management business, treasury operations, and capital markets access — establishing a flexible, revenue-generating ecosystem. Spirit Blockchain 2.0 establishes a multi-stream revenue model designed for resilience and scalability: Spirit aims to create shareholder value through strategic investments in a rapidly expanding digital asset landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quantum computing continues to pick up speed, with this week bringing updates on consensus frameworks, Asia-Pacific hardware moves, funding in China, and a new roadmap for reaching quantum advantage. We begin with BTQ Technologies (BTQQF), which has launched Léonne, a new blockchain consensus framework designed to address the long-standing blockchain trilemma: scalability, security, and decentralization. Léonne replaces energy-hungry proof-of-work and centralized proof-of-stake with a mathematically driven “proof-of-consensus” model that uses trust-based partitioning. The partnership will focus on improving materials, electronics, and application-specific integrated circuits for quantum systems. This collaboration adds depth to IonQ's efforts in the region and supports long-term scaling of its hardware stack. The framework focuses on three problem types: sampling, variational algorithms, and expectation value calculations. It emphasizes the importance of verifiable output and measurable performance gains over classical alternatives. The key takeaway is that hybrid quantum-classical systems and error mitigation strategies will be essential until fault-tolerant hardware becomes viable. Superconducting qubits and neutral atoms were highlighted as the most promising near-term platforms. SpinQ, a quantum solution company based in China, closed a Series B round worth several hundred million RMB from government-backed and private investors. The company develops full-stack quantum systems across superconducting and NMR platforms, serving a customer base spanning over 40 countries. SpinQ's current focus includes scaling its 100-qubit chip, expanding education tools with AI integration, and pushing forward on quantum algorithm development, particularly in drug simulation and supply chain optimization. A workshop hosted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Microsoft brought together researchers to define how quantum systems can contribute to practical chemistry problems within the next five years. The path forward involves tiered workflows that combine HPC, AI, and quantum resources. Candidates for early wins include materials discovery, fusion research, and chemical reaction simulations. Using TipRanks' Comparison Tool, we've brought together some of the most prominent stocks in the quantum space to see how they stack up.</p>

Ozzy Osbourne's death at 76 sparked a massive spike in his CryptoBatz NFT collection floor prices. 

NFT News: Ozzy Osbourne's death at 76 sparked a massive spike in his CryptoBatz NFT collection floor prices. 

Floor prices jumped over 400% from under 0.02 Ethereum to 0.08 Ethereum within hours of the announcement. 

Peak floor price reached 295 per NFT at 8:00 p.m. UTC on Tuesday.

The collection features 9,666 unique digital bats launched in December 2021, referencing Osbourne's infamous 1982 bat-biting incident. 

Trading volume exploded 100,000% to 281,200 in 24 hours, representing nearly 80% of the collection's total market cap. 

The surge involved 402 sellers and 327 buyers, though prices remain below the 5 Ethereum peak from January 2022. 

The current floor price sits at 36.80, while the most expensive CryptoBat is listed at 99 Ethereum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PUMP, the native token of meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, has plunged over 50% in less than two weeks following its pre-sale, as airdrop hype fades. As of Tuesday, it slipped below its ICO price and continued falling today after project chief Alon Cohen said an airdrop is not coming soon. “When it comes to the airdrop, as we promised when we initially announced the TGE, there will be an airdrop. That should come as no surprise to anybody. We're going to keep our word, and our goal with that airdrop is to obviously reward the community that helped build a platform that…has flourished for the past one, one and a half years,” said Alon in a Wednesday interview with Michael “ThreadGuy” Jerome. “We're actually focusing on bringing back a lot of that attention and hype to our ecosystem. That being said, the airdrop is not going to be taking place in the immediate future, but we will be, you know, we will communicate any timelines or any details, whatever those details are, are available,” he said. Investors' sentiment around PUMP appears to be mixed. According to data tracked by Lookonchain, Jeffrey Huang, commonly known as Machi Big Brother, has added to his PUMP long position despite being down over $5.8 million amid the token's steep decline. 2 wallets (likely private sale investors) sold 1.25B $PUMP($3.81M) at $0.00305 in the last 2 hours, losing $1.19M.https://t.co/5tx1g9vs6Lhttps://t.co/msm0ONmniu pic.twitter.com/glyBDgHfL8</p>
