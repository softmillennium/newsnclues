                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keep checking those gold prices—scientists have more news about the coveted metal. An energy startup claims it has the recipe for modern-day alchemy: turning mercury into gold inside a nuclear fusion reactor. Last week, Marathon Fusion, a San Francisco-based energy startup, submitted a preprint detailing an action plan for synthesizing gold particles via nuclear transmutation—essentially the process of turning one element into another by tweaking its nucleus. The paper, which has yet to undergo peer review, argues that the proposed system would offer a new revenue stream from all the new gold being produced, in addition to other economic and technological benefits. Specifically, the proposed method involves introducing mercury-198 into a fusion reactor and bombarding it with neutrons until it transforms into mercury-197, a much more unstable isotope of mercury. As a result, gold production wouldn't impinge on the plant's primary function to generate nuclear energy. Assuming this is all feasible—and this remains a big theoretical assumption—reactors using this approach could produce around 11,000 pounds (5,000 kilograms) of gold every year per gigawatt of electricity generated, according to Marathon Fusion's chief executive, Kyle Schiller, and chief technology officer, Adam Rutkowski. To put this into perspective, around 3,000 metric tons of gold are mined each year. But it's worth noting that the same process would likely result in the production of unstable and potentially radioactive isotopes of gold. As such, Rutkowski admitted, the gold would have to be stored for 14 to 18 years before it could be labeled radiation-safe. “On paper it looks great, and everyone so far that I talk to remains intrigued and excited,” Ahmed Diallo, a plasma physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratory at Princeton who wasn't involved in the study, told the Financial Times. If this company is successful, however, perhaps we'll finally have achieved modern alchemy without giant particle accelerators. Although, in my opinion, effectively achieving alchemy through the use of giant accelerators is still pretty cool. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. For the first time, physicists have directly measured the temperature of extremely hot gold particles using a giant X-ray laser—a breakthrough with major implications for engineering spacecraft or nuclear fusion reactors. Sedna will make its closest approach to the Sun in 2076, giving us a rare opportunity to visit the planetoid before it drifts off for thousands of years. Traces of ruthenium in volcanic rock point to a hidden geological highway. The National Ignition Facility, home of the first net-positive fusion reaction, is back with an even more powerful energy shot. The fusion reactor's electromagnetic “heart” is complete, bringing us one step closer to clean, infinite energy—though there's still a long road ahead.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. After a rapid expansion left China with excess capacity of compute power in underused data centers, the country is reevaluating its approach to data center development. Authorities are now working on a national plan to regulate growth, optimize existing resources, and link facilities into a unified computing network that can sell unused compute power to those who need it, reports Reuters. Driven by the 'Eastern Data, Western Computing' strategy, various startups built hundreds of large-scale data centers for AI and cloud computing in the People's Republic. This initiative encouraged local governments to build data centers in the country's western regions, where electricity is cheaper, to serve demand from the eastern economic zones. Analysts argued that while building in remote provinces lowers energy costs, it often compromises latencies, which in turn lowers demand for their services, as many applications are latency sensitive. Many data centers were built on the assumption that state-owned companies and government agencies would purchase computing power. However, demand has fallen short of expectations, leaving many data centers idle or operating at a 20% - 30% load, way below their capacity. Now, concerns are growing among local governments about the long-term viability of their investments. Over the past 18 months, more than 100 data center projects have been scrapped, a sharp increase from just 11 cancellations in all of 2023. As a result, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is conducting a comprehensive review of the sector, imposing new restrictions to prevent overbuilding. For example, reviews of projects are now more thorough, and there is a ban on small-scale computing infrastructure funded by local authorities. The goal is to filter out projects lacking economic justification and ensure that new facilities meet basic efficiency criteria, such as minimum utilization thresholds and purchase contracts. In parallel, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is exploring the creation of a centralized cloud platform to aggregate unused computing power across the country and offer computing capacity as a service to users around China through a centralized national network. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. When the 'Eastern Data, Western Computing' initiative was launched, Beijing set a goal of achieving a network latency of 20 milliseconds, which is necessary for real-time applications like financial services or high-frequency trading. Another obstacle is the diversity of computing hardware used across different facilities. Some data centers use Nvidia GPUs and the CUDA software stack, while others rely on Huawei's Ascend accelerators and the CANN software stack. Despite these issues, Beijing remains committed to its national computing network. However, analysts say that the integration of diverse hardware is an extremely complex endeavor, which will take time and may not deliver on its full promise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauren Kolodny, a partner at Acrew Capital, has always championed technology's power to democratize access to financial services for everyday people. When the fledgling neobank Chime struggled to convince investors in 2016 that it could build a large business serving the working class, Kolodny was the only VC out of 100 Chime pitched who agreed to back the company, stepping in with a $9 million Series A extension when it was nearly out of money. Last month, Chime went public at a $14.5 billion valuation. Kolodny, who appeared on the Forbes Midas List three years in a row, is still passionate about investing in tech solutions that help consumers maximize their resources. Alix's founder, Alexandra Mysoor, realized the burden of executing a family estate after she offered to help her best friend settle her late mother's affairs. Mysoor told TechCrunch that it took her 900 hours and 18 months to complete tasks such as calling the bank to transfer assets, locating all the 401(k)s, canceling accounts, and distributing assets among family members. That experience gave Mysoor the idea that some of the most labor-intensive aspects of trust administration, including scanning and extracting data from documents, pre-populating complex forms, and communications with banks, can now be handled by AI agents. Kolodny realized that even though economists are estimating that trillions of dollars will transfer to millennial and Gen Z generations over the next two decades, the paperwork surrounding estate settlement largely remains a burden on those grieving the loss of their parents. While some startups like Empathy provide assistance with closing accounts as part of their bereavement support, Kolodny discovered that no companies offered comprehensive, start-to-finish estate settlement services. This is exactly the kind of problem that AI should be solving.” Kolodny said that she believes Alix is among the first of many startups powered by AI that will democratize financial services and administrative processes, which were historically available only to the ultra-wealthy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Additional study authors come from multiple UW departments, the Garcia Lab at Stanford University, and the Scheinberg Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “In this study, we show that computer-designed proteins can help human immune cells spot the right targets and function more effectively.” The work could lead to significant advancements in precision immunotherapy, which delivers disease-fighting drugs that are crafted for individual patients. The custom-made proteins can then be integrated into chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which are engineered molecules that attract and activate immune-system warriors called T cells to attack specific targets. In their study, the researchers designed proteins for 11 peptide targets and eight successfully triggered a T-cell response. The peptide targets included HIV fragments and tumor-related protein mutations. “We've shown how advances in protein design could make personalized cancer therapy possible, and we intend to start a company to turn these results into real therapies that benefit patients,” said Bingxu Liu, co-lead author of the study and postdoctoral scholar in the Baker Lab. When Baker won the Nobel Prize in October, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that “his research group has produced one imaginative protein creation after another, including proteins that can be used as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors.” The process could make it much cheaper to create personalized treatments. “I'm hopeful that this will lead to new therapies that are more accessible to patients around the world who do not benefit from current state-of-the-art cancer treatments,” said Julia Bonzanini, a co-lead author and Baker Lab graduate student. Other authors of the Science paper, titled “Design of high-specificity binders for peptide–MHC-I complexes,” are Nathan Greenwood, Amir Motmaen, Jeremy Meyerberg, Tao Dao, Xinyu Xiang, Russell Ault, Jazmin Sharp, Chunyu Wang, Gian Marco Visani, Dionne Vafeados, Nicole Roullier, Armita Nourmohammad, David Scheinberg and Christopher Garcia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a company-wide memo, Nadella acknowledged what he called the “uncertainty and seeming incongruence” of Microsoft's situation. Even with its recent job cuts, he wrote, it's thriving by “every objective measure” — with strong market performance, record capital investments, and relatively unchanged overall headcount due to ongoing hiring. “This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,” he wrote. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before.” Microsoft, in particular, has been grappling with employee discontent and internal questions about its culture following multiple rounds of layoffs. At the same time, Microsoft is positioning itself as a global leader in AI-driven economic development, launching a $4 billion “Elevate” initiative to help millions of people worldwide gain new skills for the AI era. However, Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged in a recent interview with GeekWire that record capital expenditures — an estimated $80 billion over the past year — have put pressure on the company to reduce operating costs, which in tech typically means reducing headcount. It's part of a broader war for AI talent, fueled by Meta and others. Multiple reports have described employees being blindsided by abrupt terminations, while others say they are now operating in a culture of fear and heightened performance pressure. Some longtime employees have expressed concern that they may be witnessing a return to the “old Microsoft” — marked by internal rivalries, poor communication, and job insecurity — after a decade of more inclusive and empathetic leadership under Nadella as CEO. In his memo Thursday morning, Nadella described Microsoft's long-term evolution from a “software factory” to an “intelligence engine” that empowers everyone to create their own AI-powered tools. Nadella described this paradox as part of a broader transformation requiring Microsoft to go through a difficult process of “unlearning” and “learning” — maintaining its current successful businesses while simultaneously creating new categories and business models. He called this dual mandate “inherently hard” and said “few companies can do both.” At the same time, he wrote, “I have full confidence that we can, and we will once again find the resolve, courage, and clarity to deliver on our mission in this new paradigm.” Microsoft names DeepMind co-founder and former Google exec as its new CEO of AI Microsoft names new COO who played a key role in GE's turnaround Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's comp tops $79M as stock soars; cash bonus cut in half on security woes GeekWire Podcast with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the company's 50th anniversary</p>

The new Web Guide experiment is a variation on the fan-out technique for displaying search results that Google is already using with its AI Mode. The feature itself is powered by Gemini, which helps Google better understand the search query and then link to other pages that could have been missed if using a traditional Google Search. For instance, you could ask something like “My family is spread across multiple time zones. With the solo travel example, Web Guide would display groupings like those focused on comprehensive guides, safety tips, links where people have shared their personal experiences, and more. You can also turn off this Web View from this tab itself, if you want to see the standard results without having to disable the experiment entirely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a visitor in town, and its name is 3I/ATLAS. For Harvard astronomer and study co-author Abraham Loeb, this is not his first interstellar rodeo. In 2018, Loeb proposed that the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua might be an alien probe. He's now back at it, along with co-authors Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl from the UK's Initiative for Interstellar Studies, asking the same question about 3I/ATLAS. The team is essentially flagging 3I/ATLAS as a candidate for alien technology and, perhaps alarmingly, as something that might actually pose an existential threat to humanity. Sounds absolutely bonkers, but it's a topic worth exploring and not something to reflexively toss onto the garbage heap. A clear picture of the object is emerging, suggesting it's very likely an enormous, icy comet that's considerably older than our solar system; preliminary estimates suggest it's 0.74 miles long (1.2 kilometers) and dates back some 7 billion years. Astronomers are therefore under a tight deadline to understand everything they possibly can about 3I/ATLAS—an object that originated in some faraway protoplanetary or planetary system. That said, astronomers have already made some great strides in sketching out the finer details of 3I/ATLAS, quickly churning out papers pertaining to the visitor's age, size, velocity, spin, and, most importantly, its origin, based on observational data. According to research released earlier this week, the object is a jumble of organic molecules, silicates, and carbon-based minerals, placing it in a similar compositional category as asteroids found between Mars and Jupiter. Based on current data—much of it from researchers working with the newly launched Vera C. Rubin Observatory—3I/ATLAS is expected to pass through the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter later this fall, reaching its closest point to the Sun in late October. Importantly, and despite strange, unfounded claims made in the new Loeb paper, there's zero indication that 3I/ATLAS is anything but a natural object formed by natural processes. Yet that hasn't stopped Loeb and his colleagues from venturing beyond the existing evidence. What's more, they've violated Occam's razor—a central tenet of the scientific method. Often, when astronomers detect something unusual or inexplicable in space, there's the urge to invoke extraterrestrial influence. This seems to be the case here, but as we'll discuss next, these researchers are not wrong to be asking these sorts of questions. As Sara Webb, an astrophysicist at the Swinburne University of Technology, wrote in The Conversation, “Objects like 3I/ATLAS remind us that space is vast, strange, and full of surprises. But the strangest objects are worth a second look.” Loeb and his colleagues do bring up a salient point—that we need to be curious about this object and not simply assume that it is what we think it is. Moreover, the team's warning that this object, should it be an alien probe, poses a potential hostile threat to humanity is rooted in some fascinating—if not disturbing—philosophical arguments having to do with our failed search for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. The first is the Fermi Paradox—the surprising observation that, despite our galaxy's immense size and extreme age, we have yet to see any signs of intelligent aliens. As Italian physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked in 1950, “Where is everybody?” This conundrum, known as the Great Silence, is not so easy to brush aside, as virtually all proposed solutions fail to convincingly account for the conspicuous absence of a Milky Way filled with extraterrestrials and extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's new paper invokes one of these solutions, an idea known as the Dark Forest hypothesis. In Liu's imagined universe, intelligent civilizations stay silent and hidden because any interaction with aliens could be fatal; since it's impossible to know another civilization's intentions, the safest move is to eliminate potential threats before they can act. Hence, a Dark Forest galaxy, in which advanced civilizations take the form of silent hunters. This general concept didn't start with Liu; sci-fi novelist and SETI expert David Brin has been ruminating over the possibility of killer alien probes since 1983. As Loeb and his colleagues argue in the new paper, 3I/ATLAS, should it be artificial, is likely to possess “active intelligence.” If that's the case, the object might be friendly, evil, or possibly something in between, they write. In other words, the reason we have yet to encounter aliens is that they're stealthy hunters, and this interstellar visitor, should it be a probe, likely belongs to that class of civilizations. This argument brings the Berserker probe concept to mind, an idea proposed by another science fiction writer, Fred Saberhagen. All this talk of interstellar probes may seem outlandish, but there are a few things worth considering. First, our galaxy, across its 13-billion-year history, has likely spawned numerous advanced civilizations, many of which were (or are) capable of launching probes on interstellar missions. Secondly, we ourselves have already launched three interstellar (or interstellar-bound) probes as a result of exploring our immediate environment: both Voyager probes and New Horizons. It's therefore not unreasonable to assume that interstellar probes of varying ages and technologies are zipping around the Milky Way. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xuewu Liu, a Chinese inventor who has no medical training or credentials of any kind, is charging cancer patients $20,000 for access to an AI-driven but entirely unproven treatment that includes injecting a highly concentrated dose of chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleach solution, directly into cancerous tumors. One patient tells WIRED her tumor has grown faster since the procedure and that she suspects it may have caused her cancer to spread—a claim Liu disputes—while experts allege his marketing of the treatment has likely put him on the wrong side of US regulations. Nonetheless, while Liu currently only offers the treatment informally in China and at a German clinic, he is now working with a Texas-based former pharmaceutical executive to bring his treatment to America. While the health secretary did not respond to a request for comment about Liu's treatment, he did mention chlorine dioxide when questioned about President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed during his Senate confirmation hearing in February, and the Food and Drug Administration recently removed a warning about the substance from its website. “Without the FDA's heavy-handed warnings, it's likely my therapy would have been accepted for trials years earlier, with institutional partnerships and investor support,” Liu tells WIRED. “This quiet removal won't immediately change everything, but it opens a door. If mainstream media reports on this shift, I believe it will unlock a new wave of serious [chlorine dioxide] research.” For decades, pseudoscience grifters have peddled chlorine dioxide solutions—sold under a variety of names, such as Miracle Mineral Solution—and despite warnings and prosecutions have continued to claim the toxic substance is a “cure” for everything from HIV to Covid-19 to autism. There is no credible evidence to back up any of these claims, which critics have long labeled as nothing more than a grift. The treatments typically involve drinking liquid chlorine dioxide on a regular basis, using solutions with concentrations of chlorine dioxide of around 3,000 parts per million (ppm), which is diluted further in water. Liu claims he has injected himself with the solution more than 50 times and suffered no side effects. “This personal data point encouraged me to continue research,” he says. Liu has been making the solution in his rented apartment in Beijing by mixing citric acid with sodium chlorite, according to an account he shared earlier this month on his Substack that revealed that a “violent explosion” occurred when he made a mistake. Later, I would find 4–5 cuts on my upper thigh—shards of glass had pierced through my pants.” Liu also revealed that his 3-year-old daughter was nearby when the explosion happened. Liu began a preclinical study on animals in 2016, before beginning to use the highly concentrated solution to treat human patients in more recent years. When asked for evidence to back up his claims of efficacy, Liu shared links to a number of preprints, which have not been peer-reviewed, with WIRED. “Screenshots of WhatsApp chats with patients or their doctors is not evidence of efficacy, yet that is the only evidence he provides,” says Alex Morozov, an oncologist who has overseen hundreds of drug trials at multiple companies including Pfizer. “Needless to say, until appropriate studies are done and published in peer-reviewed journals, or presented at a reputable conference, no patients should be treated except in the context of clinical trials.” The patient had previously been taking oral solutions of chlorine dioxide as an alternative treatment for cancer, but, unsatisfied with the results, she contacted Liu via WhatsApp. On a spring evening last year, she took her first injection of chlorine dioxide and, she says, almost immediately suffered negative side effects. “It was fine after the injection, but I was woken up by severe pain [like] I had never experienced in my life,” she says. Despite the pain, she says, she injected herself again two months later, and a month after that she traveled to China, where Liu, despite having no medical training, injected her, using an anesthetic cream to numb the skin. “While this act technically fell outside legal boundaries, in China, if the patient is competent and gives informed consent, such compassionate-use interventions rarely attract regulatory attention unless harm is done,” Liu tells WIRED. Experts on Chinese medical regulations tell WIRED that new treatments like Liu's would have to meet strict conditions before they can be administered to patients. “I don't think any of it sounds very legal.” The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which handles all international press inquiries, did not respond to a request for comment. “The tumor shrinks first, then it grows faster than before,” she says, adding: “My tumor has spread to the skin after injection. The patient says that thanks to a WeChat group that Liu set up, she is also in contact with other people who have had chlorine dioxide injections. One of the women, who is based in Shenzhen, China, had at least one injection of chlorine dioxide to treat what was described as vaginal cancer, but she says she is also suffering complications, according to screenshots of conversations reviewed by WIRED. Despite having injected a patient in China last August, Liu tells WIRED, he is not a licensed physician—he calls himself “an independent inventor and medical researcher.” The treatment, which he says is “designed to be administered by licensed physicians in clinical settings,” is so painful that it needs to be given under general anesthetic. In conversations on WhatsApp shared with WIRED, a representative of the clinic named Lena told a prospective patient that it didn't advertise the chlorine dioxide procedure because it was “not a legal treatment.” Lena later wrote that chlorine dioxide was not referenced on an invoice the clinic sent the same prospective patient because it is “not a legal treatment.” Lena also told the prospective patient that they had treated patients from France, Italy, and the US, according to a recording of a phone call shared with WIRED. When asked about her comments, Lena told WIRED, “Either [the patient] misquoted me or my English was not very accurate. I repeatedly told [the patient] that it is not an approved therapy and therefore requires very detailed consent and special circumstances to be eligible for this treatment.” The prospective patient was told that she would need to bring documents detailing her prior treatment. Renz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Lena also says that patients who have exhausted every other possible treatment have “the right to be treated with non-approved interventions under strict ethical conditions, full medical supervision and informed patient consent.” The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, which regulates medical products in Germany, did not respond to a request for comment, but Liu tells WIRED that German authorities are investigating a complaint about the clinic. Liu now appears laser-focused on making his treatment available in the US. Liu shared a screenshot with WIRED including what appeared to be patients' full names, zip codes, and the type of cancer they are suffering from. It's unclear if any of the patients had agreed to have their information shared with a journalist. One of those who signed up is Sarah Jones, who has been diagnosed with stage 4 anal cancer that has metastasized to the lymph nodes. “I spend my days treating this disease like a job. Red light therapy, guided meditations, exercising, eating a keto-strong diet and researching,” Jones tells WIRED. “This is how I stumbled upon Liu and his intratumoral injections.” Despite signing up for a potential trial, Jones understands the risks but feels as if she is running out of choices. “I am extremely concerned that there are but a handful of patients and no data to speak of for this procedure,” Jones says. This sentiment was echoed by Kevin, whose father has neck cancer and who also signed up as a potential patient for the trial. Another US-based patient with untreated colon cancer who signed up on Liu's website was informed that they should consider traveling to Germany for treatment, according to a screenshot of an email response from Liu, shared with WIRED. Liu responded with inaccurate details and information that the patient did not share. Liu tells WIRED that he has spoken to Jason Williams, director of the clinic. “His clinic is fully capable of implementing my therapy.” Neither Williams nor his colleague Nathan Goodyear, who Liu also says he spoke to, responded to repeated emails and phone calls seeking comment. The Chinese inventor did, however, appear on a livestream with two US-based doctors, Curtis Anderson, a Florida-based physician and Mark Rosenberg, who works at the Institute for Healthy Aging. Rosenberg and Anderson did not respond to requests for comment. “It sounds like Mr. Liu may not understand how the Right to Try Act or the Declaration of Helsinki work or how they fit within the broader context in which the FDA regulates investigational drugs,” Clint Hermes, an attorney with Bass, Berry & Sims, with extensive expertise in biomedical research, tells WIRED. “Companies cannot make claims regarding safety or efficacy until their products have been approved for marketing by the FDA,” Mary Kohler, a member of the AHLA's Life Science leadership team, tells WIRED. “From a quick glance at the website, I see several claims that FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) would likely consider violative as pre-approval promotion even if this company were in trials that FDA was overseeing.” When asked about these issues, Liu clarified that he was planning to initially conduct a 100-person “clinical research program” that would not require FDA approval, but Liu's treatment doesn't appear to meet any of the most common exemptions that would allow such a trial to take place, according to the FDA's own website. Liu says that he has yet to make contact with such a lawmaker directly. While he has no approval from US government agencies or support of a state or national lawmaker, Liu does have the full backing of Scott Hagerman, an entrepreneur and former executive with 30 years experience in the pharmaceutical industry, including a decade working at Pfizer. “It's an unbelievable breakthrough,” Hagerman tells WIRED, adding that he and his wife have been using oral chlorine dioxide solution “for some time” as a preventative measure rather than to treat a specific ailment. Hagerman retired from Chemi Nutra in 2021, and in the intervening years his comments indicate that he appears to have become entirely disillusioned with the modern pharmaceutical industry, referring to it as a “drugs cartel” and a “a corrupt entity that is only profit-driven.” One of the issues Hagerman references is the Covid-19 vaccine based on mRNA technology, which he describes as a “con job” while also boosting the debunked theory that childhood vaccines are linked to increasing levels of autism reported in the population. “I would welcome the fact that he's not a doctor, that he's not an MD, because he's not clouded, jaded, and biased with all kinds of misguidance that would push them the wrong way,” Hagerman says, adding, “I'd like to help him establish some network here in the US, because obviously the US is where the action is.” Hagerman says he is “100 percent sure” that there would be investors willing to fund the development of this treatment. When asked about a timeline to have this procedure legally available in the US, Hagerman said he hopes it could be achieved before the end of 2025. Liu, however, thinks it could take slightly longer, saying that he believes clinical trials will begin in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, Uber announced that it's rolling out new features that will give women riders the option to request women drivers and vice versa. “Across the US, women riders and drivers have told us they want the option to be matched with other women on trips,” said Uber vice president of U.S. and Canada operations Camiel Irving in a press release. “We've heard them — and now we're introducing new ways to give them even more control over how they ride and drive.” However, if the wait for a woman driver is too long, they can still switch to the fastest available pickup. Riders can also reserve rides in advance with a woman driver for added certainty, and even toggle a preference in their app settings to increase the chances of being matched with a woman driver, although it's not guaranteed. Meanwhile, drivers are also getting a similar feature. They can turn off the setting at any time if they want to resume accepting rides from all users. Following an overwhelmingly positive response, the features have since expanded to 40 countries, including France, Mexico, Canada, Germany, and India. Uber said making these features reliable required “thoughtful design.” Since most Uber drivers are men, the company worked to ensure this feature was usable in different locations around the world. For years, both Uber and its rival Lyft have faced criticism—and lawsuits—for not doing enough to address sexual assault on their platforms. Ahead of the game, Lyft introduced a similar feature for women and non-binary riders in 2023. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grieving after her husband's unexpected death from late-stage cancer, the longtime Seattle business and engineering leader typed three words into ChatGPT: “I am sad.” Jesse found that ChatGPT couldn't easily resurface the context of their past conversations. Jesse said she wouldn't normally share such a personal story publicly, but the experience was the basis for what would become her next venture. She and two other tech industry veterans, Alan Caplan and Bob Bergstrom, this week unveiled their new Seattle-based startup, called ACME Brains, which is building what they call a “personal context engine.” They say the patent-pending AI system will remember key details over time, and give users control over their data. Nexie is currently in early development with a working prototype. The company plans to start alpha testing soon, followed by a beta program focused on gathering user feedback prior to a future public launch. Jesse, CEO, began her career in the wireless industry, in engineering and leadership roles at McCaw Cellular and AT&T Wireless before co-founding the mobile infrastructure company RadioFrame Networks. Bergstrom, chief scientist, has worked as both a software engineer and patent attorney for more than four decades. Caplan, COO, was Amazon's first general counsel, starting in its early days after working with Jesse at McCaw Cellular. The subscription-based service will be available in free and premium versions. It won't rely on advertising or data monetization, a deliberate departure from many consumer tech platforms. While companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are all investing heavily in AI memory features, Jesse said ACME Brains is taking a different approach. Rather than embedding memory within a large language model, its architecture keeps the user's data separate and under their control — seeking to be more efficient and secure. Jesse sees nexie not as a competitor to the big AI platforms and existing LLMs, but as a tool that can enhance them — making their output more useful and meaningful for personal use. Over time, she believes the underlying system ACME Brains is developing could serve as a kind of “personal credential,” carrying private, user-controlled data and context across AI apps and platforms. The Seattle-based startup has been bootstrapped by its founders so far, with about 11 people working across technology development, marketing, and operations, primarily in a virtual capacity. Jesse said ACME Brains expects a public launch of nexie by late 2025 or early 2026, with sign-ups for future beta testing now available at mynexie.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So-called AI slop, meaning LLM-generated low-quality images, videos, and text, has taken over the internet in the last couple of years, polluting websites, social media platforms, at least one newspaper, and even real-world events. In the last year, people across the cybersecurity industry have raised concerns about AI slop bug bounty reports, meaning reports that claim to have found vulnerabilities that do not actually exist, because they were created with a large language model that simply made up the vulnerability, and then packaged it into a professional-looking writeup. “People are receiving reports that sound reasonable, they look technically correct. And then you end up digging into them, trying to figure out, ‘oh no, where is this vulnerability? ',” Vlad Ionescu, the co-founder and CTO of RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch. Just in the last year, there have been real-world examples of this. “The attacker miscalculated badly,” Sintonen wrote in a post on Mastodon. In response to Sintonen's post, Benjamin Piouffle of Open Collective, a tech platform for nonprofits, said that they have the same problem: that their inbox is “flooded with AI garbage.” Contact Us Do you have more information about how AI is impacting the cybersecurity industry? “We've also seen a rise in false positives — vulnerabilities that appear real but are generated by LLMs and lack real-world impact,” said Prins. “These low-signal submissions can create noise that undermines the efficiency of security programs.” Ellis said they are seeing an overall increase of 500 submissions per week. “This'll probably escalate in the future, but it's not here yet.” Ellis said that the Bugcrowd team that analyzes submissions reviews the reports manually using established playbooks and workflows, as well as with machine learning and AI “assistance.” To see if other companies, including those that run their own bug bounty programs, are also receiving an increase in invalid reports or reports containing non-existent vulnerabilities hallucinated by LLMs, TechCrunch contacted Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Mozilla. Mozilla's employees who review bug reports for Firefox don't use AI to filter reports, as it would likely be difficult to do so without the risk of rejecting a legitimate bug report,” DeMonte said in an email. Microsoft and Meta, companies that have both bet heavily on AI, declined to comment. Ionescu predicts that one of the solutions to the problem of rising AI slop will be to keep investing in AI-powered systems that can at least perform a preliminary review and filter submissions for accuracy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anysphere, the company behind the wildly popular vibe coding platform Cursor, is officially launching a new tool that's designed to spot errors in code. The release comes as software developers are expected to code at a higher velocity than ever before due to the rise of AI-assisted coding. The new tool, Bugbot, integrates with Github, a platform where engineers keep their code. When a human or agent introduces changes, Bugbot automatically flags any errors. While that's crucial for human coders, it's particularly useful when using AI coding agents, which work incredibly fast and can introduce errors that are difficult for humans to spot and untangle. “Our core product is giving you software engineering super powers, but software engineering goes beyond just writing code in your editor,” Jon Kaplan, an engineer at Anysphere, tells WIRED. Last month, Anysphere invited a few thousand engineering teams to beta-test the new tool. That means that existing Cursor customers, who pay between $20 and $200 per year depending on the level of premium features, will now pay an additional $40 for access to Bugbot. A screenshot of how Cursor displays Bugbot to its users. Anysphere, which was cofounded in 2022 and has around 140 employees, has raised $900 million dollars from marquee firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital, alongside angel investors like Google chief scientist Jeff Dean, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman (who now works at Meta Superintelligence Labs). The startup counts OpenAI, Shopify, Instacart, Midjourney, Discord, and Rippling among its thousands of customers. Even Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has copped to vibe coding with Cursor. But the competitive landscape for AI-assisted coding platforms is crowded. Startups Windsurf, Replit, and Poolside also sell AI code-generation tools to developers. GitHub's Copilot, which was developed in collaboration with OpenAI, is described as a “pair programmer” that auto-completes code and offers debugging assistance. Most of these code editors are relying on a combination of AI models built by major tech companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. For example, Cursor is built on top of Visual Studio Code, an open-source editor from Microsoft, and Cursor users are generating code by tapping into AI models like Google Gemini, DeepSeek, and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet. Several developers tell WIRED that they now run Anthropic's coding assistant, Claude Code, alongside Cursor (or instead of it). Since May, Claude Code has offered various debugging options. It can analyze error messages, do step-by-step problem solving, suggest specific changes, and run unit tests in code. Earlier this week, the AI code-generation tool Replit reportedly went rogue and made changes to a user's code despite the project being in a “code freeze,” or pause. That's an extreme case, but even small bugs can wreak havoc for coders. Kaplan argues it is “orthogonal to the fact that people are vibe coding a lot.” Even if all of the code is written by a human, it's still very likely that there will be bugs, he says. Anysphere product engineer Rohan Varma estimates that on professional software teams, as much as 30 to 40 percent of code is being generated by AI. Most organizations are still making human engineers responsible for checking code before it's deployed. Notably, one recent randomized control trial with 16 experienced coders suggested that it took them 19 percent longer to complete tasks than when they were not allowed to use AI tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S.'s push for domestic chip manufacturing is bearing fruit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. I think that's how we're thinking about U.S. manufacturing,” the CEO said to Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow. “And yes, it will be a little bit more expensive — frankly, some of the work that has been done to encourage semiconductor investment has been helpful. But when you really average it across everything else that you need to build this computing infrastructure, I think it's a very good investment for us to make to assure that we have American manufacturing and resiliency.” TSMC Arizona has already reportedly started manufacturing 4nm chips earlier this year, with yield and quality said to be comparable to that of its factories in its home country of Taiwan. And while many companies fear that moving their manufacturing to the U.S. would cost significantly more, some experts estimate that wafer production at the Arizona site is only about 10% more expensive compared to Taiwan. Despite that, the company says that its customers are willing to pay a higher price, with production already sold out until late 2027. AMD's bigger rival, Nvidia, is also sourcing some of its Blackwell system production from the site. All these developments are a win for the U.S., as its push to bring back domestic semiconductor manufacturing is beginning to bear fruit, despite the slightly higher costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geekerwan's BMW-cooled Shimada Peak is overtaken in the fast lane by Uncle Tony and his LN2. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. AMD's incredibly powerful new Threadripper Pro 9995WX doesn't come bundled with a cooler. However, Geekerwan might have the perfect answer for this processing Goliath that can casually consume over 1,000W. AMD's $11,699 Threadripper Pro 9995WX is designed to deliver breakthroughs, as the “World's Fastest Workstation Processor,” according to AMD. With these performance-enhancing technologies turned up to 11, the king of the Shimada Peak processors can quickly demand 1,000W of power, or much more. Holding aloft the radiator, ripped from his precious M4, he highlights that the hefty rad in his hands is about 600 x 350mm, or about the size of five 360mm radiators stuck together. Of course, a suitable pump is also required to make the most of the BMW radiator, and naturally, the M4's pump was also commandeered for this Threadripper 9000 cooling task. There's one more essential to building an automotive AIO for a CPU, and that is the fans. Geekerwan didn't opt for the typical Arctic, Noctua, or Cooler Master spinners, though. Here's where Toyota came in, with a Highlander 4x4's fans borrowed for pushing air through the M4 radiator. Two of these 30cm fans were used and required 100W alone to do their duty.

Many of you will be expecting this, but Geekerwan explains that, while his “super water cooling” setup performed as expected, it was held back by the interface between the CPU cores and the AIO system. Geekerwan uses the rest of his video to inform people with more money than sense that, for gaming, consumer CPUs like the Ryzen 9 9950X are still far superior to a Threadripper (but there may be exceptions, like Cities: Skylines 2).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I knew exactly where these videos were coming from. It's been four years since I first heard about the exploding popularity of Chinese vertical soap operas called 短剧, or duanju. Since then, the industry has become fully entrenched in foreign markets, including Hollywood. It lasted only six months from start to finish. Compare that with three-year-old ReelShort, the first platform to export Chinese short dramas, which says it now has 55 million monthly active users. In the first quarter of 2025, ReelShort and similar apps like DramaBox, GoodShort, and DramaWave earned nearly $700 million from in-app purchases—either weekly subscriptions or one-time payments to watch an episode. Globally, these apps were downloaded 370 million times in the first quarter, a 500 percent increase from 2024. So how did short dramas from China quietly become the hottest thing in entertainment seemingly overnight? ReelShort arrived in Hollywood at a time when the legacy movie and TV business was struggling. Many actors and production teams were on strike or out of work after the major streaming giants slashed funding for original programming. ReelShort representatives told me the company still sees itself as occupying a middle ground between TikTok and Netflix, but it looks to me like they are no longer satisfied with just being something in between. The company is rapidly expanding into different genres, including reality TV, thrillers, art house, and more. It recently launched a global competition for new show ideas pitched by social media creators. And it's building fandom empires for its most successful actors, turning them into genuine international stars. At least for now, the company says it's continuing to double down on real, human actors and writers, rather than going all-in on artificial intelligence. “I don't think it will even come close to what humans can do when it comes to the nuances and how people follow emotion,” says Sammie Hao, head of talent relations and brand partnership at ReelShort. Short dramas are similar to low-budget feature-length movies, but filmed vertically and cut into one-minute episodes (they almost always end on a cliff-hanger). To be honest, the short drama industry is still largely defined by storylines that hinge on tired tropes: the salacious adventures of a billionaire's housewife, affairs with sexy werewolves and vampires, or rags-to-riches fairy tales. But they reliably deliver a shot of dopamine when they appear on your social feed, drawing traffic and generating revenue for the platforms. I've been told by multiple people that the set of a short drama doesn't necessarily look that different from an indie movie or commercial shoot, except everything is churned out much faster to save on costs. Whereas a traditional shoot would last weeks or months, the entire season of a vertical show is typically filmed within two weeks. Nicole Mattox, one of the vertical stars working with ReelShort in Los Angeles, told me she usually books two to three shoots per month, with only two days in between. A professionally trained actress originally from Texas, she had only been in a few small movie productions before stumbling on the short drama industry in 2023. “There's nothing else for you to move on from. Hao, who works in talent recruiting for ReelShort, says many of the company's actors come from modeling or advertising backgrounds and have never had speaking roles before. Mattox played the personal assistant to an NHL player, who naturally, was also his secret baby mama. The show became a runaway success, with over 300 million views on ReelShort. In May, some of them paid to put a picture of her face on a billboard in Times Square to celebrate her birthday. Earlier this month, they rented another billboard in Manila to advertise her latest production. Your show “had me in a chokehold,” one commenter wrote on her personal TikTok account, where she has amassed over 130,000 followers. The short drama industry can move much faster not only because its production costs are low, but because startups like ReelShort have mastered the art of localization—after all, they first had to export the genre from China. That explains why ReelShort produced its hit English show The Double Life of My Billionaire Husband in five other languages, and why it has started working with legacy telenovela production companies in Colombia. ReelShort's parent company, Crazy Maple Studio, was previously majority-controlled by COL Group, one of the largest digital novel publishers in China. Which one made them sign up for a subscription? Jay gave me a specific example: Actors, she says, often react with the same loud gasp and shocked expression when they are slapped on screen. I think there's something discreetly Chinese in the way these data-driven insights are finding their way into short-drama productions outside of China: The cheesy plots and cliff-hangers, no matter how simple they seem to be, are the result of years of hard work by Chinese scriptwriters who cracked the formula for evoking strong emotions from their viewers. Jay says when a script from China is being localized in the US, there's sometimes a tendency among producers to make big adjustments to align with local cultural norms.
