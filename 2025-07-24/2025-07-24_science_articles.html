                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, some scientists think that hidden physics may be hiding beyond LHC's view. We humans have gotten pretty good at glimpsing the invisible. But that explosion of discovery didn't really materialize. That's certainly not to say nothing has happened since then, but no major revelations on par with the Higgs have been discovered since. And now, a new article in New Scientist, written by particle physicist Harry Cliff who works on the LHCb experiment,  details one theory as to why we haven't found what we were expecting to find. At its most basic, many of these revelations could be hiding in what's sometimes referred to as the “zeptouniverse,” which is a world that only exists at the 10-21-meter scale. The LHC can only analyze particles directly down to 50 zeptometers, but Cliff highlights a theory—largely championed by Technical University of Munich theoretical physicist Andrzej Buras—that these elusive particles could simply be beyond LHC's detection capabilities. Of course, a better detector could open up this frontier—CERN completed a feasibility study for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) just earlier this year. But Buras believes that we can explore this frontier of new physics indirectly without the need to wait the several decades required to finally probe this question (the FCC won't perform high-energy physics until 2070). In a paper uploaded to the preprint server arXiv last year, Buras identified seven possible targets for this investigation, which he dubbed the “magnificent seven,” according to New Scientist. All seven are extremely rare decays of particles containing strange and bottom quarks, which Cliff calls “echoes from the zeptouniverse.” Luckily for Buras, some experiments are already searching for these ultra-rare decays. However, because the experiment wasn't set-up to directly detect neutrinos, information about them is limited. This isn't the only ultra-rare decay that's been detected recently, either. Because this interaction is sensitive to Standard Model deviations, it's identified as one of the prime targets for finding new physics. Today, the KOTO experiment in Japan is searching for a second confirmation of this kaon decay. “As direct searches at the LHC have not yet provided any clue as to what these new particles and forces might be, indirect searches are growing in importance.” Rare ‘Book of the Dead' Found Buried in Egypt</p>

Jingming Cai says he deliberately shaped his PhD's focus to prepare for future applicationsCredit: Cavan Images/Getty After completing my PhD in engineering in September 2018, I set out to navigate the world of early-career fellowships — a path that taught me as much about resilience and strategy as it did about research. After experiencing two rejections, rewriting my proposals and learning from every round of feedback, I have secured three major awards over the past five years: a Humboldt Research Fellowship in Germany, a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA-PF) from the European Union and a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) from the Australian Research Council. These totalled around US$600,000 in funding, which supported my early-stage research across multiple countries. Now, I'm an associate professor at the School of Civil Engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, China, where I conduct research on energy technologies for buildings. All three fellowships are highly competitive — for instance, the success rates for the MSCA-PF and DECRA were both around 15% when I applied. I focused on building a clear research identity: publishing in the niche but promising field of thermoelectric materials for buildings, and collaborating internationally. This helped to demonstrate that I could work across borders. For example, I actively took part in international academic conferences on emerging energy technologies, even though they were not entirely relevant to my core research area. These experiences later helped me to identify institutions that would be suitable hosts if I attracted funding, and to collect strong letters of recommendation. I also learnt the importance of being flexible with my research direction. Early on I focused entirely on structural design in buildings, but I later realized that combining structural design with energy research was better suited to my strengths. It also aligned more closely with emerging needs in the field, and so would be relevant to more calls for grant funding. I think similar opportunities exist in the natural sciences, particularly because many areas are now integrating with digital tools such as artificial intelligence and the use of big data, so expertise in those areas is transferable. Choosing a research direction that plays to your strengths and can respond to developments and demands in the field can make a real difference. For example, my methodology did not include enough detail. I rewrote the proposal from scratch: clarified my role in the project, restructured the scientific goals so that they were more focused, with concrete and feasible methods, and worked closely with my collaborators and host institution. For those starting out, I recommend applying to fellowships with simpler formats and flexible timelines — such as those offered by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science or the Humboldt Foundation in Germany. These programmes have a more streamlined application process, focusing on the applicant's potential and research idea, rather than requiring very detailed project planning and implementation, as the MSCA-PF does. The fellowships are highly respected and are excellent practice for applying to more complex programmes, such as European Research Council funding competitions. My first MSCA-PF draft was packed with bullet points, dense data tables and technical language. But I learnt that reviewers aren't just evaluating scientific merit — they're also looking for alignment with their goals, potential to become an independent researcher and a clear narrative. And, of course, how the proposed work would contribute to solving any specific scientific or societal challenges that the fellowship aims to support. What made the difference in my revised application was learning how to tell a compelling story: who I was, what I had done, what gap I saw in the field and how this project, in this environment, would help me to grow. Introduce the project using a narrative that leads from ‘everybody knows' to ‘nobody knows' — start with widely understood context, then narrow down to the specific research gap. Describe the technical bottleneck and explain why this project is needed to overcome it. Explain what makes the idea original and how it differs from existing approaches. I avoided jargon and assumed the reviewers were smart scientists, but not necessarily experts in my subfield.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than a decade since the first detection of gravitational waves—ripples in spacetime itself—proposed budget cuts threaten to silence this groundbreaking science Long ago, in a galaxy far away, two black holes danced around each other, drawing ever closer until they ended in a cosmic collision that sent ripples through the fabric of spacetime. These gravitational waves traveled for over a billion years before reaching Earth. On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) heard their chirping signal, marking the first-ever detection of such a cosmic collision. Initially, scientists expected LIGO might detect just a few of these collisions. But now, nearing the first detection's 10th anniversary, we have already observed more than 300 gravitational-wave events, uncovering entirely unexpected populations of black holes. Spearheaded by LIGO's two cutting-edge detectors in the U.S. and strengthened through collaboration with detectors in Italy (Virgo) and Japan (KAGRA), the field has become one of the most data-rich and exciting frontiers in astrophysics.

LIGO has also spurred the design and development of technologies beyond astronomy. For example advances in quantum technologies, which reduce the noise and thereby improve LIGO's detector sensitivity, have promising applications to both microelectronics and quantum computing. Yet despite this extraordinary success story, the field now faces an existential threat. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the total National Science Foundation (NSF) budget by more than half: a move so severe that one of the two LIGO detectors would be forced to shut down. Constructing and upgrading the two LIGO detectors required a public investment of approximately $1.4 billion as of 2022, so abandoning half this project now would constitute a gigantic waste. A U.S. Senate committee in mid-July pushed back against hobbling LIGO, but Congress has lately folded against administration budget cut demands, leaving it still on the table. The proposed $19 million cut to the LIGO operations budget (a reduction from 2024 of some 40 percent) would be an act of stunning shortsightedness. With only one LIGO detector running, we will detect just 10 to 20 percent of the events we would have seen with both detectors operating. Walking away now would be like inventing the microscope, then tossing it aside before we had a good chance to look through the lens. Here's why losing one detector has such a devastating impact: The number of gravitational-wave events we expect to detect depends on how far our detectors can “see.” Currently, they can spot a binary black hole merger (like the one detected in 2015) out to a distance of seven billion light-years! Moreover, distinguishing real gravitational-wave signals from noise is extremely challenging. Only when the same signal is observed in multiple detectors can we confidently identify it as a true gravitational-wave event, rather than, say, the vibrations of a passing truck. As a result, with just one detector operating, we can confirm only the most vanilla, unambiguous signals. This means we will miss extraordinary events like the one announced in mid-July. Lastly, we will also lose the ability to follow up on gravitational-wave events with traditional telescopes. Multiple detectors are necessary to triangulate an event's position in the sky. The U.S. is thus poised to lose its global leadership position. As Europe and China move forward with ambitious projects like the Einstein Telescope, LISA and TianQin, this could result not only in missing the next wave of breakthroughs but also in a significant brain drain. We cannot predict what discoveries still lie ahead. After all, when Heinrich Hertz first confirmed the existence of radio waves in 1887, no one could have imagined they would one day carry the Internet signal you used to load this article. This underscores a vital point: while cuts to science may appear to have only minor effects in the short term, systematic defunding of the fundamental sciences undermines the foundation of innovation and discovery that has long driven progress in the modern world and fueled our economies. The detection of gravitational waves is a breakthrough on par with the first detections of x-rays or radio waves, but even more profound. It is as if before, we could only see the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research details how our brains are drawn to and spot faces everywhere Now, a new study by the University of Surrey has looked into how this phenomenon grabs our attention, which could be used by advertisers in promoting future products. The study, published in i-Perception, investigated the differences between our attention being directed by averted gazes - when a subject looks away from another subject's eyes or face - and when it's directed by pareidolia - imagined face-like objects. The researchers conducted four "gaze cueing task" experiments with a total of 54 participants, to measure how our attention is influenced by the direction of another subject's gaze. They found that participants consistently shifted their attention in response to the appearance of both averted gazes and pareidolia. However, the underlying mechanisms through which attention is drawn are quite different. While we are primarily drawn to the eye region of averted gazes, we are drawn to pareidolia's holistic structure of their "faces," and as a result, experienced a stronger response and attention. Dr Di Fu, Lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Surrey, said: "Our research shows that both averted gazes from real faces and perceived faces in objects can direct where we look, but they do so through different pathways. "Our findings may have practical implications too, particularly in areas like product advertising. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A ‘Dark Oxygen' Mystery Is Unfolding at the Ocean Bottom—But Undersea Mining Giants May Soon Move In This story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center and co-published with the Post and Courier. On July 22, 2024, a team of researchers released a shocking discovery: deep-sea rock concentrations appeared to be producing oxygen in the blackness of the ocean's abyss. The two of us were in the middle of filming a documentary about these potato-sized undersea oddities—known as polymetallic nodules—and suddenly they were making global headlines. The researchers dubbed their finding “dark oxygen.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. But what grabbed us as journalists was how—within days of publication—the research ignited debate among dozens of diplomats then convening in Kingston, Jamaica, to decide the fate of those rocks. Many researchers hope their work reaches policymakers, but it's rare to see such an immediate effect. Shortly after Nature Geoscience published the “dark oxygen” study, delegates from Costa Rica and Panama began citing it as a reason not to rush negotiations. According to a United Nations treaty that has been ratified or acceded to by 170 countries and regions (but not the U.S.), companies preparing to mine can't extract nodules from international waters without agreement among those signatories on how that should be done. “Dark oxygen” became a rally call for prudence before opening up the high seas to deep-sea mining. “Dark oxygen” steered a film we were already making into an entirely new direction. We had been following a separate group of researchers who had found the world's oldest deep-sea test site, more than 50 years after mining. As one of us (Fieseler) first reported for the Post and Courier last year, they made a remarkable observation among the field of nodules there. That discovery, however, had a much different fate. What unfolded for us was a tale about the power of research in extreme environments. Is it all just timing and luck? Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and at two companies—The Metals Company and Adepth—have separately posted scientific rebuttals in preprint papers. A spokesperson for Nature Geoscience told one of us (Fieseler) via email that “concerns have been raised with us about this paper and we have been looking into them carefully following an established process, which is not yet complete.” Meanwhile the decision to mine international waters is still being decided. This month delegates returned to the negotiating table in Jamaica. We traveled there this week to watch. But unlike last year, when many signs pointed toward a speedy decision and “inevitable” deep-sea mining operations, the pace has slowed. Acceleration has given way to rising precaution. Clare Fieseler (reading from her 2024 Post and Courier article “Pulled from the Deep”): “About 10 million years ago ... the ocean swarmed with beasts.... As [these creatures] passed, debris rained down to the bottom, including errant shark teeth, which joined [with] pieces of volcanic rock scattered below. Scientists believe that these scraps started to grow in size as they slowly attracted trace metals found within the ocean's chemical soup, forming thin coatings dense in critical minerals like manganese, nickel and cobalt. I'm a reporter and a scientist, and I'm here talking to a microbiologist who, along with his collaborators, has found something remarkable at the bottom of the sea. Jeff Marlow: Each nodule can often fit in your hand. Get even closer, and you'd start to see the life on top of them. There are worms that crawl on and in the nodules. There are little corals that can stick up. It's really just about looking closer, looking at it with a different perspective that reveals something amazing. Fieseler: You seem a little hesitant to say, like, a phrase similar to: “We found that nodules may be producing oxygen.” [Laughs] Fieseler: There's a reason why Jeff Marlow is being cautious with me. His collaborators—Andrew Sweetman, Franz Geiger and the rest of their 16-person team—published a study in Nature Geoscience that could rewrite not just what we know about these nodules or about the ocean; it could rewrite what we know about how life began on planet Earth. These scientists aren't the only people interested in polymetallic nodules. Marlow: Through all this data and all of our troubleshooting we were able to conclude that the nodules—or something inside and around them—was producing oxygen. Federica Calabrese: Yeah, exactly like that, so I ... Through experiments and thoughtful analyses, you get at what the story really is, and I think we're really just at the start of that. Fieseler: To make sense of all this, I called up an old friend, Andrew Thaler, a deep-sea ecologist who used to run the deep-sea mining industry's only trade publication. He's been tracking this stuff for years. Andrew Thaler: The reason we wanna go mine the deep sea, the reason we need these metals and the reason we need these minerals is because we wanna get off fossil fuels, and in order to get off fossil fuels, we have to rapidly electrify the world's power grid. Energy production through renewable resources means energy storage, and energy storage means batteries, and polymetallic nodules are—you'll see this all the time when you see any of the mining company CEOs give a talk: they'll hold up a polymetallic nodule, and they'll say ... [CLIP: Gerard Barron, CEO of the Metals Company, appearing on 60 Minutes: “That is a electric vehicle battery in a rock.”] Thaler: “This is a Tesla battery.” And they're not wrong. For over 50 years mining companies have been testing equipment and conducting environmental studies to try and figure out how mining could impact the abyss—because nobody knows for certain how many years it might take the seafloor to recover. He's a federal scientist who studies the seafloor. So here is, actually, the Data Library. We were just looking for an area to study how the seabed responds to change over time. Actually, for this project, I, I looked for some maps and navigation data and just couldn't find it and then realized that the original navigation records were on typed-out, you know, sheets of paper. Fieseler: The coordinates had been lost to history because Deepsea Ventures went out of business just 20 years in. Other companies tried; none pulled it off. Mining the ocean floor never made economic sense. [CLIP: Scientist audio: “So as we said before this was a previous—a testing site for deep-sea mining, and this occurred about in the late '60s, early '70s.”] So we ended up with more than 550,000 photographs. What we're doing is merging 'em together to try and make a seamless picture of the seafloor. You know, at this point it's now 54 years. Thaler: That looks like a dredge track in an abyssal plain. Fieseler: You are the first person to be seeing these. Like, we know that recovery doesn't happen over decadal time scales. Like, I'm sure this is what everyone would expect to see. Thaler: I mean, like, most people, like, wouldn't have any context for what this is to begin with. Fieseler: We're here at the largest gathering of ocean scientists in North America right now in New Orleans. There are a couple different scientists here that are presenting on their own deep-sea mining research, and so I'm gonna be going in and talking to a couple people. And then we just wait 'til 4:00 P.M. to see what happens when Jason Chaytor presents his work at his poster session. Chaytor: Whether it has major impact is not what we're after. We aim for it to be useful. Just because it comes out and I don't get a whole bunch of phone calls—you know, it's not why, you know, we do the work that we do, especially as a government scientist, because there is a reason for doing it. Fieseler: After just two hours the poster session ended. Fieseler (reading from her 2024 article): “Four security guards herded the scientists out and turned off the lights.... Chaytor was certain that scientists decades from now would see its value. [But] for non-scientists, this unique view about human destruction in unreachable places may fade into history's footnotes once again.” Fieseler: Chaytor remarkably discovered this old mining site in U.S. waters, but today the nodules that most miners want to get at are out there, in international waters, which are currently protected by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It's a treaty ratified by most of the world's countries. It is legally designated “the common heritage of mankind.” But there's a catch: countries of the world can vote to open up the seabed to mining if they can agree on a code—a set of rules that would govern commercial activities out on the high seas. Thaler: That's cobalt-rich seamounts on the Rio Grande Rise—it's, it's everything. Fieseler: So here's the thing: we've been at this for, like, 50 years, but right now we're closer to mining the deep sea than we've ever been before. [CLIP: Barron speaking at Nasdaq: “The future is metallic.”] [CLIP: Barron testifying to Congress: “Four days' sailing from San Diego lies the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where polymetallic nodules sit 2.5 miles [about four kilometers] deep on the seafloor.”] [CLIP: Barron speaking on Disruptive Investing: “They form like this rock in my hand.”] [CLIP: Representative Ed Case of Hawaii and Barron speak during a congressional hearing.] Case: “And you've stated in the press that where you wanted to mine is a, quote, unquote, ‘marine desert.' But that doesn't mean it's devoid of life. [CLIP: Scientists discuss a creature in the abyssal plain.] Scientist 1: “So when we get close there's a lot of these little, tiny hexactinellids, or glass sponges.” Scientist 2: “Little spots. Thaler: In this moment, science really has the key role to play. We have never, in human history, started an extractive industry from the position of understanding the environment first. The Metals Company says dark oxygen is, quote, “bad science.” A spokesperson told me that the company's rebuttal is still undergoing scientific peer review. And the company declined to comment further. Marlow: I think a lot of the initial attention was like, “We did it! We found this intriguing thing—end of story.” But to me and my colleagues, this is the beginning of the story. And that's the next step that we have to figure out: Like, does it matter in the real world ...? Marlow: Or is it like, “They kind of do this weird thing, but it doesn't really matter”? The consequences of being wrong either way are huge. Fieseler: I remember when my editor at The Post and Courier first asked me why an audience would care about this story. Marlow: The quest for life beyond Earth is really one, when you get down to it, of life extracting energy from its environment. So to me it is the same thing [laughs]. Those sorts of unknown unknowns are so hard to come across in science because it's often at the exploratory limit of our understanding, so that might happen in outer space. Those kind of first forays into new, unknown habitats and environments are where the big discoveries could happen, where you reveal something you'd never seen before. Fieseler: That's really what this story's about—and why dark oxygen broke through. It's like: What else don't we know about our planet—or the universe? All right, buddy, you're in the way. Come on.” Scientist 9: “Oh, he doesn't seem to want to.” Scientist 3: “Lots of tentacles in all directions.” Scientist 9: “He does not look like we've seen, seen 'em.” Scientist 3: “Yeah, he looks similar to the helmet jelly, where he's got that bell with the red internals …” Scientist 9: “Yeah.” Scientist 3: “And then these tentacles that go up and down, but I don't know which kind he is. He's very neat.” Scientist 9: “Yeah, the pink looks like it was probably a reflection from our lights, but it looks like where he could maybe illuminate?” Scientist 3: “Yeah, possible. It could also be food from—that he's eaten. This story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center and co-published with the Post and Courier.

There is an emerging need for objective neural biomarkers of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) to improve the efficacy of neuromodulatory interventions, most notably deep-brain stimulation (DBS), and develop closed-loop stimulation paradigms. Preliminary data suggest that such biomarkers may be derived from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in individual patients implanted with sensing DBS devices. However, reliable LFP signatures that are generalizable across OCD patients have yet to be identified. Here, we relate LFPs recorded from sensing DBS electrodes in different basal-ganglia structures to core symptoms of OCD in 11 patients during personalized provocation of obsessions and compulsions. We identify two general markers of compulsion: delta and alpha LFP power was significantly increased during all compulsions in the external globus pallidus (GPe), nucleus accumbens, anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and anterior lateral anterior commissure. In mental compulsion subtypes, similar low-frequency increases were observed only in GPe (delta/alpha) and ALIC (alpha), suggesting that these signals possibly reflect more universal biomarkers of compulsivity unconfounded by motor function. GPe delta power correlated with OCD symptom severity, establishing a meaningful connection between subcortical sensing DBS readout and patient experience. ALIC alpha power was modulated by the phase of theta oscillations during compulsions, possibly reflecting pathological coupling of cortical networks in OCD. Our results demonstrate unique, group-level LFP correlates of core OCD symptoms across disease-relevant basal-ganglia structures. These electrophysiological signatures help pave the way toward the development of biomarker-targeted neuromodulatory intervention for OCD. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent, unwanted intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and corresponding repetitive, ritualistic behaviors (compulsions). Although the majority of patients can be treated to a satisfactory level with pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy, approximately 10% of patients respond insufficiently and remain severely ill1. In these therapy-resistant patients, neuromodulation using deep-brain stimulation (DBS) can be highly effective, leading to response rates of 52–66% (refs. DBS entails neurosurgical implantation of intracranial electrodes to target specific brain areas with electrical pulses, modulating activity of local and connected neuronal networks. In therapy-resistant OCD, common DBS targets are the internal capsule, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the subthalamic nucleus4,5. These structures relate to the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, in which aberrant neuronal network activity is hypothesized to underlie OCD6,7,8,9,10,11. However, the exact physiological manifestation of OCD in CSTC structures is yet to be discovered, and approximately 30–50% of patients experience partial or inadequate response to DBS, remaining severely disabled in daily functioning2. Improved understanding of electrophysiological activity throughout CSTC networks could improve clinical outcomes of neuromodulatory interventions such as DBS12,13,14. Novel technological advances allow real-time recording of intracranial brain activity (neuronal oscillations), time-locked to behavioral states, directly from DBS electrodes, from which neural correlates of OCD may be obtained. These oscillations, derived from the local field potential (LFP), are extracellular electrical signals that reflect temporal coordination of neuronal activity15. The frequency and amplitude of this synchronized neuronal network activity has been functionally linked with cognitive and mechanistic processes throughout the brain, such as neuronal communication and information processing16,17; furthermore, abnormal LFP oscillations have been linked with pathological neuronal activity in modeled psychiatric disease18. As altered communication between cortical- and basal-ganglia structures is thought to underlie OCD19, we hypothesized that OCD symptoms would be reflected as compromised LFP in these networks. Indeed, case reports20,21,22,23,24 characterizing neural correlates of OCD provide insight into possible neuronal signatures on the level of individual patients, and, in a recent publication from our team, deep-learning models based on LFP recordings from individual patients could identify different symptom states whereas models based on (group-level) data from multiple patients could not25. However, targeted intervention for OCD symptoms (using neuromodulation such as so-called closed-loop DBS, where stimulation adapts directly to intervene with detected pathological neural activity) requires general, group-level disease biomarkers. Here, we present LFP data from 11 sensing-DBS-implanted OCD patients, recorded in basal-ganglia nuclei and associated white matter, aiming to discover electrophysiological correlates related to cardinal features of OCD across patients and brain regions. We employed a behavioral task that effectively evoked core symptoms, imitating real-life brain states in which patients might benefit from improved neuromodulatory intervention, and identify general disease biomarkers throughout the basal ganglia and associated white matter. Eleven patients with treatment-resistant OCD indicated for DBS were included in this study over a period of 5 yr. Patient demographics are summarized in the left-hand panel of Table 1. All patients were implanted bilaterally in the brain with a Medtronic DBS system and leads. The experiment took place after recovery from surgery. After a 3-min baseline (BAS) in which patients watched a neutral movie, during which LFP was recorded from the DBS electrodes, patient-specific obsessions (OBS) were provoked and LFP was recorded for 3 min in this obsessive state. Subsequently, patients performed their compulsions (COM), while LFP was recorded for at least 3 min, until patients reported their urge had subsided. Finally, 3 min of LFP was recorded as patients experienced relief (REL). Severity of obsession, compulsion, agitation, anxiety, depressive mood and avoidance was quantified throughout the experiment by patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS) scores (Fig. Provocation of obsessions sharply increased severity of obsession, compulsion, agitation and anxiety compared with baseline, as reflected in the VAS scores in Fig. This severity remained stable throughout the obsession recordings, and decreased during compulsions, returning to baseline levels during relief recordings. Thus, the symptom provocation was successful in inducing the intended effect. Patient-specific obsessions and compulsions are summarized in the right-hand columns of Table 1. a, OCD symptoms were successfully induced by our provocation paradigm. Patients (n = 11) reported VAS scores reflecting the experience severity of obsession, compulsion, anxiety, agitation, depression and avoidance at seven timepoints throughout symptom provocation (mean ± s.e.m.). Three minutes of LFP was recorded during each behavioral condition: during ‘baseline' patients watched a neutral movie while seated in a chair; during ‘obsession' and ‘compulsion' they respectively experienced and performed their patient-specific obsessions and compulsions; during ‘relief' they were again seated in a chair. Additional compulsion LFP was recorded if the patient could not cease this behavior after 3 min. b, Example LFP traces recorded during symptom provocation. Top rows show full-spectrum LFP, bottom rows show the same trace filtered for different frequency bands. c, Anatomical localization of the DBS leads (Medtronic 3389, orange) from which LFP was recorded in one example patient, illustrating in coronal view the basal-ganglia nuclei (GPe, NAc) and associated white-matter structures (ALIC (shown only unilaterally), alAC) that were targeted in this study. d, Highlighted (in red) Medtronic 3389 contact electrodes from which LFP was recorded in this study projected onto one hemisphere, separated per anatomical target, shown in reference to GPe (blue structure; in lateral, frontal and medial views). Representative LFP traces recorded during each of the four behavior states in Fig. 1b illustrate reliable neural signal with the presence of delta, theta and alpha oscillations. Lead implants were localized for each individual patient in basal ganglia and associated white matter illustrated in Fig. We included only data recorded from electrode pairs that could be unambiguously localized in the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC, n = 10), the most anterior portion of the external globus pallidus (aGPe, n = 12), a slightly more posterior part of the anterior external globus pallidus (pGPe, n = 17), the most anterior portion of the lateral anterior commissure (alAC, n = 6) or the NAc (n = 5) (Fig. 1d); the remaining (n = 16) electrode pairs were excluded from analysis as their placement fell wholly or partially across anatomical borders. Time–frequency representation of continuous LFP recordings averaged across all patients during each behavior state demonstrates that the baseline power of low-frequency oscillations differed between anatomical recording locations but increased in all brain regions during performance of compulsions (Fig. This compulsion-driven LFP power increased significantly from baseline across multiple frequencies in all brain regions (Fig. 2b, non-parametric randomization test P < 0.05; Extended Data Table 1), extending heterogeneously over multiple frequency bands (Fig. 2c, Bonferroni-corrected one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test; Extended Data Table 2). Thus, compulsions in OCD were marked by generally increased delta and alpha LFP power throughout all structures evaluated in our study, whereas increased theta, beta and gamma LFP power during compulsions was regionally distinct. Low-frequency LFP power was also significantly increased in ALIC during post-compulsion relief (Fig. 2b,c), though we cannot exclude that this was confounded by mental compulsions persisting at the start of the relief phase in one patient (which can be seen in Fig. a, Averaged time–frequency power spectra of the 27-s continuously recorded LFP segments in each brain region, during the experimental states. Low-frequency oscillations increased in all brain regions during compulsions. b, Power spectra (mean ± s.e.m.) of LFP recorded during the experimental states in each brain region. Colored, horizontal lines at the top of the graphs mark the frequencies at which the spectral power of obsession, compulsion and relief LFP significantly differed from baseline (two-tailed non-parametric randomization test, P < 0.05). c, Bar graphs (mean + s.e.m.) of spectral LFP power per frequency band during the experimental states in each brain region. Pairwise comparisons mark power during obsession, compulsion and relief significantly different from baseline (Bonferroni-corrected one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test). Delta and alpha powers are increased during compulsions in all brain regions. d, Baseline-subtracted power spectra (mean ± s.e.m.) of LFP recorded during motor and non-motor compulsions in each brain region. Pairwise comparisons in bar graph insets (mean + s.e.m.) mark significantly different delta and alpha powers from baseline during (non-)motor compulsions (Bonferroni-corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test). aGPe delta power significantly increased with experience of obsession during the induction and experience of obsessions (Pearson r(5) = .77, P = 0.044), whereas aGPe delta power decreased (non-significant) with reduced anxiety on performing compulsions (Pearson r(5) = −0.70, P = 0.078). f, Anatomical distribution of baselined delta power during compulsions across all recording sites mirrored onto one hemisphere, shown with reference to GPe (in lateral, ventral and medial views), illustrating highest power localized in NAc, ALIC and aGPe. As increased delta/alpha power during compulsions was observed in all brain regions, we further determined whether these signals could serve as universal compulsivity markers across the CSTC circuit. First, considering that the basal ganglia facilitate movement, we discerned to what extent our LFP signals reflected the motor component of compulsions, by dividing the data set to compare powers of delta and alpha oscillations in patients with compulsions requiring movement (for example, hand washing) and patients with non-motor/mental compulsions (for example, praying). Increased delta power during non-motor/mental compulsions persisted only in ALIC and GPe, indicating that these signals may universally mediate compulsive feelings, thoughts and actions (Fig. 2d, Bonferroni-corrected unpaired t-test; Extended Data Table 3); however, this signal did not persist in NAc, indicating here it may mediate only the motor-action component of compulsions, or reflect general movement. Non-motor compulsive alpha power was only increased in pGPe (Fig. 2d, Bonferroni-corrected unpaired t-test; Extended Data Table 4). The compulsions of all patients in the alAC group required action, so although motor-compulsion signals significantly differed from baseline in both delta and alpha bands (Fig. 2d, Bonferroni-corrected unpaired t-test; Extended Data Tables 3 and 4), we could not determine to what extent these signals reflect compulsive feeling. Next, we explored the correlation between delta/alpha power and self-reported severity of obsessions, compulsions, agitation, anxiety, depressive mood and avoidance during symptom provocation in ALIC, aGPe and pGPe (that is, the regions mediating compulsive feeling). During obsessions the aGPe delta-power increase correlated positively with obsession severity (Fig. 2e: Pearson r(5) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.03093 to 0.9634, P = 0.044), while during compulsions the aGPe delta-power increase showed a non-significant negative correlation with anxiety severity (Fig. 2e: Pearson r(5) = −0.70, 95% confidence interval −0.9522 to 0.1053, P = 0.078). We found no significant symptom-severity correlations with LFP power in pGPe (delta/alpha) or ALIC (delta). Finally, despite it being general throughout the brain regions evaluated in our study, compulsion-mediated delta-power increase showed a defined spatial distribution across all recording sites (Fig. 2f), with highest baseline-subtracted power advancing non-uniformly from NAc and ALIC into GPe. This further corroborates delta-power increase as anatomically specific (rather than general, volume-conducted) and consequential to OCD symptomatology. As LFP oscillations reflect temporal coordination of neuronal activity, interaction of these oscillations across frequency bands may play an important role in cognitive processes26. Thus, we hypothesized that so-called phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) of subcortical neural oscillations may be disturbed in repetitive, compulsive behavior. To explore this, we calculated the cross-frequency coherence of LFP in basal ganglia and associated white-matter regions during symptom provocation (Fig. We further explored the striking signal observed in ALIC, and determined that PAC in this region was significantly stronger than semi-randomized PAC during compulsion (P = 0.022) but not baseline, obsession or relief states. Three of these ALIC–compulsion cross-frequency interactions (as outlined in Fig. Only theta–alpha mean PAC was significantly stronger during compulsions compared with baseline in ALIC (Fig. 3c, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Z = −1.89, P = 0.030). a, Cross-frequency coupling of baseline-subtracted LFP recorded during obsession, compulsion and relief states, averaged across patients. b, The highlighted areas mark increased coherence between frequency bands on the x axis with power of the frequency bands on the y axis during compulsions in ALIC. c, Violin plots of PAC strength during compulsions in the highlighted areas in b, compared with baseline. Pairwise comparison marks significant difference (one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Discovering electrophysiological disease markers of OCD is critical for improving outcomes of neuromodulatory interventions such as DBS. Here, we have identified intracranial electrophysiological correlates of several cardinal features of OCD across cortico-striatal network nodes. Crucially, as an essential control lacking from many study designs, in our study we control for the contribution of movement during compulsions, differentiating between brain regions where increased LFP power relates to compulsive feeling from those where it relates to (compulsive) action. Using the Lead-DBS toolbox27 to reconstruct, visualize and localize the DBS leads in each patient individually, combined with additional verification and refinement of electrode locations, we determined that our LFP data were recorded from brain structures whose functions fit in the line of evidence that CSTC-circuit dysfunction is the core pathophysiology of OCD. As a key node in this system, the GPe can be subdivided into (anterior) limbic, (medial) associative and (posterior) sensorimotor functional territories28,29. Our recordings target the most anterior, limbic portion of GPe, which is speculated to be of therapeutic relevance for psychiatric disorders, and where disruption of inhibitory neurotransmission is shown to induce stereotypies in primates30. Yet, this delineation may be more complex. Thus, for the purpose of this study, we took the additional step of subdividing our GPe recording sites into more anterior (aGPe) and more posterior (pGPe) parts of anterior GPe, and indeed find subtle divergence of electrophysiological signatures in our most anterior and more posterior subdivisions of anterior GPe. Although compulsions increased the power of delta oscillations from baseline across all brain areas targeted in our study (which generalizes to the n = 16 electrode pairs that were excluded from analysis due to anatomy; Extended Data Fig. 1), qualitative differences between them imply that this signature was not simply volume-conducted from a single brain region: its spatial distribution was regionally distinct across recording sites, it persisted only in a subset of brain regions during compulsions that were not implicitly linked to physical movement and it correlated with experience of symptom severity only in aGPe. Thus, our data suggest that subcortical delta oscillations are meaningfully different across basal-ganglia structures and that they can reflect compulsivity beyond their purported role in mediating compulsive movements. Alpha-oscillation power similarly increased in all brain areas during compulsions, yet only related to non-motor/mental compulsions in pGPe, and did not correlate with symptom severity. Increased power of theta and beta oscillations during compulsions was region specific, and phase–amplitude interactions were only affected in ALIC. This heterogeneity of our findings across frequency bands and brain regions suggests that we have identified several distinct potential biomarkers that may reflect disparate behavioral aspects of OCD symptomatology. Understanding of the functional relevance of subcortical oscillatory frequencies in psychiatric disease is limited, as only recent advances have made it possible to record deep-brain LFP in chronically implanted patients. However, human electroencephalography (EEG) studies have linked global, cortical delta activity to motor preparation and transfer of sensory information31,32,33. Delta activity may be particularly suited for this type of communication, as its low-frequency oscillations provide long time windows, allowing larger ensembles of neurons to synchronize their activity, with resulting large oscillation amplitude that may facilitate interaction between distant brain regions. This mechanism may mediate psychiatric symptoms across the CSTC circuit, that is, we speculate that the increased delta power observed in our study reflects compulsive feeling by strongly coupling neuronal activity in basal-ganglia nuclei and cortical areas. A compelling characterization of OCD posits compulsions as goal-directed actions to mitigate the anxiety induced by obsessions34. In this sense, it is unexpected that we did not find obsessions to be represented in deep-brain structures as robustly as compulsions. One interpretation is that obsessions are more strongly represented elsewhere in the brain, and thus, in our study, we identified only the subcortical reflection of this activity. Following an alternative model of OCD, where pathological disinhibition of the prefrontal cortex allows habits to escalate into compulsions, obsessions are interpreted as patients' post hoc rationalization of their behavior, instead of a driving force35. The construct of our study, where obsession and compulsion states were induced separately and in sequence, precludes us from interpreting the relevance of this latter model in our data. One origin of the LFP signal is synchronization of neuronal postsynaptic potentials by afferent activity15; in the OCD-CSTC circuit, increased subcortical LFP power may therefore reflect pathological cortical inputs36, which renders the circuit inflexible, resulting in compulsive behavior. Indeed, our team has previously shown that NAc DBS in OCD attenuates symptom-provocation-increased low-frequency frontal EEG power8. More recent work in OCD patients has identified connectivity between the NAc and frontal cortex in theta and alpha bands37 and shown that bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)/ALIC DBS reduces theta power but increases the power of higher-frequency oscillations in local LFP and cortical EEG38. Finally, the connectivity strength of midfrontal EEG and ventral capsule/ventral striatum delta LFP is found to correlate with OCD symptoms39. Less is known about the involvement of GPe, which mediates the ‘indirect' (net inhibitory) CSTC pathway, conveying neuronal activity between striatum and thalamus. Although OCD symptoms have long been hypothesized to result from overactivation of the ‘direct' (net excitatory) pathway40, pallidal lesions can result in OCD-type behavior41,42,43,44, and optogenetic inhibition of GPe-projecting striatal neurons reduced compulsive grooming in the Sapap3-knockout mouse model of OCD45. Thus, taken together, we hypothesize that the LFP biomarkers identified in our study reflect overactivation of multiple nodes of the CSTC circuit, and that DBS might disrupt the resulting pathological feedback loops, restoring behavioral flexibility. Interactions of LFP oscillations across frequency bands are believed to underlie information processing46. In particular, phase-to-power coupling is hypothesized to facilitate the integration of activity between neuronal networks. Previously, our team has shown that ALIC DBS suppresses cortical PAC in OCD patients47, possibly attenuating pathological CSTC hyperconnectivity. In the current study, we did indeed identify increased PAC in ALIC during compulsions. As, canonically, white matter does not generate its own LFP, this signal may be volume-conducted from elsewhere. However, altered cross-frequency coupling was not found in any of the adjacent gray-matter regions examined in this study, which implies that the abnormal ALIC phase–amplitude interactions reflect a unique biomarker of compulsion, distinct from the NAc/CSTC-input and GPe/indirect-pathway biomarkers described above. In fact, it has been suggested that LFP recorded from white matter may reflect distant gray-matter activity traveling through axonal fiber tracts48, in which case we believe that increased ALIC PAC reflects pathological coupling of cortical networks in OCD. Although a number of subcortical areas are commonly targeted with DBS for OCD, these are generally connected via ALIC to the CSTC circuit5 and thus typically reduce symptoms equally well49 by modulating the same prefrontal cortical regions50. Our findings corroborate this to some extent, as we find a compulsion-related, generalized power increase of delta oscillations throughout our basal-ganglia targets. However, the frequency, spatial, behavioral and cross-frequency heterogeneity of our other biomarkers might reflect different aspects of OCD symptomatology and interactions with non-shared neuronal networks. Targeting these novel, heterogeneous biomarkers with DBS might ameliorate separate dimensions of OCD symptomatology such as compulsivity or anxiety, which may be quantified more easily as separate treatment outcomes in individual patients. In addition, identification of immediate biomarkers of OCD and separate dimensions of response may allow more efficient, temporally specific targeting of symptoms with adaptive DBS. Biomarker-led closed (feedback)-loop DBS as treatment for psychiatric disorders has been the topic of recent (case) studies, which though limited in number of patients and behavioral controls are promising in their results22,51,52. The robustly defined, anatomically restricted, group-level neural correlates of OCD we identified across many patients in the current study may substantially aid these efforts, as they enable general, standardized protocols for biomarker detection in patients as a group (circumventing time-consuming individualized approaches), from the very same electrodes that are used to stimulate (thus the translation from detection to intervention may be performed on the same device), paving the way toward biomarker-led closed-loop DBS as treatment for OCD. Moreover, identification of reliable neuronal biomarkers of OCD may also benefit application of other neuromodulatory interventions, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Some limitations should be taken into consideration in interpreting our findings. Although we believe ours is the largest cohort of intracranial electrophysiological recordings in OCD to date, the absolute number of patients is still relatively low; therefore, analyses on a per-patient level might have been underpowered (Extended Data Fig. 2), and it was not possible to stratify results by OCD type, comorbidities, medication use and so on. Our behavioral paradigm was designed to subdivide OCD dynamics into four separate states (baseline, obsession, compulsion, relief). Although effective, it is debatable whether this classification provides the best approach to discovering biomarkers for treatment of a disorder that consists of such a broad and dynamic assembly of experience and manifestation between patients. In fact, immediate effects of DBS typically affect patient mood, anxiety and confidence before alleviating obsessions and compulsions, and it is therefore possible that, despite our characterization of the behavior states in our paradigm as ‘obsessive' or ‘compulsive', the neural correlates we find reflect more subtle representations thereof. For instance, our correlation of delta power with obsession severity is similar to the reported low-frequency power increase immediately preceding loss-of-control eating53, and our corresponding delta-power and anxiety decrease during compulsions is similar to the reported delta-power decrease with OCD symptom intensity22; these findings might be different classifications of the same neural signal. 2e illustrates, neural signals during compulsions may relate to more than just the compulsions themselves, reflecting reduction in VAS anxiety. In the same vein, it is possible that our choice of VAS to monitor throughout symptom provocation does not accurately reflect patients' experience of their symptomatology; for instance, basal-ganglia LFP might correlate more strongly with feelings of distress or disgust elicited during symptom provocation, which were not evaluated in our study. Furthermore, we chose to restrict our analyses to recordings taken from electrode pairs localized within CSTC structures, thus defining our results on the basis of current understanding of presupposed networks of OCD. It is, however, possible that LFP recorded differentially from a combination of brain regions could reveal other signatures of OCD dynamics not identified in our study. Additionally, as an exploratory study, our results must be replicated in a hypothesis-driven manner to verify how these biomarkers reflect OCD symptoms, and whether they can be used successfully as triggers for closed-loop DBS or other neuromodulatory intervention. Finally, although we controlled for the effects of movement on neuronal correlates of compulsion by separately analyzing patients on the basis of their motor activation, future experiments would benefit from a more comprehensive characterization of movement effects on basal-ganglia LFP by controlling for non-compulsive movement-related neuronal activity. Ultimately, we describe here an approach to identifying intracranial biomarkers of psychiatric disease using an unprecedentedly large group of patients that is innovative in multiple aspects: the data were recorded from electrodes that can be directly implemented for treatment, the behavioral paradigm was individually tailored to each patient and we differentiated our data between multiple brain areas due to highly refined anatomical localization of our recording sites. With this paradigm we found novel, group-level neural signatures of OCD obtained from sensing DBS recordings, which may prove invaluable in the pursuit of biomarker-targeted neuromodulatory intervention. Between June 2015 and March 2020, 11 patients with treatment-resistant OCD indicated for DBS were recruited at the outpatient clinic of the psychiatry department of the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, and registered in the Netherlands Trial Register under trial number NL7486, https://onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/50295. Before participation, all patients provided written informed consent. Participants included in the study met the following inclusion criteria: primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM and indication for DBS implantation. This patient group was defined as treatment resistant with insufficient response to at least two treatments with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor at maximum dosage for >12 weeks, one treatment with clomipramine at maximum dosage for >12 weeks and at least one augmentation trial with an atypical antipsychotic and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for 8 weeks. In addition, patients must have undergone one cognitive behavioral therapy trial at an OCD expert center, involving individual sessions, group day treatment or admission2. Patients were included following a new indication for DBS (ten patients) or an indication for stimulator replacement after successful DBS (one patient). Patients were excluded from the study in the case of substance or alcohol abuse 6 months before participation. Implantation of the DBS system was performed under general anesthesia. Frame-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for target determination. A detailed description of the surgical procedure was previously reported2. In short, Medtronic model 3389 leads (used off-label) with four contact electrodes (each 1.5 mm in length, spaced 0.5 mm apart, with 7.5 mm total spread) were implanted bilaterally in the brain, following the ALIC, with the most ventral contact targeting the NAc (Fig. The leads were connected via subcutaneous Medtronic extension cables to an Activa PC + S sensing neurostimulator (Medtronic model 37604, used off-label), which was placed in the right infraclavicular pocket. This telemetry device is able to both stimulate and record LFP at its contact electrodes. Patients received standard medical care after the procedure. The experiment was conducted in the clinic once patients had recovered from surgery, which was two to three weeks after device implantation, before the DBS system being activated. In two exceptional cases, recordings were done after DBS had already been activated; stimulation was temporarily turned off (an hour beforehand) for these recordings. Recordings were done during a symptom-provocation task in which patients experienced and performed, respectively, their patient-specific obsessions and compulsions (Fig. 1a, as previously reported25): 3 min of LFP was recorded during four behavioral states (baseline, obsession, compulsion, relief). Appropriate personalized symptom-provocation methods were selected in consultation with the patient before the experiment. During the 3-min baseline recordings, patients were asked to sit still and watch a neutral movie. This was followed by personalized obsession provocation (for example, touching the floor in case of contamination fear), after which patients were asked to sit still and experience their obsessions for another 3-min LFP recording. Subsequently, patients were allowed to perform their compulsions (for example, washing their hands in case of contamination fear) while LFP was recorded for 3 min or longer, until their urge resolved. Finally, patients were asked to sit still and experience their relief for another 3-min LFP recording. All but one patient underwent four iterations of the entire protocol. Neural activity was recorded using the 8180 Sensing Programmer SW (Medtronic) in montage mode, obtaining LFP differentially between two electrodes for 30 s each in succession, across all six electrode combinations on the lead, simultaneously in both hemispheres (sampling rate 422 Hz, gain 2,000, bandpass filtered 0.5–100 Hz). Severity of obsession, compulsion, agitation, anxiety, depressive mood and avoidance was monitored throughout the experiment at the beginning and end of each behavioral state using a VAS, on which patients rated each from 1 to 10 (where higher scores imply more severe symptoms, Fig. The Y-BOCS54 was used to measure the severity of OCD symptoms pre-surgery, providing insight into the clinical status of the participants during the experiment (scores are divided into obsessive and compulsive subscores, with a total score range from 0 to 40, where higher scores imply more severe symptoms). Demographic, clinical and experimental details of the study group are summarized in Table 1 (as previously reported25). Patient age range was 32–68 years (mean 49, s.d. The position of the implanted DBS leads was verified using the Lead-DBS toolbox v.2.5.227 in MATLAB R2021a (MathWorks). In short, postoperative stereotactic computerized tomography was merged with preoperative T1 MRI using a two-stage linear registration (rigid followed by affine) as implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools55 for each patient individually. Coregistered scans were inspected, refined, corrected for postoperative brain shift as needed and subsequently normalized into ICBM 2009b nonlinear asymmetric MNI space56 using the SyN-registration approach as implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools. DBS electrodes were automatically pre-reconstructed in native and template space using the PaCER algorithm57, visually inspected and manually refined as needed. Anatomical localization of each pair of adjacent electrodes was determined using an adaptation of the DISTAL atlas58 in Lead-DBS, after which results were visually verified to individual patient computerized tomography–MRI coregistered electrode trajectories, and refined using two additional atlases59,60. The Lead-Group toolbox v.2.5.261 was used to visualize recording sites (Fig. 1c,d) and the distribution of baseline-subtracted delta power onto them (Fig. 2f), using an adaptation of the DISTAL atlas58. Spectral analyses of LFP were performed in MATLAB R2022b (MathWorks) using FieldTrip62 and custom-made routines. Only data recorded from adjacent electrode pairs that were unambiguously localized within a clearly defined anatomical region were used (50 out of a total 66 pairs). Due to amplifier artifacts, the first 1,210 samples were removed from each recording, leaving 27 s of continuously recorded LFP for further analysis. Power-line artifacts were removed using a discrete Fourier transform filter at 50 Hz and its second and third harmonics, and an additional band-stop filter at 47–53 Hz. Data were segmented into 1-s epochs, which were visually inspected, manually artifact-rejected, Z-scored (to equalize the contribution of different electrodes across patients), demeaned, Hanning-tapered and Fourier-transformed. Spectral estimates were evaluated for significant differences from baseline at P < 0.05 (Fig. 2b), using a non-parametric randomization test, corrected for multiple comparisons, for each brain region across all frequency bins (as previously reported18). 3a) were performed on the basis of the cross-frequency coherence between a low-frequency oscillation and the power envelope of a high-frequency oscillation63. The statistical significance of PAC was assessed by 100 repetitions of randomly shifting the signal >3,000 data points with regards to the power and recalculating their coherence; the proportion of maximum randomly shifted coherence values obtained that lie above the original coherence value determine the P value. Additional statistical analyses were Bonferroni-corrected one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons, Bonferroni-corrected unpaired t-test, Pearson correlation, linear regression and one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. These analyses were performed using Prism 9.1.2 (GraphPad) and custom-made routines in MATLAB R2022b. The significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Left, duplicated from Fig. 2c: pairwise comparisons mark significantly different power during obsession, compulsion, and relief from baseline (Bonferroni-corrected one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test). Right, same data as Left, but plotted on the basis of individual patients. Although the number of patients in each anatomical group is relatively low (ALIC n=5, aGPe n=7, pGPe n=6, alAC n=3, NAc n=4), the results (not analyzed statistically) still follow our original conclusions, that compulsions increase low-frequency LFP power compared with baseline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We show that academic assessment outcomes vary systematically across the day, with a clear peak in passing rates around midday," said Prof Carmelo Mario Vicario, director of the Social-Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University of Messina and lead author of the article in Frontiers in Psychology. "We believe this pattern could extend to job interviews or any evaluative process scheduled throughout the day," added Vicario. "We would be very interested in investigating whether hiring decisions, too, fluctuate in fairness or outcome depending on time of day." The researchers were inspired by work which showed that judges were most likely to rule in favor of a defendant after meal breaks or at the beginning of a session. So the researchers looked at oral exams, which are more subjective than legal decisions. "Oral exams in Italian universities are scheduled at set times, typically lasting 10 to 30 minutes per student," explained Vicario. These exams can be highly stressful due to their unpredictable nature and the strong weight they carry in academic progression." A database from the University of Messina allowed researchers to access the results of exams conducted between October 2018 and February 2020. They also used the number of credits granted towards a degree per exam to measure the difficulty of individual exams. The passing rate followed a bell curve with a peak at noon: there was no significant difference in your chance of passing if you sat your exam at 11:00 or 13:00, but your chances of passing were lower if you took the exam at 08:00 or 09:00, or at 15:00 or 16:00. "They highlight how biological rhythms -- often overlooked in decision-making contexts -- can subtly but significantly shape the outcome of high-stakes evaluations." Students' falling energy levels could lead to diminishing focus, compromising their performance. Professors might also be experiencing decision fatigue, leading them to mark more harshly. Meanwhile, poorer results earlier in the day could be down to competing chronotypes. People in their early 20s are usually night owls, while people in their 40s or older tend to be morning larks. "To counteract time-of-day effects, students might benefit from strategies like ensuring quality sleep, avoiding scheduling important exams during personal 'low' periods, and taking mental breaks before performance tasks," suggested Vicario. "While we controlled for exam difficulty, we can't entirely exclude other unmeasured factors," said Prof Massimo Mucciardi of the University of Messina, senior author. This is why we encourage follow-up studies using physiological or behavioral measures to uncover the underlying mechanisms." Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

Nearly 75 percent of women report believing both partners should be equally responsible for pregnancy prevention. This shared responsibility, however, is often more of a dream than a reality, as most birth control options on the market are targeted at women. In fact, research on male birth control is so far behind that there are only two FDA-approved male birth controls on the market: condoms and vasectomies. But a new clinical trial might just make male birth control more accessible—and virtually free of side effects. Participants included 16 healthy men between the ages of 32 and 59. So as not to risk their long-term fertility while the pill is still in its trial stages, only individuals with vasectomies were enrolled. The new drug, called YCT-529, works by preventing sperm cell production and release. Researchers later selected men from each cohort to ingest the contraceptive after a rich breakfast to test nutrition's effect on tolerability. The study revealed that the pill was well-tolerated, with no noticeable effects on participants' heart rates, blood parameters, or testosterone levels. Researchers also found that YCT-529 had “no effect on [men's] sexual desire or mood,” lead author Nadja Mannowetz explained in a press release. This is a far cry from female oral contraceptives—in one survey, 35 percent of women report experiencing at least one side effect or injury related to their birth control. Like other oral contraceptives, YCT-529 can't prevent sexually transmitted diseases. “Studies and surveys continue to show that men want to share the burden of pregnancy prevention with their partners,” he said in the press release. “But they have just one non-permanent contraceptive option—condoms—and it's 170 years old. Data show men favor an oral contraceptive and one that's hormone-free, positioning YCT-529 as potentially transformative for a healthcare segment that's been stagnant for more than a century and a half.” Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics.

(2025)Cite this article Metal–sulfur active sites play a central role in catalytic processes such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, yet the majority of active sites in these compounds reside on the surfaces and edges of catalyst particles, limiting overall efficiency. Here we present a strategy to embed metal–sulfur active sites into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) by converting bridging or terminal chloride ligands into hydroxide and subsequently into sulfide groups through post-synthetic modification. We apply this method to two representative MOF families: one featuring one-dimensional metal–chloride chains and another containing discrete multinuclear metal clusters. Crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses confirm structural integrity and sulfide incorporation, and the transformation is monitored by in situ total scattering methods. The sulfided MOFs display enhanced catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using molecular hydrogen. Density functional theory calculations indicate that sulfur incorporation promotes homolytic metal–ligand bond cleavage and facilitates H2 activation.

Both periodic and cluster models were used to represent the local coordination environments and extended structures (M = Co, Ni; X = Cl, OH, SH). Colour coding follows that used in Fig. In the 1D BBTA system, MeOH initially coordinates to the square pyramidal metal centres, converting species A to B. Subsequent M–X bond cleavage (M = Co, Ni; X = Cl, OH, SH) can proceed either homolytically (C1) or heterolytically (C2), generating an open metal site for H2 adsorption (D1, D2). The H–H bond then dissociates, facilitated by a N-atom on the ligand, forming species E1 and E2. Although our computed results show relatively high energy requirements for the formation of active species E, our goal was to qualitatively understand trends related to MOF structure, metal node, and X ligand. The cluster models employed frozen C atoms in the linkers to maintain structural rigidity of the MOF, potentially overestimating energetic barriers where remarkable ligand relaxation would occur, particularly during the H–H dissociation on the ligand (Conversion of species D to E). Future studies using fully relaxed periodic models of all proposed reaction intermediates should yield lower energy requirements for E formation. Additionally, while intrinsic barriers appear high due to solvent stabilization of species B, the apparent activation energy (Eapp) observed experimentally can be lower when measured relative to separated reactants (Species A). 1–57, Discussion and Tables 1–18.

The process of protein aggregation, central to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's, is challenging to study due to its unpredictable nature and relatively rapid kinetics. Understanding its biomechanics is crucial for unraveling its role in disease progression and cellular toxicity. Brillouin microscopy offers unique advantages for studying biomechanical properties, yet is limited by slow imaging speed, complicating its use for rapid and dynamic processes like protein aggregation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a self-driving microscope that uses deep learning to predict the onset of aggregation from a single fluorescence image of soluble protein, achieving 91% accuracy. The system triggers optimized multimodal imaging when aggregation is imminent, enabling intelligent Brillouin microscopy of this dynamic biomechanical process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by detecting mature aggregates in real time using brightfield images and a neural network, Brillouin microscopy can be used to study their biomechanical properties without the need for fluorescence labeling, minimizing phototoxicity and preserving sample health. This autonomous microscopy approach advances the study of aggregation kinetics and biomechanics in living cells, offering a powerful tool for investigating the role of protein misfolding and aggregation in neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation is the hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Huntington's disease (HD), which is caused by an abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the first exon of the Huntingtin (Htt) protein (Httex1), leading to its increased propensity to misfold and aggregate1,2,3,4. Our understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the aggregation process and its role in the pathogenesis of HD and other NDDs remains incomplete. Whether protein aggregation and inclusion formation are the causes or consequences of neurodegeneration, and whether they represent neuroprotective mechanisms aimed at sequestering misfolded and toxic proteins, remains unclear5,6,7,8,9. It has also been hypothesized that the oligomeric species that are formed in an early stage of the process could have a major role in in the initiation or progression of the cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration7. The transition from soluble Httex1 protein to fully-mature aggregate has been observed to be relatively rapid, in the order of a few minutes to a few tens oof minutes, compared to the large time window of days that is usually required for the formation of protein fibrils and inclusions (Fig. Aggregation occurs stochastically in different parts of the sample at different times, complicating our ability to study early steps in the process. Fluorescence time-lapse microscopy and image-based high-throughput screening are often used to monitor the aggregation process over many hours10. This is made possible by the high field of view (FOV), which is further increased by stitching. However, this comes at the cost of low magnification and resolution, and limited temporal resolution, depending on the size of the chosen region of interest (ROI). The unpredictability and fleeting nature of this phenomenon call for new tools that are able to capture the process with optimal spatiotemporal resolution and specificity. a The process of protein aggregation occurs unpredictably in different locations at different times, over a large time window of 48 h, yet the transition from soluble protein to mature aggregate is stochastic and relatively rapid (few minutes–few tens of minutes), making it difficult to capture optimally. Images are representative of experiments conducted more than three independent times. b Self-driving microscopy is an approach that uses a feedback loop to autonomously adjust the imaging settings once an event is detected by a real-time model, offering advantages such as optimal use of time and computing resources. c In standard microscopy, images are acquired and then later processed and analyzed. In our SDM approach, processing and computation are done in real-time by a neural network model, AEGON, that was previously trained. This model is capable of detecting the onset of protein aggregation, triggering an optimized acquisition to ideally capture the process. Images are representative of experiments conducted more than three independent times. State-of-the-art microscopy modalities are indispensable tools that have significantly advanced our understanding of biological systems at various scales. However, all microscopy techniques inherently involve trade-offs between key parameters, such as the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, light dose, penetration depth, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)11,12,13, depending on their underlying principles of operation. The development of integrative approaches that leverage the strengths of complementary techniques using an intelligent microscopy strategy could help address these limitations and enable the investigation of complex and dynamic biological processes. Correlative microscopy techniques14 and multimodal microscopes15,16 have been developed to combine different imaging modalities, but this usually involves complex workflows and is typically not autonomous or adaptive in real-time. Autonomous microscopy approaches have recently started to emerge; in such approaches, there is a feedback loop between the data that is being acquired, a computer that processes this real-time data, and the microscope control software (Fig. This allows the microscope to compute and infer the current needs—whether in terms of illumination laser power, exposure time, spatial resolution, or any other such parameter, and adapt the imaging settings accordingly. The advantages of this method include preserving sample integrity, saving time and data resources, and moving closer to fully automated microscopy capable of capturing transient biological processes. Examples include autonomous control of the acquisition settings19,20,21 and adaptive illumination/detection to reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity22,23,24,25,26,27, to speed up the acquisition, or to enhance the image quality. Recently, event-triggered approaches have been implemented, where the acquisition rate or imaging modality is adjusted based on the detection of specific events28,29,30. To date, most implementations of this approach have focused on switching between fluorescence microscopy techniques. However, switching to a label-free, low-light dose technique would result in minimizing phototoxicity and light exposure, offering significant benefits for long-term live-cell imaging. Self-driving microscopy (SDM) holds considerable untapped potential for optimally capturing the dynamics and kinetics of cellular and molecular processes, such as protein aggregation, in real-time, particularly in intact, living systems. Recently, Brillouin microscopy (BM) has emerged as a non-invasive, label-free tool to study the biomechanical properties of cells and tissues, which are critical for understanding cellular behavior and tissue development31,32,33,34. BM is based on inelastic Brillouin scattering, which provides information about the longitudinal modulus, a measure of viscoelasticity, allowing insight into the high-frequency mechanical properties of the specimen33. Recently, BM was used to gain insight into the mechanical properties of stress granules35 and enabled new insight into Httex1 aggregates36, revealing that they exhibit a higher longitudinal modulus compared to the cytoplasm. The relationship between the mechanical properties of these aggregates and their dynamic properties remains unexplored. BM has only been used to image mature aggregates, rather than to monitor and characterize the full process of aggregation, due to the slow speed of the instrument, which arises from the need for point-by-point acquisition in conventional BM instruments33,35,36,37. Each measurement involves scanning a small region of the sample and analyzing the frequency shift of scattered light, which is time-consuming. Additionally, the low scattering efficiency of Brillouin signals necessitates long acquisition times to achieve a sufficient SNR, further limiting the ability to capture dynamic processes. Line-scanning and nonlinear modalities have been developed to increase the speed of this imaging technique, but they come with their own challenges, including complex sample mounting requirements and potential sample perturbation33. Alternative tools for studying biomechanics, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM)38,39 or optical tweezers (OT)40, face similar limitations with regard to speed, and in particular suffer from being invasive, further highlighting the need for more refined techniques41. To address many of the limitations highlighted above, we have developed a self-driving, fully-modular microscope that enables capturing the different stages of protein aggregation and enables intelligent Brillouin imaging (Fig. Compared to standard microscopy, which can be automated to acquire multiple FOVs that are to be processed and analyzed post-acquisition, our self-driving microscope processes the images in real time and uses a deep learning (DL) model to predict if aggregation is about to occur. When an aggregation event is imminent, the system initiates an optimized multimodal acquisition, capturing the process with high specificity and spatiotemporal resolution. Our model for predicting aggregation onset (AEGON) achieves 91% test set accuracy at predicting aggregation purely from images of soluble protein, a task that has been challenging to achieve with human vision. We compare the performance of different state-of-the-art neural network architectures on this task and demonstrate the high potential of vision transformers (ViTs). By generalizing our classification model to one-plane, one-time-point fluorescence image inputs and showcasing its functionality on a completely different setup, we provide a simple-to-use method for automatically and optimally capturing aggregation kinetics and dynamics. We apply our SDM pipeline to address two significant challenges in the field of Brillouin microscopy. First, using our aggregation classification model, we enable dynamic and highly optimized retrieval of the biomechanical properties throughout the aggregation process. Second, we employ another DL model, IC-LINA, to classify whether FOVs contain aggregates based solely on brightfield images, eliminating the need for fluorescent labeling to detect aggregates. This preserves the label-free advantage of BM, facilitating long-term imaging while maintaining sample integrity and viability, and paving the way for future clinical applications using BM for diagnosis and therapeutics. This work advances the potential of self-driving microscopy for capturing complex biological processes in real time, opening new possibilities for tracking protein aggregation dynamics, kinetics, and biomechanics throughout the process and optimally utilizing label-free techniques for enhanced sample preservation. Determining the onset of protein aggregation is challenging for humans to achieve by visually inspecting images of soluble protein, as there are no apparent discernible features for proteins that are about to aggregate versus those that are not. We aimed to test whether this challenging task can be solved with the use of a neural network. To aid the neural network in learning to identify the onset of protein aggregation and to produce a robust and reproducible model, a large enough dataset should be collected that is representative of the variability of this process, while eliminating sources of error that could confuse the model during training42. We used our custom-built microscope (Supplementary Fig. 1) that can capture images in fluorescence, brightfield, and quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and provide us with images at 8 different z-planes simultaneously, using an image-splitting prism and two cameras43. We chose a well-characterized cellular model of HD that allows the dynamic study of the process using live-cell imaging44. In this model, aggregates form within 48 h when mutant Httex1 with a polyQ repeat length ≥ 39 is overexpressed in HEK293 cells. In our case, we used a construct with a polyQ repeat length of 72, fused to GFP (Httex1-72Q-GFP) to be able to monitor the proteins throughout the aggregation process. Using our microscope, we collected time-lapse, multi-plane fluorescence images of events and non-events to use for training a classification model, AEGON. The full dataset consists of 71 events and 68 non-events. Events are defined as sequences of images where the proteins ended up aggregating during our acquisition, and non-events are sequences where the proteins did not end up aggregating during our acquisition. Due to the high dynamism of the process, we first trained a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), namely a VGG16 long short-term memory (VGG16-LSTM) network, to make use of the temporal information while maintaining efficiency. However, we eventually found the ViT network to work better and achieved 91% accuracy at predicting the onset of aggregation on our test set, a set of examples that the model had never seen before. Figure 2a shows the classification matrix on our test set, illustrating the high performance of the AEGON model using different standard performance metrics (precision = 1.0, recall = 0.82, F1 score =  0.9, and accuracy = 0.91). Visual test-set examples are provided in Fig. These examples illustrate the similarity of events and non-events to the human eye and hence the difficulty of visually determining when aggregation is about to occur. If an FOV contains multiple cells, it is possible that each cell could form a separate aggregate; however, this rarely occurs as the likelihood of two cells forming aggregates at the same time and place is low. During our collection of training events, we aimed to collect a diverse dataset that is well-representative of the different phenomena that could occur and did not exclude any particular kinds of aggregation. The model should, therefore, be able to capture varying types of aggregation events. Further fine-tuning of the model is also possible using transfer learning. a Classification matrix of our model AEGON for predicting aggregation onset. Performance metrics: precision = 1.0, recall =  0.82, F1 score = 0.9, accuracy = 0.91. b Test-set examples of correctly predicted events and correctly predicted non-events. Training and test set data were collected from more than three independent experiments. c Multimodal (fluorescence and QPI) images captured after an event is detected by our model within our SDM pipeline. The intensity in each image is locally rescaled between 0 and 1. Images are representative of experiments conducted more than three independent times. In this pipeline, an initial scan is done, after which the model computes whether events are about to occur, and then the microscope autonomously configures the imaging settings and initiates the optimized scan. The software is fully modular, enabling the user to set various parameters for both the initial and optimized scans, such as the imaging modalities, exposure times, and laser powers. After the initial scan, images are given in real time as input to the model, which predicts whether aggregation is about to occur. There are two modes, one where a specific acquisition sequence (a patterned scan in both the x and y directions) is performed and all the images are passed to the model together at the end, and one where the images at each FOV are passed directly to the model. In the first mode, all FOVs are checked at the same time, and if there are any aggregation events predicted, they are added to a list, which is iterated over in the optimized scan. In the other mode, once an event is predicted, this directly initiates the optimized scan at that FOV, after which the initial scan continues to check the subsequent FOVs. With our self-driving microscope, we are able to accurately predict the onset of mutant Httex1 aggregation process and capture it with high spatiotemporal resolution in multiple modalities (Fig. Here, we show a sequence of images captured using fluorescence microscopy and QPI after AEGON correctly predicted an event in real time. 2a) architecture due to the high dynamism of the process we are studying and the high applicability of LSTM networks for temporally-connected data. With similar rationale, we also trained a video vision transformer (ViViT) (Supplementary Fig. Both architectures produced highly accurate models (88% and 93%). However, we wanted to produce the most easily applicable model for new users in the community. Therefore, we evaluated whether it is possible to achieve similar accuracy using images from one single time-point rather than a sequence of images. We were able to train a ViT model with one time-point, and 8 z-plane inputs, and achieve 91% accuracy, similar to what we could achieve with higher time-points (Fig. a Accuracy of the AEGON models we trained for various time-point inputs. One-time-point models maintain high accuracy. b Accuracy of our one-time-point ViT model with different z-plane inputs. The one-plane model maintains high accuracy. c With our one-plane, one-time-point model, only one fluorescence image is needed to predict protein aggregation. We are able to use our model on a completely different setup and adopt our SDM pipeline, without transfer learning. d Multimodal imaging on a different setup, triggered by our AEGON model, enabling dynamic Brillouin microscopy of the aggregation process. Arrows mark the aggregating region (different colors only serve to optimize the contrast). Images are representative of experiments conducted more than three independent times. We then sought to assess whether it is possible to achieve similar accuracy with a one-plane, one-time-point fluorescence input, producing an AEGON model which is even simpler to use. Again, we found that one-plane inputs lead to high accuracy (86%) (Fig. This is the most generalizable and easy-to-use model, which only requires one image to perform the classification. The input is taken using a widefield fluorescence microscope, which is widely available in laboratories around the world. Next, to translate this to mechanical (Brillouin) imaging and to show the generalizability of our approach, we implemented it on a separate, custom-built BM setup (Methods), with an entirely different illumination, microscope objective, pixel size, and detector. This setup is capable of brightfield, fluorescence, and Brillouin microscopy. We developed a similar SDM pipeline as in our primary setup, described above, which enables the user to set the parameters for an initial scan and an optimized scan that is triggered when an event is found. Interestingly, we found that AEGON works directly on this different setup, without the need for transfer learning (Fig. 3c), as it was able to correctly predict events and non-events. Monitoring changes in the biomechanical properties throughout the process of protein aggregation has so far been challenging due to the limitations of the instruments that are used in these experiments. Although the emerging BM offers several advantages over standard techniques like AFM and OT, such as being noninvasive and label-free, one of its main limitations is its slow speed due to the weak Brillouin scattering cross-section that entails long data-acquisition times per image pixel. With a typical pixel dwell time of around 20–50 ms, one confocal-based BM acquisition can take several minutes to hours, depending on the chosen FOV and resolution. This is not a significant issue for fully formed, mature aggregates, which are relatively stable and can be identified using their fluorescence signal. However, the unpredictability of when and where soluble proteins will aggregate makes it extremely challenging to predict early aggregation events and target the right FOV at the right time. Our SDM pipeline overcomes this challenge and enables us to scan for potential events, only triggering BM when the AEGON model predicts the onset of aggregation. With this strategy, we are able to capture the aggregation process as it occurs with BM (Fig. We also capture the process with brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. We observe that the region where the aggregate is forming (marked in Fig. 3d) exhibits a higher Brillouin shift compared to the peripheral cytoplasm (the full signal in orange, excluding the background), in agreement with prior studies36. We also observe an increasing trend in the Brillouin shift of the aggregating region over time, suggesting an increased stiffness. A final Brillouin shift of 6.51 ± 0.04 GHz and a linewidth of 0.58 ± 0.06 GHz are measured for the aggregating region, versus a shift of 6.39 ± 0.05 GHz and a linewidth of 0.54 ± 0.06 GHz for the periphery. Our method demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, the ability to study the biomechanics of Httex1 aggregation as the process occurs, opening up various possibilities to understand and target different stages of protein aggregation. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation, within the respective region in the image, at each timepoint for the shown example. The previously described SDM approach is highly modular and dynamic, as not only can various parameters be set by the user for both the initial and optimized scans, but also the model that performs the classification can be simply chosen by the user. In our first use case, we showed the ability to capture the biomechanical properties of the process as it occurs. Next, we leveraged the flexible and modular nature of our method and extended our intelligent Brillouin microscope to solve another critical issue. Despite BM being a label-free method, fluorescence microscopy is typically needed to identify and localize the aggregates. This introduces unnecessary perturbations and phototoxicity to the sample44,45,46,47. To solve this issue, we extended our previous work where we developed CNN models for label-free identification of NDD-associated aggregates (LINA)48. We developed an image-classification LINA (IC-LINA) model, which takes a single brightfield image as input and determines the presence or absence of aggregates in the image. IC-LINA is 97% accurate on our test set (Supplementary Fig. We used this model within our SDM pipeline so that the microscope can autonomously identify—in real-time—locations in the sample where aggregates are located, without the need for fluorescence labeling. BM is then only triggered on FOVs where aggregates are identified. Figure 5 shows an example of the results of using our model on a label-free brightfield image, which was correctly classified as having an aggregate, as validated by checking the fluorescence signal as the ground truth, and the corresponding BM image. This real-time, correlative approach enables fully label-free and highly specific biomechanical studies of Httex1 aggregates. This also demonstrates how intelligent microscopy can be used to switch from completely label-free, low-light-dose methods like brightfield microscopy to less gentle techniques like BM and fluorescence microscopy. The IC-LINA model detects in real time the presence of aggregates solely from label-free brightfield images, eliminating the need for fluorescence imaging to localize aggregates. Here, the fluorescence image serves as a ground truth to validate aggregate presence. Autonomously-triggered Brillouin microscopy enables detailed biomechanical analysis at identified locations. Images are representative of experiments conducted more than three independent times. These results highlight the method's high generalizability and ease of use for researchers who want to use it in their own laboratory to study Httex1 aggregation. The method can also be extended to other proteins, whether by transfer learning and fine-tuning this model on a different system or training a new model from scratch using the same strategy and architecture. While this work focuses on applying SDM and intelligent BM to protein aggregation, the underlying strategy of real-time event detection and adaptive multimodal imaging is broadly applicable to a variety of dynamic cellular processes. For instance, many high-content screening assays rely on protein re-localization events—such as nuclear translocation of transcription factors, signaling molecules, or stress response proteins—as key readouts. Our SDM framework, which can be trained to detect subtle changes from single-plane fluorescence or brightfield images, could be adapted to identify such re-localization events, including nuclear accumulation, cytoplasmic clearance, or organelle-specific targeting. This would enable dynamic switching to higher-resolution or complementary modalities (e.g., super-resolution or label-free techniques), or optimizing other imaging settings such as the temporal resolution or the exposure time/laser power, at the right time and location, enhancing the informativeness of such assays while minimizing phototoxicity and enhancing throughput. We envision that retraining the model on datasets relevant to nuclear import/export, mitotic events, or phase transitions could allow for real-time monitoring of diverse biological phenomena across cell biology, developmental systems, or drug screening applications. We developed a method for self-driving microscopy that can detect the onset of protein aggregation and capture this unpredictable process in optimized spatiotemporal resolution, enabling the microscopist to precisely determine and distinguish the parameters for exploration and acquisition. Our DL-based AEGON model is 91% accurate at this challenging task and can differentiate between highly similar images of soluble proteins to decipher when aggregation will occur. We show the results of our autonomous, real-time approach, capturing the process with multiple modalities, including BM. The method is highly generalizable and can easily be adopted on other setups, as we showcased by developing a similar SDM pipeline and running the same model on a completely different setup, without requiring transfer learning. Furthermore, other models can be used to classify different kinds of events of interest. We demonstrate this by developing an image classification model, IC-LINA, that can identify aggregates from label-free, brightfield images and correlating them with BM in real time, solving a critical issue of relying on fluorescence to identify FOVs that contain aggregates. Our method also demonstrates the ability to switch modalities from a label-free technique, such as brightfield, instead of relying on a fluorescence-based technique, thereby better preserving the sample integrity. Identifying mature aggregates in a label-free manner and dynamically capturing their properties have remained unsolved challenges until now. We envisage great potential for our tools and their application to address these challenges and provide critical insights into the pathophysiological process underlying aggregation. Incorporating additional label-free techniques such as Raman microscopy—which has previously been correlated with BM49,50,51—to obtain real-time information regarding the biochemical and structural composition of aggregates and intelligently switching between the different techniques can open new avenues for self-driving, non-invasive microscopy. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid and continuous evolution, with new advancements and architectures emerging at an unprecedented pace. We assessed the performance of multiple deep learning architectures, specifically VGG16, VGG-LSTM, and ViT. Our results show that, while the different architectures all lead to good performance, our ViT models outperform those of the other two. ViT models leverage self-attention mechanisms that allow them to capture intricate relationships in the data more effectively than traditional CNNs. This capability appears to provide a significant advantage in predicting the onset of aggregation. BM provides insight into the high-frequency longitudinal modulus of biological materials and is therefore sensitive to their viscoelastic properties. Prior work has shown that Brillouin shifts increase in more solid-like structures, such as mature Httex1 aggregates, compared to the surrounding cytoplasm36. This has also been shown for biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), such as stress granules that are formed through the expression of FUS and the presence of oxidative stress35. Recent work uses BM as a measure for the average molecular interaction and finds that conditions that favor LLPS increase the Brillouin shift, linewidth, and protein concentration52. We expect that the stiffness of aggregating proteins will increase as they transition from liquid-like states to the solid-like mature-aggregate state, due to higher protein density and stronger intermolecular interactions that reduce mobility and increase mechanical rigidity. Our SDM-Brillouin framework is well suited for exploring a continuum of material states throughout the aggregation process, including transient, dynamic condensates, as it enables dynamic imaging throughout the process for the first time, and as shown here, we observe an increase in the Brillouin shift as the aggregate forms. Future work, which incorporates additional modalities, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), may allow for a more systematic correlation between internal dynamics and Brillouin mechanical signatures, thus enabling new insights into the phase behavior and maturation of aggregates in neurodegenerative disease models. Growing evidence suggests that the process of inclusion formation involves a complex interplay between misfolded protein aggregates, lipids, membranous organelles, and other subcellular constituents44,53. These include cytoskeletal proteins, which provide the structural framework that allows cells to maintain their shape, resist deformation, generate mechanical forces, and respond to mechanical stress, underscoring the importance of developing tools that are suitable for studying the biomechanics of this dynamic aggregation process. Mechanobiology has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of infectious diseases, cancer biology, developmental biology, and other fields. There is still tremendous potential in exploring this area of research further in the fields of protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, particularly with intelligent approaches that adapt in real time to optimally retrieve the mechanical properties. This could help us uncover new insight into the mechanisms by which the process of protein aggregation and inclusion formation alters the mechanical properties of cells, their physiological properties, and potentially disrupts their function. Changes in the mechanical properties of cells and protein aggregates could also influence rates or mechanisms of aggregate clearance. A better understanding of the relationship and functional consequences of protein-aggregation-dependent changes in mechanical properties of cells could pave the way for new experimental approaches, research directions, and therapeutic strategies. Our methods can enable a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that occur in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, IC-LINA can be used to detect aggregates without the need for labels, offering higher fidelity information for high-throughput screens that normally rely on fluorescent labeling. It could be used to test the effect of drug candidates or small molecules on the propensity of aggregation, including their size, morphology, and other properties, and viscoelasticity, if combined with other modalities like BM. Currently, there are limited tools that enable investigating the interactions between drug candidates and NDD-associated aggregating proteins in the early stages of aggregate formation, oligomerization. The aggregation onset prediction model, AEGON, can be used to automatically follow the process in multiple modalities with high spatiotemporal resolution and study the dynamic interactions between the aggregating protein and drug candidates or other proteins, organelles, or subcellular structures. SDM has exciting potential to impact the field of neurodegenerative diseases and other amyloid-associated diseases, enabling scientists to automate tedious tasks and focus on data analysis and interpretation, and to open up new possibilities for experiments that were impossible beforehand. Aside from leading to important contributions, SDM can be extended in the future to identify interesting events in an unsupervised manner to discover unknown biological phenomena and open up new avenues of research. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using DMEM high glucose without phenol red (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 4 mM L-glutamine (all three from Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were plated at a density of 120,000 per dish on FluoroDish Sterile Culture Dishes 35 mm, 23 mm well (World Precision Instruments), coated with fibronectin. Cells were transfected one day after plating using polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection. 2 µg of DNA is mixed in 100 µl of OptiMEM Reduced-Serum Medium (Life Technologies), 6 µl of PEI is mixed in 100 µl of OptiMEM, and then both mixtures are mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (RT), then added drop-wise and carefully distributed over the cells. Cells were then returned to the incubator and left there until imaging was initiated. For our standard imaging experiments, it was performed with a custom-built microscope equipped with a temperature and CO2 controlled incubator for live cell imaging, as described in previous work from our group43. Live-cell imaging was performed in DMEM without phenol red at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The microscope is controlled using custom LabVIEW software. For fluorescence imaging, a 120 mW, 488 nm laser (iBeam smart, Toptica), is focused into the back focal plane of an Olympus UPLSAPO 60XW 1.2 NA objective for wide-field epi-fluorescence illumination. The fluorescence light was filtered using a combination of a dichroic mirror (zt405/488/532/640/730rpc, Chroma) and an emission filter. For phase imaging, we used the white-light Koehler illumination module of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M microscope equipped with a halogen lamp to collect brightfield images, which are later processed into QPI images. The detection path is arranged as a sequence of four 2-f configurations to provide image–object space telecentricity. The image splitter placed behind the last lens directs the light into eight images, which are registered by two synchronized sCMOS cameras (ORCA Flash 4.0, Hamamatsu; back-projected pixel size of 111 nm). For translating the sample, the microscope is equipped with piezoLEGS stage (3-PT-60- F2,5/5) and Motion-Commander-Piezo controller (Nanos Instruments GmbH). We used custom MATLAB (Mathworks) scripts (available here) to retrieve the phase information from the brightfield images and produce quantitative phase images. These scripts are also used for pixel-registration in the 8 z-planes for both phase and fluorescence images. Python was used for data analysis and plotting. The BM setup is composed by a commercial Zeiss body (Axiovert 200 M) coupled with a custom-built two-stage VIPA spectrometer54, with the addition of a Lyot stop to increase the suppression of the elastically scattered light55. The laser used for Brillouin imaging has a wavelength of 660 nm (Torus 660, Coherent), and the power on the sample was kept below 7 mW. The exposure time for a single point was set to 100 ms. The LabVIEW software that controls the microscope was adjusted to interface with Python and run DL models in real time. To extract the Brillouin shift and linewidth of the aggregating regions and the periphery, we performed thresholding (Otsu's method) on the fluorescence, Brillouin shift, and Brillouin linewidth images to produce masks, which we then used to segment the corresponding regions. The shift and linewidth images are used to obtain the full region in which we have signal, without the background—and the aggregating region that is obtained from fluorescence masks is subtracted to obtain only the periphery region. The shift and linewidth images are used to obtain the full region in which we have signal, without the background—and the aggregating region that is obtained from fluorescence masks is subtracted to obtain only the periphery region. We have trained neural network models of different architectures, namely, VGG16-LSTM, ViViT, and their single-time-point counterparts (VGG16 and ViT). The full dataset consists of 71 events and 69 non-events. We used TensorFlow and Keras to build our models, and training was done on a workstation equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. We used the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a binary cross-entropy loss function. Before training our models, we normalize both the phase and fluorescence images by rescaling each image to be between 0 and 1. We used 15% of our dataset as the test set and split the rest of the dataset into training and validation sets, with 20% being used for validation. We used the “EarlyStopping” (on the validation loss) and “ModelCheckpoint” callbacks to avoid overfitting and to save the best, most general models. The time taken to train a successful model and for inference depends on the computing capabilities available to the user. On our machine with the RTX 3090, training a successful model can be done in a range of a few minutes, and the model can do the inference in 60 ms. We did not observe a noticeable difference in training or inference times between our different models. We customized our LabVIEW software (which will be made available upon publication) to develop our SDM pipeline. The graphical user interface (GUI) is shown in Supplementary Fig. Based on these predictions, the microscope autonomously adjusts imaging settings and launches an optimized scan. The software is highly modular, allowing users to configure a variety of parameters for both the initial and optimized scans, such as imaging modalities, exposure times, and laser powers. After the initial scan, images are given in real time as input to the model, which predicts whether aggregation is about to occur. There are two modes, one where a specific acquisition sequence (a patterned scan in both the x and y directions) is performed and all the images are passed to the model together at the end, and one where the images at each FOV are passed directly to the model. In the first mode, all FOVs are checked at the same time, and if there are any aggregation events predicted, they are added to a list, which is iterated over in the optimized scan. In the other mode, once an event is predicted, this directly initiates the optimized scan at that FOV, after which the initial scan continues to check the subsequent FOVs.

Source data are provided with this paper. The Python codes for training a model and using/testing a pre-trained model, along with the ViT models (with 1 plane and 8 planes inputs), are available on GitHub, and the software used for self-driving microscopy is available on Zenodo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 10 million people globally live with the life-threatening virus HTLV-1. But a landmark study co-led by Australian researchers could change this, after finding existing HIV drugs can suppress transmission of the HTLV-1 virus in mice. The research by WEHI and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute) also identifies a new drug target that could lead to the elimination of HTLV-1 positive cells from those with an established infection, and prevent disease progression. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a virus that infects the same cell type as HIV - T cells, a type of blood immune cell that helps the body fight off infections. A small proportion of people infected with HTLV-1 after a long duration of infection develop serious diseases, such as adult T-cell leukemia and spinal cord inflammation. "Our study marks the first time any research group has been able to suppress this virus in a living organism," Dr Doerflinger said. The team discovered both drugs could also powerfully suppress HTLV-1. "What's most exciting is that these antivirals are already in use for millions of HIV patients, meaning there's a direct path for the clinical translation of our findings," Dr Doerflinger said. And now we've shown that their use can very likely be extended to HTLV-1." In another remarkable finding, the team discovered that human cells containing HTLV-1 could be selectively killed when mice were treated with HIV drugs in combination with another therapy inhibiting a protein (MCL-1) known to help rogue cells stay alive. The team is now leveraging precision RNA therapies to develop new ways to target MCL-1 and establish combination treatments that can be clinically tested, which they believe could offer a promising curative strategy for HTLV-1. The development of the humanised mouse models central to this study at WEHI was spearheaded by first author Dr James Cooney and Professor Marc Pellegrini, study lead author, WEHI Honourary Fellow and Executive Director at Centenary Institute. Prof Pellegrini said the mouse models were not only critical in identifying potential therapeutic targets, but also allowed researchers to understand how different strains of the HTLV-1 virus can alter disease symptoms and outcomes. "It's long been hypothesized that differences in viral subtype may influence disease outcomes, but a lack of research into HTLV-1 has made it difficult for us to find the evidence needed to support this claim - until now. The human HTLV-1 samples needed to develop the mouse models were obtained through the front-line clinical work of Associate Professor Lloyd Einsiedel, a Clinician Scientist at the Doherty Institute and Infectious Diseases Physician, who has provided a clinical service to Central Australia for more than a decade and has dedicated his career to putting HTLV-1 on the map. The new findings show that both HTLV-1 strains cause disease in mice, with HTLV-1c showing more aggressive features. The identified drug therapies were found to be equally effective against both strains. Prof Purcell and Associate Prof Lloyd Einsiedel worked with the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organization (NACCHO) HTLV-1 committee and the Australian Department of Health over many years to advocate for guidance on HTLV-1 from the World Health Organization (WHO) that led to them formally classify the virus as a Threatening Pathogen to Humans in 2021. This resulted in the development of formal WHO policies to reduce transmission internationally and the development of clinical management guidelines for HTLV-1c in Central Australia under NACCHO leadership. "Despite Australia's high burden of HTLV-1, the virus and its associated diseases are still not notifiable in most states and true infection rates in the nation remain unknown," Prof Purcell said. "People at risk from HTLV-1 deserve biomedical tools like those that provide game-changing therapeutic and prevention options for other blood-borne persistent viral infections, such as HIV. Our research findings are a major leap forward in this." Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
