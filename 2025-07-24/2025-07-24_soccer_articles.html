                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City were eliminated from the Club World Cup after suffering a crushing defeat against Saudi club Al-Hilal in the Round of 16. The loss not only crushed Man City's only hope of lifting a trophy in the 2024/25 season but also added to Pep Guardiola's list of worries as Rodri picked up a knock during the match. With a new season approaching, the last thing Guardiola would be hoping for is a setback for their Ballon d'Or winner, and it appears there might be some good news on that front. They will conduct their first couple of weeks of preseason training at the City Football Academy, during which Guardiola and his coaching staff will help their players return to fitness. While Rodri's fate for the upcoming campaign is expected to come to light next week, Man City are set to play their only friendly game this preseason against Serie B side Palermo on August 10. Several reports have also suggested that Real Madrid are keen on acquiring Rodri's signature in the ongoing summer transfer window. Man City will have three weeks of training before they kick off the upcoming season with their opening Premier League clash against Wolves at Molineux Stadium on August 16.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you think about it, there really should be little surprise that it will be England and Spain who meet in the final of Euro 2025 on Sunday. It was almost inevitable that they would face each other once again. Two nations whose journeys seem intrinsically linked at this point; two nations whose rise has changed and disrupted the historic order of the women's game. They lifted their first major trophies within 12 months of each other – England in 2022, Spain in 2023 – and over the last three years, both have proved they have the squad and resources that could maintain this success for years to come, despite growth in the sport elsewhere. They dominated the midfield area and tactically outsmarted the Lionesses in Sydney, pouncing on their naivety pushing forward and being clinical when it mattered. When you dig into the stats, however, there was perhaps a little less between them than on first viewing. It was an illustration that, despite their different brands of football, there is little between them in the big moments. Neither are the same since they met that day in August 2023. Spanish football faced a reckoning in the wake of that final. That it took that incident to happen in front of the world before they were listened to remains a stain on RFEF. Under Montse Tomé, La Roja have developed their technical style of play even further. In Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas and Patri Guijarro, they possess three of the best midfielders in world football, all capable of unlocking defences. The return of Esther González, coming in as the starting No 9, has allowed them to add a directness to their play that they did not previously possess. England have undergone a transition of their own, a regeneration of sorts, with several young players securing permanent spots in the senior squad. While many of Sarina Wiegman's stalwarts from her four years at the helm remain – Leah Williamson, Georgia Stanway and Alessia Russo for example – new faces have come in and their strength in depth, particularly in creative areas, has continued to increase. Despite some inconsistent form, they have developed a more robust and adaptable style of play and, as seen so far this tournament, they can rely on the versatility of their players to come on and change a game. The 19-year-old received her first call up in April but has made her impact off the bench with three goals in four appearances. In their two meetings since August 2023, they have won one apiece. For England, February's win at Wembley in the Nations League will have filled them with confidence that they can find a gameplan to frustrate and beat Spain. La Roja's victory in June proved that they equally have the tools to come out on top.

EAST HARTFORD, CT — Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a leading provider of wireless audio solutions, proudly supported the U.S. Soccer Federation during the recent U.S. Men's National Team friendly against Türkiye. The match was held at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, CT.

As the governing body for Major League Soccer and all U.S. soccer programs, the U.S. Soccer Federation brought together a world-class production team for this high-profile event. PWS worked in close collaboration with the U.S. Soccer Event Production team and the Technical Director from Power Station Events to ensure seamless audio throughout the venue.





Broadcast live by TNT, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery Sports, the match demanded top-tier coordination behind the scenes. The PWS on-site team, B2B and Business Development Lead Joshua Lampf and Operations Coordinator Chris Budin, and a seasoned A1 engineer familiar with live sporting events, delivered reliable intercom and communication solutions tailored for the complex production space.









PWS deployed a strong and secure comms system featuring 15 Riedel Bolero beltpacks and eight antennas, including accessories along with Clear-Com headsets, ensuring crystal-clear communication across production zones.

“It was great collaborating with the U.S. Soccer Federation and Power Station Events for this match,” says Jim Van Winkle, General Manager of Professional Wireless Systems. “Live sports always present unique challenges, and we take pride in delivering reliable wireless solutions that keep the entire production team connected from kickoff to final whistle.”





PWS continues to support premier sporting events across the country with dependable wireless systems and expert technical staff, enabling sound execution in even the most demanding environments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's only been at Chelsea for what feels like a matter of minutes, yet João Pedro has slotted in seamlessly, not only becoming a key figure in their run to the Club World Cup trophy, but looking like he's been a Chelsea player all along, something that's rare for new arrivals at the club. After completing a £60 million move from Brighton, Pedro wasted no time heading to the United States for Chelsea's Club World Cup clash against Palmeiras. It was a swift return to action for Pedro, who had been on the beach just two weeks earlier before finding himself on the global stage. Coming on as a substitute on his debut, Pedro helped Chelsea to a 2-1 victory over Brazilian side Palmeiras, setting up a clash with his former club, Fluminense, which few predicted on Betway online sports betting. After the game, his manager Enzo Maresca said, We brought him in because this season we faced many teams with low blocks, and his quality is very good against these kinds of teams. Then came the final, against a Paris Saint-Germain side who had swept almost everyone aside over the last six months. They dominated the match, thanks to relentless high pressing from the front — no doubt influenced by João Pedro's tireless work rate, something Brighton had once benefited from and used to great effect. The energy and pressure from Chelsea caught PSG completely by surprise. Cole Palmer opened the scoring with two superb goals, and once again, Pedro stepped up to complete the performance. The Brazilian netted his third goal in just three matches for Chelsea, finishing off a brilliant move started by Palmer. A perfect start to life at Chelsea for the Brazilian. Chelsea will now have a short break before kicking off their next set of pre-season fixtures. They begin against Southern Premier League side Sholing, likely fielding a reserve or mixed squad, before facing Bayer Leverkusen in August, followed by AC Milan. They'll then open their Premier League campaign against Crystal Palace on Sunday, 17th August. No doubt, Pedro and his teammates will be licking their lips at the prospect of challenging for the Premier League title after their towering performance at the Club World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Euro 2025 comes to a close, all signs point to the tournament finally enjoying its breakout moment in the United States. It culminates on Sunday in a 2023 World Cup final rematch between England and Spain — an ideal clash for attracting an American audience. While the international break still has a few more days to go, there's enough data to assess what's worked, what hasn't and where the growth of women's soccer in America goes from here. There's never been any doubt that this country watches the U.S. women's national team. There's a massive difference, however, between casual and new fans tuning in for the USWNT during a World Cup and pulling in viewers for the Euros, or the Women's Africa Cup of Nations or Copa America Femenina, even with the presence of NWSL players at all three tournaments. Ahead of this summer of soccer, I wrote in the “Full Time” newsletter that these overlapping events — more so than a singular Women's World Cup — would reveal the true growth of women's soccer. Despite little promotion ahead of the tournament, Fox Sports bet big by putting most games on either the primary Fox channel or FS1, with only one match relegated to FS2. Fox, which said that they would air over 130 hours of live women's soccer coverage this summer between the Euros and Copa America Femenina, has supplemented their Euros coverage with a studio show featuring analysts and former players, including Carli Lloyd, Ari Hingst, Jen Beattie and others. Ahead of the Euros, Fox Sports president of insights and analytics Mike Mulvihill told Sports Business Journal that the network was targeting 50 percent growth for viewership. They've easily surpassed that number, averaging over 90 percent through the group stage with a 2025 average viewership of 306,000 compared to 2022's 161,000 viewers. France's 2-1 win over England provided the largest spike of the group stage, with 690,000 viewers, thanks to its placement on Fox and a favorable Saturday afternoon timeslot. The number one driver is increased accessibility, but Fox has gotten other calls right, too, even as their overall strategy for soccer remains disappointingly on brand. Fox has never gone for the banter the way CBS has leaned in on men's Champions League, but Hingst provided a blueprint that knowledge doesn't preclude fun behind a desk. Former Scotland international Beattie was a strong new addition to Fox's team, both at the desk and in the booth for color commentary alongside regular play-by-play analyst John Strong. Fox leaned not just on familiar voices but largely turned to established pairs for its match commentary. It did, at points, cause issues, but understandable ones. It also wouldn't be a Fox Soccer broadcast without the heavy rotation of former U.S. players participating. Lloyd, who was a divisive presence during the 2023 World Cup broadcast, especially in her approach to covering the USWNT, has settled in following a couple of major tournaments' worth of reps behind the desk. If Fox chose to rely solely on Lloyd for an American lens to these international tournaments, I'd find it a justifiable choice. A famous U.S. player helps bridge the gap to American fans, and using her own experience in major tournaments provides familiar reference points for the every-four-years World Cup viewer. Fox continues to stress these voices far too much, with the greatest example continuing to be former U.S. men's player Alexi Lalas. Lalas has always been the most divisive presence in Fox's coverage — the bombastic approach either works for you or it really, really doesn't. Every major tournament that Fox airs, I wonder what value Lalas adds to a broadcast to engage, entertain and inform new and returning viewers. Maybe there are still some women's soccer die-hards who still hate watching to see what Lalas will say next, but most social media commentary I see states time and time again that the existing women's soccer audience in this country is opting out of watching Fox's studio commentary. The majority of the former women's players serving Fox's studio analysts — including Lloyd — have largely balanced praising what's worked for teams and pointing out what hasn't, all with halftime or full-time film. Women's soccer has, however, long outgrown the need for Lalas to serve as the default Fox perspective, shouting for shouting's sake. He has not been ever-present in this tournament, but he regained a prominent role during the Italy-England semifinal (and, presumably, the final) when viewership will peak. I'd like to think that Fox evaluates itself after every major tournament, but with the viewership increases we've seen, I expect the same strategy will persist. At the same time, Fox has lost ground in the rapidly shifting landscape for women's soccer media rights to both traditional competition and new challengers. CBS has been aggressive in signing deals with Concacaf, and most recently, picking up the rights to the women's Champions League to live alongside its men's coverage. But so is robust, thoughtful commentary and analysis from the media rights holder. She continues to write columns and features around women's soccer, as well as host Full Time and contribute to the free weekly women's soccer newsletter, but also works to deliver a big-picture, conceptual vision for women's sports coverage across The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He is emerging as a top young player in Major League Soccer. The 2025 season of Major League Soccer is already over halfway elapsed, with the domestic competition seeing a few young players break through with their respective clubs. Some of these emerging talents will also make their way up the international ladder and eventually contribute to the United States Men's National Team. The 18-year-old Real Salt Lake attacker is earning crucial playing time at a key development juncture and could enjoy exponential growth. Born in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City, Utah, Gozo competed with Comba FC, Avalanche, and La Roca FC at the youth level. He then joined the Real Salt Lake academy in 2021, racking up goals and displaying a high level of speed. “When I first started soccer, my mom said I was way better than everyone else, so she moved me up an age group,” Gozo shared with Goal. In December of 2022, Gozo signed a professional deal with the club's reserves, Real Monarchs, having “proven to be an all-around athletic talent with an exceptional eye for goal and an insatiable hunger to succeed.” During the ensuing season, he featured in 10 matches in MLS Next Pro, scored his first goal in a loss to San Jose Earthquakes II, and was selected for the MLS Next All-Star Game; however, a snapped fibula kept him off the field for three months. His first-team debut came in October, a six-minute substitute appearance in a 2-2 draw with LA Galaxy. After training with RB Salzburg over the winter, Gozo signed a first-team contract with Real Salt Lake through 2027 (with extensions for 2028 and 2029) before making 16 appearances with the reserves and contributing five goals and one assist, including a brace against Minnesota United FC 2. He also featured with the senior squad in the fourth round of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, registering an assist in a 4-2 loss to New Mexico United, and played 11 minutes in a 5-1 romp over Austin FC in MLS play. Additionally, The Guardian named him to the Next Generation list of “best young talents in world football.” This year, on the heels of a strong preseason, Gozo featured in both first-round legs of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, which resulted in a defeat on aggregate to Herediano (1-2 [0-0, 1-2]). After a match with the reserves, he received a chance in MLS play and quickly ascended to a starting role, compiling 18 appearances and registering goals against the Vancouver Whitecaps and D.C. United; his first finish came by “instinctively running onto a splitting through ball from Diego Luna and cutting inside of an opposing defender,” while the second was a calm conversion following a shrewd read of the offside trap that saw him with acres of free space on the breakaway. His performances have begun to draw transfer interest, with Belgian side KRC Genk reportedly “setting sights” on him. “I think Gozo is doing all the right things,” said Real Salt Lake manager Pablo Mastroeni. He's putting himself in great positions and doing all the right things. He's been with us in preseason for the last three years.” He began featuring with the former program in the Under-15 age group and competed in several subsequent squads, making five appearances and contributing a goal and two assists on the way to a second-place finish at the 2024 CONCACAF U-20 Championship. His most recent call-up was with the Under-20 team in June, featuring in friendlies against Norway and Colombia; however, continued professional success may keep him off the roster for this fall's U-20 World Cup. Standing at five foot eleven, Gozo is a versatile attacker who can line up at right winger, striker, and attacking midfielder, earning praise for his “shiftiness with the ball and hard work,” thriving in a high press. He is very active on defense with regular tackles, interceptions, and shot blocks and relishes testing opponents in the one-on-one. “He's got that kind of graceful running where he glides past defenders,” said his head coach at Real Monarchs, Mark Lowry. Gozo is already several years into his professional career, carrying a certain level of experience that has enabled him to become a regular fixture in the lineup this season. More than just looking the part and fitting into the squad, he is making a contribution to the scoreline and producing in MLS, which is a feat unmatched by many in his age cohort. There is plenty of time for his development, but each successive finish will push him closer to a potential transfer abroad or USMNT call-up, as the next generation of talent is on the approaching horizon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump was seen putting one of the medals inside his pocket Chelsea's 2025 Club World Cup celebrations in the United States have taken on an amusing twist after a video emerged showing US President Donald Trump putting Noni Madueke's winners' medal in his pocket during the trophy ceremony. The moment came after Chelsea's convincing 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final, which sealed their second Club World Cup title. Trump, who was invited to present the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James, stayed on the podium to congratulate the players and hand out medals, but with Madueke having left the squad early, there was one medal left over. Chelsea defender, Marc Cucurella, couldn't resist poking fun at the situation during a question and answer session at his football academy in Spain. “I think he missed a good opportunity. He wasn't starting, but with everything about his transfer, he could have delayed it a day or two, it wouldn't have cost him anything,” he said. He then joked about Trump's unexpected souvenir: “He [Trump] put it in his pocket. Meanwhile, watch as football fans question FIFA's move to scrap penalty rebound rule</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a typical summer, Dallas-Fort Worth boasts average hotel occupancy rates around 63%. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “The good news is that the D-FW region has over 1,200 hotels with over 140,000 hotel rooms, not counting short-term rentals” said Craig Davis, president and CEO of Visit Dallas, the city's tourism promotion agency. “So, in terms of capacity, we're not worried at all.” That's also expected to create a surge in demand for downtown hotels. During a normal year, Dallas-Fort Worth accounts for around 30% of all lodging revenues in the state, said Paul Vaughn, director of data operations at Source Strategies, a hospitality industry data firm. He noted the industry's post-pandemic recovery has fared considerably better than other major Texas markets including San Antonio and Austin. “Even with that, their occupancies will be pretty high. You can expect hotels around the venue to sell out completely.” Because there are few choices for lodging around AT&T Stadium in Arlington, where the nine matches slated for North Texas will be played, Vaughn expects high hotel occupancy rates in a wide radius around the venue — and even those will be charging higher rates. “There are many international and domestic travelers who want to see their team, so surge pricing will be unavoidable,” said Sam Tucker, area director of sales and marketing with the Adolphus, a luxury hotel downtown. “It'll come down to supply and demand, but I think that's why Dallas was chosen. Between Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, we've got a lot of lodging,” Tucker explained. Supply will be further constrained by FIFA itself, which is coordinating large-scale hotel room blockings across the area for teams participating in the tournament, as well as other stakeholders involved in the event. “If anything in a customer's RFP mentions the World Cup, I have a kind of boilerplate e-mail I send them that says ‘I'm happy to entertain your request and talk to you about this, but let me tell you this up front: you need to be approved by FIFA to be in the building,” said Luke Hopkins, director of sales at the Adolphus. Tucker advised attendees to have multiple lodging options available. Be open to multiple different ways that you want to travel and not be disappointed when something is not available,” he said. Short-term rentals are also available to prevent demand from overwhelming Dallas' hospitality market. An Airbnb spokesperson pointed to a Deloitte study, which predicted hosts on the platform were anticipating around 42,000 guests during the World Cup. Dallas is also expected to generate an additional $502 million in GDP as a result of travel associated with visitors booking their lodging through Airbnb. Deloitte's study estimated $4,000 in supplemental income earned per stay by local Airbnb hosts in and around Dallas during the tournament. “There is capacity for short-term rentals to take some of that pressure during the event,” Vaughn said. “Visitors will be hitting alternative lodging like Airbnb and Vrbo. It's very lucrative for that short period of time. Homeowners say ‘I'll put up with this for a month, but it'll make decent money. Lisa Sievers is a local Airbnb host with two properties on the platform and a board member on the Dallas Short Term Rental Alliance. “For the FIFA World Cup, the beauty of using short-term rentals is it gives local folks a chance to welcome people into their homes and provides a location for people to stay,” Sievers said. She explained that as the event draws near, it will be easier for more residents to operate their homes as short-term rentals than it would be to build new hotels, for instance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football Australia has threatened to take clutch World Cup and Asian Cup qualifiers away from Sydney's Allianz Stadium due to concerns with the surface and congested schedule at the $828 million venue. Diego Maradona (right) and Socceroos captain Paul Wade walk onto the Sydney Football Stadium for the first leg of a World Cup qualifying tie in 1993.Credit: Getty Formerly known as the Sydney Football Stadium, Allianz has a long history of hosting major Socceroos and Matildas matches, among them the World Cup qualifier against Argentina in 1993 when Diego Maradona led the South American team to a first-leg draw before Australian hearts were broken in Buenos Aires. But FA warned in an email after the Socceroos' World Cup Asian group stage qualifying game against Indonesia in March that its men's and women's national teams may abandon the 42,500-capacity ground if it could not be closed off in the two weeks before their matches. “Moving forward, Football Australia would be hesitant to book Allianz Stadium for high-stakes international fixtures unless greater assurance is provided around pitch protection, turf preparation windows, and warm-up zone quality,” FA chief corporate affairs officer Peter Filopoulos wrote to Venues NSW general manager for event acquisition Stephen Saunders on March 26. Filopoulos said players had reported the Allianz surface was “the worst pitch they've played on in some time”, describing it as well below international standard. FA chief executive James Johnson, who has since left the role, followed up with an email to Venues NSW chief Kerrie Mather on April 17, saying the conditions hadn't improved when the Matildas played at Allianz Stadium on April 4 and football authorities had “significant concerns”. Johnson told Mather the goal conceded by the Socceroos against Indonesia was “directly influenced by an uneven bounce, undermining the integrity of play”, while also reporting safety concerns from players' slippage, an “unacceptable” strip of ready-to-play turf in a goalmouth, and below-standard warm-up areas. Blaming excessive pre-match traffic from rugby league, rugby union, as well as the A-League and Asian Champions League soccer, he called for a minimum window of 10 to 14 days in which there would be no training or games at Allianz Stadium before international soccer fixtures. Mather disputed the scathing assessment of the surface, telling Johnson it had been rated as good to excellent by Venues NSW and FA's independent turf consultants and rated as safe for play by FA pre-match inspections. Sydney FC line up against the touring Wrexham AFC at a packed Allianz Stadium last week.Credit: Getty Images Mather said Venues NSW did its best to manage the use of the stadium by multiple codes and to lessen the load where it could but could not commit to keeping Allianz Stadium free of games and training for so long before Socceroos and Matildas matches. “Given the lateness and inconsistency from year to year in international football scheduling relative to other codes, it is not possible for Venues NSW to provide the pitch protection windows football may be seeking,” she wrote. A review of the drainage system at Allianz Stadium is soon due to be handed to the Venues NSW board and NSW Sports Minister Steve Kamper. “We have been clear the quality wasn't good enough which is why we directed Venues NSW to launch an independent review,” said a spokesperson for Kamper. “We will continue to work collaboratively with Football Australia. “Football Australia has a positive and constructive relationship with Venues NSW, Destination NSW and the NSW government and our confidence in them to deliver world-class conditions is demonstrated by our recent discussions with them to bring additional content to NSW before the end of the year,” FA interim CEO Heather Garriock said. Soccer would be the sport most impacted by the closure, with Sydney FC facing being locked out of their home ground until next year.</p>
