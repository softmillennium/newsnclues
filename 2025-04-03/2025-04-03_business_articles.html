                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower The Pentagon's internal watchdog opened an investigation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for using the Signal messaging app to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen in March with other senior Trump administration officials. The probe will determine to what extent Hegseth and other Defense Department staff complied with existing rules over the "use of a commercial messaging application for official business," the department's Office of Inspector General said in a memo Thursday. "Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements," acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins told Hegseth in the memo. The Signal group chat where Hegseth discussed strikes on Houthi targets included Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Hegseth's texts were revealed in a bombshell report last week by The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who Waltz inadvertently added to the group chat. The Defense Department declined to comment on Stebbins' investigation, citing longstanding policy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Waltz was at an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, where the far-right activist Laura Loomer pressed the president to fire some of his national security aides, NBC News reported. Trump fired six members of his National Security Council after that meeting, The New York Times reported Thursday. Stebbins became the Pentagon's acting watchdog after Trump fired Inspector General Robert Storch in January. Stebbins was previously appointed principal deputy inspector general in April 2023, under President Joe Biden. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon has rosy projections for its Rufus AI shopping assistant. According to an internal planning document obtained by Business Insider, Amazon expects Rufus to indirectly contribute over $700 million in operating profits this year. The outlook is part of a metric called "downstream impact," an internal financial figure Amazon uses to measure a product or service's potential to generate additional consumer spending across Amazon's vast offerings. For example, Rufus' product recommendations can lead to more purchases on Amazon's marketplace — and an increase in its DSI. Rufus, a free service that answers everything from product details to special promotions, generates no direct revenue. Based on this metric, Rufus lost an estimated $285 million in 2024. By 2027, however, it is expected to reach $1.2 billion in DSI profit contributions, the document showed. The estimates, after operating costs and server payments, include the income from ads placed within Rufus' responses to user inquiries. The bullish forecast may explain why Amazon is aggressively expanding Rufus and its other AI search offerings. Amazon's leadership previously told employees that such AI projects are "absolute" top priorities. Just last week, Amazon unveiled another AI-powered shopping discovery app called Interests. It also shows how Amazon justifies its investment in one of its flagship AI products, even as DSI has received more scrutiny lately. To be sure, Rufus's DSI forecast is small for Amazon, given the company's $68.6 billion in total operating income last year. But early results indicate Rufus has huge potential with more room to grow. The document said initial results showed customers using Rufus had a "positive lift on downstream spending," and the impact only increased with more engagement. This year, Amazon expects $711.7 billion worth of products on its site to be eligible for Rufus's many features, like product recommendations and comparisons, up from $164 billion in 2024, according to the document. The increased model parameters to Shopping LLM were also factored into DSI, but it is unclear when this will be implemented. With the planned improvement, Amazon hopes to launch a new service that leverages Rufus to provide a wider selection and "seamlessly purchase on behalf of the customer," it added. In recent weeks, some Amazon sellers who used the Rufus app discovered an update that auto-pops up Rufus when they use trigger phrases like "how to" or "what is" in the search bar. For some products, Rufus automatically launched with its own response before search results showed up. Amazon also started testing ad placements within Rufus's responses, Adweek reported in September. Amazon isn't the only retailer with a homegrown AI shopping assistant. Others, like Walmart, Target, and Instacart, have launched their own AI-powered search apps in recent months. A recent survey by e-commerce analytics firm Profitero showed that just 10% of US customers used a retailer's AI chat assistant when searching for products. By comparison, 37% of shoppers used the search bar on the retailer's websites or apps, and 29% used promotion and deal pages. Andrew Hamada, a former Amazon employee who now runs seller agency Reason Automation, wrote on Linkedin last month that Rufus misses basic catalog information and often gives inaccurate answers. For instance, it was never clear whether Prime Video or Amazon's shipping team should claim more DSI for the Prime membership revenue, which offers both services as a perk, one of the people said. Recently, Amazon has been deemphasizing Alexa's DSI metric, the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Still, Amazon's retail CEO Doug Herrington remains a strong supporter of Rufus. During an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, Herrington said AI-driven "personalization" is a major focus area for Amazon, mentioning Rufus and other search features as examples.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Small-cap stocks, which were once thought to be primary beneficiaries of President Donald Trump's policies, entered bear market territory on Thursday after a massive stock market rout that followed the administration's sweeping and aggressive tariff rollout. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both in correction territory, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is just below that mark. That's going to hurt profits," Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, told CNBC. "On the other side, they're still paying high levels of interest payments on debt because they have more of this floating-rate debt." "They're getting squeezed on both sides," he said. This is a sharp reversal from the gains seen in the trading days following November's election, with small caps viewed as beneficiaries from deregulation, lower tax rates and even tariffs since the group has fewer multinationals than large cap stocks. Along with that, it became one of the hottest Trump trades. In fact, Tom Lee – managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat – said at that time that small caps could outperform by more than 100% over the next couple of years. But the Russell 2000 was dragged lower Thursday in names like Victoria's Secret and Urban Outfitters, which source a lot of products from other countries and could see significantly higher costs and lower margins from the tariffs. And the group is particularly sensitive to economic shifts given their small size, and therefore less financial flexibility as large-cap stocks. JPMorgan predicted that if Trump's sweeping new reciprocal tariffs remain, the U.S. economy will likely fall into a recession. The Russell 2000 previously neared bear market territory in March amid a monthlong market sell-off spurred by uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs plans and growing concern on the Street of a slowing economy. "Small caps, in the first half of an economic recession, are usually down 13%, so it's already worse than where we were for the average recession," said Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist covering small- and mid-cap companies at Jefferies, in an interview with CNBC. "For the average bear market, small caps are down 26%, so we're nearing that number." While small caps are in turmoil right now, DeSanctis believes the group could eventually find a bottom, especially if the Federal Reserve starts lowering interest rates again. Traders are currently pricing in a 58.5% chance of four quarter-percentage-point cuts by year-end 2025, with more than 90% odds of the next cut being at the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. That's usually good for small caps," the equity strategist said. From there, he anticipates that some of the concerns surrounding tariffs – which could raise input costs for businesses – may be resolved, prompting the market to focus on deregulation once again. He noted that in addition to deregulation, a greater focus on tax cut extensions and a return of animal spirits leading to a pickup in mergers and acquisitions should provide an opportunity for small caps to do well later in the year, or whenever investors feel that the worst of the economic outlook is behind them. What's more, because things "don't move in a straight line," it "wouldn't be surprising" for small caps as well as large caps to soon see an "oversold bounce," Lerner said. The S&P 500 is still a considerable distance away from a bear market, being more than 11% off its Feb. 19 high in correction territory. It's been going on for several months," the co-CIO said. Our base case for large caps is you may see further downside, but we're not calling for a bear market." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retail traders online are in full-blown panic mode over the trade war. Everyday investors took to social media on Thursday to commiserate over the impact of the president's latest tariffs, which tanked stocks on Thursday. Bond yields also sank as investors flocked towards safe-haven assets, with the 10-year US Treasury yield declining as much as 18 basis points to its lowest level since October. Individual investors were caught off guard by the sweeping nature of the latest duties, which included a base 10% tariff on all US imports, with tariffs on goods from China rising to 54%. "You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out," one user on r/WallStreetBets, the popular retail trading subreddit that exploded in popularity during the pandemic, wrote on Wednesday. Other users lamented large losses in their portfolios since the market began to slide late Wednesday. One user said he was "officially bankrupt" after purchasing calls on Nike prior to the tariffs announcement. Nike stock dropped 12% by mid-day Thursday as multinational brands with global supply chains were particularly hard hit. "I'm never going to buy options again, all my gains and now I wasted 5 years of savings," the user said. Retail trader sentiment has soured since Trump's second term began. While markets initially rejoiced at Trump's return to the White House, reality quickly set in as he pursued a much wider trade war than initially expected. In recent months, excitement about the president's pro-growth measures has been crushed by trade war fears and the potential impact on inflation and economic growth. One Reddit user speculated that the damage to stocks could run on and potentially create a bear market, which is defined by stocks falling 20% from their peak. I think there will be consequences," the user said, speculating that high inflation and job losses could lead to a "relatively long" down period for stocks. "The process of negotiating with dozens and dozens of countries simply won't happen fast. "I have a feeling this might be one of the biggest bear traps ever tomorrow and a lot of people are going to get liquidated to hell," another user said, speculating that the decline in stocks could be on par with what was seen during the 2008 recession.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turns out a pretty simple formula was used to calculate President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The approach has led to some eyebrow-raising rates. The French territory Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which has a population of around 5,000 people, was slapped with a 50% tariff. A number of countries, like the UK, Singapore, and Brazil, were hit with a base tariff rate of 10%. Israel, which scrapped all tariffs on American goods, was hit with a 17% levy. "The tariff calculation approach arguably makes for a more free-wheeling and open-ended nature to potential trade negotiations in coming months," George Saravelos, the head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. "It seems there are no specific and identifiable policy asks per se but ultimately a desire to reduce bilateral trade imbalances," he added. Others shared more pointed criticism of the approach. Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus at the NYU Stern School of Business, wrote in a post on X that the formula used is "totally flawed" because it assumes that a fair trade balance has to be equal to zero. "By that standard since the US runs a trade surplus in services other countries should impose a large services reciprocal tariffs against the US to balance that trade too!" Peter Schiff, the chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said in a post on X that the tariffs are based on "a bogus formula that attributes any nation's trade surplus to tariffs, even if tariffs are low or nonexistent." "Running bilateral trade surplus/deficits with different countries is the way it should be," Olivier Blanchard, Robert M. Solow professor of economics emeritus at MIT, wrote in an X post. "Trying to eliminate each one is simply stupid." "I have a trade deficit with my grocer, a trade surplus with my employer. I am not sure it would be a great idea for me to work for my grocer," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Then, the military gave us three weeks to find a home, pack up our lives, and relocate to Destin for his job. Moving away from the familiarities of the Midwest was scary, but we've learned to love our slow-paced life in Destin. Although Destin isn't huge, it's growing — and our county has a population of about 200,000 people. After we moved to Destin, I was surprised by the abundance of big-city amenities right at my doorstep. These lively spots often host weekly farmers' markets, annual festivals, and holiday events throughout the year. The Destin area is also filled with restaurants, coffee shops, and lively beach bars. My husband and I love getting to enjoy the sunset with a happy-hour cocktail in hand. While its town of Seaside has a relaxed beach vibe with pastel-colored homes and white-picket fences, nearby Rosemary Beach features a European-inspired design and cobblestone streets. Having 30A just a short drive away has been one of the best parts of living in Destin — especially in the offseason. It's now one of my favorite areas to visit. Living in a city where others vacation was an entirely new experience for us. Our first visit to 30A was anything but smooth, as we waited for hours in summer traffic and circled endlessly for a parking spot. During our first Labor Day weekend as Floridians, we were naively surprised by the sheer number of boaters at our iconic Crab Island sandbar. After that, we quickly learned to make the most of Destin's offseason. Late spring through early fall is packed with tourists, but the winter season is slower, with only a few flocks of snowbirds. Most vacationers choose Orlando or Miami in the winter for sunny beach days. Meanwhile, our offseason is relatively calm due to cooler weather. This quieter time allows us to try popular restaurants and visit attractions that are often overtaken by tourists in the summer. Having a strong sense of community is incredibly important to us, especially since my husband is a military pilot who travels often for work. Fortunately, there's no shortage of Southern hospitality on the Emerald Coast. Despite our thick Midwestern accents, locals have made us feel right at home. While moving into our house, multiple neighbors greeted us with homemade goodies. I'm not sure where the military will take us next, but we hope to stick around Destin for a while. As a travel enthusiast, I've visited some of the world's best beaches in Croatia, Thailand, Hawaii, Greece, and the Caribbean. Even still, Destin's sugar-white sand and emerald waters surpass them all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadians aren't the only people losing their appetite for a stateside vacation. Forward bookings for Europeans visiting the US this summer have fallen by a quarter, Accor CEO Sébastien Bazin told Bloomberg on Tuesday. One of the world's biggest hospitality companies, Accor operates more than 5,000 hotels, with brands including luxury options like Fairmont and Raffles to cheaper ones like Ibis. His comments come a week after data showed plummeting airline bookings for Canadians flying to the US. Compared to last year, travel data firm OAG reported a 70% fall in bookings for every month through September — although Air Canada and WestJet said their declines weren't quite so stark. Cirium, an aviation analytics firm, reported a 23% fall in bookings for April. For now, at least, transatlantic air routes haven't experienced the same drop. The corridor is a vital source of income for European airlines, and CEOs are staying alert. Globalization is changing," Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr told the Airlines for Europe Summit last week, in comments reported by Skift. They sparked a retaliatory "Buy Canadian" movement, with some American-made products, like liquor, removed from the shelves. Last Thursday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada's old relationship with the US, "based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over." It's highly unlikely to stay that way for long since Trump announced tariffs on Wednesday — charging the European Union with a higher rate of 20%. Even travelers who aren't put off by American isolationism may still be wary of harsher border security. For example, France's higher education minister told Agence France-Presse that a scientist had been denied entry to the US after he was found to have sent texts criticizing Trump. "Aviation is part of the globalization that we've seen growing in the last decades," Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told a company summit in Toulouse last month. With hotel bookings already falling ahead of a looming trade war, transatlantic travel could be next to sink.</p>

Middle Eastern firms that rode the region's boom in initial public offerings to only fall short of their lofty earnings targets are beginning to pay the price.

In what has been a hotbed for IPOs in recent years, the region is seeing a growing number of high-profile listings stumble in early trading as investors push back at sky-high valuations. That unease is now spilling over to earnings misses, adding to market jitters.</p>

Before the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets. Today we look at:

Good morning, this is Savio Shetty, an equities reporter in Mumbai. Traders face a sea of red across Asian equities this morning following US President Donald Trump's announcement of a minimum 10% tariff on all US imports and additional duties for major trading partners. Investors are assessing the impact of the tariffs, which include a 26% levy on India, slightly higher than rates imposed on the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical shares may attract attention, having won a reprieve for now.</p>
