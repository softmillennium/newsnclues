 Bitcoin's pre-reciprocal US tariff gains evaporated as the S&P 500 prints intra-day losses not seen since the height of the COVID-19 sell-off in mid-2020. 

Bitcoin (BTC) hit new monthly lows at the April 3 Wall Street open as US unemployment data added to pressure on risk assets.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed the first trip below $82,000 for BTC/USD since the start of the month.

After initially surging as high as $88,580 as the US government unveiled reciprocal trade tariffs, Bitcoin soon ran out of steam as the reality of the stronger-than-expected measures hit home.

US stocks then followed, with the S&P 500 down over 4% on the day at the time of writing.

“Today's -3.7% drop puts the S&P 500 on track for its largest daily decline since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X.

Thereafter, US initial jobless claims came in below estimates, at 219,000 versus the anticipated 228,000, per data from the US Department of Labor (DoL).

“The previous week's level was revised up by 1,000 from 224,000 to 225,000. The 4-week moving average was 223,000, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week's revised average. The previous week's average was revised up by 250 from 224,000 to 224,250,” an official press release stated.

Stronger labor market trends are traditionally associated with weaker risk-asset performance as they imply that policymakers can keep financial conditions tighter for longer.

Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool nonetheless continued to see markets favor an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

“As recession odds rise, markets think that the Fed will be forced to cut rates as soon as next month,” Kobeissi added.

BTC price action predictably continued to disappoint on short timeframes as $80,000 support became uncomfortably close.

“Stair step up then elevator down,” popular trader Roman summarized in part of his latest X analysis.

Market commentator Byzantine General flagged short positions increasing across major crypto pairs, concluding that tariffs would ensure that lackluster conditions would continue.

“I could see a stop hunt below the local lows before a pump to squeeze shorts, then probably more chop that slopes downward,” he told X followers.

Onchain analytics firm Glassnode had more bad news. According to their data, Bitcoin printed a new “death cross” involving the convergence of two midterm moving averages (MAs).

“An onchain analogue to the Death Cross has emerged. The 30-day volume-weighted price of $BTC has crossed below the 180-day, signaling weakening momentum,” an X post announced.

Earlier this week, Glassnode observed that speculative sell-offs in recent months have fallen considerably short of volumes traditionally associated with blow-off BTC price tops.

Web2 marketers have long had tricks to track down and "acquire" (in ad speak) likely customers. But Web3? Not so much, says ad-tech exec Asaf Nadler.

His company Addressable, is out with a new service that Nadler, the chief operating officer, claims will improve the efficacy of Web3 marketing — from the perspective of salespeople, of course. It's all about "retargeting" the most valuable potential customers: people who very nearly pressed buy, trade, sell, swap, join, but didn't.

Finding those folks in Web2 is straightforward given the troves of personal data scattered online. Crypto's trickier because wallets are pseudonymous. The company's database "bridges the gap," he said, and lets companies target their most likely customers.

Such precision could be especially important if crypto's bear market deepens into a blowout that pushes new users away. Economic malaise increases what traditional marketers call the "cost per acquisition" and what Addressable terms the "cost per wallet."

"Especially in a bear market people aren't as hyped about user acquisition," said Nadler, "But what founders care about is letting the community know they still care and reactivate them."

Addressable isn't building a doxxing service, says Nadler. While it might know on the backend that John Doe owns wallet abc123, it's not passing that information to the client, say, CoinDEX. Instead its product lets CoinDEX target John Doe with ads so that wallet abc123 becomes a paying customer.

Building the inference is Addressable's specialty, he said. The company trawls social media posts for intel that it can cross-check with wallets. Perhaps wallet abc123 interacted with protocols that John Doe follows on X. Or it's made trades that John Doe discussed on Reddit. All these clues can be enough to reverse-engineer a targetable identity.

The resulting ad-tech playbook is less an only-in-crypto innovation than a recreation of online marketer's existing capabilities with special twists for the on-chain economy. Companies' Web3 funnels are already incredibly narrow, Nadler said, because potential customers are uniquely difficult to target.

"Rather than pay KOLs, or do very broad activities, what we allow is companies to target only the users that have engaged with you," he said. KOLs are key opinion leaders, social media influencers who promote projects to their followers.

While Addressable has been around for three years, the retargeting service is new, Nadler said. He said he believes it will be a difference-maker for protocols seeking stickier customers.

"The most horrible thing that can happen to DeFi projects at the moment is if users stop believing in them," he said, pointing to targeted advertising as the solution.

 Contributor. 

With both Circle and OpenAI making two groundbreaking financial announcements this week, shockwaves have been sent through both the tech and finance worlds.

Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, announced plans to go public, signaling blockchain's significant step toward mainstream financial acceptance. USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is fully backed by U.S. dollars. USDC is backed 100% by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets and is redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. It ranks consistently among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Simultaneously, OpenAI, the pioneering force behind ChatGPT, secured an unprecedented $40 billion investment, underscoring artificial intelligence's rapid evolution from futuristic concept to essential economic driver. On the surface, these two developments might seem unrelated, but collectively, they illuminate a powerful convergence between blockchain and AI—one that could reshape our economic future dramatically.

Circle's decision to pursue an IPO is not merely another tech company entering public markets—it's a critical endorsement of blockchain technology by major financial institutions. With heavyweight backers such as JPMorgan and Citi, Circle's public listing represents a major validation from the traditional financial system. It provides mainstream investors a credible entry point into blockchain-driven financial services, potentially setting a standard for other Web3 companies aiming to bridge the gap to conventional financial markets.

Stablecoins, specifically Circle's USDC, offer the predictability traditional investors crave, serving as a digital equivalent to the dollar. By making blockchain accessible, Circle's IPO could be the tipping point for broader adoption. This move isn't just strategic; it positions blockchain firmly within the realm of regulated finance, opening doors for greater transparency and acceptance by skeptical institutional investors.

Parallel to Circle's announcement, OpenAI made history by raising a record-setting $40 billion in private funding, underscoring AI's leap from specialized tech niche to dominant economic force. Investors have now explicitly recognized AI as the cornerstone of the future economy. Such a substantial investment speaks volumes, not only about OpenAI's pioneering role but also about market confidence in AI's potential to revolutionize industries globally.

This $40 billion investment dwarfs prior tech fundraising rounds and reflects a fundamental shift in market dynamics. AI is now seen as essential infrastructure—akin to electricity or the internet—that will reshape business, communications, finance, healthcare, and more. OpenAI, already celebrated for groundbreaking AI models like ChatGPT, now commands the resources to shape global AI innovation decisively.

Individually transformative, Circle and OpenAI together highlight a significant emerging trend: the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. This convergence creates new possibilities, amplifying each technology's strengths while compensating for their respective weaknesses.

Blockchain excels in ensuring transparency, security, and immutability, making it ideal for sectors demanding trustworthy data management. AI, on the other hand, thrives on vast datasets and computational intelligence, capable of rapidly extracting actionable insights from mountains of information. Together, blockchain and AI can foster revolutionary solutions, including intelligent digital identities, AI-driven decentralized financial (DeFi) compliance systems, predictive market analytics, and secure management of sensitive AI-generated data.

Imagine a financial system where intelligent blockchain algorithms automatically ensure regulatory compliance, reduce fraud, and simplify complex financial transactions seamlessly. Or consider healthcare systems leveraging blockchain-secured patient data, analyzed by AI to deliver personalized medical treatments. These scenarios demonstrate just the tip of the iceberg in potential AI-blockchain innovations.

At the core of this AI-blockchain convergence is an economy defined by two powerful ideals: digital trust and autonomous intelligence. Circle represents the future of digital trust—ensuring transactions, currencies, and digital assets are transparent and secure. OpenAI represents intelligence-driven automation and innovation, providing tools and platforms that enable unprecedented efficiency and innovation.

The combination of these elements could create an entirely new economic paradigm. It's an economy where decisions become faster and smarter, bolstered by intelligent automation, yet securely rooted in verifiable blockchain technology. Financial transactions become frictionless, regulations automated, and market predictions increasingly precise. The impact? A dramatic acceleration in innovation, productivity, and economic growth.

These developments are reshaping investor strategies and institutional adoption of new technologies. Circle's public market entry is poised to attract traditional investors who, until now, viewed blockchain ventures as risky or opaque. Institutional investors increasingly see blockchain and AI ventures as strategic, long-term portfolio additions rather than speculative bets.

Similarly, OpenAI's record funding round signifies that AI has moved beyond being a speculative investment. Major venture capital firms and private equity groups now recognize AI as foundational technology—essential for future competitiveness and economic stability.

Together, these shifts may trigger broader acceptance and adoption of advanced technologies. Institutional portfolios might soon routinely include blockchain infrastructure and AI-driven platforms, fueling even greater investment flows and innovation.

With great innovation comes equally significant regulatory scrutiny. Circle's IPO will inevitably invite greater regulatory oversight, particularly around stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure. Regulators will closely monitor how blockchain integrates with existing financial frameworks, ensuring transparency and protecting investors.

Similarly, OpenAI's substantial funding and growing influence means that AI technology will face intensified regulatory examination. Issues such as data privacy, bias in AI models, and ethical use of AI-generated content will come under increased scrutiny, requiring thoughtful governance and responsible innovation.

Regulatory evolution isn't a roadblock; instead, it's indicative of an industry maturing. Constructive regulatory frameworks will provide clarity, fostering innovation while safeguarding ethical standards and consumer interests. Circle and OpenAI's recent successes illustrate that blockchain and AI are now ready for robust regulatory dialogue, positioning these technologies for sustainable growth.

Circle's planned IPO and OpenAI's extraordinary funding aren't merely financial milestones. They symbolize a profound shift in economic thinking, setting the stage for a future economy driven by digital trust and intelligence. Investors, businesses, and regulators alike must prepare for a landscape shaped by the symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain.

As we look ahead, the intersections of decentralized finance and intelligent automation could emerge as defining forces of tomorrow's digital economy. The potential is immense—ranging from transformative impacts in finance and healthcare to sweeping changes in government, logistics, and beyond.

The digital economy isn't just shifting—it's transforming fundamentally. Circle and OpenAI are at the forefront of this new chapter, challenging conventional economic norms and redefining what's possible. This isn't merely the rise of two innovative companies; it's a glimpse into a radically different future—a future shaped by the unprecedented convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC Pink:SILS) hat dargelegt, wie Blockchain-Technologie helfen kann, die Störungen durch globale Handelskriege durch dezentrale Infrastruktur-Lösungen zu mildern. Das Unternehmen hob fünf Schlüsselinnovationen hervor: Direkter Globaler Zugang, der Peer-to-Peer-Asset-Handel ermöglichtAutomatisierung von Smart Contracts zur Reduzierung bürokratischer VerzögerungenStablecoin-Zahlungen zur Senkung der Transaktionskosten um 40-60%Unveränderliche Herkunftsverfolgung für EchtzeitverifizierungDezentrale Schlichtung für schnellere Konfliktlösung

Strategischer Berater Tom Bustamante betonte, dass, obwohl Blockchain die Auswirkungen von Handelskriegen nicht vollständig beseitigen kann, sie die Macht von den Nationen auf die Marktteilnehmer durch transparente, regelbasierte Systeme verlagert. Das Unternehmen hat sich auf private Blockchain-Lösungen für die institutionelle Tokenisierung durch TrustNFT-Technologie spezialisiert.

Direct Global Access: Decentralized platforms enable businesses to engage international partners without intermediaries, sidestepping politicized trade barriers. Projects can tokenize assets (e.g., commodities, invoices) and trade them peer-to-peer via DeFi protocols, avoiding tariff-choked channels.

Smart Contract Automation: Self-executing contracts enforce terms without government oversight, automatically handling customs compliance, payments, and delivery verification. This reduces disputes and eliminates bureaucratic delays.

Stablecoin Payments: Cryptocurrencies like USDC provide tariff-resistant settlement mechanisms, cutting transaction costs by 40-60% compared to traditional forex channels.

Immutable Provenance Tracking: Agricultural and manufacturing sectors use blockchain to verify product origins/quality in real-time, neutralizing protectionist "dumping" accusations.

Decentralized Arbitration: Blockchain-based dispute resolution platforms (e.g., Kleros) use tokenized governance to settle cross-border conflicts faster.

"These mechanisms collectively create parallel trade channels where compliance is cryptographic rather than geopolitical", said Tom Bustamante, strategic advisor for Silver Scott. "While not eliminating all trade war impacts of course, blockchain does shift leverage from nations to market participants through transparent, rules-based systems. What decentralized systems provide isn't a solution to trade wars, but a means to circumvent their most disruptive effects."

As the world awaits US President Donald Trump's announcement on proposed retaliatory tariffs later today, crypto markets continue to show signs of uncertainty. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance may be poised to rise further, potentially worsening conditions for altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH).

According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin dominance is set to climb further, possibly reaching as high as 64%. Notably, this level of BTC dominance is historically significant, as evident from the 2017 and 2020 peaks highlighted in green in the chart below.

For the uninitiated, BTC dominance refers to the ratio of the premier digital asset's market cap to the total crypto market cap. A rising BTC dominance typically means that liquidity is rotating from small market cap coins – called altcoins – into BTC.

As a result, altcoins like ETH may exhibit subdued price action when BTC dominance rises. Fellow crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted ETH's weak performance against BTC, suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is likely to face further declines in the near term.

In an X post, Martinez shared an inverse monthly ETH/BTC chart illustrating a cup-and-handle pattern forming. While this pattern is typically bullish, in an inverse chart like this, it suggests ETH may fall to as low as 0.00240 – an almost 90% decline from its current price relative to Bitcoin.

A decline in ETH would likely drag down other altcoins, causing a sharp spike in BTC dominance. However, some analysts see the prevailing pessimism surrounding ETH as a potential buying opportunity.

In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that ETH's price has returned to its 2021 levels, trading close to $1,900 at the time of writing. However, the trader added that in 2025, multiple factors could work in ETH's favor.

For example, ETH's narrative could strengthen with the potential approval of an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) for staking, rising institutional demand, and improving fundamentals. The analyst referred to ETH as the “most asymmetric bet right now.”

That said, ETH still has a long way to go before confirming a bullish trend reversal. In a recent analysis, Martinez noted that, based on pricing bands analysis, ETH must break through a key resistance level at $2,300 before targeting higher levels. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,901, down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

On April 3, Binance announced that it would add a new set of tokens to its monitoring list. These tokens are under closer scrutiny and may face delisting following the upcoming review period.

This move follows the exchange's aims to increase transparency while offering more clarity regarding the risk levels associated with different cryptocurrencies.

As part of this update, the following tokens will be added to the Monitoring Tag list: Ardor (ARDR), Biswap (BSW), Flamingo (FLM), LTO Network (LTO), NKN (NKN), PlayDapp (PDA), Perpetual Protocol (PERP), Viberate (VIB), Voxies (VOXEL) and Wing Finance (WING).

Tokens added to the Monitoring Tag exhibit notably higher volatility and risk compared to other listed tokens. Binance will closely monitor these tokens, with regular reviews to assess their compliance with the platform's listing criteria. 

“Tokens with the Monitoring Tag are at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria and being delisted from the platform,” Binance said.

Following the announcement, the prices of the mentioned altcoins plummeted by double-digits.

In addition to the new Monitoring Tag additions, Binance will also remove the Seed Tag from Jupiter (JUP), Starknet (STRK), and Toncoin (TON).

Tokens marked with the Seed Tag are those that are still in their early stages of development and have not yet met Binance's full listing criteria. The removal of the Seed Tag indicates a change in the status of these projects. This suggests that they no longer fit the initial criteria for such a label.

Tokens with the Monitoring Tag or Seed Tag come with inherent risks. Binance ensures that users are well-informed before trading them. To access trading for these tokens, users must pass a risk awareness quiz every 90 days. 

The quiz makes sure that users understand the potential risks associated with trading higher-risk tokens. Binance will also display a risk warning banner for these tokens on its Spot and Margin platforms.

Binance will continue to conduct periodic reviews of tokens with the Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag. During these reviews, several factors are taken into account. This includes the project team's commitment, development activity, token liquidity, and community engagement. 

The latest development follows a similar announcement from Binance in March. The exchange routinely delists tokens that fail to keep up with its criteria.

Flowdesk, a cryptocurrency market maker, has become the latest participant in the Canton Network's initiative to create an advanced on chain solution for collateral and margin management in bilateral crypto derivatives. Working alongside Digital Asset, QCP, and various trading counterparties, Flowdesk will contribute to building an innovative infrastructure that utilizes the Canton Network's privacy features.

This collaboration aims to tackle persistent challenges in cryptocurrency derivatives trading, especially the high capital requirements for collateralization. Flowdesk's involvement will strengthen efforts to develop an economical and regulatory compliant framework for managing margin using blockchain technology.

The Canton Global Collateral Network founded by Digital Asset has already attracted a few industry players. Apart from Singapore institutional trading venue QCP joining earlier this year, Circle announced plans to launch a native version of USDC stablecoin on the Canton Network. That follows its acquisition of tokenized money market (MMF) fund startup Hashnote, which had already launched its USYC MMF on Canton. 

“Canton Network's offering provides the ability to manage collateral and margin on chain, aligning with Flowdesk's mission to create scalable and robust infrastructure for the digital asset economy,” said Simon Nursey, Head of Derivatives at Flowdesk.

Key features of the platform will include ISDA CSA-compliant smart contract collateral agreements and automated processes for handling margin calls and resolving disputes.

Earlier this year Flowdesk finalized an $102 million equity financing round as well as debt from BlackRock managed funds.

Collateral mobility is widely considered a prime use case for distributed ledger technology and Digital Asset is tackling the challenge from different angles. For example, it recently collaborated with Euroclear for tokenized collateral to enable instant transfers of non cash assets to meet margin requirements.

The launch introduces a tokenized fixed-income instrument that is tradable, fractionalized, and collateralized with over $750,000 in real-world assets.

The NFT Bonds are now live on the Polytrade platform and offer a fixed annual yield of 22%, with returns distributed on a quarterly basis. The bonds have a maturity period of 12 months and are supported by loans issued to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the European Union. Each loan is backed by tangible collateral, including real estate and future receivables, as part of Credefi's approach to lending based on real-world asset security.

Credefi‘s lending model is designed to address the gap in the EU SME sector, which remains underserved by traditional banking systems. All borrowers on the platform are subject to a proprietary credit assessment process validated by Experian, with loan-to-value ratios capped at 120%. According to the platform, the current default rate is 0%, and the risk predictability rate exceeds 85%.

The NFT Bonds product allows users to participate in the lending ecosystem through tokenized exposure to SME credit. Bonds are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), making them tradable on the secondary market. Users can acquire full or fractional ownership, enabling flexible participation levels.

This new product is part of Credefi's broader portfolio, which includes diversified loan portfolios, single-loan exposures, and real-economy corporate bonds. As of the launch, Credefi reports that the platform has facilitated over $3.7 million in total liquidity.

The NFT Bonds are available through Polytrade's Marketplace, a platform focused on real-world asset opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. Polytrade supports a range of on-chain asset types and offers infrastructure for buying, selling, and managing real-world asset exposure.

Credefi incorporates a dual-token system consisting of $CREDI and $xCREDI. $CREDI is used for collateral protection and yield enhancement features, while $xCREDI, earned through staking in the platform's Module X, serves both governance and utility functions. These tokens support user participation and additional security mechanisms across the platform.

Security is maintained through a multi-layered approach. Loans are collateralized with real-world assets to reduce exposure to volatility, and the platform's risk models are developed to support predictable returns. Credefi offers borrowers flexible solutions based on collateral and individual risk profiles, while lenders receive access to products designed to provide stable income derived from real economic activity.

Credefi's NFT Bonds can now be accessed directly on Polytrade's Marketplace at https://lnk.polytrade.finance/credefi-bonds.

Credefi is a decentralized lending platform that enables real-world asset-backed debt products. Based in the European Union, the platform connects crypto lenders with SMEs seeking capital, using blockchain technology to structure loans backed by real estate, receivables, and other physical assets. Credefi applies rigorous credit assessments validated by third parties and aims to provide reliable returns while addressing the SME gap in the region.

Ethereum (ETH) continues failing to reclaim the $2,100 resistance, dropping 6% in the past week. As the second largest crypto trades within its “make or break” levels, some market watchers suggest it will continue to move sideways before another major move.

Ethereum Trades At 2023 Levels

After closing its worst Q1 since 2018, Ethereum continued moving sideways, hovering between the $1,775-$1,925 price range. Amid last Monday's recovery, Ethereum traded only 6% below its monthly opening, eyeing a potential positive close in the monthly timeframe.

Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency fell over 10% from last week's high to close the first quarter 45.4% below its January opening and 18.6% from its March opening. Moreover, it registers its worst performance in seven years, recording four consecutive months of bleeding for the first time since 2018.

Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH is “still trading in no man's land” despite its recent attempts to break above its current range. In early March, Ethereum dropped below the $2,100 mark, losing its 2024 gains and hitting a 16-month low of $1,750.

The trader suggested that the crucial levels to watch are a breakdown below $1,750 or a breakout above $2,100. “Anything in between is just going to be a painful chop,” he added.

Another market watcher, Merlijn The Trader, highlighted that ETH is at 2021 levels, pointing that it is trading within the breakout zone that led to Ethereum's all-time high (ATH) but has stronger fundamentals and more institutional demand four years later.

“ETH is sitting on the same monthly support that ignited the 2021 bull run. Hold it, and $10K is in play. Lose it… and things get ugly,” he detailed.

More Chop Before ETH's Next Move?

Analyst VirtualBacon considers that Ethereum will continue to trade within its current price range for the time being. He explained that ETH's price has fallen to retest the last bear market resistance levels, as it has erased all its gains since November 2023.

The analyst considers this zone a “good value range” but doesn't expect the cryptocurrency to break out “right away.” However, he added that a bullish breakout is “simply a matter of time” in longer timeframes.

“Ethereum always catches up when the Fed pivots and the global liquidity index beings to uptrend. That's when you see the ETH/BTC ratio start to turn up again, leading the rest of the altcoin market,” he concluded.

Ali Martinez pointed out that the number of large ETH transactions has significantly declined in over a month, dropping 63.8% since February 25.

During this period, large transactions fell from 14,500 to 5,190, signaling a drop in whale activity on the network. He also noted that whales have sold 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks.

As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,903, a 6% drop in the weekly timeframe.

On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imports from 50 countries, including the BRICS and the European Union. Also dubbed the ‘Declaration of Economic Independence', Trump's prolonged speech declaring reciprocal tariffs had no mention of Bitcoin, blockchain, or even digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) price, which saw a peak at $110,000 during the inauguration of Trump, fell by 1.41 per percent, at around $83,666, as per CoinGecko, a site that tracks the global cryptocurrency market in real time. 

On Wednesday, April 2, President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in what he termed his efforts to counter unfair trade practices. Trump's latest announcement has impacted several of the US's longstanding trading partners. Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and China faced the highest tariffs, while the European Union, the UK, and Japan also faced substantial tariffs. Trump has imposed a 27 per cent ‘discounted reciprocal tariff' on imports from India.

Interestingly, with zero mentions of crypto, the crypto market panicked within minutes from the announcement. Initially, BTC dipped from $88,000 to $85,000; this is a whopping $3,000 drop in just around 10 minutes. BTC later stabilised a bit at $84,800; however, Ethereum (ETH) slid to $1,845 as the overall crypto market took a nosedive.

Zack Burks, the chief executive of NFT company Mintology, told Forbes that Trump's ‘liberation day' speech is going to be an atomic bomb on the current markets, and crypto is not safe in the immediate term. Burks told the news outlet that it was becoming clearer that bitcoin is the retail investor's doomsday asset of choice, while gold is the institutional haven, specifically considering the soft power Trump holds on crypto assets. He was referring to the president's promise to create a US bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile as well as his growing crypto business interests.

In the last 24 hours, the price of BTC and the wider crypto market have been showing mixed signals. Trump's address touched upon inflation, energy, and reviving American manufacturing on the lines with his pledge to boost the economy. While earlier there were murmurs that he may address digital assets, Trump's omission of crypto comes at a time when his supporters and crypto advocates have been buoyed by his campaign promises to make the US a crypto capital. As of now, the crypto world is closely watching for more policy changes.

Despite a higher-than-expected announcement of reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump, domestic stock markets gave a muted response, with Sensex and Nifty ending marginally lower. The BSE's Sensex fell 0.42 per cent, or 322.08 points, to end at 76,295.36. The index opened 805.58 points down but recovered later in the day.</p>

Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to maintain its recovery momentum in early April 2025, with the price failing to break above the $2,000 psychological barrier. The second-largest cryptocurrency has faced significant headwinds in recent months, resulting in a sharp decline during the first quarter of the year.

ETH price attempted to recover above the $1,880 level but faced rejection. The cryptocurrency formed a high at $1,955 before trimming most gains and falling back below $1,850.

Technical indicators show ETH trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart was also broken, suggesting continued bearish pressure.

On the upside, Ethereum faces resistance near $1,850, with the next key hurdle at $1,865. The major resistance level sits at $1,920, and clearing this could potentially push the price toward $1,950.

The first quarter of 2025 proved particularly challenging for Ethereum. The cryptocurrency ended Q1 down 45%, according to Coinglass data, making it the third-worst quarter for ETH since 2016.

This poor performance contributed to approximately $170 billion in market value being erased. Institutional investors have responded cautiously, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds losing $403 million in March alone.

Standard Chartered analysts have reduced their year-end ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000. This adjustment reflects growing competition from Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which have attracted users seeking lower transaction fees.

Network activity metrics further highlight ETH's struggles. The fee generation has fallen dramatically from $142 million in January to just $21 million in March.

Despite price challenges, Ethereum achieved a notable milestone in March by reclaiming the top position in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the first time since September 2024.

Ethereum-based DEXs processed $64 billion in spot trading, outperforming Solana's $52 billion and BSC's $44 billion, according to DefiLlama data.

Overall market activity has slowed across the board. DEX trading volume decreased from $86 billion in January to $85 billion in March. Total value locked (TVL) also declined from $67 billion to $49 billion during the same period.

The network's burn rate has reached its lowest level since August 2021. Data from Ultrasound Money shows just 53 ETH burned daily last week, with Ethereum's total supply growing 3% since the EIP-1559 upgrade.

While current market conditions appear challenging, Ethereum's long-term potential shouldn't be overlooked. The network continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, controlling 54% of this market with $5 billion in tokenized assets.

The RWA sector is projected to become a $16 trillion industry by 2030, potentially driving renewed interest in Ethereum. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has emphasized tokenization's potential, predicting that all assets will eventually have on-chain representations.

Stablecoin holdings on Ethereum are approaching an all-time high of $124.5 billion. The network remains the undisputed leader in decentralized finance with $49 billion in total value locked.

Ethereum could also benefit from staking-enabled ETFs. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange have filed for staking in Ethereum ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The market's sentiment could shift quickly with positive developments. The Trump family's investment in ETH through World Liberty Financial and Eric Trump's public support for Ethereum may provide additional momentum in the future.

For now, both professional traders and retail investors remain cautious about Ethereum's price outlook, with derivatives data showing little confidence in a strong recovery in the near term.

US President Donald Trump has once again delivered on his campaign promise. Yesterday (Wednesday), he officially ordered reciprocal tariffs to be imposed globally from 5 April. Global stock and cryptocurrency markets are expected to see cautious investor sentiment due to the possibility of an escalated trade war triggered by these US tariffs.

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market intensified following the tariff announcement. Among the top ten tokens by market capitalisation, Bitcoin dropped by 5.2 per cent, falling from nearly $88,000 to just over $83,000 shortly after the announcement. XRP and Ether also declined by 6 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively. Solana, another popular token, also dropped by 6 per cent.

Donald Trump's official meme token also took a hit, falling around 10 per cent in the past 24 hours. It is now showing signs of recovery.

As a result, crypto futures liquidations surged to $511.77 million over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin accounted for the largest portion, with $179.71 million in liquidations. The drop in crypto prices signals a broader shift towards risk aversion across financial markets.

As President Trump pledged during his campaign, he has introduced reciprocal tariffs for all countries with a trade deficit with the US. With a baseline tariff of 10 per cent, South Asian countries were hit the hardest.

From 5 April, Cambodian products entering the US will be subjected to a 49 per cent tariff, while Vietnamese exporters must pay 46 per cent. Laos and Myanmar have been hit with 48 per cent and 44 per cent tariffs, respectively. China, which charges a 67 per cent tariff on US goods, will now face 34 per cent tariffs on all exports to the US. India, another major trade partner, must now pay 26 per cent tariffs on its exports to the US.

However, Mexico and Canada have avoided additional tariffs.

“There has been whipsaw price action in the aftermath of Trump's announcement,” said Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at XTB. “There were no carve-outs or exemptions for individual countries or certain sectors, which spooked traders.”

Fidelity Investments is launching zero-fee retirement plans that will provide investors exposure to three major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). 

The product is available to US citizens over 18 who reside in states where Fidelity Digital Assets supports crypto individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The asset manager is offering three different IRA plans.

 The first plan is a tax-free Roth IRA, which allows investors to save for retirement with already taxed money, while the second is a more “traditional” IRA, which allows for tax-deferred potential earnings growth. 

The third plan is a Rollover IRA, which enables investors to transfer funds from a former employer's plan to an IRA, such as a 401(k), 403(b), or another IRA.

To open a Fidelity Crypto IRA, investors must also hold a Fidelity brokerage IRA with the same registration type, which acts as a funding account. 

Users can transfer funds from the linked brokerage IRA into the crypto IRA to execute trades. If an individual does not already hold a qualifying Fidelity brokerage IRA, the firm will open one in parallel when setting up the crypto IRA.

Additionally, Fidelity's decision to only include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin reflects a focus on established assets with relatively higher market capitalization and liquidity.

According to the company, opening and maintaining a Fidelity Crypto IRA, as well as associated custody services for digital assets, will not carry a fee for customers.

However, Fidelity Digital Assets will apply a 1% spread to buy and sell orders. The spread represents the difference between the price a client receives and the price at which Fidelity Digital Assets sources the asset to fill the order.

The offering allows users to retain familiar features of traditional Fidelity retirement accounts, including beneficiary management. 

The designated beneficiaries for the Fidelity Crypto IRA mirror those established on the user's linked brokerage IRA. Customers can make changes to beneficiaries through the brokerage IRA platform.

The move is the latest from Fidelity Digital Assets, Fidelity's arm that focuses on crypto custody, trading, and management.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that a weakening stock market may cause Ethereum (ETH) to retest lower price levels.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 889,000 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500 may continue to show weakness in April, which, based on historical precedence, may result in ETH also declining.

“What I'm wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there's going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there's a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there's a larger counter-trend rally. 

And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. It could also just simply be due to, there's a lot of macro data coming out in early to mid-April that I think the markets are going to be interested in. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” 

Cowen says ETH may drop to its logarithmic trendline, potentially as low as $1,044, amid recessionary pressures, before reclaiming the $3,000 level as support.

“I'm just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it's over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. We've been talking about that for a while, and it's the whole idea that ETH goes home.”

ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.
