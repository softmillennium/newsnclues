                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) hit new monthly lows at the April 3 Wall Street open as US unemployment data added to pressure on risk assets. “Today's -3.7% drop puts the S&P 500 on track for its largest daily decline since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X. Thereafter, US initial jobless claims came in below estimates, at 219,000 versus the anticipated 228,000, per data from the US Department of Labor (DoL). “The previous week's level was revised up by 1,000 from 224,000 to 225,000. The previous week's average was revised up by 250 from 224,000 to 224,250,” an official press release stated. Stronger labor market trends are traditionally associated with weaker risk-asset performance as they imply that policymakers can keep financial conditions tighter for longer. Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool nonetheless continued to see markets favor an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). BTC price action predictably continued to disappoint on short timeframes as $80,000 support became uncomfortably close. Related: Bitcoin price risks drop to $71K as Trump tariffs hurt US business outlook “Stair step up then elevator down,” popular trader Roman summarized in part of his latest X analysis. Market commentator Byzantine General flagged short positions increasing across major crypto pairs, concluding that tariffs would ensure that lackluster conditions would continue. “I could see a stop hunt below the local lows before a pump to squeeze shorts, then probably more chop that slopes downward,” he told X followers. Onchain analytics firm Glassnode had more bad news. According to their data, Bitcoin printed a new “death cross” involving the convergence of two midterm moving averages (MAs). “An onchain analogue to the Death Cross has emerged. Earlier this week, Glassnode observed that speculative sell-offs in recent months have fallen considerably short of volumes traditionally associated with blow-off BTC price tops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Web2 marketers have long had tricks to track down and "acquire" (in ad speak) likely customers. Not so much, says ad-tech exec Asaf Nadler. It's all about "retargeting" the most valuable potential customers: people who very nearly pressed buy, trade, sell, swap, join, but didn't. Finding those folks in Web2 is straightforward given the troves of personal data scattered online. Such precision could be especially important if crypto's bear market deepens into a blowout that pushes new users away. Economic malaise increases what traditional marketers call the "cost per acquisition" and what Addressable terms the "cost per wallet." "Especially in a bear market people aren't as hyped about user acquisition," said Nadler, "But what founders care about is letting the community know they still care and reactivate them." Addressable isn't building a doxxing service, says Nadler. While it might know on the backend that John Doe owns wallet abc123, it's not passing that information to the client, say, CoinDEX. Instead its product lets CoinDEX target John Doe with ads so that wallet abc123 becomes a paying customer. The company trawls social media posts for intel that it can cross-check with wallets. Perhaps wallet abc123 interacted with protocols that John Doe follows on X. Or it's made trades that John Doe discussed on Reddit. All these clues can be enough to reverse-engineer a targetable identity. The resulting ad-tech playbook is less an only-in-crypto innovation than a recreation of online marketer's existing capabilities with special twists for the on-chain economy. "Rather than pay KOLs, or do very broad activities, what we allow is companies to target only the users that have engaged with you," he said. KOLs are key opinion leaders, social media influencers who promote projects to their followers. While Addressable has been around for three years, the retargeting service is new, Nadler said. At CoinDesk, his beats include (but are not limited to): federal policy, regulation, securities law, exchanges, the Solana ecosystem, smart money doing dumb things, dumb money doing smart things and tungsten cubes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With both Circle and OpenAI making two groundbreaking financial announcements this week, shockwaves have been sent through both the tech and finance worlds. It ranks consistently among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Simultaneously, OpenAI, the pioneering force behind ChatGPT, secured an unprecedented $40 billion investment, underscoring artificial intelligence's rapid evolution from futuristic concept to essential economic driver. On the surface, these two developments might seem unrelated, but collectively, they illuminate a powerful convergence between blockchain and AI—one that could reshape our economic future dramatically. Circle's decision to pursue an IPO is not merely another tech company entering public markets—it's a critical endorsement of blockchain technology by major financial institutions. With heavyweight backers such as JPMorgan and Citi, Circle's public listing represents a major validation from the traditional financial system. It provides mainstream investors a credible entry point into blockchain-driven financial services, potentially setting a standard for other Web3 companies aiming to bridge the gap to conventional financial markets. By making blockchain accessible, Circle's IPO could be the tipping point for broader adoption. This move isn't just strategic; it positions blockchain firmly within the realm of regulated finance, opening doors for greater transparency and acceptance by skeptical institutional investors. Parallel to Circle's announcement, OpenAI made history by raising a record-setting $40 billion in private funding, underscoring AI's leap from specialized tech niche to dominant economic force. Such a substantial investment speaks volumes, not only about OpenAI's pioneering role but also about market confidence in AI's potential to revolutionize industries globally. This $40 billion investment dwarfs prior tech fundraising rounds and reflects a fundamental shift in market dynamics. AI is now seen as essential infrastructure—akin to electricity or the internet—that will reshape business, communications, finance, healthcare, and more. This convergence creates new possibilities, amplifying each technology's strengths while compensating for their respective weaknesses. Blockchain excels in ensuring transparency, security, and immutability, making it ideal for sectors demanding trustworthy data management. AI, on the other hand, thrives on vast datasets and computational intelligence, capable of rapidly extracting actionable insights from mountains of information. Together, blockchain and AI can foster revolutionary solutions, including intelligent digital identities, AI-driven decentralized financial (DeFi) compliance systems, predictive market analytics, and secure management of sensitive AI-generated data. Or consider healthcare systems leveraging blockchain-secured patient data, analyzed by AI to deliver personalized medical treatments. At the core of this AI-blockchain convergence is an economy defined by two powerful ideals: digital trust and autonomous intelligence. The combination of these elements could create an entirely new economic paradigm. It's an economy where decisions become faster and smarter, bolstered by intelligent automation, yet securely rooted in verifiable blockchain technology. Financial transactions become frictionless, regulations automated, and market predictions increasingly precise. These developments are reshaping investor strategies and institutional adoption of new technologies. Circle's public market entry is poised to attract traditional investors who, until now, viewed blockchain ventures as risky or opaque. Institutional investors increasingly see blockchain and AI ventures as strategic, long-term portfolio additions rather than speculative bets. Similarly, OpenAI's record funding round signifies that AI has moved beyond being a speculative investment. Together, these shifts may trigger broader acceptance and adoption of advanced technologies. Circle's IPO will inevitably invite greater regulatory oversight, particularly around stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure. Regulators will closely monitor how blockchain integrates with existing financial frameworks, ensuring transparency and protecting investors. Similarly, OpenAI's substantial funding and growing influence means that AI technology will face intensified regulatory examination. Issues such as data privacy, bias in AI models, and ethical use of AI-generated content will come under increased scrutiny, requiring thoughtful governance and responsible innovation. Regulatory evolution isn't a roadblock; instead, it's indicative of an industry maturing. Constructive regulatory frameworks will provide clarity, fostering innovation while safeguarding ethical standards and consumer interests. Circle and OpenAI's recent successes illustrate that blockchain and AI are now ready for robust regulatory dialogue, positioning these technologies for sustainable growth. Circle's planned IPO and OpenAI's extraordinary funding aren't merely financial milestones. This isn't merely the rise of two innovative companies; it's a glimpse into a radically different future—a future shaped by the unprecedented convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC Pink:SILS) a décrit comment la technologie blockchain pourrait aider à atténuer les perturbations causées par les guerres commerciales mondiales grâce à des solutions d'infrastructure décentralisées. Das Unternehmen hob fünf Schlüsselinnovationen hervor: Direkter Globaler Zugang, der Peer-to-Peer-Asset-Handel ermöglichtAutomatisierung von Smart Contracts zur Reduzierung bürokratischer VerzögerungenStablecoin-Zahlungen zur Senkung der Transaktionskosten um 40-60%Unveränderliche Herkunftsverfolgung für EchtzeitverifizierungDezentrale Schlichtung für schnellere Konfliktlösung Das Unternehmen hat sich auf private Blockchain-Lösungen für die institutionelle Tokenisierung durch TrustNFT-Technologie spezialisiert. Direct Global Access: Decentralized platforms enable businesses to engage international partners without intermediaries, sidestepping politicized trade barriers. Projects can tokenize assets (e.g., commodities, invoices) and trade them peer-to-peer via DeFi protocols, avoiding tariff-choked channels. Smart Contract Automation: Self-executing contracts enforce terms without government oversight, automatically handling customs compliance, payments, and delivery verification. Stablecoin Payments: Cryptocurrencies like USDC provide tariff-resistant settlement mechanisms, cutting transaction costs by 40-60% compared to traditional forex channels. Immutable Provenance Tracking: Agricultural and manufacturing sectors use blockchain to verify product origins/quality in real-time, neutralizing protectionist "dumping" accusations. Decentralized Arbitration: Blockchain-based dispute resolution platforms (e.g., Kleros) use tokenized governance to settle cross-border conflicts faster. "These mechanisms collectively create parallel trade channels where compliance is cryptographic rather than geopolitical", said Tom Bustamante, strategic advisor for Silver Scott. "While not eliminating all trade war impacts of course, blockchain does shift leverage from nations to market participants through transparent, rules-based systems. Specializing in private blockchain solutions for institutional-grade tokenization, the company enables fractional ownership models and cryptographic validation of assets through TrustNFT technology. The company acquisition pipeline will target blockchain-enhanced opportunities in healthcare, cleantech, and digital platforms. Such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the businesses of Silver Scott Mines, are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the world awaits US President Donald Trump's announcement on proposed retaliatory tariffs later today, crypto markets continue to show signs of uncertainty. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance may be poised to rise further, potentially worsening conditions for altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). Notably, this level of BTC dominance is historically significant, as evident from the 2017 and 2020 peaks highlighted in green in the chart below. As a result, altcoins like ETH may exhibit subdued price action when BTC dominance rises. Fellow crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted ETH's weak performance against BTC, suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is likely to face further declines in the near term. While this pattern is typically bullish, in an inverse chart like this, it suggests ETH may fall to as low as 0.00240 – an almost 90% decline from its current price relative to Bitcoin. However, some analysts see the prevailing pessimism surrounding ETH as a potential buying opportunity. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that ETH's price has returned to its 2021 levels, trading close to $1,900 at the time of writing. For example, ETH's narrative could strengthen with the potential approval of an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) for staking, rising institutional demand, and improving fundamentals. In a recent analysis, Martinez noted that, based on pricing bands analysis, ETH must break through a key resistance level at $2,300 before targeting higher levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On April 3, Binance announced that it would add a new set of tokens to its monitoring list. These tokens are under closer scrutiny and may face delisting following the upcoming review period. This move follows the exchange's aims to increase transparency while offering more clarity regarding the risk levels associated with different cryptocurrencies. As part of this update, the following tokens will be added to the Monitoring Tag list: Ardor (ARDR), Biswap (BSW), Flamingo (FLM), LTO Network (LTO), NKN (NKN), PlayDapp (PDA), Perpetual Protocol (PERP), Viberate (VIB), Voxies (VOXEL) and Wing Finance (WING). “Tokens with the Monitoring Tag are at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria and being delisted from the platform,” Binance said. In addition to the new Monitoring Tag additions, Binance will also remove the Seed Tag from Jupiter (JUP), Starknet (STRK), and Toncoin (TON). Tokens marked with the Seed Tag are those that are still in their early stages of development and have not yet met Binance's full listing criteria. This suggests that they no longer fit the initial criteria for such a label. Binance ensures that users are well-informed before trading them. To access trading for these tokens, users must pass a risk awareness quiz every 90 days. Binance will also display a risk warning banner for these tokens on its Spot and Margin platforms. During these reviews, several factors are taken into account. This includes the project team's commitment, development activity, token liquidity, and community engagement. The latest development follows a similar announcement from Binance in March. The exchange routinely delists tokens that fail to keep up with its criteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flowdesk, a cryptocurrency market maker, has become the latest participant in the Canton Network's initiative to create an advanced on chain solution for collateral and margin management in bilateral crypto derivatives. Working alongside Digital Asset, QCP, and various trading counterparties, Flowdesk will contribute to building an innovative infrastructure that utilizes the Canton Network's privacy features. This collaboration aims to tackle persistent challenges in cryptocurrency derivatives trading, especially the high capital requirements for collateralization. Flowdesk's involvement will strengthen efforts to develop an economical and regulatory compliant framework for managing margin using blockchain technology. The Canton Global Collateral Network founded by Digital Asset has already attracted a few industry players. Apart from Singapore institutional trading venue QCP joining earlier this year, Circle announced plans to launch a native version of USDC stablecoin on the Canton Network. “Canton Network's offering provides the ability to manage collateral and margin on chain, aligning with Flowdesk's mission to create scalable and robust infrastructure for the digital asset economy,” said Simon Nursey, Head of Derivatives at Flowdesk. Key features of the platform will include ISDA CSA-compliant smart contract collateral agreements and automated processes for handling margin calls and resolving disputes. Collateral mobility is widely considered a prime use case for distributed ledger technology and Digital Asset is tackling the challenge from different angles. For example, it recently collaborated with Euroclear for tokenized collateral to enable instant transfers of non cash assets to meet margin requirements.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. Sofia, Bulgaria – March 31, 2025 – Credefi, a defi platform focused on lending backed by real-world assets, has announced the release of its NFT Bonds product on Polytrade's Marketplace. The launch introduces a tokenized fixed-income instrument that is tradable, fractionalized, and collateralized with over $750,000 in real-world assets. The NFT Bonds are now live on the Polytrade platform and offer a fixed annual yield of 22%, with returns distributed on a quarterly basis. The bonds have a maturity period of 12 months and are supported by loans issued to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the European Union. Each loan is backed by tangible collateral, including real estate and future receivables, as part of Credefi's approach to lending based on real-world asset security. All borrowers on the platform are subject to a proprietary credit assessment process validated by Experian, with loan-to-value ratios capped at 120%. Bonds are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), making them tradable on the secondary market. Users can acquire full or fractional ownership, enabling flexible participation levels. This new product is part of Credefi's broader portfolio, which includes diversified loan portfolios, single-loan exposures, and real-economy corporate bonds. Credefi incorporates a dual-token system consisting of $CREDI and $xCREDI. $CREDI is used for collateral protection and yield enhancement features, while $xCREDI, earned through staking in the platform's Module X, serves both governance and utility functions. These tokens support user participation and additional security mechanisms across the platform. Credefi offers borrowers flexible solutions based on collateral and individual risk profiles, while lenders receive access to products designed to provide stable income derived from real economic activity. Credefi's NFT Bonds can now be accessed directly on Polytrade's Marketplace at https://lnk.polytrade.finance/credefi-bonds. Credefi is a decentralized lending platform that enables real-world asset-backed debt products. Based in the European Union, the platform connects crypto lenders with SMEs seeking capital, using blockchain technology to structure loans backed by real estate, receivables, and other physical assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the second largest crypto trades within its “make or break” levels, some market watchers suggest it will continue to move sideways before another major move. After closing its worst Q1 since 2018, Ethereum continued moving sideways, hovering between the $1,775-$1,925 price range. Amid last Monday's recovery, Ethereum traded only 6% below its monthly opening, eyeing a potential positive close in the monthly timeframe. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency fell over 10% from last week's high to close the first quarter 45.4% below its January opening and 18.6% from its March opening. Moreover, it registers its worst performance in seven years, recording four consecutive months of bleeding for the first time since 2018. Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH is “still trading in no man's land” despite its recent attempts to break above its current range. In early March, Ethereum dropped below the $2,100 mark, losing its 2024 gains and hitting a 16-month low of $1,750. “Anything in between is just going to be a painful chop,” he added. Another market watcher, Merlijn The Trader, highlighted that ETH is at 2021 levels, pointing that it is trading within the breakout zone that led to Ethereum's all-time high (ATH) but has stronger fundamentals and more institutional demand four years later. Analyst VirtualBacon considers that Ethereum will continue to trade within its current price range for the time being. He explained that ETH's price has fallen to retest the last bear market resistance levels, as it has erased all its gains since November 2023. The analyst considers this zone a “good value range” but doesn't expect the cryptocurrency to break out “right away.” However, he added that a bullish breakout is “simply a matter of time” in longer timeframes. Ali Martinez pointed out that the number of large ETH transactions has significantly declined in over a month, dropping 63.8% since February 25. During this period, large transactions fell from 14,500 to 5,190, signaling a drop in whale activity on the network. He also noted that whales have sold 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,903, a 6% drop in the weekly timeframe. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing. Custom scripts and ideas shared by our users.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Also dubbed the ‘Declaration of Economic Independence', Trump's prolonged speech declaring reciprocal tariffs had no mention of Bitcoin, blockchain, or even digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) price, which saw a peak at $110,000 during the inauguration of Trump, fell by 1.41 per percent, at around $83,666, as per CoinGecko, a site that tracks the global cryptocurrency market in real time. On Wednesday, April 2, President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in what he termed his efforts to counter unfair trade practices. Trump's latest announcement has impacted several of the US's longstanding trading partners. Trump has imposed a 27 per cent ‘discounted reciprocal tariff' on imports from India. Initially, BTC dipped from $88,000 to $85,000; this is a whopping $3,000 drop in just around 10 minutes. Zack Burks, the chief executive of NFT company Mintology, told Forbes that Trump's ‘liberation day' speech is going to be an atomic bomb on the current markets, and crypto is not safe in the immediate term. He was referring to the president's promise to create a US bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile as well as his growing crypto business interests. While earlier there were murmurs that he may address digital assets, Trump's omission of crypto comes at a time when his supporters and crypto advocates have been buoyed by his campaign promises to make the US a crypto capital. As of now, the crypto world is closely watching for more policy changes. Despite a higher-than-expected announcement of reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump, domestic stock markets gave a muted response, with Sensex and Nifty ending marginally lower. The BSE's Sensex fell 0.42 per cent, or 322.08 points, to end at 76,295.36.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to maintain its recovery momentum in early April 2025, with the price failing to break above the $2,000 psychological barrier. ETH price attempted to recover above the $1,880 level but faced rejection. The cryptocurrency formed a high at $1,955 before trimming most gains and falling back below $1,850. Technical indicators show ETH trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart was also broken, suggesting continued bearish pressure. The first quarter of 2025 proved particularly challenging for Ethereum. This poor performance contributed to approximately $170 billion in market value being erased. Institutional investors have responded cautiously, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds losing $403 million in March alone. Standard Chartered analysts have reduced their year-end ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000. This adjustment reflects growing competition from Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which have attracted users seeking lower transaction fees. Despite price challenges, Ethereum achieved a notable milestone in March by reclaiming the top position in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the first time since September 2024. Overall market activity has slowed across the board. The network's burn rate has reached its lowest level since August 2021. Data from Ultrasound Money shows just 53 ETH burned daily last week, with Ethereum's total supply growing 3% since the EIP-1559 upgrade. While current market conditions appear challenging, Ethereum's long-term potential shouldn't be overlooked. The network continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, controlling 54% of this market with $5 billion in tokenized assets. The RWA sector is projected to become a $16 trillion industry by 2030, potentially driving renewed interest in Ethereum. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has emphasized tokenization's potential, predicting that all assets will eventually have on-chain representations. Stablecoin holdings on Ethereum are approaching an all-time high of $124.5 billion. The market's sentiment could shift quickly with positive developments. The Trump family's investment in ETH through World Liberty Financial and Eric Trump's public support for Ethereum may provide additional momentum in the future. For now, both professional traders and retail investors remain cautious about Ethereum's price outlook, with derivatives data showing little confidence in a strong recovery in the near term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has once again delivered on his campaign promise. Yesterday (Wednesday), he officially ordered reciprocal tariffs to be imposed globally from 5 April. Global stock and cryptocurrency markets are expected to see cautious investor sentiment due to the possibility of an escalated trade war triggered by these US tariffs. Among the top ten tokens by market capitalisation, Bitcoin dropped by 5.2 per cent, falling from nearly $88,000 to just over $83,000 shortly after the announcement. lol bitcoin dived on the tariff announcement like everything else, not beating those three tech stocks in a trench coat allegations pic.twitter.com/GvOR7l1uYr Donald Trump's official meme token also took a hit, falling around 10 per cent in the past 24 hours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fidelity's crypto IRA offers US investors tax-advantaged exposure to top digital assets with no maintenance fees. Fidelity Investments is launching zero-fee retirement plans that will provide investors exposure to three major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). The product is available to US citizens over 18 who reside in states where Fidelity Digital Assets supports crypto individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The asset manager is offering three different IRA plans. The first plan is a tax-free Roth IRA, which allows investors to save for retirement with already taxed money, while the second is a more “traditional” IRA, which allows for tax-deferred potential earnings growth. If an individual does not already hold a qualifying Fidelity brokerage IRA, the firm will open one in parallel when setting up the crypto IRA. Additionally, Fidelity's decision to only include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin reflects a focus on established assets with relatively higher market capitalization and liquidity. According to the company, opening and maintaining a Fidelity Crypto IRA, as well as associated custody services for digital assets, will not carry a fee for customers. However, Fidelity Digital Assets will apply a 1% spread to buy and sell orders. The offering allows users to retain familiar features of traditional Fidelity retirement accounts, including beneficiary management. Customers can make changes to beneficiaries through the brokerage IRA platform. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that a weakening stock market may cause Ethereum (ETH) to retest lower price levels. “What I'm wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there's going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there's a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there's a larger counter-trend rally. And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” “I'm just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it's over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.
