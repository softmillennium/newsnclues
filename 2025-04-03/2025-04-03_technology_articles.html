"Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec," Switch 2 technical director Tetsuya Sasaki said at a developer roundtable. Nvidia is following Nintendo's lead, withholding information like core counts and speeds. The company also confirmed that the tensor cores allow for face tracking and background removal with AI, which was shown off with the new social GameChat feature as well as in Switch 2 games we went hands-on with, such as Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV. It isn't clear if this uses any of the same technology as Nvidia Broadcast on PC. Additionally, Nvidia confirmed that the Switch 2's new variable refresh rate (VRR) display is powered G-Sync in handheld mode, which should prevent screen tearing. Nintendo managed to get a lot of mileage out of that chip, which was old when it launched; games are still coming out eight years later.

RiVAI Technologies has launched the Lingyu CPU, China's first domestically designed high-performance RISC-V server processor. The configuration efficiently handles tasks such as inference for open-source large language models. RiVAI Technologies was founded by Zhangxi Tan, who studied under Professor David Patterson, a pioneer of RISC-V and 2017 Turing Award recipient. Professor Patterson continues to serve as RiVAI's technical advisor, promoting RISC-V adoption in China. The company is also said to have partnered with over 50 companies, including Lenovo and SenseTime, to promote adoption and ecosystem development for its RISC-V processor. RiVAI's announcement comes amid broader efforts in China to shift away from reliance on x86 and Arm processors by promoting the adoption of RISC-V chips. The Chinese government is driving this initiative, encouraging research institutions, chipmakers, and companies to invest in RISC-V development. Unlike proprietary architectures controlled by Western companies, RISC-V is an open-source instruction set that allows Chinese firms to design and manufacture processors without external restrictions. To accelerate this transition, the Chinese government provides policy support, funding, and incentives for companies working on RISC-V technology. Major domestic tech firms, including Alibaba and Tencent, have already started developing RISC-V-based solutions, while state-backed research institutions are working on software optimization for the architecture.

Donald Trump introduced a sweeping set of import taxes on Wednesday that targeted nearly all U.S. trading partners — but offered a notable exemption for the high-tech industry. However, numerous items, including computer chips, copper, medicine, and lumber, will be excluded from the new import fees. Initial reports indicate the administration has said tariffs for semiconductors could come at a later date. A senior official from the White House told a Reuters correspondent that the Trump administration is preparing separate tariffs for industries like semiconductors, drugs, and critical minerals. Initially excluding semiconductors from the sweeping import taxes enables American companies to buy chips made in Taiwan without any curbs — good news for AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, as the majority of their chips are produced in Taiwan. Also, the exemption of semiconductors applies to chips produced in Europe, Japan, and South Korea, which is again good news for automotive and consumer electronics industries in the U.S. as both use loads of chips. While 20% to 24% does not sound like a lot compared to the over 50% tariff set on China-originated goods, we are talking about very expensive equipment. With Trump's tariffs, these tools will cost $240 million and $456 million, respectively, disrupting all the capital expenditure plans for companies building advanced semiconductor production facilities in the U.S., including Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Foundry. Those who use mature process technologies — such as GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments — will also have to pay extra for their tools. Ultimately, this will make chips produced in the U.S. more expensive. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It seems manufacturers cannot actually avoid these tariffs, so expect products like PCs, smartphones, TVs, and other high-tech items to get more expensive in the U.S. and profitability of American companies to get lower. However, some goods and countries (such as those already under heavy sanctions) are excluded. These exemptions include semiconductors, copper, drugs, lumber, specific minerals that the U.S. does not produce domestically, precious metals, energy resources, steel, aluminum, and vehicle-related goods already taxed under existing rules, and products covered under national security provisions.

It faces stiff competition in the video generation space, including from OpenAI and Google. With products like Gen-4 and its recently launched API for video models, Runway hopes to hit $300 million in annualized revenue this year. One possible roadblock is a lawsuit brought by artists against Runway and other generative AI companies that accuses the defendants of training their models on copyrighted artwork without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The successor to one of the most innovative and popular consoles of all time is taller, heavier, and loaded with even more fun little bits that make the gadget brain go “brrrr.” We've got a bit until the Switch 2 is available for order, and you'll need to be jumping through some hoops if you want to get physical with it before then. I didn't have ages with it, and I only tried it with a few games, and most of those games are still in development. What I experienced is just a little tease of what could be coming June 5, yet I'm all ready to proselytize. Because the thing works exactly as you'd expect. You pointer finger naturally finds the shoulder button, and your thumb almost immediately finds the joystick. It feels a little taller than a normal mouse, and the Joy-Con digs into the palm. It feels similar to using a vertical mouse, but its definitely more slender, and I can see that possibly getting annoying after a few hours. It's also important to note I have tiny hands, and larger handed folks will probably want to explore the wonderful hobby of 3D printer ergonomic add-ons. Using them in conjunction with the mouse feature was like double fisting trackballs, and I personally think we now need a new category of mice that have a joystick under the thumb. I want to see where this goes. It was particularly useful in Civilization VII,where one joystick let you zoom in and out and the other controlled the camera. Where I really understood how valuable this double mouse set up can be was in Drag X Drive. Your only real limit for speed is how quickly you can move the two Joy-Cons in mouse mode. My lil guy couldn't go too fast. What my character could do was turn on a dime. Dragging just on Joy-Con left or right had my character turning quickly. It felt nimble and was a sensation I desperately wanted to chase. And that's a lot of my experience with the Switch 2. It gave me glimmers of something cool that I want to explore further. The built-in microphones are useful in a game like Mario Party Jamboree and will be even more useful for more casual gamers looking to play with their friends. But its the Joy-Cons I'm most enamored with. As more and more games come to handhelds that are better off with mouse control, we've watched a lot of companies come up with control solutions. But Nintendo's gone and done a Nintendo and over-engineered the hell out of its controllers, so that when you want a mouse it's as simple as a tug on some magnets. I'm super curious to see how this will work in the long term. But after a couple of hours with the Switch 2, I can definitely say I'm optimistic about the future of mobile mouse gaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even gargantuan Jupiter, with its whirling superstorms and volatile temperatures, has a soft side. The team's research, published today in Geophysical Research Letters, is the first to document this phenomenon—a burst of solar energy hitting Jupiter. “A fast solar wind stream slammed into Jupiter's magnetosphere, which acts like a giant magnetic bubble pushing back against the solar wind, triggering intense auroral activity which dumped heat into the atmosphere.” The atmosphere around Jupiter's poles then expanded, producing a thermal wave across the planet about 12 times as long as Earth's diameter. “This may also happen at Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, but we haven't seen it yet,” O'Donoghue said. “Our solar wind model correctly predicted when Jupiter's atmosphere would be disturbed,” said Mathew Owens, a researcher also at University of Reading and co-author of the paper, in a university release. “This helps us further understand the accuracy of our forecasting systems, which is essential for protecting Earth from dangerous space weather.” The research indicates that planetary atmospheres—including that of our solar system's largest world—may be more susceptible to the behavior of host stars than previously known. The work is also a reminder of how dynamic our Sun is, and how many solar system processes remain poorly understood. More observations, both of our host star and our solar system's planets, will help scientists understand not only our solar system as an ecosystem, but also how similar—or unique—our system is from other star systems and exoplanets in the universe.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. On Nintendo's specs page, the CPU and GPU in the Nintendo Switch 2 are boiled down to a vague "Custom processor made by NVIDIA." "Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec," Sasaki said. By sticking with Nvidia, Nintendo will be able to access its DLSS technologies. Dohta confirmed that Nintendo uses DLSS upscaling technology and is offering it as a tool to others in response to a question from Inverse's Shannon Liao. "And that's, I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from." As for hardware ray tracing, Dohta confirmed the chip can support it, and suggested this is yet another tool for software developers to choose to implement. Nintendo's official spec sheet claims that the Switch 2's 5220 mAh battery lasts between 2 and 6.5 hours on a charge as a "rough estimate." (This is similar to what Xbox does with backwards compatibility). "It's a bit of a difficult response, but taking into consideration it's not just the hardware that's being used to emulate, I guess you could categorize it as software-based," Sasaki said of the solution. When asked about struggles players had with connecting multiple Bluetooth devices, including controllers and headsets, to the original Switch, Sasaki kept it simple: "Yes, it has improved," he said.He added that the size of the system and its bigger antennas should have "a big impact" and enable better connections.

But that $450 handheld-turned-console is only as good as the games that Nintendo and third-party developers create.The Switch 2 is very much a sequel, but one that's also clearly an evolution of Nintendo's point of view on gaming. (And that's still lighter than the best PC gaming handheld gaming PCs, like the Steam Deck OLED, which is 1.41 pounds. Even the company's last attempt at having any sort of edge, with the GameCube, had indigo and orange options alongside black. I'm sure there will be variant colors eventually. I didn't spend a ton of time connecting and disconnecting controllers (in fact, most demos had the system hidden away). Those longer controllers fit better in my hands than the originals did. They're still thin, but I found the length to be more comfortable, though I'm not sure many people will notice a huge difference. The sticks didn't feel all that different in a series of 10-15 minute demos, but I need more time with these to really feel how they've changed.Nintendo's new kickstand is a huge improvement over the original Switch, which had a kickstand so tiny it felt like an afterthought. No, it's not OLED, so I can understand why some might think this is a step down from the OLED Switch model. But this LCD screen has been bumped up to 1920 x 1080 with a 120 Hz variable refresh rate. I sure didn't mind the lack of OLED in my brief time with the device, though I look forward to trying more games on the system, as most demos were presented on televisions. It's definitely bulkier, which makes room for a cooling fan, but other than that, it seems to be similar to the existing Switch dock in practice. Custom Nvidia processor with support for DLSS and hardware ray tracing. 256GB (UFS), expandable with microSD Express cards up to 2TB Stereo speakers, integrated monaural microphone with noise cancellation While Nintendo's consoles have a reputation for ease of use and a focus on games above all other features, there's some PC gaming leaking into the Switch.First, there's the mouse —or mice, actually. Both Joy-Con 2 controllers have sensors that, when combined with the accelerometers and gyroscopes, letting them act as mice. I sought these games out at Nintendo's showcase, wanting to see if it felt like to use a mouse on a modern Nintendo console (After all, it's been a while since the 1992 SNES mouse). The Switch 2 wrist straps include little mouse skates to make scrolling smoother. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The results were a mixed bag during my brief trials. In the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Metroid Prime 4 Beyond, you can switch between using the Joy-Con as a controller or mouse at will. But I had a much better time with the upcoming Switch 2 version of Civilization VII. It felt similar to playing a Civ game on PC, and the slower pace made for a more comfortable experience. In fact, the game only requires a single Joy-Con to use as a mouse, but I do wish you could program some quick actions to the other controller. For some, the standout mouse experience might be Drag x Drive, in which you use both mice simultaneously to play what is effectively Rocket League meets wheelchair basketball with robots. I've never seen a mouse used like this in a game, and I'm curious if this could actually send some ideas back to the PC space. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition was demonstrated with a Pro controller, but developer CD Projekt Red has already committed to mouse control. I'm curious to see how that pans out.The big question here is how many people will be in a position to use their Joy-Cons like mice. The Drag x Drive tutorial pointed out that you can use mouse mode on your pants, which did work, but I don't think that's a solution for long play sessions. I couldn't help but note that Nintendo had nice mouse mats and a variety of sitting and standing desks for games with mouse control. The other area where the Switch 2 feels like it's getting into more enthusiast territory is with various resolution options and quality modes. This occurred to a degree on the original Switch, with its 720p display (with some games that played at 540p) and an option to output at 1080p on the dock, but the Switch 2 is far more capable. This is a trend we've also seen on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.The Switch 2 can output to 4K at a max of 60 frames per second when docked. In games where you can pick a lower resolution, like 1080p or 1440p, that goes up to a 120 Hz variable refresh rate.Alternatively, the built-in screen can go up to 120 fps at 1080p, in handheld or tabletop mode. I played my original Switch in handheld mode on the couch all the time, so that's still quite an upgrade. But it's not just the system that has graphics options. Games, too, will give you a degree of customizability. For example, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition has quality and performance modes to choose from. Otherwise, the only graphics performance data I heard about was from a Civilization VII developer, who said Firaxis Games is aiming for 1080p 60 fps, which seems fine for that game. My favorite part was the two buttons on the rear that can be mapped to face buttons, though I didn't see any demonstration controllers set up to use these features. It's intended for use in Game Chat, but can also be used to put your face in games like Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, which put me and other players in the game to get roasted by Bowser if we didn't please him by winning mini games. The green screen effect was rough, though, with lots of jagged lines. You won't necessarily have to buy Nintendo's camera, though, as Nintendo's own website says you can use a "compatible USB-C camera." Did I mention Nintendo showed off a bunch of games? Nintendo's first-party library often consists of hit system sellers, and the system is launching with Mario Kart World, which is sure to be a huge seller (Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was a sales behemoth on the existing Switch). (My guess is it was being played at around 90 fps, but no one would say.) Racing was fine enough, but my favorite part was the Knockout Tour mode.Knockout Tour pits you against 24 other players as you race towards milestones rather than one finish line. This mode alone could sell some Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions. I also got laughs out of the huge character selection, including alternate outfits like Mariachi Waluigi and surprising guests, like a cow. But in the corner of the demo area with mature games, it looked a bit rough, with pixelated edges on characters and some lackluster textures. A permanent watermark on the screen said this was an early build that isn't representative of the final product, so I'm hoping CD Projekt Red can put in some more optimization. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome TourI only got to try a handful of the mini games and demos that showcase the Switch 2's new features, but I was shocked to learn this game isn't free. It's cute, and I particularly enjoyed a game in which you guess the frame rate objects are thrown at. I think it would have made a fun pack-in like Astro's Playroom did for the PlayStation 5. But since I can't just punch things in real life, doing it as Donkey Kong is the next-best thing. You can break just about anything in certain levels of this game. Still, I had enough fun in this demo to give either control mode a try again. Drag x DriveI can see this combination of Rocket League and wheelchair basketball developing a cult following. Using both Joy-Cons in mouse mode was a workout, and I'm not sure how many people will have space for this kind of mouse movement. Still, I was surprised by the deep level of strategy, including extra points for jump shots and getting air off of ramps. I'm hoping for a more typical control scheme, which would make me consider playing this game more regularly.Nintendo Classics: GameCubeSoul Calibur II and F-Zero GX felt perfect during my demo. The controller felt awesome, though I noticed it didn't rumble. You will, however, need Nintendo Switch Online and a new Expansion Pack to access this library, which also includes The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (the second-best Zelda game) and Super Mario Strikers. Other games on display included Civilization VII, Hades 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Street Fighter 6, and Kirby and the Forgotten World — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>the naming of Nintendo's Switch successor might seem like pretty straightforward choice, but developers say they spent years during the development process, brainstorming names and scrapping them. Eventually producer Kouichi Kawamoto, director Takuhiro Dohta, and technical director Tetsuya Sasaki landed on what was, for them, an unconventional route: the Switch 2. They first discussed calling it the Super Nintendo Switch, Kawamoto told media during a private event held in New York City, paying homage to the jump from the original Nintendo to the Super Nintendo console—but there was an important distinction. The NES and SNES do not share compatibility between their games. After a few hours spent with the hybrid handheld during a hands-on event, that description feels appropriate. It's a collection of ideas and designs, refined, to create a product that feels both familiar and improved from its predecessor. Mario Kart World is the Switch 2's key launch game. Nintendo has increased the handheld's size from the original 6.2-inch screen to a 7.9-inch LCD display and magnetized its Joy-Con controllers, which are also slightly longer to accommodate the change. In my hands, the difference was barely noticeable. The Switch 2 feels comfortable to hold and play as a handheld, neither too heavy nor too clunky; I've had more difficult tactile upgrades with my iPhone. To reattach, you simply snap them back on with a very satisfying click. But once detached from the handheld, both can be used, separately or together, as an impromptu mouse by placing them onto a surface at the point they'd typically attach. My experience with the mouse functionality was a little hit or miss. I played two games which used it: Drag x Drive, a wheelchair basketball game, and Metroid 4: Beyond. Drag x Drive, announced at the event for a summer release, uses both Joy-Cons simultaneously, with the left and right controls corresponding to their respective wheel. To move, you push the Joy-Cons against whatever surface you can find—Nintendo set up a large, flat table for the demo, but they also worked well on the surface of my clothes, including tights, which means your lap will do in a pinch. The game requires constant motion with the Joy-Cons, whether you're sliding them across whatever available surface you've got to weave across the court, spinning your virtual wheels to do tricks, or taking aim for a shot by flipping your hand in the air. My arms got sore quickly, and unless I decide to suddenly get very good at pilates, I can't imagine long play sessions. Metroid 4: Beyond's experience was a far better one. As an admittedly terrible shot, my aim on a typical controller could use some work, and with the Joy-Cons detached and free to wave around, I'm even worse. With the new mouse functionality, however, I was able to use the right Joy-Con on a table to steady my wobbling and actually hit my targets. Most impressive about the experience was being able to seamlessly switch from regular Joy-Con controls to the mouse functionality. “If a [developer] decides that it's actually better to have a setting or a switch that turns it from mouse control to Joy-Con control, that's also available.” The portability of the original Switch is what made it so special, and the prospect of both carrying its charger and finding a place to set up that charge on the go is a mark against an otherwise promising Switch successor. “There's a lot of the system side [that's] a lot more complex,” said director Takuhiro Dohta, pointing to features like the newly added Gamechat. When asked whether Nintendo had been able to fix this problem with its new console, technical director Tetsuya Sasaki replied only that the Joy-Con 2 controllers “have been really designed from the ground up from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movements and also, smoother movements.” Here's hoping. While our time with the new console was short, and some unknowns remain, the Switch 2 certainly left us wanting more—with plenty more games and new features to dig into and understand. We'll bring you all of our thoughts on those and more in WIRED's full review, which should be out in time for the console's official launch on June 5.

As with all pocketable items, it's hard to keep track of the charging case for my earbuds—not to mention the buds themselves. I pop them in my ears and walk off. And when I do locate them, they're often dead. Worst of all, sometimes the buds migrate away from each other between listens, so I'm left with just a left or a right. That's really helpful for this pair specifically, because they have more than 15 hours of battery life with noise canceling on. If you're looking for a pair of noise-canceling buds in the AirPods price range, I think these are a compelling choice, especially if you're as forgetful as I am. At first glance, these new buds look a lot like pairs that came out in the earlier days of wireless earbuds, when it was hard to pack all the modern conveniences into tiny packages. A long elephant trunk extends into your ear canal, with a soft silicone tip that seals it very comfortably from the outside world.

The large exterior of these buds carries with it one awesome benefit: huge batteries. This is especially important because with battery life this long, you might actually want to just click the earbuds together and set them down on occasion, rather than needing to hunt for the charging case between listens because of shorter battery life. For this reason, I'm not super upset that the case itself is a bit larger than I'd like for daily pocketability. It's about twice the size of an Airpods Pro case, which means you'll likely want to leave it at home, or in the car, or in your gym bag, when you take the buds out with you. Still, the rounded edges are nice, and it fits just fine in jacket pockets and book bags, with enough heft that you can feel around and actually find it in the depths of your storage compartments.

IP55 waterproofing and multipoint pairing mean these are ideal work/life companions, where you can pair them to your computer for work and to your phone or watch for instant connections, without having to constantly mess with swapping between devices manually. Another thing I'm happy about is the physical buttons included on the top of each bud when they're in your ears. You can play/pause and adjust ANC settings via these buttons, and they're way less easy to bump than the touch controls employed by so many earbud makers these days. A pair of 9-mm dynamic drivers were designed explicitly for these earbuds, and they are generally pretty well suited to most kinds of music. Sound quality is warm and fuzzy, with a lower midrange warmth that makes them less tiring to listen to than many other buds. Songs like Son Volt's “Mystifies Me” have a blanket of organic tape sound over them, with a bit of bloom in the lower end of the acoustic guitar that I don't hear on all pairs. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. I liked it on much acoustic music, but a recent version of “Seventeen” by Sharon Van Etten with Norah Jones gets a bit too forward in the kick drum and bass, leaving out a bit of the vocal detail that sits just above it on higher-end pairs. Adjusting the EQ inside the associated Audio Technica Connect App to the Clear Vocal setting (you can also pick between Bass Boost, V-Shaped, and Treble Enhance, among others) worked well to solve this problem. The app also has controls for noise canceling and hear-through modes, and you can tailor an individual five-band EQ to your liking if you don't like the presets. Dual microphones on the earbuds mean that you'll sound fine on calls, and the noise canceling quality is actually very solid, especially for buds in this price range. The weirdest part of these buds is a “Soundscape” function in the app, in which Audio Technica included “relaxing sounds of nature, a masking noise to help you concentrate, or sounds for meditation.” I'm not sure why I needed that in an app to control wireless earbuds, but sure. As far as a pair of earbuds that sound decent, work awesome, and can take all that life throws at them (including the occasional misplacing of their charging case), there is very little to dislike about these. They work well, fit great, and have the longest battery life I've ever seen from a pair of wireless buds. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founded in 2023 by George Davis, former co-founder of BVNK, and CTO James Smith, Fuse says it's the first infrastructure-grade payments platform offering virtual International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) in the region. That allows the startup to offer first-mile collections and last-mile payouts for international businesses without requiring them to set up a local entity, handle their own FX, or navigate licensing. Davis outlines two legacy options for global companies trying to move money in MENA: local payment firms that lack scale, or larger cross-border players like Thunes, which often operate without local licenses and rely on patchy partnerships. Fuse sits in the middle with a fully licensed, infrastructure-grade platform that simplifies money movement across the Middle East using virtual IBANs and local payout rails. With these options, global businesses can operate in the region without setting up local infrastructure or navigating regulatory red tape. Most of Fuse's clients are businesses in the U.S., Europe, and Asia that want to operate in MENA but lack the banking setup or licenses to do so quickly. For instance, a U.S.-based company with employees in the UAE typically needs a local bank account—something hard to obtain without residency or licensing—to pay salaries in dirhams under the correct business name. Fuse solves this by issuing USD-denominated virtual IBANs, allowing businesses to top them up and pay salaries locally in AED (dirhams) directly to named beneficiaries. Fuse now serves over 20 clients, including EORs, remittance firms, crypto platforms, marketplaces, and PSPs. Businesses across MENA aren't just underserved; they're transacting more than ever, driven by a surge in e-commerce and digital payments. That demand, Davis believes, creates a rare window for regional infrastructure players to win. In fact, Davis says Fuse made more this quarter than it did all of last year. Davis's interest in solving cross-border payments for the Middle East came from firsthand experience. At crypto infrastructure startup BVNK, which he co-founded and served as chief product officer, he saw how hard it was for global businesses to expand into the Middle East. “We were supporting global businesses using stablecoins to move money out of emerging markets,” he said. “We felt the pain of entering MENA—and so did others I was advising. He launched Fuse in 2023 with CTO James Smith, a longtime collaborator who led engineering at both TrueLayer and BVNK. The two now lead a 12-person team across engineering, product, and compliance. Northzone, the European multi-stage VC that has backed the likes of Klarna and Spotify, led the $6.6 million round, with participation from Flourish Ventures, Alter Global, and notable angels, including Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga “GB” Agboola and former Morgan Stanley MENA president George Makhoul. “Their ability to simplify MENA's complex cross-border flows is exactly what the region needs.” Epic Games CEO calls Apple and Google ‘gangster-style' businesses in need of competition You might be following Second Lady Usha Vance on Instagram now Zelle is shutting down its app, but you probably don't need to worry Mark Cuban backs Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on Bluesky's underlying technology</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But unlike many that focus on large markets like Nigeria, Egypt, or South Africa, Djamo has carved out a niche in Francophone West Africa, specifically the Ivory Coast and, more recently, Senegal. The equity round, the largest ever for an Ivorian startup, surpasses Djamo's $14 million Series A in 2022 and reflects continued investor confidence in its mission to make banking accessible and affordable. Most mobile money platforms offer basic services: cash-in, cash-out, P2P transfers, and bill payments. While useful, they don't unlock more advanced financial tools like credit, investments, or long-term savings. Its target is a growing segment of users, mostly younger customers, who've outgrown mobile money wallets but still find traditional banks expensive, outdated, or inaccessible, the founders say. And this is what we are building, trying to become the go-to bank for this huge cohort of customers that is evolving now to more complex, wealth-building financing opportunities.” Since our last coverage, Djamo has expanded beyond cards and peer-to-peer transfers. The Ivorian fintech now offers savings vaults, investment products — thanks to the region's first fintech-issued brokerage license — and salary-linked bank accounts, which Bourgi sees as important to boosting customer engagement. Like many neobanks, Djamo attracts banked users who treat it as a secondary account for smoother bill payments and mobile money integration. These users, who make up over 55% of Djamo's base, often treat the app as their primary financial service. Bourgi says nine in 10 users who rely on Djamo as their main account come from this segment. According to CTO Bamba, the startup now provides bulk payments, payment links, and QR code tools to help merchants accept and manage payments directly within the app. The fintech generates revenue from merchant fees on online card purchases and a premium tier plan, which 25% of users pay for. Bamba adds that the company is exploring additional revenue streams, including lending and earning interest on customer deposits. With its recent expansion into Senegal, Djamo has entered a market dominated by Wave, one of Africa's largest fintechs known for low-cost mobile money transfers. But rather than compete directly, Djamo positions itself as a complementary service, offering a digital banking experience where users can store funds and access more advanced tools like savings, investments, and credit. Now a 250-person team, Djamo is betting that its new round of funding, led by Pan-African, gender-focused VC Janngo Capital, will help it scale those services across French-speaking Africa. “We are thrilled to lead the largest VC round in Ivory Coast and double down on Djamo, a mission-driven fintech transforming access to financial services across Francophone West Africa,” said Fatoumata Bâ, founder and executive chair of Janngo Capital. “In a region where fewer than 25% of adults have access to formal financial services, and where women are twice as likely to be excluded, this is a vital mission. With women making up a third of its users, Djamo is not only closing the gender gap but unlocking economic opportunity at scale.” Epic Games CEO calls Apple and Google ‘gangster-style' businesses in need of competition Zelle is shutting down its app, but you probably don't need to worry Mark Cuban backs Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on Bluesky's underlying technology</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The past two years, Universal chose CinemaCon to debut the first footage from its adaptation of Wicked and now, with the second and final film on the way, it had to happen again. Director Jon M. Chu, producer Marc Platt, and stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were all on hand to debut the first footage from the highly anticipated Wicked: For Good, and while it's not yet online, here's what happened. Glass breaks on what appears to be a brand new apartment. She goes out to her massive balcony and says, “Elphaba Thropp, I know you're out here, come in before the monkeys see you.” The camera circles her twice and then, boom, Elphaba is there. Elphaba has set up a home for herself somewhere in the woods. There, she looks at some of the propaganda that has been spreading about her. Glinda gets a massive crown placed upon her head. Madame Morrible says that the witch will be caught soon, now that Prince Fiyero and his squad are hot on her trail. So, we see Fiyero riding a horse through the woods, in uniform, with many soldiers behind him. Glinda and Elphaba are sitting together on a swing discussing all the good they can do together. A scene shows what appears to be Glinda and Elphaba back in the Wizard's big room, with massive flashing colored lights all around, and it looks like they are all dancing together. Someone handles a few yellow bricks. The Wizard has what is clearly Dorothy, the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow in his palace and tells them to “Bring me the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West.” A follow-up to the dancing scene sees Fiyero pointing a gun at Elphaba with the Wizard there, only for him to shift it over to him. As the footage ends, Elphaba is standing in place. Then she says, “I'm off the see the Wizard,” followed by scenes of her flying through Oz, being chased by the monkeys. I know—much of that doesn't make sense, but it was a trailer filled with lots of very cool and intriguing moments. It certainly felt like a trailer audiences are sure to see later this summer, but we'll have to wait and see. Wicked: For Good comes to theaters on November 21.
