            Mexico's economic minister Marcelo Ebrard praised the “preferential treatment” received by Mexico after US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping new global tariffs.
    


            On Wednesday, Trump detailed new tariffs on many countries including a minimum 10% “baseline” tariff on imports. Mexico and Canada, though still subject to prior tariffs, were exempt from the new reciprocal tariffs.

            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that this treatment is due to Mexico's positive relationship with the US.
    


            “There are no additional tariffs to Mexico and that is good for the country,” Sheinbaum said during a Thursday morning press conference, touting her government's relationship with the Trump administration.
    


            “This has to do with the good relationship we have constructed with the US government, based on collaboration but with respect”.
    


            “President Sheinbaum's strategy has worked. We (Mexico) have a preferential treatment,” Ebrard said at the same press conference.
    


            Shortly after being sworn in, Trump announced that he would implement a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, but later agreed to pause tariffs for products covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on free trade. On Wednesday, the White House said that this exemption and the tariffs on non-USCMA compliant products would continue until Trump determines that the fentanyl and illegal immigration issues have been resolved.
    


            However, Mexico remains subject to a separate 25% tariff on cars imported to the US.
    


            Sheinbaum said that Mexico remains in dialogue with the US about the impact of US tariffs on the automobile industry.

            Global markets on Thursday were severely rattled by President Donald Trump's historic tariff announcement, which threatens to throw the US and the rest of the world into a recession.
    


            The Dow fell 1,200 points, or 2.82%, pulling back from a session low of 1,570 points in the red. The broader S&P 500 was down by 3.5%, hitting its lowest level since September. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 4.5% and also hit its lowest level since September. All three major indexes were on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis.
    


            The S&P 500 was down 11% from its record high in February and on track to close in correction territory. The Nasdaq, which has been in correction, was down 16.8% from its record high in December. The Dow was down 8.9% from its record high in December.
    


Global markets also fell sharply Thursday. Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index tumbled 2.57% and Germany's DAX index fell 3%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index sank 2.77% and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell 1.52%.
    


            The significant declines come after Trump's massive tariffs imposed on practically all goods coming into the United States sparked fears that the new policy could trigger significant backlash from trading partners and take down the global economy.
    


            That's part of the reason the US dollar fell to its weakest level since October on Thursday. Tariffs in theory should boost the dollar, but investors' concerns that the United States is creating a self-inflicted wound that would stymie its long-term growth sent the dollar sinking against other global currencies.
    


            “They're ignoring every rule of classic micro and macro economics. This is the policymaking equivalent of a suicide bomber,” Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital, told CNN's Matt Egan.
    


            Investors poured money into safe-haven assets. Gold surged to a new record Wednesday above $3,160 a troy ounce, and Treasury bond yields fell sharply. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since October. Bonds and prices trade in opposite directions. Gold, which hovered above $3,100 a troy ounce Thursday morning, is up 19% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986.
    


            Stocks leading US markets lower included companies that rely on international supply chains that will be subject tariffs. Apple (AAPL) sank 8%. Nike (NKE) tumbled 9.8%. Best Buy (BBY) plunged 15% and Ralph Lauren (RL) tanked 15.8%.
    


            Apple shed almost $300 billion in market value from market close on Wednesday to morning trading on Thursday, according to FactSet data.
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 30% on Thursday. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN's Fear and Greed Index. The Fear and Greed index slumped to its lowest level this year as tariff anxiety gripped investors.
    


            If Trump maintains the massive tariffs he announced Wednesday, his unprecedented trade policies will probably cause the US and global economies to both fall into a recession in 2025, JPMorgan analysts said in a note to investors.

Trump launches historic global trade war



            That's not exactly a shock: Prior to Trump's announcement Wednesday, JPMorgan analysts gave the US economy a 40% shot of entering a recession.
    


            JPMorgan noted that the tariffs would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year — the largest tax increase in recent memory by a longshot. It will cause prices to surge, too, adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of US inflation that has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years.
    


            “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macro economic shock.”
    


            The shock will be exacerbated by plunging consumer and business sentiment and by any retaliation visited upon America as foreign countries potentially impose new tariffs on the United States.
    


            “We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and global economy into recession this year,” the analysts said.
    


            Oil prices plunged on Thursday on worries that Trump's trade war will slow the world economy and that OPEC is oversupplying the market. US oil futures plummeted 7% to $66.68 a barrel, leaving crude on track for its worst day since July 2022. Brent crude, the world benchmark, tumbled 6.6%.
    


            OPEC+ surprised investors on Thursday by announcing that Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members have agreed to sharply accelerate previously scheduled production increases starting in May.
    


            The Business Roundtable, a powerful group of America's leading CEOs, warned Wednesday night that Trump's latest tariffs could backfire on their businesses.
    


            “Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said in a statement. “Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.”
    


            Trump's massive new tariffs would send the US tariffs rate dramatically higher to levels unseen since around 1910, according to Fitch Ratings.
    


            Trump's aggressive tariff moves are set to lift the US tariffs rate from just 2.5% last year to 22%, according to Fitch.
    


            That surpasses the roughly 20% tariff rate the United States charged following the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which set off a global trade war that economists say worsened the Great Depression.
    


            “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a statement on Wednesday.
    


            Sonola said “many” nations will likely plunge into recession.
    


            “You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,” the Fitch economist said.

            “Friends” star David Schwimmer has opened up about fame and the impact the show's huge success had on him, revealing that he struggled to listen to the theme tune for a while as he “just had heard it so many times.”
    


            Schwimmer discussed his dislike of “I'll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts during an appearance on the “Making a Scene” podcast, hosted by British comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams.
    


            “I'll be really honest, there was a time for quite a while that just hearing the theme song would really… uggh,” said Schwimmer in the episode earlier this week.
    


            “You know what I mean? I just had that reaction. I just had heard it so many times,” he added.
    


            “Any time you'd go on a show or a talkshow or an interview, that would be your intro song. So I just didn't have the greatest response to it for a period of time,” said Schwimmer.
    


            Schwimmer portrayed Ross Geller in the hit comedy, which spanned 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 and also starred Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc and the late Matthew Perry.
    


            Schwimmer also spoke about his struggles with fame, recalling how the last time he was able to appear in public without attracting attention was in 1994.
    


            “Jim Burrows (“Friends” director) took the cast to Vegas… this was before we were on the air or anything,” he said.
    


            “We were walking through the casino at one point, and he said to us, ‘remember this moment, it's the last time you're going to be able to walk through a casino like this' – basically, with total anonymity,” said Schwimmer.

            He went on to recount one incident that hammered home Burrows' point.
    


            “The moment that I realised Jim Burrows was right, I was at LAX and I was trying to catch a flight. I'm not one of those actors that has an entourage with me. It's me, that's it. I just go solo,” said Schwimmer.
    


            “I'm going through LAX trying to find my flight, I hear a blood-curdling scream. I was genuinely frightened. I thought someone was being stabbed or something,” he said.
    


            “And a group of girls come and like just accost me… literally just scream and grab me,” added Schwimmer. “And they won't let me go… I mean, it was terrifying.”
    


            “It took me a long time to get adjusted to that kind of fame,” added Schwimmer.
    


            “At that time you had three cars following you everywhere you went… staked outside your house. You had absolutely no privacy, ever.”
    


            Schwimmer also told Lucas and Walliams how his relationship with “Friends” and its theme tune has evolved over the years, particularly after his child started watching the show, aged about nine.
    


            “I'd be making breakfast or whatever, and I'd hear my kid's laughter,” he said. “My whole relationship to that song and to the show changed again.”

Follow:


            The death of Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, was due to carbon monoxide inhalation, the Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) of Costa Rica said Wednesday.
    


            Gardner was found dead by a family member in his hotel room on March 21, while the family was staying at the Arenas Del Mar resort in Costa Rica.
    


            OIJ director Randall Zúñiga confirmed that the toxicology results and the carboxyhemoglobin test showed a saturation level of 64%. Zúñiga stated that concentrations above 50% of carboxyhemoglobin are lethal.
    


            According to the National Institutes of Health, carboxyhemoglobin is “the complex formed within red blood cells when hemoglobin is exposed to carbon monoxide.”
    


            “In this particular case, it was a strictly scientific effort that allowed us to find the real truth of the facts,” Zúñiga said.

            “In the autopsy, in fact, when it was performed, the young man's organs had a very specific layer, which is generated when a person dies from inhalation of carbon monoxide gases, and that … was visible at the time the autopsy of the minor was performed.”
    


            The official added that tests were also conducted to detect the presence of drugs such as fentanyl, and the results were negative.
    


            On Monday, Zúñiga had said that a machine room next to the hotel room where Gardner was sleeping was “believed to have some type of contamination that could have caused this situation.”
    


            On Tuesday, the Arenas Del Mar resort offered its condolences but said the cause of death was still uncertain at the time. CNN has reached back out to the resort for comment.
    


            Preliminary reports had initially suggested the cause of the teenager's death could have been “asphyxiation due to intoxication related to food poisoning,” but that was later ruled out.
    


            Other members of the family had felt unwell the night before his death.
    


            Announcing the death of their son last month, Brett Gardner and his wife Jessica said Miller “left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation.”
    


            “Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile.
    


            “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”
    


            Brett Gardner played in Major League Baseball for 14 seasons, all with the Yankees where he was a part of the team that won the World Series in 2009. He retired following the 2021 season.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's military is “switching gears” in Gaza, dividing and seizing more parts of the strip, a move observers say could mean Israel establishing deeper, more long-term control over the territory.
    


            Israel says it will escalate its campaign against Hamas in Gaza until it agrees to revised ceasefire terms, with the defense minister vowing to seize “large areas” of the Strip. Gaza has seen an intense bombing campaign, with the territory's health ministry saying at least 100 people have been killed in the space of 24 hours, bringing the total number of the dead to 1,163 since Israel renewed its military operations in the strip on March 18.
    


            It remains unclear how much land Israel is prepared to seize or whether permanent annexation is being considered, however Netanyahu gave some hints, in particular saying his troops would wrest control over another key strip of land.

            “Last night in the Gaza Strip, we switched gears. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is seizing territory, striking the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” Netanyahu said in a video speech on Wednesday.
    


            “We are now dividing the strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do.”
    


            “We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor,” he added.
    


            The Morag Corridor refers to the settlement of Morag that once lay between the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt, which Israel had also seized and continues to occupy as a major sticking point in ceasefire negotiations.
    


            A historic route linking Gaza's Sufa crossing to the former settlement of Morag, the Morag Corridor could become a dividing line between Khan Younis and Rafah if seized by Israeli forces, experts told CNN on Wednesday.
    


Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization that focuses on the freedom of movement of Palestinians, says that even before the current operation, Israel had already expanded its control of a buffer zone along the edges of the enclave, covering almost 52 square kilometers along the entire perimeter of the Strip, or 17% of its total area.
    


            Col.(res) Grisha Yakubovich, former Head of the Civil Department for the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) compared the move – which also follows a number of evacuation orders for Palestinians – to Israeli forces' earlier creation of a “buffer zone” in northern Gaza, where troops cleared Hamas strongholds and established a security perimeter near Israeli border communities.
    


            In the south, he told CNN that the IDF may seek to evacuate Rafah's population and extend a southern buffer zone. Holding these border zones puts pressure on Hamas while protecting Israeli communities, Yakubovich said.
    


            Maj. Gen. (res.) Eitan Dangot, former Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT), speculated that seizing the Morag corridor could be the start of dividing Gaza into three broad sections for greater control.
    


            “It means Israel or the IDF is going through a very clear process in order to keep areas under closed control by military forces that prevent movement from area to area,” he said.
    


            “There will be full control of traffic that will be allowed to enter and to cross. That means if the time comes that Israel will allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, the control of the convoys will be under more close control,” Dangot added.
    


            Focusing on the Morag corridor is also “a kind of a political decision in order to give the right-wing extremists in the government, a kind of hope that maybe we will be back in some areas (settlements) as before,” Dangot added. “When you say ‘Morag' out loud, it means going back to the disengagement of Gush Katif.”
    


            Gush Katif was a bloc of several Israeli settlements, including the agricultural settlement of Morag, in the southern Gaza Strip. When Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismantled Gush Katif and expelled some 8,000 Jewish residents living there.
    


            Some Israeli settlers have since October 7 called for a return to Gush Katif and for the re-settlement of Gaza, a movement emboldened by Israel's right-wing politicians who have openly called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.
    


            Gaza's fragile ceasefire was shattered on March 18 as Israel carried out deadly strikes across the enclave and Netanyahu vowed to use “increasing military strength” against Hamas until all hostages are released.
    


            Hostage talks have stalled, with Hamas rejecting Israel's latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza which would have seen a 40-day truce in exchange for the release of 11 hostages, itself a counterproposal to an Egyptian offer Hamas agreed.
    


            A total of 24 living hostages are believed to be in Gaza and the bodies of 35 deceased hostages are thought to still be held in the enclave.
    


            After the first phase of the deal ended in early March, Israel said it would block all aid going into Gaza until Hamas accepted a new, US-backed extension of the ceasefire. Hamas – which wants to see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza - rejected the plan, accusing Israel of reneging over commitments made during initial talks over the truce.
    


            Israel resumed full-scale military operations soon after – and mediators are struggling to revive negotiations.
    


            Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group's surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
    


            The war has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to the territory's health ministry.

            Justice Department attorneys will appear before Judge James Boasberg on Thursday to make its case for why the Trump administration did not violate his orders halting the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans the government has accused of being part of a gang.



            The so-called show cause hearing represents the closest a federal judge has come to deciding whether the administration has defied a judicial command.
    


            While other judges around the US have considered in recent months whether the government violated their orders in disputes over federal funding and transgender rights, Thursday's hearing goes much further as it's the first step in Boasberg potentially holding officials in contempt and possibly ordering sanctions.
    


            The case has emerged as one of the highest-profile and most contentious court battles of President Donald Trump's second term, with the president calling for Boasberg's impeachment over his handling of the matter, leading to a rare rebuke of the rhetoric from Chief Justice John Roberts.
    


            At the center of the case is Trump's invocation of the sweeping wartime authority in a 1798 law to let his administration quickly carry out the deportations. Shortly after, civil rights group representing the Venezuelans mounted a legal challenge, Boasberg said from the bench during a March 15 hearing that any planes carrying migrants deported under the authority must immediately return to the US.
    


            But two such flights carrying more than 100 migrants continued to El Salvador the day of the hearing, and Boasberg promptly embarked on a fact-finding mission about the flights, vowing to “get to the bottom of whether they violated my order – who ordered this and what the consequences will be.”
    


            Attorneys for the Trump administration are arguing that Boasberg's oral command “did not amount to a binding injunction” and that a written order he issued shortly after the proceedings is the controlling ruling in the matter.
    


            That written order contained no such language about the planes and instead just said the administration was enjoined from removing the migrants subject to Trump's proclamation invoking the law while the judge's temporary restraining orders remained in effect.
    


            Lawyers representing the Venezuelans counter that the judge's written order encompassed his oral order by including the language, “As discussed in today's hearing,” and argue that there's no question that the administration violated the court's orders.
    


            “The purpose of the Court's order was unmistakable – to keep individuals from being handed over to a foreign government,” they told Boasberg in court papers. “And counsel for Defendants stated that he ‘understood' on March 15 that the Court had orally directed the government to turn planes around immediately.”
    


            It's possible that Thursday's hearing could also include some discussion of the administration's invocation of the state secrets privilege to withhold information from Boasberg that he's seeking to decide whether the government flouted his judicial orders.
    


            The administration told Boasberg last week that it was invoking the state secrets privilege to avoid answering under seal a series of questions posed by the judge, including ones concerning the exact timing of when the two planes took off from US soil on March 15 and left US airspace that day, as well as the specific times individuals deported under Trump's proclamation were transferred out of US custody that day.
    


            It's now up to the judge to decide whether to uphold the invocation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","It's among the largest collections of Michelangelo sculptures ever shown. But there's a catch","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/style/michelangelo-smk-3d-printing-factum-arte/index.html","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:56:00 GMT","


            Behind the red-bricked facade and marble friezes of the National Gallery of Denmark, visitors are now able to see nearly all of Michelangelo's existing sculptures — the “most comprehensive” exhibition of his sculptural work assembled in 150 years according to the institution — and more than 1,000 miles away from where the majority of the Renaissance artist's works are typically seen.
    


            But to do so, the museum did not haul the 17-foot-tall David from the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, or the unfinished figure called “The Genius of Victory” that sits nearby in the Palazzo Vecchio. Instead, “Michelangelo Imperfect,” hosted at the SMK (short for Statens Museum for Kunst), relies on some 40 reproductions, including a new set of 3D-printed copies made for the show by the Madrid-based studio Factum Arte.
    


            Included is a 19th-century bronze version of “David,” plaster casts of the four famed allegorical figures seen on the tombs of the Medici Chapel, and 3D-printed and cast sculptures of Pope Julius II's   unfinished tomb. Though it's not the first time a Michelangelo sculpture has been 3D printed — the University of Florence unveiled a David replica made of acrylic resin at the 2020 Dubai Expo — this time, the technology has been used to help bring together nearly all of the artist's sculptural works in one place.
    


            The show also features original works by the Italian artist, including 20 drawings and a group of maquettes — preliminary models in wax and clay.
    


            “It is a bit of an experiment,” said Matthias Wivel, the show's curator, in a video call with CNN. “It's an exhibition that consists largely of reproductions.” Today, he added, “it's not something you see so often.”
    


            Michelangelo Buonarroti, the 15th-to-16th-century sculptor, painter and draftsman who has endured as one of the most famous artists of all time, is recognized for the dynamism and emotional qualities of his classical sculptures. They twist and turn in space, tense their muscles, or hold seemingly precarious poses despite being rendered in solid white Carrara marble.
    


            At Factum Arte's studio, the team didn't just 3D print each object, but used a mix of new and traditional techniques. The intensive process involved recording each work with photogrammetry and Lidar scanning to make a digital twin. They first printed each work in resin, similar to the “David” replica exhibited in Dubai, but they didn't stop there. Then, they created silicone molds from the printed forms and cast each in a marble composite to get closer to the artist's original material, before hand-finishing the final sculpture.

            “Our goal is to make the (artworks) visually identical under exhibition conditions,” said Factum Arte's founder Adam Lowe, in a video call with CNN. “You're able to distinguish a difference if you can touch them or if you can tap them, because the temperature of the marble is not quite the same.”
    


            But why exhibit replicas at all? And, if it really is virtually indistinguishable to the untrained eye (albeit a little warmer to the touch), is it Michelangelo enough?
    


            Today, we might not assign much value to reproductions, but in the 19th century, plaster cast versions of famous sculptures were the stars of many museums. Institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago began their collections with plaster casts, and the Louvre's plaster cast workshop, created in 1794, is still active today. Visitors who have traveled to Florence are already likely to have encountered a plaster doppelgänger of Michelangelo's “David” in its original outdoor location at the Piazza della Signoria, but they have also been erected in London and Moscow, while bronze versions can be found internationally as well. Many were cast soon after the largest Michelangelo exhibition at the time took place in Florence in 1875 to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth, and featured a mix of original sculptures and new plaster duplicates, Wivel said.
    


            But reproductions eventually fell out of favor, and eventually into disrepair, locked away in storage or destroyed. In 2004, the Metropolitan Museum of Art donated its once-prized collection to the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art. They had previously been neglected in “leaky” storage, The New York Times reported in 1987.
    


            “It was a way of gathering and making accessible works of art that weren't accessible to the general public, either because they were far away or because you couldn't see them together,” Wivel explained. “There's been this sort of fetishism of authenticity around original objects (beginning) in the 20th century.”
    


            In fact, he added, the entire foundation for Western art would have been upended without reproductions, since precious few original sculptures from Ancient Greece still exist today; the vast majority of our knowledge of the period comes from Roman copies.
    


            The SMK's extensive collection of plaster casts already included 27 out of around 45 existing Michelangelo sculptures, making it an ideal institution to host the show, Wivel noted. They were also able to relocate the bronze cast of “David” from 1896 — normally displayed outside in Copenhagen's harbor district — indoors, becoming a “centerpiece” of the show. “I thought that was probably going to be impossible, but it happened,” Wivel said of moving the sculpture inside.
    


            A show of this magnitude is “something you can only do with replicas,” Wivel said. “You get a richer experience of him as a sculptor by seeing it this way.”
    


            To see the breadth of Michelangelo's sculptures, you'd have to travel across Italy and make additional stops in cities around the world, including Bruges, London, New York and Paris. Most can't move and some are behind bulletproof glass, such as the “Pietà” at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, or placed up high in cathedral niches, like four lesser-known saints he carved for a Siena chapel that until now, have never been reproduced. At the SMK, visitors will have unprecedented intimacy with nearly his entire sculptural output — though not quite all, as some institutions did not give permission to make copies, including two of the four unfinished nude prisoners Michelangelo carved for the tomb of Pope Julius II. (Those missing icons are “the great frustration of the show,” Wivel lamented.)

            But all of the institutions who loaned the works will own the imaging and data that Factum Arte recorded, which — as they demonstrate through the exhibition — can be invaluable for conservation efforts. One of the most work-intensive replicas they made is a reconstruction of Michelangelo's early sculpture of St. John the Baptist as an infant from 1495–96, which was housed in El Salvador chapel in Úbeda, but smashed during the Spanish Civil War. Conservators took 19 years to restore the work, which went back on view in 2015, but Factum Arte sought to improve upon it by scanning, printing, and casting each of the fragments before reassembling it.
    


            “We spent two and a half years working on the reconstruction to put the fragments back as they might have been,” Lowe said.
    


            Factum Arte's data provides invaluable information for institutions, Wivel said. “Its accuracy is down to micron level… And that's very useful in the future (for) conservation treatments. You can refer back and see what it was like at that time, especially if it's damaged.”
    


            The scans they capture are taken around 20 inches away from the works and “capture right down to the tiniest marks in the surface,” Lowe explained — even dirt and dust, which can prove challenging as it reads as extra volume or noise in the digital model.
    


            The scans do have their limitations if parts of the sculptures are inaccessible, like the backs of some that are positioned in chapel niches. But the material and surface details mimic marble in a way that plaster can't, Lowe emphasized, from the marble veining that's meticulously added to match the original works, to adding dirt and cracks to the sandblasted exteriors to match the texture and condition.
    


            In video clips of the studio taken by Factum Arte, monumental pieces of the sculpture sit together as they come to life over months and years. Spending that time with each work can profoundly change one's impression of them, according to Sol Costales Doulton, the studio's project manager who oversaw their making.
    


            “The way you perceive these objects, it changes totally,” she said in the video call with Lowe. “The Genius of Victory” was one that began to subtly transform the more she spent time with it, she explained.
    


            “Everybody saw him as a quite dispassionate, detached, idolized beauty. And then you start looking at him, and he starts gaining depth, and there's actually something quite mysterious and deep in his eyesight, (like) something is calling him over his shoulder,” she recalled. “So the psychological charge that the sculpture expresses is totally different when you get a chance to be with it and listen to what it's saying.”
    


            Though it was a privileged position to have that length of time, she encourages visitors to take advantage of the proximity of the works together in one show, and really sit with them.
    


            “So many times in passing through a gallery or a museum, you're rushed to see all the masterpieces. Your attention span will be limited to a minute, a minute-and-a-half, and then you'll move on to the next object,” she said. “So the possibility of being with them for months, they start to unravel many different narratives.”

            The European Union is preparing countermeasures to US President Donald Trump's announcement of 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc, which it called a “major blow to the world economy.”
    


            The EU is a major US trading partner. Last year, it was the largest single market for US goods exports, ahead of America's neighbors Canada and Mexico, based on figures from the United States Census Bureau.
    


            “President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world including the European Union is a major blow to the world economy. I deeply regret this choice,” Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union's executive arm, said on Thursday, adding the tariffs will be felt “immediately.”
    


            Trump on Wednesday launched a historic global trade war, announcing sweeping global tariffs on dozens of nations, from Nicaragua to Cambodia. The tariffs come on top of previously imposed taxes on imports of steel, aluminum and cars.
    


            “Let's be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. The global economy will massively suffer. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism,” von der Leyen said in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where she is attending the EU-Central Asia Summit.
    


            “All businesses, big and small, will suffer from day 1, from big uncertainty to the disruption of supply chains, to burdensome bureaucracy. The costs of doing business with the United States will drastically increase,” she said.
    


            While the European Union would prefer to work with the US to reduce trade barriers, von der Leyen said “Europe is ready to respond.”
    


            “We are already finalizing the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail,” she added.
    


            Last month, the EU responded to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs by unveiling countermeasures on up to 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of exports of American goods, including tariffs on boats, bourbon and motorbikes.
    


            Both Europe and the US have a lot at stake in the escalating trade dispute. In 2024, America was the biggest buyer of European goods, with imports ranging from pharmaceutical products and cars to alcoholic drinks and telecommunications equipment, according to official EU data. The EU, meanwhile, was America's biggest source of goods imports last year, the US figures showed.
    


            “In the past 80 years trade between the European Union and the United States has created millions of jobs,” von der Leyen said on Thursday. “Consumers across the Atlantic have benefitted from reduced prices. Businesses have benefitted from huge opportunities, leading to unprecedented growth and prosperity.”
    


            Still, she said the global trading system has “serious deficiencies.”
    


            “I agree with President Trump that others are taking unfair advantage of the current rules and I am ready to support any efforts to make the global trading system fit for the realities of the global economy,” von der Leyen said. “Reaching for tariffs as your first and last tool will not fix it.”
    


            She stressed that the European Union is ready to negotiate with the US, but Europe must stand up for itself.
    


            “I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally. Yes, we must brace for the impact that this will inevitably have. Europe has everything it needs to make it through the storm. We are in this together. If you take on one of us, you take on all of us.”

            US stocks plunged in after-hours trading Wednesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs that could escalate a growing trade war and upend the global economy.
    


            Dow futures plummeted more than 1,100 points, or 2.7%. S&P 500 futures sank 3.9%. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 plunged 4.7%.
    


            US stocks had closed higher Wednesday afternoon ahead of Trump's announcement on tariffs, but a selloff began as he unveiled his plan, holding up a chart that depicted how rates would increase for each country.
    


            Key Asian stocks mostly sank shortly after opening on Thursday, hours after the broad-based tariffs were announced. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbled at least 4%. South Korea's KOSPI plunged 2.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 2.4%. Taiwan's Taiex was closed for a holiday.

            Wall Street had been nervous about Trump's tariffs, though some analysts expected stocks could rally if the tariff announcement was lighter than feared. Those hopes were quickly dashed as Trump unveiled baseline 10% tariffs on all imports, plus higher rates for specific countries.
    


            “Trump is enacting a very aggressive tariff policy, far more aggressive than most investors thought possible six months ago,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital. “Painful times for stock market investors.”
    


            “While the market was positioned to bounce on a ‘less bad than expected' tariff announcement, there is no way to spin today's news as positive for the economy or stock market,” said Ellerbroek.
    


            The selloff turned into a rout Wednesday evening as investors reckoned with the extent of Trump's tariffs.
    


            Apple (AAPL) tumbled more than 7% in after-hours trading. The tech giant relies extensively on supply chains in China, which will be subject to steep tariffs.
    


            The other stocks leading markets lower in after-hours trading included Tesla (TSLA), which fell more than 6% and Amazon (AMZN), which fell more than 5%. Nike (NKE) plunged 7% and Walmart (WMT) fell 6%.
    


            “President Trump just finished his tariff speech at the White House and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as ‘worse than the worst case scenario' the Street was fearing,” said Dan Ives, senior analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note.
    


            Ives said “the jaw dropper” was Trump slamming hefty reciprocal tariffs on China, bringing its rate to 54%.

            As stocks tanked, members of the Trump administration appeared unfazed. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg that a selloff in stocks was “a Mag 7 problem not a MAGA problem,” referring to the “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Tesla and Nvidia.
    


            Economists expect that Trump's sweeping tariffs could upend global supply chains, stoke inflation and drag on economic growth.
    


            JoAnne Bianco, chief investment strategist at BondBloxx, said the US will continue to experience elevated uncertainty and market volatility as investors assess the “detrimental economic impact” of Trump's tariffs.
    


            “The roller coaster ride continues as the initial leaks were positive … but then the details were released and they were far worse than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.
    


            “The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board — but for now traders are shooting first and asking questions later,” said Zaccarelli.

Hungary will pull out of the International Criminal Court (ICC) because it has become a “political tool,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said.

The announcement coincides with a visit to the EU and NATO member-state by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the Hague-based body for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity related to Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza.

During a joint press-conference with Netanyahu on Thursday, Orban said that in recent years the ICC had stopped being impartial and turned into “a political court.”

Hungary, which is a “democratic state governed by the rule of law, cannot participate in this,” he insisted.

The Israeli leader praised Budapest for its “brave step” in quitting the UN court, which he described as “a corrupt organization” that chose to prosecute Israel instead of going after terrorists.

Earlier on Thursday, Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, announced that Budapest would officially begin the process of withdrawal from the ICC later in the day “in accordance with [the] constitutional and international legal framework.”

Budapest signed the Rome Statute, which gives the ICC its powers, in 1999 and ratified it two years later.

Obran invited Netanyahu to visit Hungary a day after the Hague-based court issued an arrest warrant against him, saying that he would “guarantee him that if he comes, the ICC ruling will have no effect in Hungary, and we will not follow its contents.”

The court does not have its own police force and relies on member-states to detain and transfer suspects. The ICC's jurisdiction is currently recognized by 123 countries.

In February, the administration of US President Donald Trump sanctioned the ICC and its top prosecutor Karim Khan for going after Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Washington is not a party to the ICC. Other non-participating states include Russia, China, and Israel.

In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Moscow called the order “null and void,” saying the children had been evacuated for safety reasons and could be returned to their parents or guardians upon request.

School officials told by Pete Hegseth to review books as part of administration's attacks on DEI

The US Naval Academy has removed nearly 400 books from its library after being told by the office of the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to review and get rid of any that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, US officials said on Tuesday.

Academy officials were told to review the library late last week, and an initial search had identified about 900 books for a closer look. They decided on nearly 400 to remove and began doing so Monday, finishing before Hegseth arrived for a visit on Tuesday that had already been planned and was not connected to the library purge, officials said. A list of the books has not yet been made available.

Pulling the books off the shelves is another step in the Trump administration's far-reaching effort to eliminate so-called DEI content from federal agencies, including policies, programs, online and social media postings and curriculum at schools.

A Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said late on Tuesday: “All service academies are fully committed to executing and implementing President Trump's executive orders.”

The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the US Military Academy in West Point, New York, were not included in Donald Trump's executive order in January that banned DEI instruction, programs or curriculum in kindergarten through 12th grade schools that receive federal funding. That is because the academies are colleges.

Pentagon leaders, however, suddenly turned their attention to the Naval Academy last week when a media report noted that the school had not removed books that promoted DEI. A US official said the academy was told late last week to conduct the review and removal. It is not clear if the order was directed by Hegseth or someone else on his staff.

A West Point official confirmed that the school had completed a review of its curriculum and was prepared to review library content if directed by the army. The air force and naval academies also completed curriculum reviews as had been required.

An Air Force Academy official said the school continually reviewed its curriculum, coursework and other materials to ensure it all complied with executive orders and defense department policies. Last week, Lt Gen Tony Bauernfeind, the academy's superintendent, told Congress that the school was in the middle of its course review, but there was no mention of books.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss academy policies.

Hegseth has aggressively pushed the department to erase DEI programs and online content, but the campaign has been met with questions from angry lawmakers, local leaders and citizens over the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from defense department websites and social media pages.

In response, the department has scrambled to restore some of those posts as their removals have come to light.

The confusion about how to interpret the DEI policy was underscored on Monday as Naval Academy personnel mistakenly removed some photos of distinguished female Jewish graduates from a display case as they prepared for Hegseth's visit. The photos were put back.

In a statement, the navy said it is aware that photos were mistakenly removed from the Naval Academy Jewish center. It said US Naval Academy leadership was immediately taking steps to review and correct the unauthorized removal.

Hegseth spoke with students and had lunch at the academy on Tuesday, but media were not invited or allowed to cover the visit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Howard Lutnick tells CNN that US president stands by decision to impose sweeping tariffs on nations around the world

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said that there is no chance Donald Trump will back away from his tariffs which have sent shock waves across the global market.

“The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” Lutnick said in an interview on CNN.

He added: “Let the dealmaker make his deals when and only if these countries can change everything about themselves, which I doubt they will.”

Canada will retaliate against “unjustified, unwarranted” tariffs imposed by the United States with a 25% taxes on US vehicles, Mark Carney announced on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump announced wide ranging tariffs on dozens of countries, but did not add new trade levies to Canada or Mexico. Despite the reprieve, however, the US has placed 25% taxes on Canadian steel, aluminum and vehicles.

“The president's actions will reverberate here in Canada and across the world,” the Canadian prime minister said at a press conference. “They are all unjustified, unwarranted, and in our judgment misguided.”

In response to US trade policy, Carney said his government would impose the taxes on vehicles that are not compliant with the continental free trade deal. The new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from trade ally Mexico.

Given the prospective damage to their own people, the American administration should eventually change course. But I don't want to give false hope.

Carney's comments come against the backdrop of a global economy in turmoil. Trillions have been wiped from markets as multiple nations digest a new – and grim – trading relationship with the United States.

Carney said that it could take a long time for the US to shift approach. He added that Canada's previously announced tariffs would stay in place.

The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free and open exchange of goods and services, is over. This is a tragedy.

Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate agriculture committee, called the tariffs a “national sales tax” on consumers, farmers and businesses.

In a statement she said:

This is the biggest tax increase in a generation, and will increase costs by more than $5,000 a year for the average family. The economic chaos and uncertainty the president is creating is endangering our economy.

Angie Craig, the top Democrat on the House agriculture committee, said the tariffs would force American farms to close.

She said in a statement:

Increasing input costs, shutting farmers out of export markets and causing middle-class families to pay more at the grocery store is not a winning strategy. Starting trade wars puts family farmers in the crosshairs for retaliation.

The few positive reactions came from beef and seafood groups, who said they have been disadvantaged in the global market and see the tariffs as an opportunity for growth, Reuters reports.

John Williams, executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said:

We've watched as multi-generational family businesses tie up their boats, unable to compete with foreign producers who play by a completely different set of rules.

Ethan Lane, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association's senior vice-president of government affairs, said in a statement:

America's family farmers have been mistreated by certain trading partners around the world. President Trump is taking action to address numerous trade barriers that prevent consumers overseas from enjoying high-quality, wholesome American beef.

Groups that represent dairy processors and fresh produce growers and retailers said the tariffs risked higher prices for US consumers and smaller markets for farmers.

Becky Rasdall Vargas, senior vice-president of trade and workforce policy at the International Dairy Foods Association, said in a statement:

Broad and prolonged tariffs on our top trading partners and growing markets will risk undermining our investments, raising costs for American businesses and consumers, and creating uncertainty for American dairy farmers and rural communities.

The International Fresh Produce Association said it appreciated that Trump exempted fruits and vegetables covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from tariffs, but added that it was concerned about tariffs on other trading partners.

Cathy Burns, the CEO of the association, said in a statement:

The global trade of fresh produce is essential to the health and well-being of people in every nation.

Reuters has a helpful roundup of reaction from groups representing US farmers and food processors, most of which are sharply critical to Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports. I'll start with farmer groups.

The American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farm lobby, said the tariffs threaten US farmers' competitiveness and could cause long-term damage by eroding market share.

Zippy Duvall, the president of the group, said in a statement:

We share the administration's goal of leveling the playing field with our international partners, but increased tariffs threaten the economic sustainability of farmers who have lost money on most major crops for the past three years.

The National Farmers Union also criticized the plan, saying it puts farmers at risk during a period of economic strain. Rob Larew, the NFU's president, said in a statement.

One thing is certain: American family farmers and ranchers will bear the brunt of this global trade war. Without meaningful support and a commitment to fair trade policies, we will lose even more family farms, weaken rural economies, and ultimately drive up costs and limit choices for consumers at the grocery store.

The US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said that the administration is “months away” from making a decision about whether to make payments to farmers to offset any impact from tariffs.

Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs were mostly criticized by farm and food groups for their potential to shrink markets for farmers and raise prices for consumers.

Rollins told Fox News that the administration would consider making payments to farmers in the case of any economic hit from tariffs, but any decision was a long way off.

We are months, literally months away, from understanding if that's going to be necessary.

It has been a majorly challenging few years for America's agricultural sector and across the country, farming groups are in a spin over Trump's tough tariff approach. Indeed, with 10% of all US workers employed in or adjacent to agriculture and around 20% of all US agricultural production going overseas, some agronomists fear the ructions caused by the Trump administration could put pay to relations that took decades to develop.

My colleague Stephanie Starr reported on that earlier this week:

US dangles billions of dollars in Congo mineral investment

The US is in talks to invest billions of dollars in mineral-rich Congo and wants to help end the conflict raging in the country's east, Donald Trump's senior adviser for Africa said during a visit on Thursday.

Democratic Republic of Congo, which has vast reserves of cobalt, lithium and uranium among other minerals, has been fighting Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who have seized swathes of its territory this year (you can read our coverage of the conflict here). The DRC, the US and other countries have said Rwanda is backing M23 to exploit the region's mineral resources.

Meanwhile the US said last month that it is open to exploring critical minerals partnerships with Congo after a Congolese senator contacted US officials to pitch a minerals-for-security deal.

Reuters reports that US senior adviser Massad Boulos (who is Donald Trump's daughter's father-in-law) said after meeting Congo president Félix Tshisekedi in Kinshasa.

You have heard about a minerals agreement. We have reviewed the Congo's proposal, and ... the president and I have agreed on a path forward for its development.

The details of any potential deal, or Congo's proposal, were not made public on Thursday.

Congo's minerals, which are used in mobile phones and electric cars, are currently dominated by China and its mining companies.
 How the US will operate in Congo is unclear, but Boulos suggested that US companies will be involved.

Rest assured, American companies are operating transparently and will stimulate local economies. These are multi-billion-dollar investments.

He added that the US wants to help forge peace in the east where thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee amid M23's advance, which has seen the group take over eastern Congo's two largest cities.

We want a lasting peace that affirms the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the DRC. There can be no economic prosperity without security.

On the need to ramp up domestic production, Howard Lutnick said the US needs to produce its own steel, pharmaceuticals, weapons and aircraft. The commerce secretary told CNBC:

We can't allow the United States of America to not produce steel. We can't allow the United States of America to not produce pharmaceuticals. We can't have a war where we can't get antibiotics and we have to call another country to make a missile or to make a plane. I mean, these are obvious things. We need to have domestic production and we need to employ Americans.

Lutnick also claimed there would be the “greatest surge” in training for American workers to learn tradecrafts, such as operating robotics.

While Wall Street is in a state of flux with plunging stocks and a weakened dollar, Howard Lutnick doubled down on his assertion that Trump's tariffs are still “going to drive growth”.

The commerce secretary told CNN that in the context of the US's $30tn economy: “That's a whole lot of growth. And you're gonna get that starting in the fourth quarter.” (As I'm sure you're aware, we're currently three days into the second quarter.)

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said that there is no chance Donald Trump will back away from his tariffs which have sent shock waves across the global market.

“The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” Lutnick said in an interview on CNN.

He added: “Let the dealmaker make his deals when and only if these countries can change everything about themselves, which I doubt they will.”

Ruben Gallego, a Democratic senator of Arizona, has joined a growing number of Democrats in criticizing Donald Trump's tariff policy.

Replying to a Reuters headline about the automaker Stellantis, which said on Thursday it was temporarily laying off 900 workers at five US facilities after Trump's tariffs were announced, Gallego wrote:

Heck of a job @POTUS.

Several officials within Donald Trump's national security council have been fired, Axios reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

On Thursday, the outlet reported that the firings came a day after Laura Loomer, a staunch Trump ally and conspiracy theorist, visited the Oval Office and urged Trump to carry out the firings.

According to one source who spoke to Axios, the firings were “being labeled as an anti-neocon move”.

One official who spoke to Axios described Loomer's visit, saying: “She went to the White House yesterday and presented them with her research and evidence.”

It remains unclear whether the reported firings and Loomer's visit are related.

The latest report follows just weeks after the White House found itself in a scandal involving its national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who added the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg into a Signal group chat last month to discuss US strikes on Yemen.

Here are some visual explainers of Donald Trump's latest tariff policies and how they can affect US and global trade:

Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, has also hit back at Donald Trump's newest tariff's plan, saying:

“President Trump's tariffs will raise prices on Pennsylvanians – including the tab at your local brewery. Even breweries who buy and source almost everything from the US, like @TheBrewWorks in Bethlehem, could see costs increase as a result of tariffs on the aluminum they use for their cans or the malt they use in their beer.”

In an earlier post on Thursday, Shapiro said that Trump's tariffs “could cause real harm to Pennsylvania's hardwood industry and the 60,000 Pennsylvanians who work in it”.

“I don't know why he's doing this – but I know we're going to fight like hell for our farmers and our [agriculture] sector here in PA,” he added.

New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, has joined other lawmakers in criticizing Donald Trump's latest tariffs policy.

Writing on X in response to a news headline of US stocks falling including the Dow plunging 1,400 points and NASDAQ being down 5%, Hochul said on Thursday morning:

This is what Liberation Day looks like.

Stocks have taken a sharp fall on Wall Street following Donald Trump's latest tariffs reveal which has sent shock waves across the global market.

The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 of the largest US companies, promptly plunged by 1,137 points, or 2.7%, to 41,087 points, the Guardian's Graeme Wearden reports.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg has calculated that approximately $1.7tn was erased from the S&P 500 Index at the start of today's trading.

Following widespread backlash to Donald Trump's latest global tariffs reveal, JD Vance said in a new interview on Fox News:  “What I'd ask folks to appreciate here is that we're not going to fix things overnight.”

He added: “We know people are struggling, we're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us but it's not going to happen immediately.”

Vance also claimed that with the “right regulation”, Americans were “going to benefit from the fact that foreign countries can't take advantage of us any more”, adding: “That means their jobs are going to be more secure.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US president's new tariff regime on every country threatens to unleash a global trade war. Here we explore how the world is responding

Global markets and businesses were reeling on Thursday, as US president Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on major trade partners and struggling countries alike.

Trump's new policies set a baseline tariff of 10% on all goods coming into the US, taking the a maximum rate to more than 50% on imports from some countries. It marks the biggest upheaval of global trade norms since the second world war. The US president said that these levies were aimed at targeting decades of unfair trade practices which had disadvantaged the US.

The 10% universal tariff will go into effect on 5 April while the “reciprocal tariffs” on specific countries will begin on 9 April.

Trump has imposed a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union. Mexico and Canada escaped Wednesday's whirlwind but will still be subject to 25% tariffs imposed earlier this year.

The reaction to the upending of decades of US foreign and trade policy has been swift and dramatic, with Asian markets plunging on Thursday morning. You can follow the latest on our business liveblog.

Here we break down the individual responses by country to the new global economic order as they come in.

China has been hit particularly hard by the new tariffs, which take the total levy on Chinese imports to over 50%.

China's commerce ministry called for Washington to “immediately cancel” the tariffs, warning they “endanger global economic development” and would hurt US interests and international supply chains.

“There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism,” the ministry said. Beijing has promised countermeasures.

The US will impose a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the 20% that had already been imposed earlier this year.

Wang Wen, dean of Renmin University's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, said China had become accustomed to US tariffs over the past seven years. “But these high tariffs have not reduced the US-China bilateral trade volume as well as China's trade surplus with the US … most Chinese people believe that the US tariff war against China is ineffective.”

Wang speculated that potential Chinese countermeasures could include reciprocal tariffs, devaluing China's currency, and further restrictions on the export of certain rare earths to the US.

Trump also closed the so-called “de minimus” loophole, which allowed goods worth under $800 to be imported to the US duty-free. More than 90% of all packages coming to the US enter via the de minimus regime, with about 60% of them coming from China. This exception had allowed fast-fashion companies like Shein and Temu to enjoy booming business in the US. Shein is the biggest e-commerce company in the US and contributed an estimated $570m to the US economy in 2023, according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. But it will see its business model cratered by the closing of the loophole, which takes effect on 2 May.

Donald Trump has hit the UK with tariffs of 10%. Downing Street, which had been expecting a 20% rate to be imposed, expressed relief to have escaped the higher rate. Keir Starmer's more conciliatory approach to the Trump administration appeared to have paid off.

However, the UK's growth forecasts are likely to be downgraded as a result, and the tariffs could cost thousands of jobs and force the government to implement further spending cuts or tax rises in autumn.

South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, has vowed an “all-out” response as Asia's fourth-biggest economy reeled from Thursday's imposition of 25% tariffs on its exports to the US. Han instructed senior officials to urgently address the crisis during an emergency meeting of his economic and security strategy taskforce, the Yonhap news agency reported.

“As the situation is very grave with the approach of the reality of a global tariff war, the government must pour out all of its capabilities at its disposal to overcome this trade crisis,” Han said.

The auto industry is expected to be hit particularly hard by the latest round in Trump's trade war, with leading carmakers Hyundai and GM Korea expected to see a decline in US exports. South Korea exported automobiles worth $34.74bn to the US last year, the Korea Herald said, accounting for 49% of the country's global car exports.

Prime minister Shigeru Ishiba said: “Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for [Washington] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries.”

Trade and industry minister Yoji Muto described the tariffs as “extremely regrettable” and said Tokyo was still attempting to persuade the Trump administration to think again. “I have conveyed that the unilateral tariff measures taken by the United States are extremely regrettable, and I have again strongly urged Washington not to apply them to Japan,” Muto told reporters.

Shares in Tokyo reacted negatively, with the Nikkei Stock Average slumping by 4% at one point, taking the benchmark index to its lowest level for eight months. “We are expecting an extremely challenging start for Asian equity markets this morning,” Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia, wrote in a note, according to Nikkei Asia. “Strap in tightly folks … uncharted waters are ahead.”

Japanese automakers are also bracing for a slump in exports. Goldman Sachs said the levies would have a “significant” impact on Japanese autos and auto parts makers, as vehicles account for more than 30% of Japan's exports to the US.

India woke up to the news of a 26% tariff on all Indian goods imported into the US. Trump had singled out India as “very, very tough” with their own levies, and said the 26% was a “discounted reciprocal tariff” for the 52% tariffs imposed by India.

The commerce ministry was analysing the impact of the tariffs, a senior government official said on Thursday. “It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,” the commerce official told Indian media.

The Indian government had worked hard in recent weeks to negotiate tariff concessions. Nearly $14bn worth of electronics products and over $9bn of gems and jewellery are among the top sectors to be hit by the new tariffs, as well as the textile and IT industries. However, it was good news for India that so far pharmaceuticals, one of its biggest export industries, is exempt.

The US trade deficit with India currently stands at $46bn, and Trump has made it clear that these tariffs will remain till this “threat” is resolved. According to reports, India is considering slashing tariffs on $23bn worth of US imports, including gems, jewellery, pharmaceuticals, and auto parts in a bid to appease Trump and bring down the tariffs, but no trade deal has been finalised yet.

Prime minister Anthony Albanese said that although “no one got a better deal” than Australia, the new tariff regime was a hostile act against an ally.

Australia escaped comparatively lightly from the new Trump tariff regime – only incurring the blanket 10% tariff – but Albanese criticised the move. “President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%,” Albanese said. “The administration's tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations' partnership. This is not the act of a friend.”

Albanese said his government would not impose retaliatory tariffs against America – currently at zero in both directions – and said that, ultimately, the American people would bear the burden of Trump's tariffs.

Some critical minerals coming out of Australia, not available in the US, will be exempt from the new tariff regime.

Prime minister Christopher Luxon said on Thursday New Zealand had fared better, relatively, to other countries with a 10% levy but said tariffs and trade wars were “not the way to go”.

“There's about $900m worth of tariff being levelled at New Zealand exporters, and that will be passed on to US consumers sadly,” Luxon said. “It ends up driving higher prices for US consumers, higher inflation, slows down growth and as a result that puts real pressure in across the world.”

Luxon said he would be seeking discussions with US officials over their claim New Zealand was imposing a 20% tariff on US imports. “We don't understand how that figure has been calculated,” he said.

The US is New Zealand's fastest growing export market, becoming its second largest in 2024, ahead of Australia and after China. New Zealand exports to the US surpassed NZ$9bn ($5bn) in 2024, driven by meat, dairy and wine. The new tariff could mean a NZ$900m bill for New Zealand exporters.

Canada has been exempted from the latest tariffs but still faces 25% levies on steel and aluminum, as well as on automobiles, which came into effect at midnight eastern time. Prime minister Mark Carney said that he would “fight these tariffs with countermeasures” and “build the strongest economy in the G7”.

Carney said that Trump had “preserved a number of important elements of our relationship” but noted that the previous tariffs of 25%, which Trump said are a punishment for not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, remained in place.

Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association posted on social media the result was “like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank”.

Like Canada, Mexico has been exempted from the latest set of tariffs but still faces previously announced levies announced by Trump. President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that the country would not pursue a “tit-for-tat on tariffs” but would rather announce a “comprehensive program” on Thursday.

Taiwan's cabinet has called the tariffs “very unreasonable” and said it would take up the matter with the US government.

The 32% tariff Trump announced against the island is expected to have a big hit on Taiwan's economy. More than 60% of its economy comes from exports and Taiwan had a trade surplus of almost $74bn last year. Bloomberg economists predicted a possible 3.8% contraction of its GDP due to a steep drop in exports to the US because of these tariffs.

On Thursday evening, Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, said the tariffs did not reflect the “highly complementary trade structures and substantive trade relations” between Taiwan and the US. He said the trade deficit was mainly from Taiwan's industries cooperating with Trump's technology control policies during his first term.

“The United States' demand for Taiwan's information and communication products has become the reason for imposing high tariffs,” Lai said in a statement, adding that he had urged his ministers to negotiate “strongly” with the US to safeguard Taiwan's interests.

Taiwanese officials had been planning a response to these particular tariffs for months, including considerations of increasing its energy imports and reducing its own tariffs to balance bilateral trade, according to reports last week.

The government had already scrambled to appease the Trump administration over his earlier announcement of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, of which Taiwan is the dominant player. A $100bn investment by Taiwan's TSMC company in the US – announced by TSMC's chair and Trump at the White House – appeared to work, with Trump saying the deal meant TSMC would be exempt.

The Thai government said in a statement that the levies “will inevitably impact all trading partners, particularly affecting American consumers' purchasing power, who may not be able to absorb the rapid price increases”.

It encouragedThailand's exporters “to seek new potential markets to reduce 
 reliance on a single market” and said it had prepared “mitigation measures” to support exporters that are particularly exposed.

It added: “The Thai government wishes to affirm that Thailand has expressed its
 readiness to engage in dialogue with the United States at the earliest opportunity to achieve a fair trade balance that minimises disruption to both economies.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Sara Campanella and Ilaria Sula were found within 48 hours of each other, bringing the number of femicides in 2025 to 11

There have been calls in Italy for a “cultural rebellion” amid outrage and protests over the murders of two female students found within 48 hours of each other, bringing the number of femicides in the country since the start of the year to 11.

Sara Campanella, a 22-year-old biomedical student, was stabbed at a bus stop in the Sicilian city of Messina on Monday afternoon and died while being taken to hospital.

Stefano Argentino, a fellow student at the University of Messina, was later arrested in the town of Noto. His lawyer, Raffaele Leone, told the Italian press that Argentino, 27, had confessed to the murder.

The Messina prosecutor, Antonio D'Amato, claimed Argentino had “insistently and repeatedly” harassed Campanella since she started her university course two years ago.

In a separate killing, the body of 22-year-old Ilaria Sula, a statistics student at Sapienza University of Rome, was found in a suitcase in a forested area outside the Italian capital early on Wednesday morning. She had been missing since 23 March and was allegedly stabbed to death. Her former boyfriend, Mark Samson, 23, is being questioned by police on suspicion of her murder and of hiding a body.

The murders sparked protests in Messina, Rome and other Italian cities, including Bologna, on Wednesday night. Further events are planned on Thursday.

Antonella Polimeni, the rector of Sapienza University, said Sula's death was an “atrocious and brutal femicide that leaves us speechless and heartbroken”. She added: “We must no longer stand by and watch femicide incidents.”

A minute of silence was held for Campanella at the University of Messina. Giovanna Spatari, the university's rector, said students were “dismayed by this umpteenth episode of femicide”.

The killings have also renewed political debate on violence against women in Italy, where there were 113 femicides in 2024, of which 99 were committed by relatives, partners or ex-partners.

Mara Carfagna, party secretary for the centre-right Noi Moderati, called for a “cultural rebellion”. “From a regulatory point of view, Italy is more advanced than other countries, but culturally we haven't managed to evolve at the same speed,” she told La Stampa newspaper. “For this we need a rebellion shared by everyone.”

In March, Giorgia Meloni's government approved a draft law which for the first time introduced a legal definition of femicide in criminal law, punishing it with life in prison while increasing sentences for crimes including stalking, sexual violence and “revenge porn”.

The law followed the strong public reaction to the killing of Giulia Cecchettin, a 22-year-old student who was murdered by her former boyfriend, Filippo Turetta, in November 2023. Turetta was sentenced to life in prison in December.

A group of MPs with the opposition Democratic party has argued that an “incisive action of prevention” is now needed to stop this “continuous slaughter of women”, starting with education in schools.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mette Frederiksen joins Greenland's new and outgoing prime ministers, emphasising ‘cooperation, equality and security'

The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has put on a show of unity with Greenlandic leaders in her first visit to the Arctic island since Donald Trump's renewed threats to acquire the territory, saying that when Greenland is in a “difficult situation” so too are Denmark and Europe.

The Danish PM boarded an inspection ship on Thursday with Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after which they were due to hold a joint press conference expected to focus on unity and Arctic security.

Greenland's outgoing prime minister, Múte B Egede, was also onboard. The three leaders were pictured looking out to sea and perched on a helicopter while onboard the ocean-patrol vessel HDMS Vædderen.

In contrast to last week's visit by the US vice-president, JD Vance – which, after a diplomatic outcry, was limited to the US military base Pituffik and did not involve Greenlandic or Danish representatives – Frederiksen was greeted at the airport by Egede and went straight to the capital, Nuuk, where she met Nielsen.

On Wednesday, Frederiksen said: “When Greenland is in a difficult situation, the kingdom of Denmark and Europe are also in a difficult situation.

“Regardless of what discussions we may have down the road about our commonwealth, it is clear that with the pressure from the Americans on Greenland in relation to sovereignty, borders and the future, we must stand together.”

In a clear signal to Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to gain control of the autonomous territory, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, and has not ruled out military or economic force to do so, she said: “The USA will not take over Greenland. Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the USA will not take over Greenland. And that is, of course, also the message that we will say collectively over the next few days.”

On social media she posted a picture of herself alongside the incoming and outgoing leaders, with the message: “Cooperation. Equality. Security.”

Frederiksen's visit had initially been criticised by members of the governing coalition because the new government has not yet been officially approved. However, before her arrival, Nielsen said: “Denmark is our closest partner and it is natural we meet as soon as possible.”

The last time Frederiksen was in Greenland was in March 2024 on a joint visit with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.

As a former Danish colony, Greenland remains in the kingdom of Denmark, which continues to control the territory's foreign and security policies.

Greenland's long-running independence movement has been gaining momentum in recent months – momentum the Trump administration appears to be hoping to capitalise on – particularly after revelations over alleged mistreatment of Greenlanders by the Danish state.

But the threat of US intervention appears to have slowed down appetite in Greenland for a rapid move towards independence.

A general election last month resulted in the most US- and Trump-friendly party leaving coalition talks, after which the four other parties, led by Nielsen's Democrats, signed a coalition agreement hours before Vance touched down in Greenland last Friday.

Page one of the agreement stated: “Greenland belongs to us.”

Frederiksen's visit takes place amid reports from the US that the White House is preparing an estimate of what it would cost the government to control Greenland as a territory.

According to the Washington Post, the White House budget office is assessing the cost of running Greenland and working out an estimate of how much revenue could be earned from its natural resources.

Among the options on the table is to offer Greenland a higher figure in subsidies, approximately £500m a year, than Denmark currently does.

Speaking to US troops in Pituffik, Vance said the US had to gain control of Greenland to stop the threat of China and Russia, and claimed that Denmark had “not done a good job by the people of Greenland”.

In Washington, Trump claimed the US needed Greenland for “world peace”.

He said: “We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","California: sea lion attack on teenager raises fears of toxic algae poisoning","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/california-sea-lion-poisoning","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 01:47:00 GMT","

Animals affected by domoic acid are known to exhibit erratic behavior and poisonings are becoming frequent

A teenager was attacked by a sea lion in southern California, raising concerns that a recent increase in algae-induced poisonings among marine mammals could have elicited the erratic behavior.

Phoebe Beltran initially feared it was a shark when she was bitten repeatedly during a 1,000-yard swim test for the Junior Lifeguards cadet program in Long Beach on 30 March. Relatives onshore saw the sea lion pop its head out of the water before it swam away, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Beltran, 15, was briefly hospitalized and treated for injuries to her arm. Little could be done to determine why exactly the sea lion became unusually aggressive. But the act aligns with symptoms observed in animals afflicted by toxic algae, which has sickened hundreds of animals off the southern California coast since late February.

A surfer bitten by a sea lion near Oxnard in late March told CBS News he had never experienced anything like the terrifying altercation and that the animal's expression was “feral, almost demonic, devoid of the curiosity or playfulness I'd always associated with sea lions”.

“Although lethargy, disorientation, and abnormal neurologic behavior (seizures/tremoring) are typical primary behaviors for sea lions impacted by the neurotoxin, erratic and sometimes aggressive behavior can occur,” said Giancarlo Rulli, a spokesperson for the Marine Mammal Center, in an email. He added that bites by seals and sea lions were rare, but warned members of the public to always avoid engaging with marine life and to stay at least 150ft away from animals on beaches.

Responders with the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network, a consortium of experts and organizations that intervene when animals are in danger, have reported more than 100 calls a day as scores of sea lions and dolphins wash up on shores. The need has been so great in recent weeks, teams have had to make tragic decisions, helping only those with the best chance of survival.

If they receive treatment quickly, sea lions have a 50-65% chance of survival. For dolphins, ingesting the toxin is almost always deadly.

This is the fourth year in a row that there has been a major outbreak from domoic acid in California, a troubling development that is becoming more intense, common and unpredictable, according to Rulli. The most recent toxic algae bloom occurred earlier in the year than normal and has hit hardest along the coast between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.

The algae typically grows after a wind-driven upwelling that churns deep ocean water full of nutrients closer to the surface. Fish are first to ingest the acid produced by the algae, which then poisons the animals that eat them.

This year, the timing and location – with the first poisoning documented around 20 February near Malibu, California – has spurred questions over whether this could have been caused by debris from the Los Angeles fires that swept through the area in January.

But the climate crisis has long been a culprit of the rising risks, as increasing temperatures and changing ocean conditions help fuel the growth of this algae.

This year's early start to the issue comes just two years after the worst domoic acid bloom on record claimed the lives of at least 1,000 marine mammals along the southern California coast in just a single month. 
  “It does take an emotional toll in the field,” John Warner, chief executive officer of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles, said in a post shared by Noaa fisheries. “Year after year, it's getting tough. Each of our organizations is trying hard to get to as many animals as we can, but we don't have the resources to rescue every one that is out there.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

European markets and US futures dip sharply after news triggers sell-off across Asia

Global stocks have fallen sharply and the US dollar hit a six-month low after Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs against the US's global trade partners in a move that is expected to upend supply chains and cause economic turmoil.

European markets were down across the board on Thursday after a sharp sell-off across Asia and US futures signalled similar falls when Wall Street opens.

In London, the FTSE 100 fell 1.5%, Germany's Dax was down 2.3% and France's CAC was off 2.5%.

The dollar sank nearly 2% against a basket of foreign currencies including the pound, which was up more than a cent and a half at $1.3148. Deutsche Bank sent a note warning clients to “beware a dollar confidence crisis”.

City of London investors raised bets on interest rate cuts by central banks, as policymakers try to fend off a global recession. The money markets are now pricing in a 92% chance that the European Central Bank cuts eurozone interest rates at its meeting later this month, up from 80% on Wednesday.

The chances of a Bank of England rate cut in early May have also risen, to 77%.

It followed a major sell-off in Asia where trading partners were hit with some of the highest tariff rises above the baseline 10% applied to imports from all countries selling goods to the US.

Overnight, Japan's Nikkei and Topix fell 3.3% and 3.5%, respectively after the US president applied a 24% tariff on the country. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.9%, while the stock market in Vietnam – which was hit with 46% tariffs – tumbled 6.7%.

US futures also suffered, with the Dow futures pointing at losses of 2.7% and the broader S&P 500 futures falling about 3.4%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 3.8% pre-market.

Futures for Nasdaq were the hardest hit of the three main markets, down 3.5%, with constituents such as Apple – which still has large exposure to China – plunging 7%. Nike took a similar dive of 7.3%, the AI chip maker Nvidia dropped 5.6% and Tesla tanked more than 8%.

Adam Hetts, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said markets were unlikely to calm down anytime soon.

“Eye-watering tariffs on a country-by-country basis scream ‘negotiation tactic', which will keep markets on edge for the foreseeable future,” he said. “Fortunately, this means there's substantial room for lower tariffs from here, albeit with a 10% baseline in place.”

“We've seen the administration have a surprisingly high tolerance for market pain, now the big question is how much tolerance it has for true economic pain as negotiations unfold.”

Oil prices also fell, with a barrel of Brent crude down 5.8% at $70.61 amid fears that sweeping tariffs would trigger a global recession, dampening energy demand.

Meanwhile, investors flocked to “safe” assets, such as gold, for which prices reached a record high of $3,167.50 overnight.

Tony Sycamore, an IG market analyst, said: “The tariff rates unveiled this morning far exceed baseline expectations, and if they aren't negotiated down promptly, expectations for a recession in the US will rise dramatically.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jonathan Reynolds tells MPs he is keeping ‘all options on the table' after Trump's announcement of import taxes on British goods

The UK has launched a formal process to retaliate against Donald Trump's tariffs if it does not secure a trade deal with the US, the business secretary has said.

Jonathan Reynolds told the Commons he was taking the first step towards retaliatory action against the US so as “to keep all options on the table”.

The trade department published a 417-page list of US products on which it could impose tariffs, including meat, fish and dairy products, whiskey and rum, clothing, motorcycles and musical instruments.

The tariffs, if implemented, could hit familiar brands such as Jack Daniel's whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorbikes.

It is the first time the UK government has explicitly threatened to retaliate, and follows Trump's announcement that he will introduce a blanket 10% import tax on British goods and 25% on cars.

Reynolds said ministers were still pursuing an economic deal with the US as the priority but “we do reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal is not secured”.

Officials will consult businesses on possible retaliatory measures over the next four weeks, until 1 May.

“To enable the UK to have every option open to us in future, I am today launching a request for input on the implications for British businesses of possible retaliatory action,” Reynolds said. “This is a formal step, necessary for us to keep all options on the table.

“This exercise will also give businesses the chance to have their say and influence the design of any possible UK action.”

The measure will be withdrawn if a deal with the US is struck. “If we are in a position to agree an economic deal with the US that lifts the tariffs that have been placed on our industries, this request for input will be paused, and any measures flowing from that will be lifted,” Reynolds told MPs.

Ministers are hopeful about the prospect of striking a speedy economic deal that would lift the US tariffs on the UK. Downing Street said negotiations with the US over an economic deal were at an “advanced stage”.

“Our focus is to negotiate this economic deal with the US, but not taking any options off the table, and we'll continue to respond in a way that serves UK interests,” the prime minister's spokesperson said.

On Wednesday night, Trump unveiled sweeping US import taxes on countries worldwide, in a move that experts say will change the global economic landscape.

UK ministers have taken heart from the fact that 10% is the lowest tariff that has been imposed by the US, compared with 20% for the EU.

Keir Starmer convened heads of business in Downing Street on Thursday morning and told them that “clearly there will be an economic impact” from US tariffs but that ministers would respond with “cool and calm heads”.

The prime minister told business officials that Trump “acted for his country, and that is his mandate. Today, I will act in Britain's interests with mine.” He said that while the tariffs were “a challenge”, the UK was in a “better position than a lot of other countries”.

Speaking to reporters at Labour's local elections launch later on Thursday, the prime minister defended his decision not to pursue immediate retaliation against the US. “I don't think we should jump straight into a trade war,” he said. “I think it is better if we're able to negotiate a better outcome, and that's what we are attempting to do.”

The move to prepare retaliatory action still risks angering the Trump administration, however. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warned countries on Wednesday night not to retaliate and said that “as long as you don't retaliate this is the high end of the number”.

Asked about Bessent's remarks, Reynolds said that while the ministers would “give ourselves the tools that we need to respond”, they were still focused on securing a deal.

“Whilst we have a chance of making the relationship between the UK and US even stronger than it is, the message I get very strongly from businesses is remain at the table, don't overreact, stick with the calm-headed approach the government has had to date and we're going to do that,” Reynolds told Sky News.

“I hope perhaps if we are successful there will be a template for other countries to resolve some of these issues.”

He struck an optimistic tone and said he “absolutely” believed a deal could be done. “We have been able to progress talks on a range of areas on a timescale which to be honest has delivered in days and weeks more progress than we've had in years,” he told LBC.

Reynolds revealed, however, that Trump's team had raised objections to UK food safety standards, reigniting long-running tensions over the UK's ban on US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.

“We have a food standards regime which we're very committed to in the UK which they have some objections to. So they put a number of factors into this,” Reynolds told BBC Breakfast.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President says ‘nothing can be ruled out' in response to US measures

Macron says he agrees with EU leaders that “nothing can be ruled out” in response to Trump's move as “all instruments are on the table.”

“We must do whatever is effective and most proportionate … but which also clearly shows we are determined to … not have these sectors fall victim to these tariffs,” he says.

Among available tools, he pointedly makes a reference to a potential intervention on digital services, “where the United States benefits enormously from Europe.”

At one point he calls for a suspension of new and recently announced French investments in the US until tariffs are clarified, saying that continuing with investments while being hit by tariffs would send a wrong message.

He also urges leaders to stay united, and resist temptation to “go alone” but to leverage the size of the European market in any policy response instead.

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

French president Emmanuel Macron called US tariffs imposed against the EU “brutal and unfounded” (16:32), as he urged leaders to do “whatever is effective and most proportionate” in response, suggesting a potential intervention on digital services and suspension of French investments in the US until the tariffs get clarified (16:54, 17:28).

Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez accused Donald Trump for “plunging” the world into an “unfair and unjustified crisis,” as he announced plans for a Covid-like €14.1bn “response and commercial relaunch plan” to support the Spanish economy (13:22).

Irish prime minister Micheál Martin said he “deeply regreted” US tariffs and he saw “no justification” for them as he repeatedly talked about the need to “negotiate way forward” with the US to protect the Irish economy (13:58) amid growing fears that the pharmaceutical industry could be the next target of Trump's interventions (13:50).

Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson suggested that the US announcements last night should be seen as a starting point for negotiations, with ultimate aim of driving them as much down as possible (15:38).

EU leaders spoke in similar tone, with EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič saying he would speak with US counterparts on Friday (12:32).

Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán confirmed plans to withdraw Hungary from the international crime court after accusing it of “becoming a political court” while speaking at a joint press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is subject to an ICC arrest warrant (13:16).

Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has put on a show of unity with Greenlandic leaders in her first visit to the Arctic island since Donald Trump's renewed threats to acquire the territory (9:44), saying that when Greenland is in a “difficult situation” so too are Denmark and Europe (15:43). Meanwhile in Brussels, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen made it clear to US state secretary that Denmark would oppose all US claims for control of Greenland (18:12).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa.

Meanwhile in Brussels, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said he told US state secretary Marco Rubio that repeated comments about Donald Trump's intention to take control over Greenland were “untenable”.

Speaking after the pair met on the sidelines of the Nato ministerial in Brussels, he said Trump's comments were at odds with international law and “challenged” Denmark's sovereignty.

He added while Denmark was open to discussions with the US on issues of mutual interests, he was clear that it would oppose any US claims on Greenland .

The minister also said he reminded Rubio of the 1951 defence treaty which gives the US options to increase military presence on the island within the existing framework. He said that at one point there were over 1,000 US soldiers in Greenland, while now it's less than 200, a decision made by the US.

His comments were reported by multiple Danish media.

In the US readout, the US Department of State said that Rubio “reaffirmed the strong relationship” with Denmark, and the leaders discussed Nato and threats to the alliance, including from Russia and China.

The French president has offered one of the more hawkish responses to Trump's announcements overnight. Expect his proposal for suspending recent and new French investments in the US until there is more clarity on tariffs to get a lot of attention.

His and his spokesperson's repeated references to a potential digital services tax against US tech giants will also be surely noticed in the White House – even as it is clear that there isn't unanimity on this with Ireland, where most tech companies have their EU headquarters, openly against this idea.

Macron says he agrees with EU leaders that “nothing can be ruled out” in response to Trump's move as “all instruments are on the table.”

“We must do whatever is effective and most proportionate … but which also clearly shows we are determined to … not have these sectors fall victim to these tariffs,” he says.

Among available tools, he pointedly makes a reference to a potential intervention on digital services, “where the United States benefits enormously from Europe.”

At one point he calls for a suspension of new and recently announced French investments in the US until tariffs are clarified, saying that continuing with investments while being hit by tariffs would send a wrong message.

He also urges leaders to stay united, and resist temptation to “go alone” but to leverage the size of the European market in any policy response instead.

French president Emmanuel Macron is now addressing a meeting of business leaders talking about how to best protect the French economy following Donald Trump's tariffs.

He opens by saying the US president's decision was “brutal and unfounded,” as he expresses concern about the tariffs' “massive” impact on France and its overseas territories and Europe more broadly.

He signals there will need to be an answer to this move.

EU officials have denounced the indiscriminate nature of tariffs Donald Trump has imposed on some of the world's poorest countries as a “deplorable move”.

“To see countries like Lesotho, Cambodia, Bangladesh hit the hardest by US tariffs is absolutely deplorable and is something that is extremely difficult for us to comprehend,” said one.

“These are not countries that are producing semiconductors, these are not countries that are producing cars. They produce things that the US may not produce coffee, bananas or other things. So these do not represent a threat,” they said.

The EU's says if negotiations fail and it imposes counter tariffs, they will be targeted in a “smart way”.

The officials have also confirmed it would not ever contemplate messing with food standards to address Trump's complaint last night over “non tariff barriers”, seen as a reference to rules banning US hormone fed beef and chlorinated chicken in the EU.

“We do not lower our standards. So whenever we protect consumers, protect the environment, we have legitimate legislation that is non discriminatory, which is the basic test in trade law. We do not discriminate against anyone. We design our rules in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization. We do not lower the level of protection of food, for example, in any negotiation, certainly not in this negotiation,” said a senior insider.

The EU is refusing to comment on the details of its retaliatory response saying it has to analyse the impact first but that everything “remains on the table” including measures that could see US tech companies unable to charge for their intellectual property for software.

The bloc is facing three types of tariffs – tariffs on aluminium and steel Trump announced last month, last night's 25% tariff and cars and the 20% blanket tariff on exports.

It has now concluded its response on aluminium and steel which will be put to a vote next Wednesday with analysis of the other two tariffs expected to take weeks.

Over in France, president Emmanuel Macron will soon be meeting with representatives of sectors hit by US tariffs.

According to media reports, the meeting – expected to start 4pm local time – will bring together business leaders from aerospace industry, agriculture, wine, chemicals, electronic and metallurgy, among others.

French prime minister François Bayrou will also be there, with numerous ministers.

The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has put on a show of unity with Greenlandic leaders in her first visit to the Arctic island since Donald Trump's renewed threats to acquire the territory, saying that when Greenland is in a “difficult situation” so too are Denmark and Europe.

The Danish PM boarded an inspection ship on Thursday with Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after which they were due to hold a joint press conference expected to focus on unity and Arctic security.

Greenland's outgoing prime minister, Múte B Egede, was also onboard. The three leaders were pictured looking out to sea and perched on a helicopter while onboard the ocean-patrol vessel HDMS Vædderen.

In contrast to last week's visit by the US vice-president, JD Vance – which, after a diplomatic outcry, was limited to the US military base Pituffik and did not involve Greenlandic or Danish representatives – Frederiksen was greeted at the airport by Egede and went straight to the capital, Nuuk, where she met Nielsen.

On social media she posted a picture of herself alongside the incoming and outgoing leaders, with the message: “Cooperation. Equality. Security.”

Earlier today I flagged the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen's much anticipated visit to Greenland (9:44), so let's get an update on that from our Nordic correspondent, Miranda Bryant.

Sweden sees the US announcement of tariffs as the start of negotiations, in which the Nordic country aims to ultimately get as low tariffs as possible, prime minister Ulf Kristersson said.

In a wide-ranging speech responding to the move, he said:

“We are ready to retaliate. Our preferred option is of course to negotiate a deal. We don't want growing trade barriers. We don't want a trade war.

If this fails, the EU stands ready with countermeasures. And we are big trading power globally. 

But our goal is not retaliation, but to lower tariffs and increase trade – with the US and with other countries. That is what made our populations more prosperous and the world safer.”

Pivoting to broader policy challenges, he stressed that “the rules-based order that we have operated within since the second world war is now on shaky ground.”

He set his three priorities – increasing immediate support for Ukraine, boosting military and defence, and increasing competitiveness – rejecting dismissive comments about Europe's future.

“Europe is certainly not perfect, but we do have agency over our own future,” he said.

He added:

“If EU manages to reform while others either are banned from global trade or isolate themselves from global trade – then Europe will be a winner. 

The world needs and deserves a European renaissance. Sweden will do our part of it.”

Let's bring you some more comments from Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez's speech earlier.

He said Spain would move past “this unfair and unjustified crisis into which some people have decided to plunge the world” and would not allow itself to be “dragged into zero-sum-game thinking or into a way of seeing the world that is guided by fear, disinformation and short-termism”.

In a final rebuke to Trump, he added:

“We will continue to push for a just distribution of wealth, for environmental sustainability and for equality between men and women.

We will keep working for European integration, we will keep defending multilateralism, we will keep opening ourselves to the world, and we will keep looking for partners who respect our interests and who also share our values.”

Micheál Martin gets asked specifically about the potential problems for the country's pharmaceutical industry (13.50).

He says his government needs to “maintain engagement” with US officials to “convey the complexity of the pharmaceutical story,” as he points out that Ireland operates “as part of a complex supply chain” with “physical infrastructure” that is “not easily relocatable overnight.”

He warns there is “a real danger of undermining your own companies, the US companies, by proceeding precipitously or in a premature way.”

He also is asked about proposals to introduce a European digital services tax.

“We do not favour a digital services tax,” he says, adding that the EU's response needs to be “considered … measured,” and “one that is clearly calculated and calibrated not to bring more damage upon the European economy and European citizens.”

“The desired outcome is negotiations between the US and the European Union,” he says.

And that concludes their press conference.

Elaborating on the EU's planned response to US tariffs, EU commissioner McGrath expands a bit by saying the focus is on “on preventing the harm rather than responding to the harm.”

“We're still in a scenario where we're looking at potential [harm], and while sentiment is immediate and uncertainty has immediate impacts, the direct impact of tariffs is something that will take some time to work its way through the system,” he says.

He also pushes back against Sánchez's suggestion to create an EU aid fund for companies affected, saying it is “premature.”

“When you talk about an EU fund, there aren't many potential sources of funding. Is it additional member state contributions? Is it new own resources? Is it collective borrowing? Is it reallocation of resources from one part of the budget to another? So we're not in that space, because our focus is on negotiations,” he says.

Martin and McGrath also get asked about Netanyahu's visit to Hungary earlier.

The Irish prime minister Martin says he is “concerned about trends within Hungary”, as he says “there are procedures there in term of dealing with member states who we believe have either transgressed the rule of law or are not really behaving in the full spirit of EU unity”.

“We've fully supported the ICC. We've provided significant funding, additional funding above any per capita contribution to the ICC. International rule of law is extremely important, and Ireland will continue to adhere to it,” he says.

Commissioner McGrath speaks in a similar vein, adding that “the concerns that we have in the Commission about rule of law related issues [in Hungary] are well documented.

“Unfortunately, this is another retrograde step from the Hungarian authorities. Let's see what happens over the period ahead,” he says.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Archaeologists say ‘catastrophic military event' took place at site where 129 bodies have been found so far

As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a football pitch in Vienna last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: a heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the first-century Roman empire, most likely the bodies of warriors killed in a battle involving Germanic tribes.

This week, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave – linked to “a catastrophic event in a military context” and evidence of the first known fighting in that region.

The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighbourhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of bodies could exceed 150 – a discovery they said would be unprecedented in central Europe.

Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig, said: “Within the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters. There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.”

Soldiers in the Roman empire were typically cremated until the third century.

The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganised dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury – to the head, torso and pelvis in particular.

Kristina Adler-Wölfl, the head of the Vienna city archaeological department, said: “They have various different battle wounds, which rules out execution. It is truly a battlefield. There are wounds from swords, lances; wounds from blunt trauma.”

The dead are all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.

Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between AD80 and AD130. That was cross-checked against artefacts found in the grave – armour, helmet cheek protectors and nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.

One of the biggest clues was the presence of a dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the first century and the start of the second.

So far, only one victim has been confirmed as a Roman legionary. Archaeologists hope DNA and strontium isotope analysis will help further identify the fighters, and whose side they were on.

Adler-Wölfl said: “The most likely theory at the moment is that this is connected to the Danube campaigns of Emperor Domitian – that's 86 to 96 AD.”

The archaeologists said they had also found signs of the founding of the settlement that would become Vienna.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow:


            The White House has fired at least three National Security Council staffers, three sources familiar with the move told CNN.
    


            The firings came after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist who once claimed 9/11 was an inside job, urged President Donald Trump during a Wednesday meeting to get rid of several members of his National Security Council staff, including his principal deputy national security adviser, claiming that they are disloyal. One of the sources said the firings were a direct result of the meeting with Loomer.
    


            Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Alex Wong was not among those who had been dismissed on Wednesday, however, one White House official speculated to CNN Thursday that Wong could be out as soon as today, though a final decision remains to be seen.
    


            Wong was one of the advisers specifically targeted by Loomer, who publicly questioned his loyalty to Trump and criticized him privately as a “Never Trumper.”
    


            One of the sources speculated that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz may have been reluctant to fire Wong because he has been embroiled in the controversy surrounding the leak of controversial Signal messages related to military strikes on Yemen that Waltz and his team have been under fire for initiating.
    


            The three officials fired include Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence and a former top staffer for now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Senate Intelligence Committee; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs who previously served as Waltz's legislative director in Congress; and David Feith, a senior director overseeing technology and national security who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.
    


            “NSC doesn't comment on personnel matters,” NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Waltz had been in the Oval Office for other meetings when Loomer arrived Wednesday for an audience with Trump and stayed as the president met with Loomer.
    


            “Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I'm going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump,” Loomer told CNN on Thursday. “It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security.”
    


            The Oval Office meeting with Loomer, which was first reported by The New York Times, took place as the president and his economic team were preparing the tariff announcement in the Rose Garden.
    


            Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff who was among the advisers who worked to control Loomer's access to Trump during the campaign, was present for the meeting, an aide said.
    


            It was unclear when the Loomer meeting was placed on the schedule, but the aide said the presence of Wiles and Sergio Gor, the head of presidential personnel, underscored that it was a sanctioned meeting.
    


            Gor, who is seen as one of the president's most loyal aides, has been among the advisers who has been fielding complaints from MAGA world about Waltz.

• Canada hits back: Canada announced it will levy a 25% counter-tariff on non-USMCA compliant vehicles imported from the US. The EU, another top US trade partner, is also preparing countermeasures.
    


            • Global markets rattled: US stock markets fell sharply Thursday, as did Asian and European markets. Meanwhile, gold hit a new record high as investors seek safer investments. Leading economists told CNN they feared the tariffs could lead to a global recession.
    


            The Trump administration's new package of tariffs, which by some measures are the highest in more than a century, could significantly hurt the United States' economy and have already triggered a huge selloff in global markets.
    


            Now, as countries are beginning to impose retaliatory measures to strike back at the US, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said President Donald Trump will not revise his plans.
    


                    “The president is not going to back off,” Lutnick told CNN's Pamela Brown in an interview Thursday. “Countries can fix their tariffs” and non-tariff trade barriers, which he said are “much, much rougher.”
                





            However, he did not offer any kind of immediate reward for countries that seek to change their current systems to satisfy the administration.
    


            “America has got to stop being exploited… and then, and only then, will Donald Trump make a deal with each country,” he said.
    


            His comments came as global financial markets experienced their worst trading day since the onset of the pandemic.
    


            The average American household will pay $2,100 more per year for goods because of the slew of new tariffs President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation said.
    


            Trump's plan will lead to a significant, $900 billion decline in America's imports, the Tax Foundation says. That decline will come as consumers shift to American goods — or simply choose not to buy certain items that will become too expensive.
    


            Nevertheless, Americans won't be able to avoid paying more as a result of tariffs. America's average import tax will surge to 19% this year from 2.5% last year — the highest rate since the Smoot-Hawley era in 1933. Fitch Ratings said the rate would rise even higher, sending America's effective tariff rate to its highest level in more than a century.
    


            As a result, Americans' after-tax incomes will decline 2.1% on average this year, the Tax Foundation said. Although no one will escape the tariffs, wealthier Americans' incomes will decline less, the group found.
    


            Mainstream economists largely agree the US and global economies will plunge into a recession this year if Trump doesn't loosen up his new trade policy. The Trump administration has been pushing back on those predictions, arguing Trump's trade actions in his first term were widely predicted to cause inflation to soar and the economy to slow — neither of which happened.
    


            However, Trump in his entire first term put in place tariffs on $380 billion worth of goods. Already, Trump has announced tariffs on more than $2.5 trillion of imports, and he has promised more tariffs are on their way.
    


            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said today that American farmers and ranchers “understand that there may be a short time of uncertainty” as President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on at least 10% across all countries — with even higher rates for 60 countries.
    


            Asked about the impact on foreign countries, Rollins pulled out a chart showing their exports and how it compares to the United States.
    


                    “This is what he's trying to fix,” Rollins told reporters outside the White House.
                





            “I'm not surprised there's some complaining, but at the end of the day, this president is committed to putting Americans first,” Rollins continued.
    


Here's what some lawmakers from agricultural states are saying about the tarriffs: 



CNN's Alison Main, Manu Raju and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed reporting to this post.



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio went straight to the airport to fly to Brussels after President Donald Trump's bombshell tariffs announcement, setting himself up for some potentially difficult discussions with NATO allies on Thursday, every single one of which was slapped with tariffs.
    


            Officials said the tariffs news was hanging over some of the conversations and meetings, meant to focus on more NATO-specific issues like defense spending and the war in Ukraine. There was no specific meeting planned on trade and economic issues so any chatter was taking place on the margins of the formal sessions.
    


                    “Obviously having this trade war going on makes it tough to do normal business,” said a Western official who told CNN that “it seems to be what most people are talking about.”
                





            “And if they are talking about tariffs,” the official continued, “it means they aren't talking about the other priorities NATO needs to focus on.”
    


            On the surface, Rubio appeared to have been greeted warmly by the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, and his NATO counterparts. As they gathered for a group photo, Rubio chatted easily with the others, warmly shaking hands and kissing Canada's foreign minister, Melanie Joly, on the cheeks.
    


            Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told CNN that the conversations have been “very constructive” and “very positive.”
    


                    “The tarrifs aren't the best news,” Valtonen said, “but I hope that this is an opening to a fruitful negotiation, especially between friends and allies, whereby we could reach a situation in which we effectively will let go of the existing trade barriers between us. Because that's what we need.”
                





            A senior European official downplayed the impact on the mood in Brussels, saying it hasn't colored the talks and officials were in fact making jokes about the news.
    


            As was the case at the recent G7 in Canada, which has been furious about Trump's eagerness to make Canada the 51st state, officials in Brussels appear to be focusing more on the issues they agree on and can advance.
    


            America's biggest trading partners promised retaliation for President Donald Trump's massive tariff announcement. The first major response has come in — from Canada.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada will levy a 25% counter-tariff on vehicles imported from the United States that are not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in response to US tariffs on Canadian vehicles and auto parts that went into effect today.
    


                    “As I told President Trump during our call last week, Canada will respond to the US auto tariffs, and today, I'm announcing that the Government of Canada will be responding by matching the US approach with 25% tariffs on all vehicles imported from the United States that are not compliant with CUSMA, our North American Free Trade Agreement,” Carney told reporters in Ottawa, using the Canadian acronym for the USMCA.
                





            The prime minister said there were no talks scheduled between him and Trump, but he would talk to the US president again “if appropriate.” Carney also said Canada's counter-tariffs would not affect auto parts.
    


            Though Carney said Canada still considers the US an ally in defense and security, his country “must be looking elsewhere to expand our trade, to build our economy and to protect our sovereignty.”
    


            “The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over,” Carney said.
    


            Carney added that the Canadian response will “not affect vehicle content from Mexico,” which the prime minister said is respecting the free trade agreements in place.
    


            “We take these measures reluctantly, and we take them in ways that it's intended and will cause maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact here in Canada,” Carney said, adding that Canada's other retaliatory tariffs will remain in place.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from Carney.



            Justice Department attorneys will appear before Judge James Boasberg this afternoon to make its case for why the Trump administration did not violate his orders halting the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans the government has accused of being part of a gang.



            The so-called show cause hearing represents the closest a federal judge has come to deciding whether the administration has defied a judicial command.
    


            While other judges around the US have considered in recent months whether the government violated their orders in disputes over federal funding and transgender rights, Thursday's hearing goes much further as it's the first step in Boasberg potentially holding officials in contempt and possibly ordering sanctions.
    


            The case has emerged as one of the highest-profile and most contentious court battles of President Donald Trump's second term, with the president calling for Boasberg's impeachment over his handling of the matter, leading to a rare rebuke of the rhetoric from Chief Justice John Roberts.
    


What the Trump administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance told Fox News earlier today that the Trump administration will keep up its legal battle over the president invoking the Alien Enemies Act.
    


            The administration last month filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court asking the justices to overturn Boasbergs order blocking further deportations under the act, after a similar appeal failed in DC Court of Appeals. The vice president said he thinks the Supreme Court will overrule the lower courts' decisions.
    


            This comes as the Trump administration in a court filing Monday conceded it had mistakenly deported a Maryland father to El Salvador. Vance on Thursday claimed the man had been part of the MS-13 gang, despite the man's attorneys saying he is not a member of nor has any ties to the MS-13 gang.

            Wall Street's fear gauge skyrocketed Thursday as investors express shock over President Donald Trump's historic tariff increase.
    


            While US markets and blue-chip stocks like Apple tumble, the VIX volatility index, also known as the “fear gauge,” surged 30%. It's on track for the biggest one-day increase since a Federal Reserve-fueled selloff in December.
    


            “The market is saying this isn't just bad economics, it's bad mathematics,” Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital, told CNN in a phone interview.
    


            Block pointed to the dubious way the Trump administration appeared to have calculated its reciprocal tariffs.
    


            “They're ignoring every rule of classic micro and macroeconomics. This is the policymaking equivalent of a suicide bomber,” Block said.
    


            Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNN many investors assumed in the past that Trump was just using tariffs as a negotiating tool.
    


            “Now the market is saying, ‘Wait. This is actually happening. We should have taken him at his word,'” Sonders said. “What we weren't liberated from yesterday is uncertainty,” she added, referencing Trump's branding of Wednesday as “Liberation Day.”



            Sonders added that the actual tariff announcement was far more aggressive than Wall Street was bracing for.
    


                    “We didn't even get worst-case. We got worse than the worst-case scenario,” Sonders said.
                





            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz “agreed to strengthen the diverse trade relationship” between their two countries after a call Thursday morning, Carney said.
    


                    “As we face the crisis caused by President Trump's tariffs, reliable trade partners are more important than ever,” Carney wrote on social media.
                





            Carney has made a point of turning to other countries as alternative trade and security partners to reduce Canada's reliance on the United States.
    


            The prime minister — who assumed the role after his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, announced his resignation in January — visited France and the United Kingdom for his first trip abroad, and days later announced a deal with Australia for military radar.
    


            Apple shares tumbled nearly 9% Thursday morning, following tech stocks and wider markets lower in the wake of President Donald Trump's massive tariff announcements on Wednesday.
    


            Many tech giants, including the iPhone maker, produce gadgets abroad in places like China, Vietnam and India, and could take a significant hit from tariffs when importing those goods for US consumers.
    


            Around 90 minutes after the market opened on Thursday, Apple stock was down 9%, Microsoft stock was down 3%, Meta stock was down 8%, Amazon stock was down 9%, Google stock was down 4% and Tesla stock was down 7%.
    


            If Apple's stock price ends Thursday at the same level, it will mark its largest one-day decline since March 12, 2020, when businesses across the globe shut down because of the pandemic. Thursday's share price decline shaved more than $293 billion off Apple's market value compared to Wednesday's close. The company's valuation is down $800 billion from its all-time high.
    


            Apple, which had been struggling with sluggish iPhone sales in recent years, could feel the pain from tariffs even more than its fellow tech giants.
    


                    “No doubt that if the tariffs stick, it will have a negative impact on (Apple's) fundamentals, with downside to margin and earnings expectations,” CFRA Research Analyst Angelo Zino said in emailed commentary Thursday.
                





            Zino added that Apple is likely to handle tariffs by attempting to increase supply chain efficiencies, eating some of the cost itself and raising costs for customers. But the company “will have a tough time passing through more than 5%-10% of the costs to consumers … and any major increase could have a detrimental impact to revenue,” he said.
    


            Gary Friedman, the CEO of luxury furniture retailer Restoration Hardware, was on a conference call with analysts discussing the company's reported quarterly earnings Wednesday when news broke of Trump's tariffs.
    


                    “Oh, sh*t. OK,” Friedman said as he watched Restoration Hardware's (RH) stock plunge. 
                





            RH gets a huge chunk of its merchandise from Asia, and the company is highly exposed to Trump's levies on China, Vietnam, Taiwan and other Asian countries.
    


            “It got hit when I think the tariffs came out,” he said. “And everybody can see in our (annual report) where we're sourcing from, so it's not a secret, and we're not trying to disguise it.”
    


            RH's shares plunged more than 40% during early trading Thursday, on track for the worst day in company history.
    


                    “This move is quite stunning,” Friedman said of Trump's tariff announcement. “It's going to force everyone to just play a different game.”
                





            Retail stocks are in free fall Thursday, as much of the industry is heavily reliant on imports and will be damaged by the tariffs. Large global clothing, footwear, home goods and other brands source nearly all of their products from outside the United States.
    


            Best Buy, Lululemon, Macy's and other chains plunged by double-digits and were among the worst performers on the S&P 500 Thursday.
    


            Some Republican senators struggled today to defend the short-term strain on Americans from President Donald Trump's newly announced sweeping global tariff policies. They argued that it could help Americans in the long run even as they were worried about the immediate impact on prices.
    


Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said he still had “a lot of questions” about how the tariffs will be rolled out, adding that some products will “benefit” while tariffs will be a “detriment” for others, like “clothing, electronics, some of those things that are only made overseas now.”
    


            Lankford conceded “there will be short-term impact. There's no doubt.” Pressed by CNN on Trump's campaign promise to lower prices, Lankford responded, “I think you've got to be able to take it where he means it on that,” pointing to egg prices now declining from exceedingly high levels.
    


Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has been “concerned” about tariffs, said he's willing to give Trump “the benefit of the doubt,” adding “there's no doubt that we've lost critical manufacturing overseas.”
    


            He called tariffs a “double-edged sword,” saying Trump has used the policy effectively in the past and is announcing investments in the US, as well as lowering barriers to trade with other countries. Pressed on how long he's willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, Johnson answered, “I can't predict that.”
    


Sen. Rick Scott blamed “fiscal insanity,” driven by increased spending, for the inflation that is putting a strain on Americans' pocketbooks, adding he's “really excited” about Trump's tariff announcement.  The Florida Republican said his focus in campaigns has been on “how do we get more American jobs? That's what this is going to do.”
    


Republican Leader John Thune, who hails from the agricultural state of South Dakota, said the short-term market reaction to Trump's tariffs proposal was not “unexpected” even as he cautioned there must be vigilance to make sure certain sectors of the economy aren't damaged by the long-term impacts of the tariffs.
    


            The White House fired at least three National Security Council staffers on Wednesday, three sources familiar with the move told CNN.
    


            The firings came after a meeting in which far-right activist Laura Loomer, who once claimed 9/11 was an inside job, urged President Donald Trump to get rid of some National Security Council staff, including his principal deputy national security adviser, claiming they are disloyal. One of the sources said the firings were a direct result of the meeting with Loomer.
    


            It was not immediately apparent on Thursday whether principal deputy national security adviser Alex Wong was among those who had been dismissed. One of the sources speculated that national security adviser Michael Waltz may have been reluctant to fire him because he has been embroiled in the controversy surrounding the recent Signal chat debacle.
    


            The three officials include Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence and a former top staffer for now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Senate Intelligence Committee; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs who previously served as Waltz's legislative director in Congress; and David Feith, a senior director overseeing technology and national security who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.
    


            CNN has reached out to the National Security Council.
    


            Waltz had been in the Oval Office for other meetings when Loomer arrived Wednesday for a private audience with Trump and stayed as the president met with Loomer.
    


            Loomer told CNN on Thursday that she wasn't divulging details of the Oval Office meeting out of respect for Trump.
    


            Volkswagen has told its US dealers that cars it imports from Europe and Mexico will now break out the cost of the 25% tariffs imposed this week on the stickers that consumers look at when shopping for a car.
    


            While Volkswagen does make the electric ID.4  and the gasoline powered Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport for the US market at a plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which together made up about a third of its US sales last year. But other models will be hit with the tariffs on imported vehicles that went into effect early Thursday. It imports the Volkswagen Jetta, Taos and Tiguan from a plant in Mexico, and other models from Germany.
    


                    “We have our dealers' and customers' best interests at heart, and once we have quantified the impact on the business we will share our strategy with our dealers,” a VW spokesperson said in a statement. The “extra import fee” plans were first reported by Automotive News. 
                





Keep in mind: VW's US dealers have a 50- to 60-day supply of new-vehicle inventory, and those vehicles, and those already in the United States and in transit to dealers, will not be hit with the 25% tariff, and thus will not have the fee added to its sticker price.
    


            The tariffs could add thousands of dollars to the cost of all imported vehicles. For example the Taos small SUV has a manufacturer's suggested list price of about $25,000. Tariffs can be somewhat lowered by the value of the American parts used to build a vehicle in Canada and Mexico but the Taos has only about 15% US content, according to US government data. So the Taos could be hit with about $5,000 in tariff costs.
    


            The situation remains fluid, but VW told Automotive News that the tariffs have caused anxiety among dealers and consumers.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration will reach a deal on TikTok before the April 5 deadline – assuring that they are in “a good place” but reluctant to get ahead of President Trump on any official announcement.
    


                    “It'll come out before the deadline,” Vance told Fox & Friends. “We got a couple days to continue working on it, to finalize some things, and of course, we are going to let the president announce what we ultimately decide.”
                





            Addressing potential security concerns from the app's existence on US devices, Vance said, “You want to make sure that the TikTok app in the United States is not spying on people.”
    


            But he said that has to balance with the large number of Americans who use and enjoy TikTok.
    


            “We got to accomplish both of those things. I think that we're in a good place. We're going to keep on working at it, but I'll let the President make that announcement,” Vance said.
    


            As CNN reported, advisers to Trump, including Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick presented the president with options for a deal to invest in TikTok on Wednesday, including a number of well-heeled venture capital, private equity funds and tech companies.
    


            Oil prices plunged on Thursday on worries that President Donald Trump's trade war will slow the world economy and that OPEC is oversupplying the market.
    


            US oil futures plummeted 7% to $66.52 a barrel, leaving crude on track for its worst day since July 2022. Brent crude, the world benchmark, tumbled 6%.
    


            OPEC+ surprised investors on Thursday by announcing Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members have agreed to sharply accelerate previously scheduled production increases starting in May.
    


            The unexpected move by OPEC+ amplified concerns about the economic fallout of Trump's massive tariff escalation.
    


                    “It's a demand destruction event and it's going to disrupt the supply chain. The market is concerned about the threat of recession, inflation and unemployment,” Robert Yawger, executive director at Mizuho Securities, told CNN on Thursday.
                





            If the intensifying trade war slows the flow of goods and services, it will hurt demand for energy like crude oil.
    


            “The good news is prices at the pump will go down. But if we're going into recession, you won't be going to the pump as much,” Yawger said.
    


            Stellantis says it has “paused production” at some of its Canadian and Mexican auto assembly plants due to the newly announced tariffs, and that as a result, some US workers will also be temporarily laid off.
    


            Stellantis said that 900 US hourly employees who make powertrains and stampings that supply the affected Canadian and Mexican plants will be among those laid-off due to reduced production prompted by the tariffs. They work at five different Midwest plants — the Warren Stamping and Sterling Stamping plants in Michigan, as well as the Indiana Transmission Plant, Kokomo Transmission Plant and Kokomo Casting Plant, all in Kokomo, Indiana.
    


            The assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, which produces the Chrysler Pacifica and Voyager, and Dodge Charge Daytona, will be closed for two weeks starting Monday, and the assembly plant in Toluca, Mexico, which makes the Jeep Compass and electric Wagoneer S, will be closed for the rest of April, also starting Monday.
    


                    “We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,” said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis' chief operating officer for the Americas, in a memo to Stellantis' North American employees. “Those actions will impact some employees at several of our US powertrain and stamping facilities that support those operations.”
                





            US stocks opened sharply lower on Thursday as global markets were severely rattled by President Donald Trump's tariffs, which threaten to plunge the US and the rest of the world into a recession.
    


            The Dow fell 1,500 points, or 3.6%, in morning trading. The broader S&P 500 index was 3.95% lower, hitting its lowest level since September and on pace for its worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 4.9%.
    


Global markets also tumbled Thursday. Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 2.34% and Germany's DAX index was down 2.29%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index sank 2.77% and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell 1.52%.
    


            The significant declines come after Trump's massive tariffs imposed on practically all goods coming into the United States sparked fears that the new policy could trigger significant backlash from trading partners and take down the global economy.
    


            Stocks leading US markets lower included companies that rely on international supply chains that will be subject tariffs. Apple (AAPL) sank 9%. Nike (NKE) tumbled 13%. Ralph Lauren (RL) and Best Buy (BBY) each plunged 16%.
    


            Investors poured money into safe-haven assets. Gold surged to a new record Wednesday above $3,160 a troy ounce, and Treasury bond yields fell sharply. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since October. Bonds and prices trade in opposite directions. Gold, which hovered above $3,100 a troy ounce Thursday morning, is up 19% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said that Elon Musk will remain an adviser and friend to himself and President Donald Trump, even after his time as a special government employee ends after 130 days.
    


                    “DOGE has got a lot of work to do, and yeah, that work is going to continue after Elon leaves,” Vance told Fox & Friends in an interview on Wednesday.
                





            Vance also called Politico reporting that Trump was telling members of his inner circle, including Cabinet officials, that Musk will leave soon “total fake news.”
    


            “Elon came in and we said, we need you to make government more efficient. We need you to shrink the incredible fast bureaucracy that thwarts the will of the American people but also cost way too much money. And we said, that's going to take about six months, and that's what Elon signed up for,” Vance said.
    


            “But of course, he's going to continue to be an adviser. And by the way, the work of DOGE is not even close to done. The work of Elon is not even close to done,” Vance added.
    


            Asked about his own presidential ambitions, Vance said that he and Trump would cross that bridge when they come to it in 2028. This comes as Trump said “there are methods” for seeking a third term and that he is “not joking” about it.
    


            The day after announcing expansive new tariffs in a major escalation of his trade war, President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed “the operation is over,” adding, “The patient lived, and is healing.”
    


            “The prognosis is that the patient will be far stronger, bigger, better and more resilient than ever before. Make America Great Again!!!” he claimed.
    


            On Wednesday, Trump declared a US economic emergency and announced tariffs of at least 10% across all countries, with rates even higher for 60 countries or trading blocs that have a high trade deficit with the US.
    


            Stock markets across Asia-Pacific and Europe fell Thursday after the announcement.

China has vowed to retaliate against President Donald Trump's new tariffs on its exports to the US, a move Beijing labeled ""unilateral bullying."" Trump increased tariffs on all Chinese imports into the US to 54%, in a move poised to escalate a trade war between the world's two largest economies. #cnn #news #tariffs #china


            Trade associations representing an array of industries in Europe have been scathing toward US President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on the continent.
    


            Trump's tariffs are a “fundamental turning point in trade policy,” the head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said Thursday. All car imports entering the US will now face a universal 25% tariff, while all other exports from the European Union will be hit with a 20% tariff.
    


                    “It represents the US's departure from the rules-based global trading order – and thus a departure from the foundation for global value creation and corresponding growth and prosperity in many regions of the world. This is not America first; this is America alone,” VDA president Hildegard Müller said.
                





            The Spanish Wine Federation (FEV) said the 20% tariff on EU products will deal a “significant blow” to Spain's wine industry and lead to higher prices for US consumers.
    


            “The tariffs announced by the US are completely unjustified in the specific case of wine, considering that the current tariff gap between the tariffs applied by the EU and the US is minimal,” FEV Director José Luis Benítez said in a statement Thursday.
    


            The Irish Farmers' Association said the tariffs would “impact the competitiveness” of Irish products, like Kerrygold butter.
    


            “Kerrygold is now the second best-selling butter brand in the US, where we sent almost 500 million euros (about $554 million) worth of product in 2024. The market accounts for about 7.5% of our total dairy exports,” it said in a statement.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a CNN interview Thursday tried to calm investors' worries about the impact of President Donald Trump‘s Wednesday announcement he will impose tariffs of at least 10% across all countries.
    


            “To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump,” Leavitt said. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term.”
    


                    “This is a common-sense policy. And if these countries wanted to negotiate, if these countries wanted to do what's right, they've had 70 years to do it,” the press secretary added. “Instead, they have been ripping off American workers. And President Trump has made it very clear that this is a policy he was going to implement.”
                





            When asked if there is any chance Trump will pull back on implementing these tariffs before they go into effect this weekend, Leavitt said, “The president made it clear yesterday this is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency. He's always willing to pick up the phone to answer calls, but he laid out the case yesterday for why we are doing this.”
    


            Leavitt said the president would not reassess his strategy if the tariffs violate an article of the NATO treaty, telling CNN's Kate Bolduan, “The president is firm in his approach.”
    


More on tariffs: Leavitt encouraged people to “buy American.” She added that the White House is looking at options to ease the pain for Americans that Trump warned could come after the tariffs.
    


            “We're working on that every single day. The American people and the naysayers need to look at the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking,” Leavitt said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said the sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday are “a big change,” but a necessary one, railing against a “globalist economy” that has caused the United States to incur “a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us.”
    


            “We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture. That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America,” Vance told “Fox & Friends.”
    


                    “Right now, President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction. He ran on that. He promised it, and now he's delivering,” Vance continued. “Yes, this is a big change. I'm not going to shy away from it, but we needed a big change.”
                





            Vance said while the administration is “fighting very hard” to lower prices, change wouldn't happen overnight. He also seemed to suggest that high prices would be the result of inflation inherited from the Biden administration, rather than these new actions taken by Trump in office.
    


            As Republicans pursue a tax bill as part of Trump's agenda, Vance said he wouldn't view the tax cuts as a means to “offset” the tariffs, rather a “total shift” in economic policy that will reward American workers and companies.
    


            Bringing up his own background growing up poor in Ohio and Kentucky, Vance acknowledged how Americans are concerned about the cost of living.
    


            “I grew up in a family that often did live paycheck to paycheck, and we know a lot of Americans are worried, so we are fighting very hard to bring prices down,” Vance said.
    


            Stock markets on Thursday were severely rattled by President Donald Trump's historic tariff announcement, which threatens to plunge the US and global economies into a recession.
    


Dow futures tumbled 1,200 points, or 2.87%. The broader S&P 500 index was set to open 3.5% lower and was on pace for its worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was set to sink 4.2% at the open. Global markets also fell sharply Thursday.
    


            The significant declines come after Trump's massive tariffs imposed on practically all goods coming into the United States sparked fears that the new policy could trigger significant backlash from trading partners and take down the global economy.
    


            That's part of the reason the US dollar fell to its weakest level since October on Thursday. Tariffs in theory should boost the dollar, but investors' concerns that the United States is creating a self-inflicted wound that would stymie its long-term growth sent the dollar sinking against other global currencies.
    


            Similarly, investors poured money into safe-haven assets. Gold surged to a new record Wednesday above $3,160 a troy ounce, and Treasury bond yields fell sharply. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since October. Bonds and prices trade in opposite directions. Gold, which hovered above $3,060 a troy ounce Thursday morning, is up 19% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986.
    


“How did Trump calculate the first column of tariffs charged to the US?” Juan in Nicaragua asks. 



            At first, trade economists were flummoxed by how the tariffs had been calculated.
    


             But the crude methodology used by the White House to calculate the list of “reciprocal” global tariffs has since become clear.
    


            The Trump administration used a simple formula: It took each country's trade deficit with the US, divided it by the value of that country's exports to the US – and then divided this figure by half, in a gesture of “kindness.”
    


            Let's take this step-by-step, using official US data and the example of Vietnam, which President Donald Trump claimed imposed a 90% tariff on US goods and therefore would get a 46% “reciprocal” tariff of its own.
    


            In 2024, Vietnam, a massive and growing global manufacturing hub, sold $136.6 billion worth of goods to the US.
    


            Because Americans want to buy things like Nike shoes a lot more than Vietnamese want to buy things like Ford cars, the US sold a lot less to Vietnam. Vietnam bought just $13.1 billion of goods from the US that same year.
    


            Subtracting $13.1 billion from $136.6 billion gives Vietnam a trade surplus of $123.5 billion with the US. But one man's trade surplus is another man's trade deficit – which Trump has made clear he finds unpalatable, akin to being “ripped off.”
    


            Dividing the $123.5 billion by $136.6 billion (the value of Vietnam's exports to the US) gives 0.90 – or, in percentage terms, 90%. In a supposed act of “kindness,” Trump nearly halved this, meaning Vietnam will “only” now face a tariff of 46%.
    


            With few exceptions, the White House repeated this methodology for all countries on its tariff chart. To be clear, these countries are being punished for having trade surpluses with the US – not because they had imposed a “tariff” on goods traded with the world's largest economy.
    


            T﻿he trend was first pointed out by James Surowiecki, a financial writer, in a post on X.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US will remain in NATO as he stressed the importance of the strength of the alliance during remarks in Brussels, Belgium even after President Donald Trump has cast doubt on his support for the organization.
    


                    “As we speak right now the United States is as active in NATO as it has ever been, and some of this hysteria and hyperbole that I see in the global media and some domestic media in the United States about NATO is unwarranted. President Trump's made clear he supports NATO, we're going to remain in NATO, he's made clear,” Rubio said on Thursday.
                





            Rubio's comments surround concerns that the US will pull out of the alliance after President Donald Trump's willingness to embrace Russia's Vladimir Putin and casting doubt over whether he would defend NATO allies “if they don't pay.”
    


            Similar rhetoric came from Vice President JD Vance, who told European leaders they must “step up in a big way to provide for its own defense” during remarks in Munich in February. He also said the biggest threat to their security was “from within,” while using his first major speech at the Munich Security Conference to lambast European politicians.
    


            Rubio said he wants NATO to be stronger and have more capabilities among the US' partners.
    


            “We want NATO to be stronger. We want NATO to be more viable. And the only way NATO can get stronger and more viable is if our partners, the nation states that comprise this important alliance have more capability. This is a collection not just to partners and allies, but of advanced economies, of rich countries, who have the capability to do more. We understand that's a trade off. We have to do it every single year in our country,” he said.
    


            Rubio is in Brussels, where NATO is headquartered, for meetings with officials.
    


            Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the latest on Trump's presidency.
    


            While we'll be focusing on other developments today, tariffs are still a hot topic.
    


Cristina from Italy has asked, “Do tariffs apply retroactively to orders made before yesterday and not yet delivered?” 



            In response to your question, Cristina, typically tariffs are assessed in the United States once the goods being shipped arrive at one of the 328 points of entry into the US designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports. So it would not matter when the goods were loaded onto a ship.
    


            But upon looking into your question further, we discovered that there's an exception laid out in the executive order President Donald Trump signed yesterday.
    


            It states:
    


                    ”..rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, and entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty.”
                





            Now there are some practicality issues there, like how will CBP monitor all this? How can you verify when goods were loaded, etc. But theoretically, orders that haven't yet been delivered could escape some of the new tariffs set to go into effect.
    


Got questions for us about the tariffs? Ask us here.



Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described when tariffs will be assessed under Trump's new executive order. This post has been updated with details from the executive order.



            Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific and Europe fell Thursday and US markets were also set to open lower after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on trading partners around the world.
    


            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 2.8% down, while South Korea's Kospi index closed less than 1% lower.
    


            Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed 1.5% down. In Europe, the region's benchmark Stoxx 600 index was trading 2% lower at 6.45 a.m. ET, while France's CAC was 2.5% down and Germany's DAX fell more than 2%. London's FTSE 100 had fallen 1.5% by the same time.
    


            Falling US stock futures also pointed to a difficult day ahead.Dow futures were 2.8% down and S&P 500 futures 3.4% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was set to open 3.8% lower.
    


            What US President Donald Trump called “Liberation Day” would better be called “Inflation Day,” said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee.
    


            The tariffs unveiled by Trump “will really harm people on the ground,” Lange said Thursday at a news conference in Strasbourg, France.
    


            Lange called Trump's tariff announcement a “mess” that is “unfair” to producers in the United States, Europe and the Global South.
    


                    “President Trump called it ‘Liberation Day.' I will call it, ‘Inflation Day,' because it's totally clear that these tariffs will increase prices in the United States” and around the globe, Lange said.
                





            So, we've had a few hours to process exactly what these tariffs might look like — and their potential impact. But, there's a lot to unpack.
    


            If you still have questions, let us know what they are below and we'll try to answer them here.
    


            Leaders around the world are responding to US President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on virtually every country.
    


These are the latest countries to respond: 



This post has been updated with further reaction from international leaders.



            US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping global tariffs of at least 10% on imports from all countries, as well as increased tariffs on dozens of nations, from Nicaragua to Cambodia.
    


            The tariffs come on top of previously imposed taxes on imports of steel, aluminum and cars, which came into effect at midnight.
    


            The tariffs upend a century of American global trade policy and threaten to destabilize the world economy.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            The tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump target not only economic superpowers but also financial minnows. A White House list notes some territories with no economy, and no people, at all.
    


            That is the exact case of the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory in the southern Indian Ocean that was hit with a 10% tariff.
    


            Another Australian territory targeted by tariffs is the Cocos Islands. The territory of 600 people sends 32% of its exports – ships – to the US. They now face a 10% tariff.
    


            The Norwegian island of Jan Mayen faces 10% tariffs. But no one lives there permanently and it has an economy of zero.
    


Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean, has a population of about 1,600. It has an economy of about $8 million and exports of around $100,000, the CIA says. It too faces 10% tariffs.
    


            One enclave hit hard by Trump's tariffs is Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French territory of islands near the Canadian province of Newfoundland. Its exports – “processed crustaceans, shellfish,” according to the CIA World Factbook – are now subject to a whopping US tariff of 50%, way more than France faces (20%) as part of the European Union.
    


            The Marshall Islands in the North Pacific is a key American military installation. Washington is responsible for the defense of the islands under a Compact of Free Association. The CIA says it has exports of about $130 million a year, though the US is not listed as a top destination. Those now face 10% tariffs if coming to the US.
    


Read the full story.



            President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs will lead to higher costs for American families, the National Retail Federation warned.
    


            “Tariffs are a tax paid by the US importer that will be passed along to the end consumer,” David French, the trade organization's executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement yesterday. “Tariffs will not be paid by foreign countries or suppliers.”
    


            The immediate implementation of these tariffs is a “massive undertaking” and could negatively affect millions of US businesses, he noted. The tariffs are expected to have a disproportionate effect on local communities and, especially, small retailers.
    


                    “More tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for American businesses and consumers,” French said. “While leaders in Washington may not care about higher prices, hardworking American families do.”
                





            Earlier today, the NRF released its 2025 retail sales forecast, projecting growth of between 2.7% and 3.7% to between $5.42 trillion and $5.48 trillion, marking a likely pullback from the 3.6% annual sales growth notched last year.
    


            “It's the hard data on employment, income and tariff-induced inflation — not consumer sentiment — that supports our view of a slower trajectory for consumer spending,” Jack Kleinhenz, the NRF's chief economist, said in a statement.

Live Updates


            • Dangerous storms plow east: Intense and violent tornadoes have destroyed homes and farms in Missouri and Arkansas, as well as toppling a radio tower in Indiana. About 14 million people are under tornado watches from Ohio to Mississippi.
    


            • Once-in-a-lifetime flooding: Wednesday's storms will start multiple days of nearly nonstop rain that could trigger “generational” flooding in Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Mississippi, forecasters warned.
    


            • Supercharged rainfall: Climate change is making extreme rainfall more likely. It has intensified hourly rainfall rates in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, a recent study found.
    


Our live coverage of the storms impacting much of the central United States has moved here.



            One person is confirmed dead in Cape Girardeau following severe storms, though circumstances remain unclear, the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) told CNN.
    


            The MSHP said it cannot confirm whether the death was due to severe storm at the moment and more details will follow Thursday morning.
    


            A tornado watch is in effect for parts of northern Alabama, eastern Kentucky, northern Mississippi and central Tennessee until 6 a.m. C.T. Thursday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
    


            Nearly 6 million people are impacted by the watch, which includes Nashville, Tennessee, and Tupelo, Mississippi.
    


            A line of strong-to-severe thunderstorms will move across the watch area overnight. Even though there may be an overall weakening trend of the storms, they still could produce tornadoes with locally damaging gusts of up to 75 miles per hour, and hail of up to 1.5 inches in diameter.
    


            Currently, 15 million people are under tornado watches, from Ohio to Mississippi.
    


            Three people were rescued from the partially collapsed warehouse in Brownsburg, Indiana, which was hit by a tornado Wednesday night, officials told CNN.
    


            The collapse initially left two people missing and one trapped at the Sur La Table warehouse, Kamrick Holding, a spokesperson for the Brownsburg Fire Territory, said in a statement. The missing individuals were found by co-workers, with one transported to a trauma hospital in downtown Indianapolis, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast. Her condition remains undisclosed.
    


                    “The entrapped individual was awake and alert throughout the entire rescue efforts,” Holding said. “Crews worked diligently throughout the entire process to extricate the individual.” 
                





            The tornado caused at least one wall of the warehouse to collapse, and burst ceiling pipes flooded the floor, CNN affiliate WISH-TV reported.
    


            Four people who took shelter in a van were injured near a tornado-hit church in Ballard County, Kentucky, the local emergency management office said in a Facebook post.
    


            One member of the group was left in critical condition.
    


            “Four individuals sustained injuries when they attempted to take shelter in their vehicle under the carport of a church,” it said in the post.
    


                    “The church suffered a direct hit from debris, causing severe structural damage. All four individuals were transported to a local hospital, three with non-life-threatening injuries and one in critical condition.”
                





            A tornado tore through Carmel, Indiana, on Wednesday night, toppling a large radio tower downtown and ripping the front off a building, according to CNN affiliate WISH-TV.
    


            Trees were uprooted from the saturated ground, and video shared by the outlet appeared to capture the storm in east Carmel.
    


            The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning, while a tornado watch is in effect until 4 a.m. for southeastern Indiana, northern Kentucky and southwestern Ohio.
    


            Several vehicles are submerged in high waters in eastern Indianapolis, the city's police department said in a post on X.
    


            No one was trapped in the vehicles but police warned drivers not to “put your vehicle or your life at risk by driving into water.”
    

These are photos of vehicles in high water at Southeastern and S Sherman at 10:50 PM.  There were, thankfully, no people in the vehicles.Please don't put your vehicle or your life at risk by driving into water when you don't know how deep it is. https://t.co/hStcbpfHqL pic.twitter.com/vZrkaziE8n


            Several roads in Indianapolis may still be flooded after tonight's heavy storms, and police urged drivers to obey road closures and watch for hidden hazards such as debris in floodwaters.
    


            “Turn Around, Don't Drown. Never drive through floodwaters,” the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said in a separate post.
    


            There are reports of heavy damage, including to multiple homes, in Craighead County, northeastern Arkansas, after a dangerous tornado ripped through the area, according to county administrator Brandon Shrader.
    


            The severe storms “impacted multiple cities within the county,” Shrader said, including Bay, Lake City, Monette, Cash and Bono.
    


            Multiple houses were damaged in Monette and emergency responders assisted two people trapped in a home. Another person was injured due to a semi-truck rollover, the county administrator said.
    


            Lake City suffered heavy damage, which is currently “unspecified” while damage assessments are ongoing, Shrader said.
    


            There is no reported damage at this time in Cash or Bono, Shrader said. Bay has also not reported any damage “as of yet,” Shrader said, adding: “However, we can confirm a tornado touchdown on the outside of town.”
    


            No deaths have been reported in the county due to the storm at this time, he added.
    


                    “Our teams are actively evaluating the extent of the destruction and coordinating response efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of our residents,” Shrader continued.
                





            More than 200,000 customers are without power across Indiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.US, as intense and violent tornadoes plow through the central US.
    


            Here's the breakdown of customers without power as of 11:16 p.m. E.T.
    


            Separately, nearly 120,000 customers are without power in Michigan after being impacted by ice storms from the previous weekend.
    


            One person is trapped in a Sur La Table warehouse after it partially collapsed in Brownsburg, Indiana, after a severe thunderstorm and possible tornado.
    


            The Sur La Table facility “has significant structural damage with collapse” and police and fire crews are working to extract the trapped person, Brownsburg Police Department Capt. Jennifer Barrett said.
    


            Photos from CNN affiliate WTHR show a large space with beams that appear to have fallen from the ceiling. Firefighters and other emergency personnel are at the scene.
    


            A violent line of severe thunderstorms is stretching nearly 700 miles from Arkansas to northern Indiana and Ohio.
    


            These storms will continue to track east overnight and will deliver the threat of damaging winds, hail and tornadoes to more of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Major cities from Nashville to Cleveland could be in their path.
    


            A few powerful storms could also develop very late tonight in parts of northern Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. These storms could also unleash hail, damaging winds and tornadoes.
    


            Flash flood warnings are in effect for more than 1.4 million people in parts of six states as severe thunderstorms unleash torrential rain in the central US.
    


            Large portions of Arkansas are under flash flood warnings as well as parts of Tennessee – including Memphis – Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky and Illinois.
    


            Flooding will likely worsen and expand to new areas overnight as storms continue. Today is the start of a multi-day, potentially historic flood event for parts of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys.
    


            A rare level 4 of 4 high risk of flooding rainfall is in place tomorrow for parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
    


            A tornado watch is in effect for southeast Indiana, north-central Kentucky and west and central Ohio until 4 a.m. E.T. Thursday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
    


            Ten million people are impacted by this watch, which includes Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland.
    


            A line of intense thunderstorms over western Indiana is moving eastward into the watch area. It is expected to produce a few tornadoes, along with damaging wind gusts up to 75 mph and large hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter.
    


            Currently, 23 million people are under tornado watches from Ohio to Texas.
    


            A dangerous storm came so close to the National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, that the forecasters there had to practice what they preach and shelter in place.
    


            Forecasters sheltered for about 15 minutes as a likely tornado passed just to the west.
    


            The NWS in Davenport, Iowa, stepped in to serve as backup while the Paducah forecasters protected themselves.
    


            NWS offices have protocols in place so life-saving information like severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings don't stop going out when an office is under threat.
    


            It's only meant to be a short-term, emergency solution, but the Trump administration's DOGE cuts could make it more permanent for some offices. Around 800 NOAA employees – including NWS forecasters – were abruptly laid off at the end of February, only for many to be reinstated and immediately placed on administrative leave until the legality of their firing is settled in the courts.
    


            The loss of forecasters at an already understaffed agency could lead to some offices doubling up on life-saving work or providing frequent backup for critically understaffed offices.
    


            Radar gives us a clear view of the storm that produced a large and destructive tornado as it tracked through Bay and Lake City, Arkansas, earlier this evening.
    


            From this view, the storm had an almost textbook look for a tornado-producing storm.
    


            The fish hook-like area on the back end of the storm is called a “hook echo” and it's a clear signal that this storm was incredibly powerful. A hook echo doesn't always mean a tornado is in progress, but it sends a clear signal that forecasters need to pay close attention as one could form soon.
    


            The hook forms when a storm has really strong, rotating winds that pull rain, hail and potentially other debris toward its center. The clear, wedge-shaped area that helps give the hook its shape shows where air is being sucked into the storm — like an intake. All of the rainy areas in front of and behind the storm, which show up as yellow, orange and red, are its downdrafts, or exhaust.
    


            You can see the hook part of the storm tracking directly over Bay and then just northwest of the center of Lake City.
    


            As a tornado was making its way through Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a meteorologist at CNN affiliate KFVS talked his audience through the disaster, all while he and his colleagues sheltered as it passed over the station.
    


            As the tornado inched closed, chief meteorologist Grant Dade kept the radar up on air as they went into the basement to keep people up to date.
    


            “I've never had to watch a tornado hit my house, hoping it's not hitting my house,” he said, as he prepared to shelter.
    


            While the scene outside the station wasn't broadcast, Dade noted when the tornado passed, saying “It went right across us.”
    


            “That was a little bit intense folks,” he said after making his way back to the camera. “I've never witnessed a wedge tornado come right into the station.”
    


            He took a moment to text his family as he had “no idea the shape of my neighborhood.”
    


            He kept talking the audience through what the radar showed until he finally heard back that his family was all right. “My family is OK and now I'm all yours,” Dade said as he continued the broadcast.
    


            The station posted on its Facebook page everyone there was okay.
    


            While full reports of damage are not in yet, the station said they were seeing reports of at least one house damaged.
    


            At least five houses and one power line are down after a tornado ripped through Lake City, Arkansas on Wednesday, Mayor Cameron Tate told CNN in a phone call.
    


            The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management has confirmed “reports of tornadoes on the ground,” public information officer Lacey Kanipe told CNN.
    


            “We are working with local emergency management offices for situational awareness and still learning of impacts as they come in. It's early in the event and we will release more information about potential impacts as it becomes available,” Kanipe said.
    


            There were no immediate reports of injuries.
    


            The tornado threat has ramped up to the extreme in the lower Mississippi Valley tonight. A nearly unbroken line of tornado warnings is stretching over 200 miles from central Arkansas into southeast Missouri.
    


            Multiple “large and extremely dangerous” tornadoes have impacted parts of eastern Arkansas in the past hour, according to the National Weather Service. One of these tornadoes triggered a rare tornado emergency.
    


            This is the rare level 5 of 5 high risk of severe storms unfolding in real time. These dangerous storms are approaching some population centers – like Memphis, Tennessee – and will likely continue to produce tornadoes at least into the early overnight hours.
    


            A tornado emergency is in effect for Lake City, Arkansas, as a “large and destructive tornado” moves through the area, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            “This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. TAKE COVER NOW!” the NWS warned.
    

Tornado Emergency continues for Blytheville AR, Trumann AR and  Gosnell AR until 7:45 PM CDT pic.twitter.com/5Eemlwkkvb


            Tornado emergencies are the most extreme form of tornado warning. This tornado emergency is the fourth issued in the United States this year. The three others were issued during mid-March's tornado outbreak.
    


            It appears the tornado has already inflicted damage near Bay, Arkansas, as we're seeing concerning radar signatures there. A so-called “debris ball” is showing up on radar, meaning that some sort of debris was tossed a few thousand feet in the air.
    


            A tornado destroyed homes and structures near Potosi, Missouri, on Wednesday, according to state troopers. There were no deaths and everyone was accounted for, some with minor injuries, the agency said.
    


            Timbers from homes, overturned cars and farm equipment and debris littered the landscape in the aftermath of the tornado.
    


            Potosi is located roughly 72 miles southwest of St. Louis.
    


            Several drone shots show the extreme damage and debris after a storm ripped through neighborhoods in Owasso, Oklahoma, Wednesday.
    


            The damage in the Fairways and El Rio Vista neighborhoods includes parts of roofs torn off homes and sidewalks uprooted. Photos also show piles of debris tossed onto the streets.
    


            A tornado watch was in effect early Wednesday morning for parts of Oklahoma, CNN previously reported.



            There are nearly two dozen tornado warnings in effect in the central US just after 6 p.m. CDT, but the storms we are most concerned about right now are the supercells west of Memphis, Tennessee.
    


            These storms have a classic rotation signature on radar. Storm chasers or other weather spotters have observed tornadoes in several of them.
    


            The Memphis area could be at significant risk if these kinds of storms continue to develop.
    


            Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Wednesday afternoon ahead of storms hitting the state.
    


            She also released $250,000 from the Governor's Disaster Response and Recovery Fund to help with recovery costs, she said in an executive order.
    


            “Arkansas is anticipating severe storms today and potential flooding later this week,” she said in a post on X. “I've released $250,000 to make sure our state is prepared, and emergency responders are readying themselves to assist.”
    


            Fierce thunderstorms have produced a tornado in eastern Arkansas.
    


            “At 558 PM CDT, a confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado was located over Almyra, or 12 miles southeast of Stuttgart, moving northeast at 60 mph,” the National Weather Service warned.
    


            With a 60 mph movement speed, the tornado could tear through an area in a matter of moments.
    


            “A large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly tornado is on the ground. To protect your life, TAKE COVER NOW!”

            Videos show a tornado hit Potosi, Missouri, on Wednesday as millions of people in the central US are under a tornado watch.
    


            Potosi resident Ashley Bleckler-Akers told CNN her family is safe and they suffered no damage, despite capturing these videos of the nearby tornado.
    


            Potosi is located roughly 72 miles southwest of St. Louis.
    


            Severe thunderstorms are intensifying and trying to churn out tornados in southern Illinois, east of St. Louis. Tornado warnings span more than 70 miles of a particularly intense portion of the line.
    


            An EF-1 tornado in Owasso, Oklahoma, outside of Tulsa, caused damage in the area as the storm brought winds estimated around 100 to 110 mph, the National Weather Service said.
    


            “Our survey team has found high-end EF1 tornado damage that occurred this morning in the Owasso area,” the Weather Service office in Tulsa said on X. “More details will be forthcoming later.”
    


            An EF-1 tornado caused damage in Vernon County, Missouri, Wednesday morning after it traveled 17 miles in 12 minutes, the National Weather Service Springfield office said.
    


            The tornado knocked over eight train cars, damaged the roofs of several houses and inflicted “varying degrees of damage” to businesses in the area, they said in a post on X.
    


            No injuries were reported, the post said.
    


            A new tornado watch is in effect through 7 p.m. CDT for more than 2 million people in west-central Illinois and east-central Missouri, including St. Louis.
    


            A line of severe thunderstorms is tracking through the area and parts of the line have already been warned for tornadoes. Tornadoes, damaging wind and hail are possible in any storm.
    


            This tornado watch is one of five total watches active in the central US. Close to 17 million people are within these watch areas.
    

A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Illinois and Missouri until 7 PM CDT pic.twitter.com/VeBdbVO1vS


            A new tornado watch is in effect through midnight CDT for more than 1 million people in parts of southern Arkansas, northern Louisiana and northeast Texas, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
    


            “Severe storm development may occur in multiple zones through late afternoon and early evening across the ArkLaTex, with hail/wind and tornadoes all possible with the most intense storms,” the SPC warned.
    


            This tornado watch is one of four total watches active in the central and eastern US.

            A line of severe thunderstorms is intensifying as it continues to roll through parts of Missouri and Arkansas this afternoon.
    


            Multiple parts of this line have prompted tornado warnings in the last few hours. These storms will continue to get stronger as they track east.
    


            Clusters of severe thunderstorms also just started to bubble up in northern Mississippi and southwest Tennessee. These storms could get ferocious over the next few hours as they track north and east over more of Tennessee and into Kentucky.
    


            Additional storms have started to develop in parts of Illinois and will move into Indiana this evening.
    


            A severe thunderstorm is producing a tornado in eastern Missouri, just southwest of the St. Louis metro.
    


                    “At 335 PM CDT, a confirmed and extremely dangerous tornado was located near Old Mines, or 6 miles northwest of Potosi, moving northeast at 50 mph,” the National Weather Service warned. “You are in a life-threatening situation.”
                





            The storm developed a classic “hook echo” on radar, which looks sort of like a fishing hook on the back end of the storm. It's just one way forecasters can spot a potential tornado.
    


            Severe thunderstorms are intensifying rapidly as they plow across the Midwest. The conditions in the atmosphere have now prompted the Storm Prediction Center to issue a “particularly dangerous situation” tornado watch until midnight, local time.
    


            This kind of watch indicates forecasters have high confidence that large, destructive tornadoes will develop this evening. Some of the tornadoes could be EF3 or higher.
    


            Memphis, Tennessee, is the largest city in the watch.
    


            Tornadoes are powerful storms that get more destructive the faster their winds spin. They're rated from EF0 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita or “EF” scale based on estimated wind speeds.
    


            These ratings are assigned long after a tornado is over by National Weather Service crews that survey the kind of damage it left behind to estimate its wind speed.
    


            EF3 tornadoes – which are possible today – have wind speeds of at least 136 mph and inflict some serious damage.
    


            EF3 tornadoes can rip apart entire stories of well-constructed homes, damage large structures like office buildings and shopping malls and completely wipe away anything built on a weak foundation, like mobile homes.
    


            Stronger EF4 tornadoes are also possible. These tornadoes have wind speeds of at least 166 mph and up to 200 mph. They can completely level well-built homes and toss cars in the air like toys.
    


            Thousands of flights are delayed across the United States on Wednesday as dangerous storms and, in some states, tornadoes, roll through the central part of the country.
    


            At 3:30 p.m. ET, 5,005 flights within, into or out of the US were delayed and 728 were canceled, according to the website FlightAware.



            Chicago's major airports led the country with significant delays. 41% of flights leaving O'Hare and 28% of flights leaving Midway were behind schedule.
    


            At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, 34% of flights departing were delayed.
    


            American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines all had travel advisories Wednesday for passengers wanting to reschedule their flights due to the weather.
    


            Satellite imagery captured the potent storm that's delivering hazardous weather from southern Canada to the southern United States this afternoon.
    


            The storm's center can be seen around eastern Iowa in the small, relatively cloud-free area. It's snowing just north of there.
    


            A cold front extending hundreds of miles south from the storm's center – denoted by the continuous line of thicker clouds – is what's generating the current batch of severe thunderstorms stretching from Texas, just north of Dallas, through Arkansas and Missouri.
    


            Some bubbly clouds are moving north over Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Those are the result of a lot of moist air rushing north from the Gulf—moisture that's also fueling today's extreme weather.
    


            Around 1 million people in the Lower Mississippi Valley between Paducah, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee, are currently facing the highest level of risk for both severe storms, including strong tornadoes, and destructive flooding—an extremely rare combination.
    


            It's rare to reach the highest level of risk for severe storms (a level 5 of 5 happens in the US about once per year, on average) or for excessive rainfall and flood risk (a level 4 of 4 happens fewer than once per month, on average).
    


            Only once before has the same location been outlooked for the highest level risks for storms and floods by NOAA's Storm Prediction Center and Weather Prediction Center, respectively, according to a CNN analysis going back over the past decade.
    


            May 20, 2019, saw a level 5 of 5 high risk from the SPC and a level 4 of 4 high risk from the WPC over the state of Oklahoma. The event resulted in more than three dozen tornado reports and flooding that prompted a state of emergency for all 77 Oklahoma counties.
    


            Facing simultaneous threats from tornadoes and flooding can cause confusion when it comes to getting to safety. When sheltering during a tornado, it's recommended to move to a basement or interior room on the lowest level of a building, whereas during a flood, it's best to get to higher ground or move to higher levels of a building.
    


            If you find yourself facing imminent threats from a tornado and flash flood, you should shelter in the lowest dry level of a building until after the tornado threat passes.
    


            A tornado watch is in effect for nearly 5 million people in parts of northern and central Arkansas, southern and eastern Missouri and southern Illinois until 4 p.m. CDT Wednesday. The watch contains St. Louis and Little Rock, Arkansas.
    


            A line of severe thunderstorms recently moved into the westernmost portion of the watch. Storms in the next few hours will have damaging winds up to 70 mph, ping pong ball-sized hail up to 1.5 inches and the potential for a few “intense” tornadoes, according to the Storm Prediction Center

            Missouri State Highway Patrol captured images of an overturned train and downed trees and power lines in the Missouri towns of Nevada and Moundville after a tornado moved through the area.
    


            No fatalities have been reported in Vernon County, which includes both towns, at this time, the agency said in a post on Facebook.
    


            The county is located in western Missouri on the border with Kansas, about 115 miles south of Kansas City, Missouri.
    


            Several structures are “totally destroyed” in the central Missouri town of Pilot Grove on Wednesday after a severe thunderstorm and tornado, Cooper County Emergency Management Director Larry Oerly told CNN
    


            Oerly said he has no information on any deaths or injuries. A spokesperson for Boone Hospital in the city of Columbia, 40 miles east of Pilot Grove, told CNN their EMS had not yet been contacted for any patient transports.
    


            The Missouri State Highway Patrol has posted several photos of the damage to buildings, power lines and vehicles.

            “Troopers are responding to multiple structures being severely damaged and vehicles overturned in Pilot Grove, just south of I-70, in Cooper County,” the patrol said on X.
    


            Route 135, “in and around Pilot Grove, is closed at this time due to multiple power lines across the roadway,” according to the patrol.
    


            Meteorologists use a wide array of weather models and other observations to make the best forecast possible. One of those things is Nadocast, which I sometimes look at as a gut check during an active severe weather day like this.
    


            Nadocast is kind of like AI — it uses machine learning to analyze data and produce probabilities of tornadoes occurring in certain areas.
    


            Its most recent output highlighted western Kansas and Tennessee as the area most at risk of tornadoes today (pink, 30% area). But it also shows strong tornadoes – EF2 or higher – are possible from northern Louisiana to Indiana and Ohio.

            The Storm Prediction Center also provides similar probabilities. The difference is those are checked by expert forecasters before they are released. Nadocast is pure machine learning, so often needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The advantage to a model like this is that it can be updated more frequently than the SPC outlooks.
    


            Dangerous severe thunderstorms this afternoon and evening will be moving so quickly, people in their path may have mere moments to get to safety, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
    


            Storms in parts of the Plains this morning were moving at 60 mph and this afternoon's storms will likely be even faster.
    


            “It is important to take action when warnings are issued and not wait to see or hear the signs of a severe storm,” the SPC warned.
    


            A level 5 of 5 high risk of severe thunderstorms is in place today for parts of the Mississippi Valley.
    


            High-risk days are only used when forecasters are very confident conditions are right for widespread, dangerous storms. They've occurred on less than 1% days over the past 25 years, according to a CNN analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
    


            But the last high-risk day happened just last month.
    


            A powerful storm set off a tornado outbreak in mid-March that produced more than 100 tornadoes in the central, southern and eastern United States. Many of these same areas could be in the path of violent storms today.
    


            In 2024, there was just one high-risk day of severe thunderstorms—likewise for 2023.
    


            A radar confirmed tornado ripped through a small town about an hour and a half east of Kansas City on Wednesday morning, causing “significant damage” according to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
    


             The tornado hit Pilot Grove, Missouri, just after 9:00 a.m. CDT. The extent of the damage in the area is unclear, but photos showed structural damage to homes and at least one vehicle that was flipped.

            There have been multiple confirmed tornadoes Wednesday morning.
    


            A tornado in Owasso, Oklahoma, outside of Tulsa, downed a number of trees and damaged several roofs and homes, according to video from Michelle Heath on Wednesday.
    


            The video shows wooden fences knocked down in multiple places and a downed tree that fell on a house, which had some siding ripped off. Chainsaws could be heard in the distance.
    


            Heath and her 7-year-old got into their storm shelter as the storm passed, she said. Her husband was driving elsewhere and had to pull over because of the storm.
    


            National Weather Service forecasters in Arkansas are sounding the alarm this morning as severe thunderstorms approach the state.
    


            “Today has the making of a serious, severe weather outbreak across the entire state,” the NWS in Little Rock, Arkansas, warned.
    


            Parts of the state are under a level 5 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, with violent storms set to impact the area this afternoon and evening.
    


            “Today has the necessary (atmospheric) ingredients in place to be a memorable day severe weather outbreak wise which is quite the declarative statement given the history of severe weather in Arkansas,” the weather service said.
    


                    “It is an absolute must that you remain vigilant today to quickly changing weather conditions and have a severe weather action plan in place and the means to activate that plan in a matter of minutes to protect life.”
                





            Damaging wind gusts up to 80 mph, hail larger than baseballs and tornadoes are possible in the state. Some tornadoes are likely to be long-lived and could be rated EF3 or stronger.
    


            Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Wednesday declared a state of emergency for the commonwealth and urged residents to prepare for a four-day severe weather event that could include damaging winds, tornadoes and hail, as well as major flooding for parts of the state.
    


            “Every risk is on the table,” Beshear said in a video posted on X.
    


            “As we move through the next four days, we are going to see the most rain that many parts of western Kentucky have seen in a long time,” the governor said, adding the heavy rain could cause flooding in areas that don't normally flood.
    


            Beshear also noted the state is “under some of the most serious weather threats I've seen” in his post.
    


            “We need everyone statewide to take this seriously. Tonight, we expect tornadoes, dangerous winds and hail. You need to be prepared. Have alerts on, an emergency kit ready and stay elsewhere if safer,” he wrote.
    


            A rare level 5 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place for parts of the Mississippi Valley, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Storms in this area could produce multiple long-track tornadoes of EF3 strength or greater.
    


            High risk days are only used when forecasters are very confident that the necessary atmospheric ingredients for severe thunderstorms are in place and will produce widespread, dangerous storms. They've occurred on less than 1% days over the past 25 years, according to a CNN analysis of NOAA data.
    


            The last one was issued last month as a part of a multi-day tornado outbreak that killed dozens of people in some of the same areas at risk again today.
    


            Strong tornadoes – rated at least EF2 – are also possible from Louisiana to Ohio. The greatest tornado risk will begin in the afternoon and continue into Wednesday night.
    


            By the evening, severe thunderstorms could stretch from Louisiana and Arkansas to as far north as Michigan. A few more storms could develop overnight in Texas.
    


            The Mississippi Valley could see historic rain and floods this week, with a rare level 4 of 4 high risk of flooding rainfall in effect Thursday for parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
    


            “Extensive, rare, and at times catastrophic, flash flooding is likely… flash flood water levels may reach areas that rarely or have never flooded before,” forecasters at the National Weather Service in Little Rock, Arkansas, said.
    


            It's hard to overstate just how significant level 4 of 4, high risk flooding events are. They are issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but are responsible for more than 80% of all flood-related damage and 40% of all flood-related deaths, research from the WPC shows.
    


            Forecasters predict storms will work over the same areas repeatedly and could drop 2 to 6 inches of rain each day –– especially from Arkansas to Indiana.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has moved to fire several White House National Security Council officials taking action soon after he was urged by a far-right activist to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently committed to his Make America Great Again agenda, several people familiar with the matter said Thursday.

Laura Loomer presented her research to Trump in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, making her case for the firings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters. Vice President JD Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sergio Gor, the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, took part in the meeting, the people said.

NSC spokesman Brian Hughes declined to comment on the meeting or the firings, insisting that the White House does not discuss personnel matters.

The Presidential Personnel Office has moved to dismiss at least three senior NSC officials and multiple lower-ranking aides.

Loomer, who has promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, was a frequent presence on the campaign trail during Trump's 2024 successful White House run. More recently, she's been speaking out on social media about some members of Trump's national security team that she insists can't be trusted.

“It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings,” Loomer said in a posting on X. “I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of, and the necessity of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America, and our national security.” 




Trump has a long history of elevating and associating with people who trade in falsehoods and conspiracy theories, and he regularly amplifies posts on his social media site shared by those like Loomer, who promote QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the “deep state.”

The move by Trump to push out staff comes at a moment when his national security adviser Mike Waltz is fighting back criticism over using the publicly available encrypted Signal app to discuss planning for the sensitive March 15 military operation targeting Houthi militants in Yemen. 

A journalist, The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg, was mistakenly added to the chain and revealed that Trump's team used it to discuss precise timing of the operation, aircraft used to carry out the strikes and more.

Waltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain, but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.

Loomer in the leadup to Wednesday's meeting with Trump had complained to sympathetic administration officials that she had been excluded from the NSC vetting process as Waltz built up his staff, according to one person familiar with the matter. She believe Waltz was too reliant in the process on “neocons”—shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party—as well what she perceived as “not-MAGA-enough” types, the person said.

Waltz in the first days of Trump's return to the White House sent about 160 non-political detailees assigned to the National Security Council back to their home agencies to ensure personnel were committed to implementing Trump's America First agenda.

The moved sidelined nonpolitical experts on topics that range from counterterrorism to global climate policy at a time when the United States is dealing with a disparate set of complicated foreign policy matters, including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Last week, Adam Schleifer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, was fired without explanation in an terse email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office shortly after Loomer posted about him on social media, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Wall Street is following global markets sharply lower after U.S. President Donald Trump announced big increases in tariffs on imports of goods from around the world.

Financial markets around the world are reeling following President Donald Trump's latest and most severe volley of tariffs, and the U.S. stock market may be taking the worst of it.

Little was spared as fear flared globally about the potentially higher inflation and weakening economic growth that tariffs can create. Prices fell for everything from crude oil and Big Tech stocks to small companies that invest only in U.S. real estate.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will match the U.S. president's 25% auto tariffs with a tariff on vehicles imported from the United States — but not on their parts, as Trump did with his previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports that took effect Thursday. 

The prime minister said he told Trump last week in a phone call that he would be retaliating. 

“We take these measures reluctantly. And we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact in Canada,” Carney said. He said Canada won't tariff the parts because Canadians know the benefits of the integrated auto sector, where parts can cross the border multiple times as vehicles are assembled in Ontario or Michigan.

“Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable. Donald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,” the minority leader said on the Senate floor Thursday.

Schumer was referring to Trump's 10% sanctions on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory in the remote Antarctic. They're mostly barren, with active volcanoes.

Vladimir Putin's Russia, meanwhile, was left off Trump's list, which also includes Jan Mayen, a small Norwegian island in the Arctic that possibly has more polar bears than people.

The legislation pushed by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell would require presidents to justify new tariffs and secure congressional approval within 60 days, otherwise they would expire.

Grassley said he was working on this long before Trump introduced sweeping global tariffs. Whether it gains traction in the Republican-controlled Congress remains to be seen.

Congress already technically has authority over tariffs, but over the last century it has given much of that power to the president. This has effectively removed most of its check on executive power. Lawmakers have some standing to counter tariffs, such as nullifying a presidential emergency declaration, but such resolutions need to pass both chambers and then either be signed by the president, or have the votes to override a veto.

The NEH distributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year to state humanities councils, along with museums, historical sites, educational institutions and independent researchers. Projects have included organizing George Washington's papers and supporting “American Prometheus,” the J. Robert Oppenheimer biography that led to an Oscar-winning film.

Now NEH grant recipients are getting termination notices, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403.

“Cutting NEH funding directly harms communities in every state and contributes to the destruction of our shared cultural heritage,” reads a statement from the National Humanities Alliance, a nationwide coalition of humanities advocates. 

An NEH spokesperson did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment. The Trump administration has been dismantling institutions over what it calls “woke” culture.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says his administration will take all necessary actions, based on World Trade Organization principles and a new reciprocity bill approved by Congress on Wednesday, to protect Brazil's companies and workers after the United States imposed a 10% extra tariff on all Brazilian exports.

“We stand for multilateralism and free trade, and we will respond to any attempt to impose protectionism, which no longer has a place in today's world,” Lula said during an official ceremony in Brasília.

The U.S. is Brazil's top trade partner after China, importing Brazilian crude oil, aircraft, coffee, cellulose and beef. America's trade surplus reached $28.6 billion in goods and services last year.

Brazil has said it remains open to dialogue aimed at reversing the extra tariffs, while also considering taking the case to the WTO and imposing reciprocal tariffs. Lula has yet to sign the bill into law.

The president took action involving several senior White House National Security Council officials soon after he was urged by the far-right activist to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently committed to his Make America Great Again agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter Thursday.

Loomer presented her research to Trump in an Oval Office meeting, making her case for the firings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.

The Trump administration is ordering schools nationwide to certify that they are following federal civil rights laws — and eliminating DEI practices — as a condition for receiving federal money.

A notice sent Thursday by the Education Department gives the nation's states and schools 10 days to sign and return the certification.

“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement.

The certification asks state and school leaders to acknowledge that “the use of certain DEI practices can violate federal law” and result in a termination of funding.

It follows a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any school policy that treats students or staff differently because of their race is illegal.

The S&P 500 was down 4.3% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since COVID shattered the global economy five years ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,538 points, or 3.6%, as of 10:55 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.6% lower.

Fear is flaring globally about the potentially toxic mix of higher inflation and weakening economic growth that could be created by the tariffs rivaling levels unseen in roughly a century.

It's “plausible” that Trump's latest and most severe set of tariffs could reduce U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to the multinational financial services company UBS.

Lesotho is one of the smallest countries in Africa with a population of 2.2 million people, yet exports $237.3 million worth of goods to the U.S. — mostly textiles and diamonds — sectors which create most of its jobs.

“There is no country immune from those tariff hikes he made. That means countries will have to renegotiate their positions with the USA and see how they will manage to trade in,” said government spokesman Thabo Sekonyela.

The U.S. is Lesotho's second biggest trade partner after South Africa. This a second blow for Lesotho after Trump withdrew foreign aid.

Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of United States European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told lawmakers Thursday that a potential Trump administration plan to relinquish U.S. control over the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe as part of its downsizing efforts could create issues for control over U.S. nuclear weapons based there as well as the tens of thousands of troops deployed there.

The position oversees all NATO decisions in Europe, where the U.S. is often the largest troop contributor to NATO operations.

“I think that would bring some challenges in terms of nuclear command and control. It would put us in a position where, in an Article Five situation, we could have for the first time since the First World War large numbers of American troops under non-U.S. command. So I think those are things that would have to be considered carefully,” Cavoli told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Democrats are blaming Trump for plunging financial markets and calling on him to rescind his tariffs.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said the tariffs amount to the biggest tax hike on families since World War II.

Schumer spoke on the Senate floor as financial markets tanked, saying “Donald Trump has singlehandedly created a financial forest fire.”

“President Trump should reverse course on his disastrous tariffs immediately,” Schumer said. “Or else, he risks plunging America into recession.”

The Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted that the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporter to the U.S.

The association said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates. But it still expects U.S. furniture prices to rise. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components, the association said.

“While many in the industry support the long-term goal of reshoring manufacturing, the reality is that it will take at least a decade to scale domestic production,” Home Furnishings Association CEO Shannon Williams said in a statement. “Permitting, training a skilled workforce and managing the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing are significant hurdles. Applying steep tariffs during this transition period only hurts the American consumer.”

“There are some who believe now is the time to reduce drastically our military footprint in Europe,” Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said at Thursday's hearing with U.S. military commanders for Europe and Africa.

“I'm troubled at those deeply misguided and dangerous views held by some mid-level bureaucrats within the Defense Department. They've been working to pursue a U.S. retreat from Europe and they've often been doing do without coordinating with the Secretary of Defense,” Wicker said. 

It was not immediately clear what “mid-level bureaucrats” Wicker was talking about. U.S. troops in Europe increased by about 20,000 to a total of roughly 100,000 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to assist with training and logistics and to reassure NATO allies that the U.S. would defend them.

Nayib Bukele is scheduled to visit with Trump on April 14.

Bukele posted on social media a signed letter from Trump inviting him to a meeting and thanking him for help fighting illegal immigration. 

The Trump administration is paying Bukele's government to house deportees, particularly people it accuses of being Venezuelan gang members, at one of his notorious prisons. 

A White House official confirmed the date of the visit. The official was not authorized to speak publicly.







Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry says its government is calculating the impact on its exports including electronics, textiles and textile products, footwear, palm oil, rubber, furniture, shrimp and marine fishery products, and taking “strategic steps to mitigate the negative impact on the Indonesian national economy.”

“The Indonesian government is committed to maintaining the stability of the yield of Government Securities (SBN) amidst global financial market turmoil following the announcement of the U.S. reciprocal tariff,” the foreign ministry statement says.

As Mexico had hoped, the free-trade agreement it has with the United States and Canada shielded many sectors producing things covered by the treaty from avocados to clothing and electronics. Discussions continue over the 25% tariff the U.S. has placed on auto imports, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminum.

“The last call I had with President Trump I said that in the case of reciprocal tariffs, my understanding was that there wouldn't be tariffs (on Mexico), because since Mexico doesn't place tariffs on the United States, the United States doesn't put tariffs on Mexico,” Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning press briefing Thursday.

Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard pointed out that many other countries that have free-trade agreements with the U.S. were nevertheless targeted by the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday. Ebrard says Sheinbaum's strategy worked, “because today we do have preferential treatment.”

Some Americans may be giving the president the benefit of the doubt for now on his Department of Government Efficiency.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults “somewhat” or “strongly” approve of Trump's handling of Social Security, and similar approvals on his management of the federal government.

The latest AP-NORC numbers on his changes to government are almost identical to Trump's overall presidential approval, suggesting that his Republican administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close Social Security Administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies and cancel thousands of government contracts haven't yet created a significant independent backlash — or spurred independent support.

The U.S. secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker are in Brussels for a meeting of alliance foreign ministers.

Many hope Rubio will clarify Trump's intentions amid persistent signals from Washington that NATO as it has existed for 75 years may no longer be relevant.

“The United States is as active in NATO as it has ever been,” Rubio told reporters as he greeted NATO chief Mark Rutte. “And some of this hysteria and hyperbole that I see in the global media and some domestic media in the United States about NATO is unwarranted.”

“President Trump's made clear he supports NATO,” Rubio said. “We're going to remain in NATO.”

And the U.S. stock market may be taking the worst of it.

The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in early trading Thursday, more than the losses seen in other major markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1150 points, and the Nasdaq composite was off 4.3%.

Little was spared as fear flares globally about the potentially higher inflation and weakening economic growth that tariffs can create.

Prices fell for everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to small companies that invest only in U.S. real estate.

Vance says the president will have something to say about the popular social media site before his reprieve on the congressionally-approved ban of the platform expires.

“We have a couple days to continue working on it, to finalize some things. And of course, we'll let the president announce whatever we ultimately decide,” Vance said on Fox & Friends.

Trump on Inauguration Day gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that had been upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, which said the ban was necessary for national security.

Under the law, TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance is required to sell the platform to an approved buyer or take it offline in the United States.

The vice president appeared on Fox & Friends, saying it will take some time for Trump's tariffs, spending cuts and support for U.S. industries to help everyday Americans. “We are not going to fix things overnight,” Vance said.

“Frankly, a lot of people have gotten rich from American jobs moving overseas,” Vance said. “But American workers have not gotten rich. And frankly, American companies have not gotten wealthy from the increasing growth of foreign competitors manufacturing overseas.”

“We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost reducing policies — Yes, people are going to see it in their pocketbook. They're also going to benefit from the fact that foreign countries can't take advantage of us anymore.”

The sweeping tariffs declared by Trump could increase prices for Americans who depend on citrus from 1400 producers across southern Africa, according to Boitshoko Ntshabele, chief executive of the Citrus Growers Association in Johannesburg.

“South Africa does not compete with the citrus producers of the US,” Ntshabele said. “In fact, quite the opposite — we sustain customers' interest when their local citrus is out of season, benefitting US citrus growers in the end.”

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Trump's 30% tariffs on U.S. imports of South African products shows the urgent need for a new bilateral trade deal. 

Greece's exports of canned peaches to the United States in 2020 were worth 32 million euros ($35.3 million) and soared to 95 million euros ($105 million) in 2024. The new 20% tariff, on top of existing duties, could reverse those gains, according to Christos Giannakakis, vice president of Venus, one Greece's largest peach canning cooperatives.

“This creates a huge problem,” Giannakakis told the Associated Press. “It means reduced exports, lower revenue and shrinking production.”

Trump said his decision to impose sweeping import tariffs will boost American industries. 

At 1 p.m., Trump will receive his intelligence briefing in the Situation Room. After, at 2 p.m., he will travel to Florida to attend an event for LIV golf this evening. He will then head to his home at Mar-a-Lago, according to the White House.

Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said the new U.S. tariffs may violate NATO's Article 2, which stresses the importance of economic cooperation among allies to avoid conflict.

“If you want a strong NATO, you should ensure that there is as much economic growth as possible in the NATO countries. That was the insight of those who established NATO, that economic cooperation would be good for the entire alliance,” Eide said during a visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, according to the NRK broadcaster.

Eide told NRK that he will raise the tariff war with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the meeting.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the new U.S. tariffs many reduce Poland's GDP by 0.4%.

He said it was “a severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it.” The Polish-U.S. friendship, he added, “must also survive this test.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Thursday that his government will implement a $15.6 billion (14.1 billion euro) spending package to mitigate the effects of U.S. tariffs on the eurozone's fourth-largest economy.

The Spanish leader called the tariffs “19th-century protectionism,” against which the European Union and Spain had to act proactively and diversify their economic ties with the rest of the world.

Sánchez also called for a negotiated solution with the U.S. “We're once again asking President Trump to reconsider, to sit down at the negotiating table with the European Union and also with the rest of the world.”

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson says “there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism is not a way out. What the U.S. should do is to correct its wrong practices and resolve trade disputes with all countries, including China, through consultations based on equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.”

Guo Jiakun added that the tariffs violate WTO rules, “harm the common interests of people of all countries, and do not help solve the problems of the U.S. itself. It is clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the U.S.'s unilateral bullying actions, such as imposing tariffs.”

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, said that these are “the most disruptive tariff increases for 90 years.” He also drew a comparison with the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

“I think this is an extraordinary day for the world economy, comparable with the situation after the Russian aggression on Ukraine, where we knew that something new was happening and we were not prepared in Europe to cope with the challenge,” Habeck told reporters in Berlin. “And we looked in(to) the abyss in that time, but we worked it out and we managed it by putting aside everything that was restricting economic strength and energy security.”

“I think a similar reaction is necessary now from the European Union and its world partners,” Habeck said.

The local government leader of Christmas Island, one of several Australian external island territories that like Australia have been assigned a 10% U.S. tariff, said his Indian Ocean atoll exported nothing to the United States.

The Australian outpost of fewer than 2,000 people 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta has used U.S. heavy machinery to mine phosphate for decades, Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thomson said.

The uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the remote Antarctic are another Australian territory included in the 10% tariff. The mostly barren islands include two active volcanoes and can only be reached by sea.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. imports. The U.S. and Australia have a free trade agreement.

Trump's announcement of a new 20% tariff on the European Union drew a sharp rebuke from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said it was a “major blow to the world economy.”

“The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,” von der Leyen said. Groceries, transport and medicines will cost more, she said while visiting Uzbekistan. “And this is hurting, in particular, the most vulnerable citizens.”

Von der Leyen held off, however, from announcing new retaliatory measures and underlined that the EU was ready to negotiate with the U.S.

Analysts say there's little to be gained from an all-out trade war since higher tariffs can lower growth and raise inflation.

“On the other hand, Trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response,” said Matteo Villa, a senior analyst at Italy's Institute for International Political Studies. 

“Probably the hope, in Brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce Trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack.”

President Trump Signs Historic Reciprocal Tariffs Executive Orders



Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others — that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.

In a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, Trump said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States, while imposing a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency.

The action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuania's political and religious leaders joined thousands of people on Thursday to bid farewell to four American soldiers who died during a training exercise in the Baltic nation.

President Gitanas Nausėda and other dignitaries were among those who stood in respect as hearses carried the bodies of the four young Americans to Vilnius airport before being flown to the United States for burial.

Many of the onlookers were in tears, and Nausėda said that the reaction of the population and the military to the disappearance of soldiers was rooted in Lithuania's own difficult history.

“For us, it is more than a duty, it is an emotion. We have experienced trials in our history and therefore we understand well what loss is, what death is, what honourable duty is,” Nausėda said in a speech to those gathered.

Schoolchildren accompanied by teachers waved Lithuanian and U.S. flags to honor the soldiers, who died in an accident along NATO's eastern flank, a region that is on edge due to Russia's aggression in nearby Ukraine.

Leading one group was Justin Boyd, the secondary school principal of the American International School in Vilnius, who said his group was there “to honor the fallen soldiers from the United States and to honor the relationship between Lithuania and America and the defensive pact that represents.” 

“It's important for us to give dignity to the fallen and to let the families know that we are with them and we support them in this time,” Boyd said.




The soldiers, part of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, were on a tactical training exercise when they and their vehicle went missing a week ago, the Army said. 

Lithuanian, Polish and U.S. soldiers and rescuers searched through the forests and swamps at the Gen. Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in the town of Pabradė, 6 miles (10 kilometers) west of the border with Belarus. The M88 Hercules armored vehicle was pulled from a peat bog Monday and the final body was recovered Tuesday.

“I feel sorry for these young men,” said one mourner from the town of Pabradė as he watched the hearses make their way towards the airport. “I live nearby, and I know that swamp. Dangerous places for anyone who enters that area.”

The U.S. Army has identified the soldiers as Staff Sgt. Troy S. Knutson-Collins, 28, of Battle Creek, Michigan; Staff Sgt. Jose Duenez Jr., 25, of Joliet, Illinois; Staff Sgt. Edvin F. Franco, 25, of Glendale, California; and Pfc. Dante D. Taitano, 21, of Dededo, Guam. 

About 3,500 soldiers from the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team deployed in January to Poland and the Baltic states for a nine-month rotation as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which supports NATO allies and partners following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government has banned American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens, The Associated Press has learned.

Four people with direct knowledge of the matter told the AP about the policy, which was put into effect by departing U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns in January shortly before he left China. The people would speak only on condition of anonymity to discuss details of a confidential new directive. 

Though some U.S. agencies already had strict rules on such relationships, a blanket “non-fraternization” policy, as it is known, has been unheard of publicly since the Cold War. It's not uncommon for American diplomats in other countries to date locals and even marry them.

A more limited version of the policy was enacted last summer prohibiting U.S. personnel from “romantic and sexual relations” with Chinese citizens working as guards and other support staff at the U.S. Embassy and five consulates in China. But Burns, the departing ambassador, broadened it to a blanket ban on such relations with any Chinese citizen in China in January, days before President Donald Trump took office. The AP was unable to determine exactly how the policy defined the phrase “romantic or sexual relationship.”

Two of the people with knowledge of the ban told the AP the new policy was first discussed last summer after members of Congress contacted Burns to express concern that restrictions on such relationships were not stringent enough. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party did not respond to a request for comment.

The new policy covers U.S. missions in mainland China, including the embassy in Beijing and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan, as well as the American consulate in the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong. It does not apply to U.S. personnel stationed outside China.




The only exception to the policy is U.S. personnel with pre-existing relations with Chinese citizens; they can apply for exemptions. If the exemption is denied, they must end the relationship or leave their position, the people said. Anyone who violates the policy will be ordered to leave China immediately.

The policy was communicated verbally and electronically to American personnel in China in January, but has not been publicly announced. 

The State Department said it does not comment on internal matters. The National Security Council referred questions to the State Department. Burns, the former ambassador, did not reply to an AP request sent to his email address at The Cohen Group, a consultancy that he rejoined as vice chair in February.

Intelligence services across the world have long used attractive men and women to obtain sensitive information, famously during the Cold War. The State Department and other agencies with offices in China have long had stringent reporting requirements on personal relationships for American personnel stationed there, as well as rivals considered high intelligence threats such as Russia or Cuba. 

Declassified State Department documents show that in 1987, the U.S. government barred personnel stationed in the Soviet bloc and China from befriending, dating or having sex with locals after a U.S. Marine in Moscow was seduced by a Soviet spy. Such restrictions were relaxed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, according to news reports at the time.

In China, a blanket ban on such relations has not been in effect for many years. Until the new ban in January, U.S. personnel in China were required to report any intimate contact with Chinese citizens to their supervisors, but were not explicitly forbidden from sexual or romantic relationships. 

U.S. diplomats and intelligence experts say that Beijing continues to aggressively use so-called honeypots to access American secrets. In presentations before being stationed in China, U.S. personnel are briefed on case studies where Chinese intelligence services sent attractive women to seduce American diplomats, and warned that dozens of Chinese state security agents can be assigned to monitor any individual diplomat of interest.

Little is known about the U.S. government's non-fraternization policies elsewhere, as they are considered classified. It is unknown how restrictive such policies are in other countries. 

In recent years, tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated over trade, technology and geopolitical competition. 

Peter Mattis, a former CIA analyst and president of The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said there were at least two publicized cases in which Chinese agents seduced American diplomats stationed in China, though he hasn't heard of such a case in recent years. 

Mattis added that another issue is that Chinese state security doesn't gather intelligence just through spies, but also by pressing ordinary Chinese people for information, often through threats or intimidation. That, Mattis said, means any Chinese citizen who dates an American diplomat could be vulnerable to coercion.

“The MSS is willing to leverage any human connection that a target has to collect intelligence,” Mattis said, using an acronym referring to China's Ministry of State Security. “This rule change suggests the MSS has gotten a lot more aggressive at trying to access the embassy and U.S. government.”

The Chinese foreign ministry did not comment on the ban, saying in a faxed statement that it was “more appropriate to ask the U.S. about this question.”

China also has been tightening already strict controls on its personnel overseas, according to Chinese regulations, news reports and four people familiar with China's bureaucracy who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could discuss a sensitive topic. In recent years, Beijing began strictly enforcing regulations that bar promotions for Chinese civil servants with spouses who acquired foreign citizenship and restrict diplomats from spending an extended period of time in one country, forcing some to return to China.

China's foreign ministry and many other government bodies bar their officials and staff from sexual or romantic relations with foreign citizens, while members of the Chinese military or police are generally barred from leaving China altogether without express approval from their supervisors.

Kang reported from Beijing.

NEW YORK (AP) — Financial markets around the world are reeling Thursday following President Donald Trump's latest and most severe set of tariffs, and the U.S. stock market is taking the worst of it so far.



The S&P 500 was down 3.7% in afternoon trading, more than other major stock markets, and at its bottom in the morning was on track for its worst day since COVID struck in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,228 points, or 2.9%, as of 1:08 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 4.8% lower.

Little was spared in financial markets as fear flared globally about the potentially toxic mix of higher inflation and weakening economic growth that tariffs can create. 



Everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies fell. Even gold, which has hit records recently as investors sought something safer to own, pulled lower. Some of the worst hits walloped smaller U.S. companies, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 5.5% to pull it more than 20% below its record.



Investors worldwide knew Trump was going to announce a sweeping set of tariffs late Wednesday, and fears surrounding it had already pulled Wall Street's main measure of health, the S&P 500 index, 10% below its all-time high. But Trump still managed to surprise them with “the worst case scenario for tariffs,” according to Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment officer at Sanctuary Wealth.

Trump announced a minimum tariff of 10% on imports, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries like China and those from the European Union. It's “plausible” the tariffs altogether, which would rival levels unseen in roughly a century, could knock down U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to UBS. 






Such a hit would be so frightening that it “makes one's rational mind regard the possibility of them sticking as low,” according to Bhanu Baweja and other strategists at UBS.

Wall Street had long assumed Trump would use tariffs merely as a tool for negotiations with other countries, rather than as a long-term policy. But Wednesday's announcement may suggest Trump sees tariffs more as helping to solve an ideological goal than just an opening bet in a poker game. Trump on Wednesday talked about wresting manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a process that could take years. 



If Trump follows through on his tariffs, stock prices may need to fall much more than 10% from their all-time high in order to reflect the recession that could follow, along with the hit to profits that U.S. companies could take. The S&P 500 is now down roughly 11% from its record set in February.



“Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,” said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, though he sees Trump's announcement on Wednesday as more of an opening move than an endpoint for policy.

One wild card is that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in order to support the economy. That's what it had been doing late last year before pausing in 2025. Lower interest rates help by making it easier for U.S. companies and households to borrow and spend.



Yields on Treasurys tumbled in part on rising expectations for coming cuts to rates, along with general fear about the health of the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.05% from 4.20% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% in January. That's a huge move for the bond market.



The Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like, though. While lower rates can goose the economy, they can also push upward on inflation. And worries are already worsening about that because of tariffs, with U.S. households in particular bracing for sharp increases in their bills.



The U.S. economy at the moment is still growing, of course. A report on Thursday said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Economist had been expecting to see an uptick in joblessness, and a relatively solid job market has been the linchpin keeping the economy out of recession.

A separate report said activity for U.S. transportation, finance and other businesses in the services industry grew last month. But the growth was weaker than expected, and businesses gave a mixed picture of how they see conditions playing out.



One business told the survey by the Institute for Supply Management that its restaurant sales and traffic have improved, for example. But another said tariffs on wood imported from Canada and the “resulting delays have caused havoc with the supply chain and deliveries.” A third in the construction industry said it's “starting to see effect of aluminum tariff. These costs will be passed on to customers.”



Worries about possible stagflation knocked down all kinds of stocks, leading to drops for four out of every five that make up the S&P 500. 



Best Buy fell 15.9% because the electronics that it sells are made all over the world. United Airlines lost 12.3% because customers worried about the global economy may not fly as much for business or feel comfortable enough to take vacations. Target tumbled 9.8% amid worries that its customers, already squeezed by still-high inflation, may be under even more stress. 



In stock markets abroad, indexes fell sharply worldwide. France's CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, and Germany's DAX lost 3% in Europe.



Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.5% and South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.8%.

U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a new 20% tariff on the European Union drew a sharp rebuke from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She said it was a major blow to the world economy and the consequences “will be dire for millions of people.”

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to counter tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Speaking shortly after President Donald Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, Carney insisted Canadian workers will be protected.

In a rare display of unity in recent years, Brazil's Congress unanimously passed a reciprocity bill to allow its government to retaliate against any country or trade bloc that imposes tariffs on Brazilian goods.

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the 10 percent tariffs imposed on his country by U.S. President Donald Trump have “no basis in logic” and they go “against the basis of our two nation's partnership.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump's s weeping new tariffs shocked governments and investors, provoking dismay, threats of retaliation and calls for negotiations to rescind the stiff new import taxes imposed on goods from countries around the world. Global stocks sagged.

China accused the U.S. of “bullying” and the European said it was ready to retaliate, with French officials suggesting measures to hit U.S. big tech companies. 

Yet the calls for making a deal from the EU, the U.K. and Japan indicated a lack of appetite for escalating trade tensions with the world's biggest economy and fear that slapping tariffs on U.S. goods will only make things worse. 

Trump said Wednesday that the import taxes, ranging from 10% to 49%, would do to U.S. trading partners what they have long done to the U.S. He maintains they will draw factories and jobs back to the United States.

“Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,” he said. “But it is not going to happen anymore.”

Trump imposed a 34% levy on goods from China on top of an earlier 20% tariff, as well as a 20% tariff on the European Union, 24% on Japan and 25% on South Korea.




China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun called for trade talks and said that “there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism is not a way out ... It is clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the U.S.'s unilateral bullying actions, such as imposing tariffs.”




China, which is a key exporter to the U.S. of everything from kitchenware to clothing, has already announced a raft of retaliatory measures set to raise prices for U.S. consumers.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged businesses to “suspend” investments in the U.S. pending talks with the Trump administration, denouncing a “brutal and unfounded” decision.

“Because what would be the message of having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when they're hitting us?” Macron said before meeting with representatives of key businesses affected by U.S. tariffs, including wines and spirits, food industry, cosmetics, health, metals and aircraft.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denounced the tariffs as a “major blow to the world economy” but held off announcing new retaliatory measures and said the commission - which handles trade issues for the 27 member countries - was “always ready” to talk. 

Analysts say there's little to be gained from an all-out trade war, for the United States or other countries, since higher tariffs can lower growth and raise inflation. The tariffs are not paid by the countries they're imposed on, but by the companies in the U.S. that buy the goods to sell to Americans. They must decide whether to absorb the new taxes or pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 

“If Trump really imposes high tariffs, Europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the EU would be better off doing nothing,” said Matteo Villa, a senior analyst at Italy's Institute for International Political Studies.

“On the other hand, Trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response,” Villa said. “Probably the hope, in Brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce Trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack.”

The makers of Italy's Parmigiano Reggiano cheese say the new tariffs just mean U.S. consumers will pay more, since the protected designation cheese doesn't really compete with U.S. made parmesan. “Americans continued to choose us even when the price went up” after an earlier round of Trump tariffs in 2019, said Nicola Bertinelli, president of the Parmigian Reggiano Consortium.

“Putting tariffs on a product like ours, only increases the price for American consumers, without protecting local producers,'' he said.

Europe's strategy so far has been to limit retaliation to early tariff rounds to just a few politically sensitive goods such as bourbon and motorcycles in an attempt to push the U.S. to the negotiating table, rather than escalate an all-out trade war that could cripple its export-dependent economy. 

Economists say the next target could be U.S. tech companies. They fall into the services category, where the U.S. exports more than it imports to Europe and thus would be more exposed to retaliation. 

The EU response, likely to be ready by the end of April, could include a tax on U.S. digital giants such as Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, as French officials have been advocating. 

Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the EU “must show that we have strong muscles.”

He added: “But this is with the aim of an agreement, because that is the best for prosperity in the U.S., for prosperity in Europe and for prosperity in the world.”

British Prime Minister Kier Starmer said the U.K. government would react with “cool and calm heads,” telling business leaders in London that he hopes to get the tariffs lifted with a trade deal. “Nobody wins in a trade war, that is not in our national interest,” Starmer said. 

Japan, America's closest ally in Asia, plans to closely analyze the U.S. tariffs and their impact, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said, while refraining from talk of retaliation.

Financial markets were jolted, with the U.S. Standard & Poors 500 off 3.7% in afternoon trading. The STOXX Europe 600 index fell 2.7% and a 2.8% drop in Tokyo's benchmark led losses in Asia. Oil prices sank more than $2 a barrel. Analysts fished for superlatives to a step that disrupts the global trading order and overturns decades of efforts to lower tariffs through trade talks and free trade agreements. 

“The magnitude of the rollout — both in scale and speed — wasn't just aggressive; it was a full-throttle macro disruption,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid called it “radical policy reordering” and said the U.S. now had an average tariff of 25%-30%, the “worst end of expectations” and the highest since the early 20th Century.

“This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession,” Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings' head of U.S. Economic Research, said in a report. “You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.”

A 29% tariff imposed on the tiny South Pacific outpost of Norfolk Island came as a shock. The Australian territory has a population of around 2,000 people and the economy revolves around tourism.

“To my knowledge, we do not export anything to the United States,” Norfolk Island Administrator George Plant, the Australian government's representative on the island, told the AP on Thursday. “We don't charge tariffs on anything ... so we're scratching our heads here.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his tariff threats by declaring on Wednesday a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.




In announcing what he has called reciprocal tariffs, Trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise by raising U.S. taxes on foreign goods to narrow the gap with the tariffs the White House says other countries unfairly impose on U.S. products.

Trump's higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. But economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs since they're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. It's possible, however, that the reciprocal tariffs could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.

The Associated Press asked for your questions about reciprocal tariffs. Here are a few of them, along with our answers:

Tariffs are taxes on imports, collected when foreign goods cross the U.S. border by the Customs and Border Protection agency. The money — about $80 billion last year — goes to the U.S. Treasury to help pay the federal government's expenses. Congress has authority to say how the money will be spent. 

Trump — largely supported by Republican lawmakers who control the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives — wants to use increased tariff revenue to finance tax cuts that analysts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Specifically, they want to extend tax cuts passed in Trump's first term and largely set to expire at the end of 2025. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, has found that extending Trump's tax cuts would reduce federal revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 to 2034. 

Trump wants higher tariffs to help offset the lower tax collections. Another think tank, the Tax Policy Center, has said that extending the 2017 tax cuts would deliver continued tax relief to Americans at all income levels, “but higher-income households would receive a larger benefit.''

It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect. 

Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday — such as 20% on imports from Europe — will be too large to swallow on their own.

Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.

A key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.

Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.

The U.S. Constitution grants the power to set tariffs to Congress. But over the years, Congress has delegated those powers to the president through several different laws. Those laws specify the circumstances under which the White House can impose tariffs, which are typically limited to cases where imports threaten national security or are severely harming a specific industry. 

In the past, presidents generally imposed tariffs only after carrying out public hearings to determine if certain imports met those criteria. Trump followed those steps when imposing tariffs in his first term.

In his second term, however, Trump has sought to use emergency powers set out in a 1977 law to impose tariffs in a more ad hoc fashion. Trump has said, for example, that fentanyl flowing in from Canada and Mexico constitute a national emergency and has used that pretext to impose 25% duties on goods from both countries.

Congress can seek to cancel an emergency that a president declares, and Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, has proposed to do just that regarding Canada. That legislation could pass the Senate but would likely die in the House. Other bills in Congress that would also limit the president's authority to set tariffs face tough odds for passage as well. 




U.S. tariffs are generally lower than those charged by other countries. The average U.S. tariff, weighted to reflect goods that are actually traded, is just 2.2% for the United States, versus the European Union's 2.7%, China's 3% and India's 12%, according to the World Trade Organization. 

Other countries also tend to do more than the United States to protect their farmers with high tariffs. The U.S. trade-weighted tariff on farm goods, for example, is 4%, compared to the EU's 8.4%, Japan's 12.6%, China's 13.1% and India's 65%. (The WTO numbers don't count Trump's recent flurry of import taxes or tariffs between countries that have entered into their own free trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that allows many goods to cross North American borders duty-free.) 

Yet the Trump administration has used its own calculations to come up with far greater tariffs that they say other economies impose on the U.S. For example, the White House said Wednesday that the European Union's effective tariffs on the U.S. equal 39%, far higher than the WTO's numbers. It says China's equal 67%. 

Previous U.S. administrations agreed to the tariffs that Trump now calls unjust. They were the result of a long negotiation between 1986 to 1994 — the so-called Uruguay Round — that ended in a trade pact signed by 123 countries and has formed the basis of the global trading system for nearly four decades.

The Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night that would thwart President Donald Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada, delivering him a rare rebuke just hours after the president unveiled sweeping plans to clamp down on international trade. The Senate resolution, passed by a 51-48 vote tally, would end Trump's emergency declaration on fentanyl that underpins tariffs on Canada.

After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his reciprocal tariff threats by declaring on Wednesday a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker held the Senate floor with a marathon speech that lasted all night and into Tuesday afternoon in a feat of endurance to show Democrats' objections to President Donald Trump's sweeping actions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night that would thwart President Donald Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada, delivering a rare rebuke to the president just hours after he unveiled sweeping plans to clamp down on international trade.



The Senate resolution, passed by a 51-48 vote tally with four Republicans and all Democrats in support, would end Trump's emergency declaration on fentanyl trafficking that underpins tariffs on Canada. Trump earlier Wednesday announced orders — his so-called “Liberation Day” — to impose import taxes on a slew of international trading partners, though Canadian imports for now were spared from new taxes.

The Senate's legislation has practically no chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Trump, but it showed the limits of Republican support for Trump's vision of remaking the U.S. economy by restricting free trade. Many economists are warning that the plan could cause an economic contraction, and GOP senators are already watching with unease as Trump upends the United States' relationship with the rest of the world.



Trump earlier Wednesday singled out the four Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky — who voted in favor of the resolution.






In a statement following the vote, McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader, said, “As I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most.”

To justify the tariffs, Trump has argued that Canada is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs from entering the northern border. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl in its northern border sector during the 2024 fiscal year, and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data. Meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year.



“This is not about fentanyl. It's about tariffs. It's about a national sales tax on American families,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who initiated the resolution, at a news conference Wednesday. 



Democrats argued that Trump is using the tariffs to pay for proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, but will also make it more expensive to build homes, buy cars and pay for imported grocery products. Kaine pointed to aluminum imported from Canada that is used by businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders.

“Today, Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to the American economy and even to the American dream,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech. 



On the heels of election results in Wisconsin and Florida that delivered early warning signs to Republicans about the popularity of Trump's agenda, Schumer said that the president is particularly vulnerable when it comes to the economy.



“Once the American people say, ‘I don't want to embrace somebody, I don't want to vote for somebody, I don't want to support somebody who embraces Trump's policies,' things are going to change,” he told reporters. “Public sentiment is everything.”

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump singled out Canada as a beneficiary of “unfair” trading practices with the U.S., though his latest order did not add to tariffs already in place on Canada and Mexico.



“Why are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say, ‘You've got to work for yourselves and you've got to'? This is why we have the big deficits,” Trump said.



For their part, Republican leaders tried to hold their members in line not by talking about the impacts of tariffs, but by emphasizing that Trump was acting to address fentanyl trafficking and border security.



Majority Whip Sen. John Barrasso argued in a floor speech that former President Joe Biden had “also thrown open the northern border. The criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage.”



“There are unique threats to the United States at our northern border,” the Wyoming senator said. “President Trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well.”



Republicans lined up on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon to underscore the need to act to halt fentanyl trafficking, including at the northern border. However, it was not enough to persuade a key group of Senate Republicans who objected to the tax on Canadian imports.



In a floor speech Wednesday, Collins said she would support the resolution and noted, “The fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border.”



Collins said that Canada is already beefing up border security to address drug trafficking, yet she was concerned about what tariffs would do to businesses and households in Maine. She pointed to a paper mill in her home state that pumps paper pulp from Canada.



“A tariff placed on this pulp would jeopardize the financial wellbeing of this vital paper mill, which employs more than 500 people in rural, northern Maine. There is not another big employer in that area that can possibly compensate for the loss of those 510 direct jobs,” Collins said.






Paul, a Kentucky Republican who often supports libertarian economic views, also delivered an impassioned floor speech, arguing that the president should not be given unilateral authority to impose taxes on imports.



“Every dollar collected in tariff revenue comes straight out of the pockets of American consumers,” he said. “Conservatives used to understand that tariffs are taxes on the American people. Conservatives used to be uniformly opposed to raising taxes because we wanted the private marketplace, the private individuals to keep more of their income.”



While a younger group of Republicans closely aligned with Trump has spoken out in favor of the president's plans to aggressively reshape the economy, a sizable portion of the Republican Conference voiced concerns about the tariff impacts on farmers and other industries. Still, most wanted to give Trump room in hopes that he would negotiate better trade deals.



North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said that he has been in constant talks with both Canadian officials and businesses in his state, like Bobcat, which does a significant amount of its sales in Canada. He voted against the resolution. Instead, he hoped that Trump's order would just be a starting point for negotiations to mutually drop tariffs.



The Republican added: “I'm not overly concerned about it, but obviously it occupies a lot of attention and time and a lot of political anxiety.”



Democrats planned to keep pressing into that anxiety. After Trump's announcement, Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on social media he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.



“Republicans can't keep ducking this — it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a new 20% tariff on the European Union drew a sharp rebuke from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She said it was a major blow to the world economy and the consequences “will be dire for millions of people.”

These live updates have ended. See what you missed below and follow Thursday's live updates. 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others — that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.

Trump, in a Rose Garden announcement, said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States while imposing a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency.

The action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability.

What to know about Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs:



Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said the new U.S. tariffs may violate NATO's Article 2, which stresses the importance of economic cooperation among allies to avoid conflict. 

“If you want a strong NATO, you should ensure that there is as much economic growth as possible in the NATO countries. That was the insight of those who established NATO, that economic cooperation would be good for the entire alliance,” Eide said during a visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, according to the NRK broadcaster.

Eide told NRK that he will raise the tariff war with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the meeting.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the new U.S. tariffs many reduce Poland's GDP by 0.4%. 

He said it was “a severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it.” The Polish-U.S. friendship, he added, “must also survive this test.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Thursday that his government will implement a $15.6 billion (14.1 billion euro) spending package to mitigate the effects of U.S. tariffs on the eurozone's fourth-largest economy.

The Spanish leader called the tariffs “19th-century protectionism,” against which the European Union and Spain had to act proactively and diversify their economic ties with the rest of the world. 

Sánchez also called for a negotiated solution with the U.S. “We're once again asking President Trump to reconsider, to sit down at the negotiating table with the European Union and also with the rest of the world.”

The local government leader of Christmas Island, one of several Australian external island territories that like Australia have been assigned a 10% U.S. tariff, said his Indian Ocean atoll exported nothing to the United States.

The Australian outpost of fewer than 2,000 people 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta has used U.S. heavy machinery to mine phosphate for decades, Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thomson said.

The uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the remote Antarctic are another Australian territory included in the 10% tariff. The mostly barren islands include two active volcanoes and can only be reached by sea.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. imports. The U.S. and Australia have a free trade agreement.

Hong Kong strongly opposed the extra tariffs announced by Trump and urged the U.S. to withdraw them. It said Hong Kong, as a free port, always practices free trade and doesn't impose tariffs on imported goods, including those from the U.S. 

It said the U.S. had a trade surplus of $271.5 billion with the semiautonomous Chinese territory over the past decade, the highest among its global trading partners.

“The U.S. imposing tariffs on Hong Kong products as so-called reciprocal tariffs defies logic,” Hong Kong's government said in a statement, adding that it would take measures including filing complaints with the WTO. 

Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to China in 1997, has a different economic and political system from mainland China that allows it to set its own policies most of the time.

India's Trade Ministry is assessing the latest U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. It said the Indian government strives to expedite the negotiations for a trade agreement with the U.S. to potentially garner some concessions and offset the impact of higher import taxes.

The agreement, first tranche of which is expected to be in place by the fall, would focus on enabling both nations to boost trade, investments and technology transfers in addition to deepening supply chain integrations, it said.

“We remain in touch with the Trump administration and expect to take them forward in the coming days,” it said. 

The U.S was New Delhi's biggest trading partner in 2024 with trade estimated at $129 billion. The countries have now set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.

Vietnam's stock market plunged Thursday while gold prices reached a record high after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped 46% tariffs on Vietnam's exports. Meanwhile people lined up to buy gold in Hanoi despite the high prices. 

“Investing in gold would be at lower risk because the economy is very uncertain at the moment,” said Nguyen Trung, a buyer. 

Vietnam has long realized that it was too reliant on the U.S. and has been diversifying its trade relations by signing free trade agreements with over a dozen countries, said Dan Martin, international business adviser of Dezan Shira & Associates. 

“The lesson is clear now, the reliance that Vietnam had as a U.S. export market, it's not safe,” he said.Especially hard-hit will be the garments and sportswear section, including household names like Adidas and Nike. Nike made of its shoes and about a third of its clothes in Vietnam last year, while factories in Vietnam made 39% of Adidas's shoes and 18% of its clothes.

Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said that the country still hoped to reach its economic growth target of at least 8% despite the Trump administration imposing 46% tariffs on its exports.

Chinh chaired a Cabinet meeting Thursday to assess the impact of the tariffs, among the highest imposed on any country, and said that Vietnam hoped that U.S. policy would be “consistent with the good relations between the two countries.” He added that Vietnam was still overcoming the consequences of the long war between the two nations.

The tariffs will deal a severe blow to Vietnam since the U.S. is its largest export market. Exports to the U.S., valued at $142 billion, in 2021 made up a third of the country's GDP.

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, said that these are “the most disruptive tariff increases for 90 years.” He also drew a comparison with the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

“I think this is an extraordinary day for the world economy, comparable with the situation after the Russian aggression on Ukraine, where we knew that something new was happening and we were not prepared in Europe to cope with the challenge,” Habeck told reporters in Berlin. “And we looked in(to) the abyss in that time, but we worked it out and we managed it by putting aside everything that was restricting economic strength and energy security.”

“I think a similar reaction is necessary now from the European Union and its world partners,” Habeck said.

Ukraine is working to get better tariff conditions from the United States, Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko wrote on her X account. 

Svyrydenko says Ukrainian tariffs on U.S. goods are “quite low” and that Ukraine imported more goods from the U.S. in 2024 than exported to the country. 

She said the 10% tariff Trump imposed on Ukrainian goods will mainly impact small producers. “Ukraine has something to offer the United States as a reliable ally and partner. Both our countries will benefit from fair tariffs,” she wrote.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said it was “extremely regrettable” that the United States slapped the 25% auto tariff on Japan despite its huge contribution to the U.S. economy. 

Japanese companies have been the world's biggest investors in the U.S. since 2019, especially automakers, creating jobs for millions of Americans, Ishiba said.

Ishiba said Japan will continue to strongly request the United States to reconsider its tariffs measures and that he will directly negotiate with Trump, whenever it is considered appropriate. “I will do so at a most appropriate time and method without hesitation.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says the tariffs are an “attack” on a trading system that brought global prosperity and that America itself helped design.

Scholz said Thursday “the whole global economy will suffer from these decisions that haven't been thought through.” He added that “the U.S. administration is setting off on a road at the end of which there will only be losers.”

Scholz said in Berlin that “this is an attack on a trading order that has created prosperity across the globe – a trading order that is also to a very significant extent the result of American efforts.”

Among the small island nations of the South Pacific Ocean, a few were singled out for higher tariff rates than the 10% baseline. Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad on Thursday criticized as “disproportionate” and “unfair” the 32% tariffs announced on Fiji's exports to the U.S.

The U.S. is a major trading partner for the nation of 924,000 people, accounting for 10% of total imports and exports, Prasad said Thursday on social media. Fiji's biggest export to the U.S. is bottled water, with its most famous brand — Fiji Water — owned by a U.S. conglomerate.

The U.S. administration justified Fiji's higher tariffs with a claim that the Pacific nation imposes 63% tariffs on American goods arriving on its shores. Prasad rejected that figure, telling reporters that Fiji does not impose such tariff rates on any country.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson says “there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism is not a way out. What the U.S. should do is to correct its wrong practices and resolve trade disputes with all countries, including China, through consultations based on equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.”

Guo Jiakun added that the tariffs violate WTO rules, “harm the common interests of people of all countries, and do not help solve the problems of the U.S. itself. It is clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the U.S.'s unilateral bullying actions, such as imposing tariffs.”

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says his office is studying Trump's tariff order and “analyzing its implications for the economy,” in the country's first reaction to Trump's announcement of a 17% tariff on imports from Israel.

On Wednesday, ahead of Trump's announcement, Israel cancelled all remaining tariffs on imports from the U.S. The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement the move would go into effect after final approval by the economy minister and the parliament's finance committee.

Smotrich said in a statement on X he was talking with industry leaders about Trump's new order and would meet Thursday with the Finance Ministry leadership to decide on “courses of action” in response to it.

Spain's Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said a negotiated solution with the United States was essential for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy, but that Spain was prepared to take steps to protect its companies and industries.

“We have a lot at stake. We have to protect the very important trade and economic relationship we have between the planet's two biggest partners,” Cuerpo said in an interview Thursday with the RNE radio station after the U.S. announced 20% tariffs against the European Union.

“This day is not going to become Liberation Day for consumers in the U.S., but Inflation Day,” said Germany's vice chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck. “The U.S. mania for tariffs could set off a spiral that could also pull countries into recession and cause massive damage worldwide.”

“We have always pushed for negotiations, not confrontation. That remains right,” Habeck said. “So it is good that the European Commission still aims for a negotiated solution with the U.S. There is still some time for that. But if the U.S. doesn't want a negotiated solution, the EU will give a balanced, clear and determined answer. We have prepared for this.”

Germany's main industry lobby group, the Federation of German Industries, said that “the EU must now strengthen its alliances with other major trading partners and should coordinate its reaction with them. A coordinated reaction is also necessary to counter diversionary effects in international trade.”

The group, known by its German acronym BDI, said that the tariffs are “an unprecedented attack on the international trade system, free trade and global supply chains. The reasoning for this protectionist escalation is incomprehensible.”

The United States was Germany's biggest single trading partner last year for the first time since 2015, displacing China.

Watch the playback of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's response to U.S. President Donald Trump's far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. government would react with “cool and calm heads” to Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on imports from Britain.

Starmer told business leaders gathered in 10 Downing St. that “clearly there will be an economic impact,” but that he still hoped to get tariffs lifted through a trade deal with Washington.

“Negotiations on an economic prosperity deal — one that strengthens our existing trading relationship — they continue and we will fight for the best deal for Britain,” Starmer said.

“Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest,” he added.

Honda Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe says the Japanese automaker will take some time to look at the market situation and other factors to determine the right way to respond to Trump's tariffs.

“Sudden changes like this are tough as it's hard to respond speedily,” he told reporters on Thursday.

Taiwan responded to the imposition of a 32% tariff on its high-tech economy by calling it “strongly unreasonable and highly regrettable,” adding it would “lodge solemn representations with the United States.”

“The proposed tax rate does not reflect the actual economic and trade situation between Taiwan and the United States (and) is unfair to Taiwan,” Cabinet spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said in an official news release.

Lee said the tariff calculation method was unscientific and unclear and “cannot reflect the high degree of complementarity in the trade structure between Taiwan and the U.S. and the actual trade relationship.”

Taiwan's exports to the U.S. and corresponding trade surplus have risen significantly in recent years, mainly reflecting the surge in demand from U.S. customers for semiconductors and related products, especially AI products, Lee said.

The British government says it will push to secure a free trade deal with the United States rather than retaliate after Trump slapped a 10% tariff on U.K. goods.

Labelling the announcement a “disappointment,” Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said “I'm pleased the U.K. is in a better position than other countries, but I'm not satisfied.”

Reynolds told Sky News that the message he was hearing from businesses was “remain at the table, don't overreact.”

Britain argues that it has a broadly balanced trade relationship with the U.S., and has been negotiating with Washington on a trade deal in hope of escaping import taxes.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba says the tariffs are a matter of great concern and stressed that Japan's contributions to the American economy are significant both in terms of investment and jobs.

He said he repeatedly made his case with the Trump administration not to move ahead with the tariffs.

“They will have a great impact not only on U.S.-Japanese economic relations but also on the global economy and various trade relations overall,” Ishiba told reporters Thursday. 

“We as the government will work as one to decisively protect people's lives, jobs and industries,” he added.

The Thai prime minister says her country is ready to negotiate with the U.S. to find a fair trade balance for both sides, after Trump announced 36% tariffs on Thailand.

Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thursday that Thailand is committed to working with the U.S. to achieve sustainable economic growth.

She added that Thai exporters should also look for additional markets for their products to reduce their risk of relying on one main market.

Indian exporters and analysts say Trump's new tariffs are a mixed bag for the country.

Trump announced a reciprocal tariff of 26% for India, as compared to 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam, 37% for Bangladesh and 36% for Thailand.

Observers said Thursday the move will likely impact Indian industry and pressure jobs, but that there is room for new business to come in since India is in a lower band than its Asian peers.

“These tariffs do present challenges, but India's position remains comparatively favorable,” said S.C Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisations.

Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the New Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative, said the protectionist tariff regime could be a catalyst for India to gain from global supply chain realignments.

Vietnam, Sri Lanka and other countries across South and Southeast Asia are the targets of some of the highest tariff rates. 

Trump imposed 46% “reciprocal” duties on goods from Vietnam, 49% on products from Cambodia, 37% on Bangladesh and 44% on Sri Lanka. 

The duties will affect domestic exporters to the U.S. but also Chinese, Japanese and South Korean companies that have over the past few years shifted production to Southeast Asian nations to escape the trade frictions during Trump's first term in office.

Automaker Stellantis will shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, Canada, for two weeks from April 7, the local union said late Wednesday.

The president of Unifor Local 444, James Stewart, said more scheduling changes were expected in coming weeks.

“The company said there are multiple factors at play, with the primary driver behind the final decision being this afternoon's announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump of the U.S. tariffs,” Stewart said. “This has and continues to create uncertainty across the entire auto industry. This is not just affecting our plant—it's impacting facilities in the U.S. and Mexico as well.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the tariffs are a “major blow to the world economy.”

“The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,” von der Leyen said. Groceries, transport and medicines will cost more, she said, “And this is hurting, in particular, the most vulnerable citizens.”

Von der Leyen acknowledged that the world trading system has “serious deficiencies” and said the EU was ready to negotiate with the U.S.

Japan's chief cabinet secretary has called the tariffs “extremely regrettable,” saying officials thought the country deserved an exemption, after Trump slapped 24% additional tariffs on Japan.

Yoshimasa Hayashi on Thursday also questioned whether the tariffs are compatible with Japan-U.S. bilateral trade agreements and said the move would likely impact their economic ties, as well as the global economy and multilateral trade system.

He said Japanese officials are continuing to negotiate with Washington seeking an exemption. Asked if Japan would consider retaliatory tariffs or file complaints with the World Trade Organization, Hayashi declined to comment.

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to counter tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Speaking shortly after President Donald Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, Carney insisted Canadian workers will be protected.



Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index dipped more than 3.4%, while the Kospi in South Korea dropped 1.8%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 also sank 1.8%. 

U.S. stocks whipped through another dizzying day before Trump's unveiled the tariffs Wednesday. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, and the Dow gained 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite surged 0.9%. 

Tesla swung from a sharp loss in the morning to a gain later in the day to help pull the market higher. Treasury yields also veered from lower to higher following a better-than-expected report on the job market.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer fielded mostly friendly questions during an hourlong telephone town hall with constituents in Minnesota.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has encouraged Republican lawmakers to avoid holding in-person town halls where they'd run the risk of hostile questioning and protesters.

Emmer extensively praised the actions that Trump has been taking in his first months back in office, including the tariffs he announced earlier Wednesday.

“How about we give this guy some grace while he tried to actually do what he's been campaigning on for years and his mission to protect American companies and workers?” Emmer said. “There's still going to be some choppy waters, but when we come out the other side, it's going to be much better than it was beforehand, and certainly much better than it was the last four years.”

South Korea's acting leader called for swift emergency measures to support the auto industry and other businesses potentially affected by the Trump administration's new tariffs, pledging full government efforts to address what he described as a looming “global tariff war.”

During an emergency government meeting, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo also instructed officials to work with business groups to analyze the impact of the U.S. tariff increases and actively engage in negotiations with Washington to “minimize damage” to South Korea's economy, the trade ministry said.

Han, serving as South Korea's acting leader while President Yoon Suk Yeol remains impeached over his December imposition of martial law, convened the meeting with trade and foreign policy officials after Trump announced a 25% tariff on South Korea.

The Republican from Pennsylvania said allies and enemies alike have taken advantage of the U.S. for far too long but also suggested that some products should be exempt.

Perry, whose district is home to the candy-making Hershey Company, said products like cocoa and coffee — which cannot be grown domestically in most of the U.S. — should get an exemption.

“We don't really have much of a choice except to buy them from somebody, from the countries that produce those things,” Perry said during a nearly 90-minute telephone town hall.

He acknowledged that Trump's tariffs would cause “some market disruptions” but said there can be a “sweet spot” in which the U.S. evens the tariff scales with trading partners.

“I do think that our country has been taken advantage of for a long time by enemies and by allies alike, and I think that we should have more of a level playing field,” Perry said.

The resolution delivers the president a rare rebuke just hours after he unveiled sweeping plans to clamp down on international trade. It would end the presidential emergency declaration on fentanyl that underpins tariffs on Canada. 

The legislation has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Trump, but it shows the limits of Republican support for Trump's vision of remaking the U.S. economy by restricting free trade.

Mike Pence is not a fan of Trump's new tariffs.

The former vice president posted on the social platform X, “The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.”

“These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year,” Pence wrote.

Pence was once among Trump's fiercest loyalists. The pair have feuded since Pence refused to heed Trump's calls to ignore the Constitution and attempt to help overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.

Trump's tariffs have initially been met with measured reactions from key trading partners, highlighting the lack of appetite for a full-fledged trade war. 

The fact that the tariffs fell most heavily on parts of the world sleeping through the night appeared to at least temporarily delay some of the potential outrage. 

Trump presented the import taxes in the simplest terms: The U.S. would do to its trading partners what he said they had been doing to the U.S. for decades. Some countries have taken issue with the White House's calculations.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says Trump's measures are going to fundamentally change the international trading system but preserved a number of important elements of the commercial relationship between Canada and the U.S.

Spared for the moment from the latest round of tariffs were Canada and Mexico, so far as goods that already qualified under their free trade agreement with the United States.

The previously announced 25% steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place. Carney says the impact on the U.S. economy will be negative and that will impact Canada. Carney says the measures will impact millions of Canadians and his government will fight it with countermeasures.

He says he will meet with his Cabinet committee on U.S. Canada relations Wednesday evening and with the premiers of Canada's provinces Thursday morning before he has more to say.

Tom Wark, the executive director of the National Association of Wine Retailers, said the tariffs will hurt wine sellers because many of the products they sell — like Champagne and prosecco — can only be made overseas.

Wark said higher prices for a discretionary item like wine will further challenge the industry, which has already been hurt by inflation and downturns in consumption.

“Tariffs on imported wines aid no one,” Wark said.

The new duties could raise the average U.S. tariff rate to as high as 25%, according to calculations by two different economists, from about 3%. Such an increase, if it remains in force, would leave U.S. duties at their highest level in decades.

Omair Sharif, an economist and founder of Inflation Insights, said the duties would even top the 20% rate put in place by the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that were imposed in 1933 and are widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.

Still, economists said the fact that the tariffs won't take effect until April 5 at least leaves room for some last-minute negotiations that could delay or alter the import taxes.

House Republicans wasted little time adding to their thin majority Wednesday with Speaker Mike Johnson swearing in the chamber's two newest members less than 24 hours after their special election victories.

Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine of Florida took the oath of office on the House floor during a pro-forma session in which no roll call votes are held.

They are filling vacant seats in two reliably Republican congressional districts. The partisan breakdown in the House is now 220 Republicans to 213 Democrats, with two vacancies due to the deaths of Democratic Reps. Sylvester Turner of Texas and Raul Grijalva of Arizona.

Patronis said in a brief speech that he's “ready to get to work to support President Trump's agenda.”

Fine, who recalled working as a Capitol page some 35 years ago, said for those who haven't followed him, “‘fighter' will be the word that you know soon enough.”

An advocacy group for electric vehicles says Trump's tariffs will increase costs to consumers and make it more difficult for the U.S. to attract investment for electric vehicles and battery supply chains.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the tariffs introduce “uncertainty and risk into an industry that is creating jobs and bringing new economic opportunities to communities across the country.”

The plan will likely harm long-standing U.S. trade partners such as Canada, Mexico and South Korea that have committed billions in direct investment in electric vehicles and battery supply chains, Gore said.

Building new manufacturing capacity and securing supply chains for components and hardrock minerals needed for EVs and other technology is essential to help the U.S. compete with China, he said.

The entire 17-member U.S. government team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health received layoff notices Tuesday, as part of the overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

It's not clear whether there's an alternative plan for analyzing the survey data, which local and state governments use to develop prevention measures and treatment services.

The federal government distributes grant money to fight the opioid addiction crisis based on it. Researchers use it to study trends in depression, alcoholism and tobacco use.Before the layoffs, the government team was preparing to analyze 2024 data.

Democratic leaders are sharing a rare moment of relief — if not celebration — as they cling to election results from Wisconsin and Florida that offered a glimmer of hope for their party. 

For a day, at least, there was an overwhelming sense that the Democratic Party's comeback may have begun. 

And it wasn't just the election results. Some Democrats highlighted New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's marathon 25-hour Senate speech as a rallying point that could inspire frustrated voters. 

Some party officials are warning that it's far too early to draw sweeping conclusions from a series of off-year elections with polls still showing that the party's brand is deeply unpopular.

New Zealand's trade minister, Todd McClay, said the 10% tariffs announced on his country's goods were “not unexpected” and would “have an impact” on exporters.

McClay told reporters that officials were awaiting more detail about what the announcement meant for the Pacific nation of 5 million people and how it would be implemented.

“It is important to note that many other countries around the world are facing much higher tariff rates than New Zealand exporters will be,” he said.

McClay said New Zealand “won't be looking to retaliate.”

“That would put up prices on New Zealand consumers, and it would be inflationary,” he said.

AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said strategic tariffs can be an effective tool for supporting U.S. industries and protecting jobs, but they must be accompanied by policies that invest in manufacturing and promote workers' right to organize.

“Unfortunately, the Trump administration's attacks on trade union workers' rights at home, gutting of the government agency that works to discourage the outsourcing of American jobs and efforts to erode critical investments in U.S. manufacturing take us backward,” Shuler said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for trade policy that prioritizes the interests of working people without causing unnecessary economic pain for America's working families.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that one of the purposes of the tariffs “is setting the stage for long-term economic growth”

“With our gigantic government spending, it was unsustainable,” Bessent said. “We have taken us off that trajectory, and we're putting us back on a sound trajectory.”

When asked how countries like China, which will see a 54% total tariff rate on imports, should respond, Bessent said, “We'll see what they do.”

“My advice to every country right now: Do not retaliate,” he said. “If you retaliate, there will be escalation.”

A group of scientists and health groups are suing the National Institutes of Health, arguing that an “ideological purge” of research funding is illegal and threatens medical cures.

Since Trump took office, hundreds of NIH research grants have been abruptly canceled for science that mentions the words diversity, gender and vaccine hesitancy, as well as other politically charged topics.

That has led to grants being cut that fund studies of HIV prevention, violence prevention in children, pregnancy health disparities and Alzheimer's disease, among others, according to the lawsuit.

The suit aims to restore the money and end the terminations, arguing they violate NIH's usual science-based review process, specific orders from Congress to tackle health equity and disparities, and federal regulations.

The suit was filed by the American Public Health Association, unions representing scientists and some researchers who were stripped of grants. The Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment.

Tornadoes and violent storms struck parts of the South and Midwest on Wednesday, killing at least one person, knocking down power lines and trees, ripping roofs off homes and shooting debris thousands of feet into the air.

A tornado emergency was briefly issued in northeast Arkansas, with the National Weather Service telling residents on social media: “This is a life threatening situation. Seek shelter now.”

Dozens of tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Mississippi as storms hit those and other states in the evening. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to daytime heating combining with an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming into the nation's midsection from the Gulf.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol said at least one person was killed Wednesday in southeast Missouri, KFVS-TV reported.

The coming days were also forecast to bring the risk of potentially deadly flash flooding to the South and Midwest as severe thunderstorms blowing eastward become supercharged. The potent storm system will bring “significant, life-threatening flash flooding” each day through Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

With more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain possible over the next four days, the prolonged deluge “is an event that happens once in a generation to once in a lifetime,” the weather service said. “Historic rainfall totals and impacts are possible.”

More than 90 million people were at some risk of severe weather in a huge part of the nation stretching from Texas to Minnesota and Maine, according to the Oklahoma-based Storm Prediction Center.

A tornado emergency was briefly declared around Blytheville, Arkansas, Wednesday evening, with debris lofted at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers), according to Chelly Amin, a meteorologist with the weather service. That was the weather service's highest alert, and rare. It was not immediately clear whether there were any injuries.

“It's definitely going to be a really horrible situation here come sunrise in the morning in those areas, coming out of Arkansas,” Amin said.

More than 2 miles (3 kilometers) of Highway 18 in the area was temporarily shut down due to a downed power line.

A tornado was also reported on the ground near Harrisburg, Arkansas, in the evening.

The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management reported that there was damage in 22 counties due to tornadoes, wind gusts, hail and flash flooding. At least four people were injured and there were no reports of fatalities as of Wednesday evening.

In Pilot Grove, Missouri, several structures were damaged, cars flipped over and power poles were snapped, the state emergency management agency said. Minor injuries were reported, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Meanwhile roads were closed because of storm debris and downed utility lines near the town of Potosi, southwest of St. Louis, according to the state transportation department.

Authorities in eastern Missouri were trying to determine whether it was a tornado that damaged buildings, overturned vehicles and tore down utility poles, tree limbs and business signs in the morning in and around the city of Nevada. 

Another tornado touched down in the northeastern Oklahoma city of Owasso about 6:40 a.m., according to the weather service office in Tulsa. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but the twister heavily damaged the roofs of homes and knocked down power lines, trees, fences and sheds.

Forecasters at the National Weather Service office in the area of Paducah, Kentucky, took cover during a warning at night. 

“We're all good here at the office, the circulation JUST missed us to the south,” the agency said on social media.

Power was knocked out to nearly 90,000 customers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide. As storms moved through Indiana on Wednesday night, more than 182,000 customers lost power. 

News outlets reported part of a warehouse collapsed in Brownsburg, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis, temporarily trapping at least one person inside, while the police department told people to not travel through the city. Five semitrucks were blown over on Interstate 65 near Lowell, Indiana, state police reported. 

The dangerous weather came nearly two years to the day after an EF-3 tornado struck Little Rock, Arkansas. No one was killed, but there was major destruction to neighborhoods and businesses that are still being rebuilt today.

About 2.5 million people were in a rarely called “high-risk” zone, covering parts of west Tennessee including Memphis; northeast Arkansas; the southeast corner of Missouri; and parts of western Kentucky and southern Illinois.

The Storm Prediction Center said “multiple long-track EF3+ tornadoes” were likely. Tornadoes of that magnitude are among the strongest on the Enhanced Fujita scale, used to rate their intensity.

At a slightly lower risk for severe weather was an area that included Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Louisville, Kentucky. Dallas, Detroit, Milwaukee and Nashville, Tennessee, were also at risk.

A line of thunderstorms dropped heavy rain through parts of Indiana on Wednesday night. At least one street was flooded in Indianapolis, with water nearly reaching the windows of several cars, according to the city's metropolitan police department. No one was in the vehicles.

Additional rounds of heavy rain were expected in parts of Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley from midweek through Saturday. Forecasters warned that they could track over the same areas repeatedly, producing dangerous flash floods capable of sweeping cars away. 

Middle Tennessee was looking at severe storms followed by four days of heavy rains as the front stalls out and sticks around through the weekend, according to NWS meteorologist Mark Rose. 

“I don't recall ever seeing one like this, and I've been here 30 years,” Rose said. “It's not moving.”

Rain totaling up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) was forecast over the next seven days in northeastern Arkansas, the southeast corner of Missouri, western Kentucky and southern parts of Illinois and Indiana, the weather service warned, with some areas in Kentucky and Indiana at an especially high risk for flooding.

In Michigan, crews worked to restore power after a weekend ice storm. More than 122,000 customers were still without electricity on Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us.

The Mackinac Bridge connecting Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas was shut down because large chunks of ice were falling from cables and towers. It was the third consecutive day of bridge interruptions from the ice storm.

Trump signs executive orders on sweeping ‘reciprocal' tariffs

President Donald Trump holds up a chart while announcing his sweeping new reciprocal tariffs, showing the United States will charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan.

President Donald Trump is set to sign a barrage of self-described “reciprocal” tariffs on friend and foe alike. The new tariffs — coming on what Trump has called “Liberation Day” — is a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish other countries.

After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his reciprocal tariff threats by declaring on Wednesday a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.

President Donald Trump has announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — including a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others — that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.




Trump, in a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States, while imposing a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency. 

The president, who said the tariffs were designed to boost domestic manufacturing, used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the United States helped to build after World War II, saying “our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other nations.

The action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability. 

Trump said he was acting to bring in hundreds of billions in new revenue to the U.S. government and restore fairness to global trade. 

“Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,” he said. “But it is not going to happen anymore.”




Trump declared a national economic emergency to levy the tariffs. He has promised that factory jobs will return to the United States as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes.

Trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on trade partners, acting without Congress under the 1977 International Emergency Powers Act. But his action Wednesday could jeopardize Trump's voter mandate in last year's election to combat inflation. Several Republican senators, particularly from farm and border states, have questioned the wisdom of the tariffs. U.S. stock market futures sold off sharply overnight in anticipation of the economy weakening, after having already dropped since the start of this year.

“With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression,” said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The president's higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. The administration essentially calculated its tariff rates to raise revenues equal in size to the trade imbalances with those nations. Trump then halved that rate in an act that he described as “very kind.”

The White House says the tariffs and other trade imbalances led to an $1.2 trillion imbalance last year. Administration officials suggested it could take an extended set of actions by other countries to bring down the new tariffs their imports now face, and retaliatory tariffs by those countries could make the situation worse.

Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said the average tariff rate charged by the United States would increase to roughly 22% from 2.5% in 2024.

“Many countries will likely end up in a recession,” Sonola said. “You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.”

The new tariffs will come on top of recent announcements of 25% taxes on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. Trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from Venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.

Canada and Mexico would not face higher rates on what they're already being charged by Trump in what he says is an effort to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. As of now, goods that comply with the USMCA North American trade pact would be excluded from those tariffs.

But the 20% charged on imports from China due to its role in fentanyl production would largely be added to the 34% announced by Trump. The specific products that Trump is tariffing, such as autos, would be exempt from the tariffs unveiled Wednesday, as would products such as pharmaceutical drugs that he plans to tariff at a later date.

None of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash.

Senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of Trump's speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. They said the 10% baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that Trump presented in the Rose Garden.

The 10% rate would be collected starting Saturday and the higher rates would be collected beginning April 9.

Trump removed the tariff exemptions on imports from China worth $800 or less. He plans to remove the exemptions other nations have on imports worth $800 or less once the federal government certifies that is has the staffing and resources in place.

Based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some White House aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. 

Trump would be applying these tariffs on his own; he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. That makes it easy for Democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. 

Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., said the tariffs are “part of the chaos and dysfunction” being generated across the Trump administration. The chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee stressed that Trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers' approval, saying that Republicans so far have been “blindly loyal.”

“The president shouldn't be able to do that,” DelBene said. “This is a massive tax increase on American families, and it's without a vote in Congress. ... President Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. Now he says he doesn't care if prices go up — he's broken his promise.”

Even Republicans who trust Trump's instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 % unemployment rate.

“We'll see how it all develops,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “It may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.”

Longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. Canada has imposed some in response to the tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted Trump to threaten a 200% tariff on European alcohol.

Many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by Trump, who routinely says America's friends and foes have essentially ripped off the United States with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers.

The flip side is that Americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by French fashion houses and autos from German manufacturers, whereas World Bank data show the EU has lower incomes per capita than the U.S.

The Chinese government delivered a measured response to the new tariffs, saying in a statement: “China believes that protectionism leads nowhere, and trade and tariff wars have no winners. This has been widely recognized in the international community.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's new tariffs would “fundamentally change the international trading system.” He noted that the tariffs already in place against his country and those Trump says he plans to add will be fought with countermeasures.

“In a crisis, it's important to come together and it's essential to act with purpose and with force and that's what we will do,” Carney said.

Italy's conservative Premier Giorgia Meloni said Trump's new tariffs against the EU were “wrong” and Italy would work toward an agreement with the United States to avoid a trade war that would weaken all involved.

Basic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company is behind such classic toys as Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, has been working hard to come up with new ways to cut tariff-related costs like reduce packaging and eliminate batteries with the products.

But Trump's announcement that he plans a 34% increase in tariffs on Chinese imports has solidified his decision to hike prices. Most of the company's toys are made in China. He said the Tonka Mighty Dump Truck will go from $29.99 to $39.99 this holiday season, possibly even $45.

“There is no other way,” he said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes battered rebel-controlled areas of Yemen into Wednesday, with the Houthis saying the attacks killed at least six people across the country. 

Meanwhile, satellite images taken Wednesday and analyzed by The Associated Press show at least six stealth B-2 Spirit bombers now stationed at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean — a highly unusual deployment amid the Yemen campaign and tensions with Iran. 

The intense campaign of airstrikes in Yemen under U.S. President Donald Trump, targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters stemming from the Israel-Hamas war, has killed at least 67 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis. 

The campaign showed no signs of stopping as the Trump administration again linked its airstrikes on the Iranian-backed Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While so far giving no specifics about the campaign and its targets, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt put the overall number of strikes on Tuesday at more than 200. 

“Iran is incredibly weakened as a result of these attacks, and we have seen they have taken out Houthi leaders,” Leavitt said. “They've taken out critical members who were launching strikes on naval ships and on commercial vessels and this operation will not stop until the freedom of navigation in this region is restored.” 

The Houthis haven't acknowledged the loss of any of its leadership so far — and the U.S. hasn't identified any official by name. However, messages released by the leak of a Signal conversation between Trump administration officials and their public comments suggest a leader in the rebels' missile forces had been targeted. 

A likely U.S. airstrike targeted what the Houthis described as a “water project” in Hodeida governorate's Mansuriyah District, killing four people and wounding others. Other strikes into Wednesday targeted Hajjah, Saada and Sanaa governorates, the rebels said. Into Wednesday night, the Houthis said some 17 strikes hit Saada, with a person being killed in a strike at Ras Isa port in Hodeida and another at a telecommunication site on Jebel Namah mountain in Ibb governorate. 

The rebels say they've continued to launch attacks against U.S. warships in the Red Sea, namely the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which is carrying out the majority of the strikes on the Houthis. No warship has been struck yet, but the U.S. Navy has described the Houthi fire as the most intense combat its sailors have faced since World War II. 

The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, now in Asia, is on its way to the Middle East to back up the Truman. Early Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said that “additional squadrons and other air assets” would be deployed to the region, without elaborating. 

More than 300 airmen and several A-10 Thunderbolt IIs have deployed into the Middle East as well to support the mission from the Idaho Air National Guard. The troops, from Idaho's 124th Fighter Wing out of Boise, fly the aircraft known as the Warthog. The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees Mideast operations, posted an image Wednesday of two A-10s flying in the region.

Satellite photos taken Wednesday by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by the AP showed at least six nuclear-capable B-2 bombers deployed to Camp Thunder Bay on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. 

The deployment represents nearly a third of all the B-2 bombers in Washington's arsenal. It's highly unusual to see that many at one base abroad. Typically, so-called show of force missions involving the B-2 have seen two or three of the aircraft conduct operations in foreign territory. 

The B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat, because each aircraft is worth around $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The bombers are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there.

The U.S. has used the B-2 in Yemen last year to attack underground Houthi bases. The B-2 likely would need to be used if Washington ever tried to target Iran's underground nuclear sites as well. 

The Houthis on Tuesday said that they shot down another American MQ-9 drone over the country. 

An AP review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former U.S. President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.

The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.

The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.

The attacks greatly raised the profile of the Houthis, who faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers in Yemen amid a decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

Passengers onboard an American Airlines plane evacuated the aircraft from its wings after smoke was reported in the cabin upon landing in Georgia. 

Video captured by passenger Sean O'Conor showed travelers carrying their luggage as they were helped down from the wing of the jet Tuesday at Augusta Regional Airport. 

""It smelled like the brakes were burning or something, the cabin was filled with smoke, and we climbed out on the wing,"" a voice says in the footage. ""It looks like everybody is safe. Welcome to Augusta."" 

""American Eagle Flight 5406, operated by PSA Airlines, with service from Charlotte Douglas International Airport to Augusta Regional Airport, experienced a maintenance issue after landing safely in Augusta,"" American Airlines told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""All passengers deplaned and were escorted to the airport terminal. The safety of our customers is our top priority, and we apologize for the inconvenience.""

China's military launches drills aimed at sending Taiwan a ""severe warning"" against seeking independence, officials say.

The U.S. government banned employees and personnel in China from having romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens.

According to the Associated Press, four sources said that former U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns put the policy into place before leaving his post.

A watered-down version of the new policy was tested in summer 2024, which banned U.S. government employees in China from having ""romantic and sexual relations"" with Chinese citizens who were employed as support staff and guards at five consulates in China as well as the U.S. embassy.

Burns expanded that policy to cover all Chinese citizens just days before President Trump took office.

The policy was announced to American government staff located in China in January, but hasn't been announced publicly.

Two people with knowledge of the new policy told the Associated Press that it was implemented after several members of Congress reached out to Burns and voiced worries that there wasn't a policy in place that restricted such relationships with Chinese citizens.

Interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba joins Fox & Friends to discuss a 14-year-old gang member being charged as an adult in the fatal shooting of a police officer.

Interim New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has announced that a 14-year-old gang member accused of fatally shooting a Newark police detective will be charged as an adult in federal court as she vows to crack down on violent crime in the Garden State. 

The teen suspect, who has not yet been publicly identified and is an alleged member of the violent Bloods gang, is accused of shooting and killing Detective Joseph Azcona in Newark last month while he was inside his police vehicle. Another officer was also injured in the shooting. 

""We'll be charging that minor as an adult. We filed the papers yesterday,"" Habba told the New York Post on Wednesday as she accompanied a multi-agency law enforcement raid on wanted criminals in Brick City.

TRUMP TAPS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL ALINA HABBA FOR TOP ROLE AT DOJ

Habba, President Donald Trump's former attorney who was sworn in to her new role on Friday, issued a firm warning to violent underage offenders.

""The message is very clear: If you're a child, I don't care. If you shoot a cop, you're getting tried as an adult. I have no tolerance for violence and we're gonna clean up New Jersey.""

Offenders under age 15 cannot be tries as adults New Jersey but Habba said her office filed papers to take the case to federal court where the teen will be eligible.

""He's 14 years old; he's part of a gang — he shot a cop who came out to get him and the officer is now dead. He was 26 years old,"" Habba told the Post. 

The teen was initially charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of illegal weapons.

POLICE OFFICER KILLED, ANOTHER INJURED IN SHOOTING INVOLVING 14-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT: AUTHORITIES

The slain officer was part of a team of Newark police detectives and federal agents that had gone to capture a suspect in an illegal weapons sting when the officer was fired on in his vehicle, authorities said.

The other officer who was struck was hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening, authorities said. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka called the shooting a ""heinous, callous disregard for humanity"" and that officers had gone to the scene knowing that ""grave danger was possible.""

During Wednesday's raid, law enforcement arrested an 18-year-old alleged Bloods gang member with a history of weapons charges and wanted for aggravated assault after an incident in which he allegedly shot two people, the Post reported.

Habba, meanwhile, also outlined her zero tolerance for human trafficking in New Jersey. 

""One of my first orders of business was creating a Human Trafficking Task Force and appointing an incredibly talented and passionate Assistant U.S. Attorney to lead it,"" Habba wrote on X Wednesday.

""The World Cup will be hosted in New Jersey in 2026 and it will be safe. WE WILL BE READY!""

President Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Sunday night from Air Force One, where he was asked about a third term, ceasefire negotiations with Russia and tariffs on Iran.

If President Trump wants to secure a national security legacy that will never be other than history changing, the time to do so is fast approaching.

The Institute for the Study of War recently published this summary of the moment:

""Senior Iranian officials are continuing to threaten nuclear weaponization, likely to try to deter a potential US or Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities amid new US threats to strike these facilities. Senior Supreme Leader Adviser Ali Larijani stated on March 31 that a US or Israeli strike on Iran would ‘force' Iran to develop a nuclear weapon to ‘defend its security.' Western media reported in January 2025 that Larijani had made secret trips to Russia to gain Russian assistance on Iran's nuclear program. Hardline Iranian Parliamentarian Ahmad Naderi separately stated on March 31 that the United States ‘wouldn't dare threaten to bomb' Iran if Iran ‘had an atomic bomb.'  Naderi previously made similar statements in November and December 2024. Larijani and Naderi's comments echo recent calls from Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) officials for the Supreme Leader to allow the development of a nuclear weapon. The recent Iranian threats come after US President Donald Trump stated on March 30 that ‘there will be a bombing' if Iran does not agree to a new nuclear deal."" 

The report actually understates Trump's warnings because the very blunt statements made by Trump at least twice in the past week are crystal clear and made in public: Iran will not be allowed to ""break out"" and make a nuclear weapon. Period.

IRAN'S KHAMENEI WARNS OF ‘STRONG BLOW' AS TRUMP THREATENS TO DROP BOMBS, PUTIN SILENT ON US IRE

The president has also been precise. He'd much rather Iran negotiate the process by which it destroys its forbidden weapons program, but the president vowed he will use force if Ayatollah Khamenei refuses to deconstruct its nuke program and do so in a way that is verifiable. Trump sent the ""Supreme Leader"" of Iran a letter to that effect and he has been clear as clear can be: Iran can chose the easy way or the hard way, but it has to choose. Now.

At least three other presidents —President Joe Biden, President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush— have said similar things, but only Bush was believable, especially after Obama abandoned the explicit red line he drew for Syria about the use of chemical weapons and the Biden Regency botched the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

All three also said they would move the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and then didn't. Trump did. Trump has also unequivocally supported Israel in its war with Iran and Iran's proxies. As Prime Minister Netanyahu made clear in an extended interview this week, that was not the case with Biden and we know that Obama was the least supportive president of the Jewish State since its founding in 1948. Even a strong supporter of Israel like W pressured Israel to stop a conflict with Hezbollah after an intense period of combat when world pressure built on the U.S. and Israel.

That won't happen with Trump and Israel's end game in Gaza whatever Israel decides it will be. He's ""all in"" with Israel and all Israelis know it. Iran knows it too. So do our Sunni allies in the region.

At least a half-dozen B-2 bombers along with tankers and cargo aircraft have deployed to the island of Diego Gacia in recent weeks. The island airbase, a joint US-British base, is about 2,400 miles from from Iran's southern coast. The B-2s can reach everywhere in Iran.

The B-2s can also carry the heaviest and most destructive ordinance the U.S. makes including the deep-penetrating munitions, the ""bunker-busters,"" that could destroy many, if not all, of the nuclear program bases and facilities buried deep in Iran's mountains, locations widely believed to house Iran's advanced weapons programs and uranium enrichment equipment.

Even as the B-2s deployed to within striking range of the Islamic Republic of Iran, other actions by the American military have caused eyebrows to rise. A second carrier strike force, the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier with its flotilla of supporting ships, joined the USS Harry Truman (CVN-75) in the waters near both Yemen and Iran.

Advanced missile defense systems have also arrived in the region where, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, some 40,000 service members are deployed across at least nineteen sites. The pounding of the Houthis has continued unabated, but the B-2s are not forward deployed to hit Yemen's terrorist proxies of Iran and their tricked-up drones and speed boats. The target of those B-2s, if they fly into combat, will be Iran's nuclear facilities if Trump gives the order.

""I wish you civilians would pause to think about second-order impacts when you start talking about war.""

The United States Marine Corps colonel who told me that two decades back is a friend. We were touring Camp Pendleton in the early years of this century, more than a year after the invasion of Iraq when he told me this. I wasn't advocating for anything because I know too many senior military folks to dare to voice or even have opinions on such things as when and where America's military might strike, especially in the absence of the classified information Trump and his national security team are working from. But the colonel's admonition came back to me as the events above made headlines.

Among the many things the Marine Corps did in response to the first years of the war in Iraq was build a mock-up of an Iraqi village in which to train their youngest Marines on the intensity and instant decision-making required of them while patrolling a village that could be home to insurgents planning to ambush the Marines. I got taken through the training site as though I was a deployed ""embedded"" journalist —something I'd never actually done— and was astonished at the sheer number of decisions a sergeant and his Marines had to make over the course of about 45 minutes in a run-through exercise in the mock-up. The Marines trained and trained and trained.

Our pilots, sailors, submariners and drone operators —we don't know if any of our most lethal submarines are in the region, but it's a good bet they are— also train and train and train. But any mission in the skies over Iran will be risky, as will be the consequences of an intensive bombing campaign. Iran's nuclear program could be set back years, if not decades. The fragile regime could find itself engulfed by fury in the streets as well if Trump's maximum pressure campaign continues to dry up the regime's hard currency reserves. But the Iranian people could very well rally to the regime they generally despise if attacked by the U.S. We don't know. We can't know. There are too many variables.

But we do not know what Iran has deployed around the world —and in the U.S.— to strike back in response to such a campaign. We will not put ""boots on the ground"" in Iran, but the mullahs and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its expeditionary Quds Force may already have deployed their cells across Europe and the U.S. as pre-positioned ""paybacks-in-waiting.""

Iran has about a million men in arms at present. They could not easily embark on any sort of ground invasion that threatens us directly. But Iran's ballistic missile arsenal may number around 3,000 and some of those can travel more than 1200 miles.

While Iran did not penetrate Israel's defenses in its two strikes against the Jewish State in April and again in October of 2024, that doesn't mean Iran cannot hit other countries allied with the U.S.and Israel, including our allies in Europe.

The U.S. and other allies including the U.K. had warning of Iran's attacks on Israel last year and coordinated the successful defense. But that is not a guarantee that the third (and possibly fourth, fifth, sixth etc) strike from Iran won't exact a heavy toll. Taking out all or most of the nuclear sites won't cripple Iran's military.

But Trump has drawn a bright red line, though he hasn't used that term. He knows President Bill Clinton blinked in 1994 when North Korea approached breakout on that country's nuclear weapons program. The result of Clinton's stand-down is that North Korea now has a significant nuclear arsenal as well as the confidence such weaponry brings. Nukes provide the sort of shield that allows Kim Jong Un to dispatch tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia to fight alongside Putin's conscripts in the ongoing war against Ukraine. Having nuclear weapons changes everything for a country —and for its opponents. That's why Trump made his demand on Iran, made it early in his second term, made it explicit, and made it multiple times. Trump knows what a disaster it will be if Iran gets nukes.

If Trump orders the strikes, expect that they will be largely successful against the targets. But don't be surprised if an aging and angry Ayatollah undertakes even suicidal actions such as cyberattacks on our infrastructure and terrorist attacks in our cities. It's the sort of complex decision matrix that presidents have to weigh, judging all risks but also weighing the consequences of kicking the can down the road again.

On the edge of enormous events, American media seems almost oblivious to the highest-of-stake showdown unfolding before our eyes. But they are unfolding and rapidly.

An American Airlines flight from New York City to Tokyo was forced to turn around over the Pacific Ocean on Monday night before flying back to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas after experiencing a ""maintenance issue.""

American Airlines Flight 167 took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York at about 11 a.m. on Monday and was expected to land at Tokyo's Haneda Airport (HND) in Japan at about 2 p.m. the next day.

Flight Aware data shows that the aircraft had crossed the U.S. and was over the Pacific Ocean when nearly seven hours into the flight, it turned around and headed back toward the U.S.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew over several states, including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and Oklahoma, before ultimately landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport just before 10:15 p.m. local time on Monday.

American Airlines told Fox News Digital the flight was diverted due to a maintenance issue, though details surrounding the issue were not provided.

""We never want to disrupt our customers' travel plans, and we are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused,"" American said.

All passengers on the flight were provided hotel accommodations for the night, and the flight departed the next day for Tokyo.

The diversion comes after a series of aviation disasters in the U.S.

'The Big Weekend Show' panelists discuss the legal fight over deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

A federal judge will hear from government lawyers Thursday to determine whether the Trump administration defied court orders when it deported hundreds of migrants to El Salvador last month.

The hearing marks the latest clash between President Donald Trump and U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who Trump has publicly attacked as an ""activist"" judge and called for his impeachment. At issue is whether the administration knowingly violated Boasberg's emergency order, which temporarily blocked the deportations and required that any individuals removed under a centuries-old immigration law be ""immediately"" returned to U.S. soil. Flights carrying migrants, including those deported under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, still landed in El Salvador that same night.

""Oopsie…"" El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, wrote on X after they landed in his country. ""Too late.""

Boasberg, who issued the emergency orders at the center of the controversial and complex case, has said he intends to find out whether the administration knowingly violated them, and who, if anyone, should be held accountable.

""The government isn't being forthcoming,"" Boasberg told Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign during an earlier hearing. ""But I will get to the bottom of whether they complied with my order, who violated it and what the consequences will be.""

At Thursday's hearing, Boasberg is expected to revisit many of the same questions he raised earlier, including how many planes left the U.S. carrying individuals deported ""solely on the basis"" of the Alien Enemies Act. Other questions include how many individuals were on each plane and what time and from which location each plane took off. 

Although the administration has already appealed the case twice – first to the D.C. Circuit, which upheld Boasberg's order, and then to the Supreme Court – the judge is still pressing for answers. Thursday's hearing is part of his effort to determine whether the government defied the court when it carried out the deportation flights.

The Alien Enemies Act, passed in 1798, has been used only three times in American history – during the War of 1812 and the two world wars – making its modern application by the Trump administration a rare legal maneuver.

Trump officials have argued invoking the law is necessary to expel dangerous individuals, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, who were flown to El Salvador under the administration's new deportation policy.

Meanwhile, plaintiffs have pushed back on the administration's use of the 1798 law, calling its use during peacetime ""unprecedented.""

In a brief filed to the Supreme Court earlier this week, plaintiffs argued the law permits immediate deportations only in cases of a ""declared war"" or an ""invasion or predatory incursion"" by a foreign nation, conditions they say don't apply to the Venezuelan nationals targeted for removal.

Government lawyers have declined to disclose key details about the deportation flights, including whether any planes departed after Boasberg's order, citing national security protections.

Boasberg had previously warned the administration of consequences if it violated his order and criticized earlier filings as ""woefully insufficient,"" noting the government also refused his offer to submit information under seal.

The case has become a political flash point over the balance of power between the courts and the executive branch. Trump allies dismiss much of the judiciary's involvement as the work of ""activist"" judges seeking to rein in the president and overstep their constitutional role.

Trump's demand for Boasberg to be impeached prompted a rare public rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.""

The White House has kept up its criticism of the lower courts, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt last month accusing judges of overstepping their bounds and infringing on the president's authority.

""The administration will move quickly to pursue Supreme Court review, defend the Constitution, and protect the American people,"" Leavitt said in a statement.

National security and human rights lawyer Irina Tsukerman says the Trump administration's recent deportations of college students highlights a broader national security strategy, but questions remain.

Federal authorities have detained college students and professors at schools across the United States since the Trump administration began its crackdown on alleged Hamas sympathizers and those with expired visas.

The administration is now facing legal challenges in at least two separate student detention cases, though that number will likely increase in the coming months.

""They are not just random acts of law enforcement,"" national security and human rights lawyer Irina Tsukerman told Fox News Digital of the arrests. ""They are part of a comprehensive domestic national security strategy that also involves investigation of universities for facilitating illegal activity, including acts of antisemitism and general violence, material support for terrorist organizations, and other violations that caused tremendous inconvenience, distress, and even terror to students, staffers, and the general population alike.""

Tsukerman noted that President Donald Trump signed executive orders to combat antisemitism on college campuses and illegal immigration soon after taking office, so the arrests ""should have come as no surprise.""

The human rights lawyer also added that ""part of the reason the administration is going hard after some of these students now is because the universities did not do their job in the first place in vetting individuals coming into the country or in holding them accountable after they engaged in repeated violations both of U.S. law and campus regulations in bullying, harassing, intimidating students, causing mass obstruction and engaging in bigotry and violation of [the] non-discrimination statute.""

""Part of the reason the administration is going hard after some of these students now is because the universities did not do their job in the first place…""

Here are the students, professors and employees who have been detained so far since Trump took office in January, each under a different set of circumstances:

Rasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old Brown University assistant professor and physician specializing in kidney transplants from Lebanon, was detained and deported earlier this month at Boston Logan International Airport while coming back from a trip to Lebanon. 

Dr. Rasha Alawieh was deported to Lebanon from Boston Logan airport after attending the funeral of a notorious Hezbollah leader in Beirut. (Handout )

Alawieh had an H1-B visa, according to her attorneys, but allegedly expressed support for and attended the funeral of a slain Hezbollah leader responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. 

""Last month, Rasha Alawieh traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, to attend the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah – a brutal terrorist who led Hezbollah, responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade terror spree,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital on March 17. ""Alawieh openly admitted to this to CBP officers, as well as her support of Nasrallah.""

""A visa is a privilege, not a right – glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied. This is commonsense security,"" McLaughlin added.

Federal authorities alleged that they also conducted a search of Alawieh's phone and found ""sympathetic photos and videos"" of Hezbollah leaders, as well as materials showing ""various other Hezbollah militants"" in a deleted folder.

""With the discovery of these photographs and videos, CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,"" DOJ lawyers wrote, according to the Providence Journal. ""As such, CBP canceled her visa and deemed Dr. Alawieh inadmissible to the United States.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the attorney representing Alawieh and Brown Medicine.

Alawieh's cousin filed a federal lawsuit on March 14 against DHS and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, arguing that she was detained ""without any justification and without permitting them access to their counsel.""

ANTI-ISRAEL IVY LEAGUE STUDENT IN US ON VISA BEING URGED BY ICE TO SURRENDER: COURT DOCS

""Despite repeated requests from Dr. Alawieh's family members and a volunteer attorney, CBP refuses to provide any justification for their detention, refuses to allow the attorneys to talk to Dr. Alawieh, and refuses to provide assurances that Dr. Alawieh will not be deported to Lebanon at 7:45 pm tonight, March 14, 2025, immediately following this detention, even though two U.S. government entities, the Department of State and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (""USCIS"") have approved Dr. Alawieh's H1B petition and visa,"" the lawsuit states.

Just last week, a federal judge issued a restraining order against federal officials to stop their efforts to detain Columbia University student Yunseo Chung, who allegedly engaged in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, after she filed a lawsuit against the government.

A DHS spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital that ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) ""will investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization. Based on investigative findings, the Department of State may make a determination which may result in visa revocation or other action impacting the immigration status of an alien in the U.S. Upon the determination from the Department of State, ICE will take appropriate enforcement actions.""

Chung, who moved to the United States from South Korea when she was 7, is suing Trump and several members of his administration after federal authorities tried to arrest and deport her earlier this month.

In the lawsuit, Chung's attorneys say that the government's pursuit of the Columbia student is an ""unjustifiable assault on First Amendment.""

The lawsuit states that Chung was a participant in the anti-Israel protests, not a leader, and was ""one of a large group of college students"" expressing ""shared concerns"" over the war in Gaza. Chung, according to the lawsuit, ""visited"" the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, a number of tents organized in the center of campus, but does not state whether she stayed there. The lawsuit also makes it clear that she did not make public statements or engage in high-profile activities while at the protests.

The lawsuit states that on March 8, an ICE official signed an administrative arrest warrant for Chung and federal law enforcement went to Chung's parents' house the next day seeking to arrest her.

An ICE official allegedly told Chung's attorneys on March 10 that her green card had been ""revoked,"" according to the lawsuit. The government has the authority to rescind permanent resident status if they believe a person has violated U.S. immigration law.

DHS told Fox News Digital in a statement last week that he ""posed significant national security concerns.""

""ICE HSI made this arrest in accordance with the State Department's revocation of Doroudi's student visa,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.

Doroudi reportedly came to the U.S. in January 2023 on an F-1 student visa after ""clearing all immigration checks,"" but it was revoked six months later, according to student newspaper The Crimson White.

Doroudi's attorney, David Rozas, told Fox News Digital this week that the doctoral student ""is in good standing with his I-20 and SEVIS status.""

""He has an impressive resume and has been a significant support to the university's mechanical engineering department. The only infraction he has is a minor speeding ticket,"" Rozas said. ""He has never participated in any government or political protests, nor has he been involved in any social media or in-person groups expressing public opinions on any matter. To quote his fiance, he is simply a student in the United States pursuing the American dream. He entered the country legally and has always complied with U.S. laws.""

Rozas said Doroudi's attorneys ""are perplexed by his detention and are hopeful for a swift resolution.""

Federal officials detained former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who allegedly helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at the Ivy League school in New York City, last month.

Khalil's case has garnered worldwide attention and sparked protests in New York City.

The 30-year-old Algerian citizen is currently detained in Louisiana.

Khalil, who was born in a Syrian refugee camp and holds legal U.S. permanent resident status, entered the United States in 2022 on a student visa and later filed to become a permanent resident in 2024.

Attorneys for the Justice Department are arguing for Khalil's deportation, saying he failed to disclose his ties to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) when he applied for his green card.

Israel has accused 12 UNRWA employees of being involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks against Israel. They also alleged Khalil did not reveal his work at the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.

VIDEO SHOWS MAHMOUD KHALIL'S ARREST:

Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil's lawyers, and Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, characterized Khalil as a ""political prisoner detained at an ICE facility in Louisiana"" in statements published to Instagram last month.

Khalil's lawyers have argued that his support for Palestinians is protected by free speech and that the administration's deportation efforts are an effort to prevent his ""current and future speech"" and to deter others from doing the same. 

ICE DETAINS UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA DOCTORAL STUDENT FROM IRAN

""The Policy, including as-applied to Mr. Khalil, does not give the proper notice to anyone residing in the country which of their otherwise-lawful speech, opinions, beliefs, or advocacy will result in the government targeting them for detention and removal, and it provides government officials with unfettered discretion to target disfavored speech,"" the lawyers wrote.

His lawyers also noted that the administration does not define who qualifies as a ""Hamas supporter."" They say that there is no clarity on Khalil's activities that are ""aligned to Hamas.""  

MAHMOUD KHALIL'S ATTORNEYS ENCOURAGE PROTESTERS TO CONTINUE:

On March 18, Khalil wrote: ""In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all. Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances, I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.""

Leqaa Kordia was the second person who attended pro-Palestinian rallies at Columbia University detained by ICE last month following Khalil's arrest and after another Columbia student opted to self-deport.

Kordia, who is from the West Bank, had a student visa canceled in 2022 ""for lack of attendance"" and was detained by the agency for the outdated visa. DHS told Fox News Kordia was previously arrested in April for an alleged role in the protests. The New York Police Department, however, told Fox News Digital it does not have an arrest record under that name.

""Columbia has no record of this individual being registered as a current or former student at the University,"" the university said in a statement. 

Noem said ""[i]t is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America"" in a statement posted to X. 

""When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport,"" Noem said.

ICE detained Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student, last month in Somerville, Massachusetts.

""We have recently learned and verified that Rumeysa Öztürk, the student who was detained by federal immigration authorities yesterday, is currently being held in Louisiana,"" Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement. ""We recognize how frightening and distressing this situation is for her, her loved ones, and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff, and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events.""

He added that the ""footage of Rumeysa's arrest"" released on March 26 ""is disturbing.""

ICE AGENTS ARREST RUMEYSA OZTURK:

A DHS spokesperson told Fox News on March 26 that Ozturk was ""granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa.""

""DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,"" the spokesperson said. ""A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security.""

The legal team representing Ozturk told Fox News she had a valid F-1 visa status prior to her arrest. They also said no charges have been filed against their client and are demanding her release.

""Rumeysa was heading to meet with friends to break her Ramadan fast on the evening of March 25th when she was detained near her home in Somerville, MA by DHS agents,"" Khanbabai Immigration Law told Fox News in a statement last week. ""We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of.""

Federal officials are arguing for her deportation. She has a hearing in federal court on Thursday afternoon.

In February, federal officials detained Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist working at Harvard Medical School, at Boston Logan International Airport while she was attempting to return from a trip to Paris.

Petrova, a bioinformatician at the Kirschner Lab, was bringing back frog embryos at the request of a professor at a French lab Harvard is collaborating with, her attorney Gregory Romanovsky confirmed to Fox News.

The sample was picked up in Paris and was supposed to be brought to Harvard and Petrova was unaware she needed to claim them at customs. Officials apparently revoked her visa at the airport instead of following protocol, Romanovsky said.

""As upset as I am with ICE, they are not at fault and are just doing their job,"" he says.

Her attorney noted that Petrova was previously detained in Russia following anti-war protests when conflict initially broke out between Russian and Ukraine.

Like other detainees, Petrova is being held at an ICE facility in Louisiana.

""Despite having lawyers and the fact she did not do anything illegal in the first place, she is still there, and we have no idea when she will be paroled (or released, however simply released is unlikely),"" Cora Anderson, who works with the Russian scientist, shared on Facebook.

ICE last month arrested Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and Georgetown University postdoctoral student, after he allegedly shared pro-Hamas propaganda online.

Federal Judge Patricia Giles ordered that the Indian citizen ""shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order."" He, like other students, is being detained in Louisiana.

The postdoctoral scholar student, in the United States on a student visa, was accused of ""actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,"" a senior DHS official said in a statement.

""Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.""

The agency did not name the suspected terrorist or Hamas advisor. The New York Times reported that Suri's wife is Palestinian American. Her father is Ahmed Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader Israel assassinated last year in Iran. 

Anti-Israel protester Momodou Taal, a Cornell University international graduate student, dismissed his case against the Trump administration on Monday after he was threatened with deportation. He will now leave the country voluntarily.

The Ivy League student, who holds dual citizenship in the United Kingdom and Gambia, said that although he intended to progress the lawsuit, he decided to leave the country instead, fearing for his safety.

DHS revoked the student's visa after he allegedly participated in anti-Israel student activities and praised the ""resistance"" against Israel several times on his X account. Despite being accepted on a student visa in 2022, Taal has also posted about his ""hatred"" for the U.S. and called for ""the end of the US empire.""

""Today I took the decision to leave the United States, free and with my head held high,"" Taal wrote in a post on X on Monday. 

""Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favourable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs,"" he continued.

He wrote in a Wednesday post on X: ""Palestine is the ultimate clarifier.""

ICE detained an unnamed, international graduate student at the University of Minnesota last month.

The university said the student, who was enrolled at UM's Carlson School of Management, was arrested at an off-campus residence.

""This is not related to student protests,"" a senior DHS official told Fox News Digital in a statement at the time. ""The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.""

""It can be reviewed by the U.S. government. It can be denied on the basis of security threats it presents, and even if you are a legal resident, if you lie on your application, or if you engage in repeated acts of violence or other criminal offenses, or even if simply travel out of country for longer than the law provides, you can be denied a path to citizenship and you can be deported, and we are seeing that,"" she explained.

Questions do remain, however, about the recent deportations and how they will impact free speech on college campuses.

""There are many people who are concerned that while the Trump administration is doing the right thing in reviewing individuals who may be presenting a danger to the country and to fellow students and faculty on campuses, the way to go about it is not necessarily clear,"" Tsukerman said.

She also suggested the arrests and deportations could ""backfire with future administrations"" that ""hold a completely different ideological or political line and who decide that a different political perspective is unfounded and people should be deported for that reason.""

""If you start mass deportation based simply on ideology alone and without weighing in on how much of it is crossing the line of outright extremism and how much is simple political disagreement, you can create a very uncomfortable climate that becomes unwelcoming to people who can contribute, who can change their minds, who could be persuaded by better education and who can evolve as they study or work in the United States,"" she said.

Canadians aren't the only people losing their appetite for a stateside vacation.

Forward bookings for Europeans visiting the US this summer have fallen by a quarter, Accor CEO Sébastien Bazin told Bloomberg on Tuesday.

One of the world's biggest hospitality companies, Accor operates more than 5,000 hotels, with brands including luxury options like Fairmont and Raffles to cheaper ones like Ibis.

While forward bookings are up as much as 5% overall, Bazin told Bloomberg, there's a ""pretty strong deceleration across the Atlantic.""

European customers were instead choosing to travel to Canada, South America, and Egypt, he said.

His comments come a week after data showed plummeting airline bookings for Canadians flying to the US.

Compared to last year, travel data firm OAG reported a 70% fall in bookings for every month through September — although Air Canada and WestJet said their declines weren't quite so stark. Cirium, an aviation analytics firm, reported a 23% fall in bookings for April.

For now, at least, transatlantic air routes haven't experienced the same drop.

The corridor is a vital source of income for European airlines, and CEOs are staying alert.

""We probably all agree something is happening out there. Globalization is changing,"" Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr told the Airlines for Europe Summit last week, in comments reported by Skift.

On the same panel, Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith described the situation as ""concerning for us,"" and added that the airline group is watching developments ""very, very closely.""

The contrast between Canadian and European airline bookings also matches the extent of political tensions.

Trump provoked the US's northern neighbor with his talk of it becoming the 51st state, but his tariffs have been far more detrimental.

They sparked a retaliatory ""Buy Canadian"" movement, with some American-made products, like liquor, removed from the shelves. ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was booed at sports games.

Last Thursday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada's old relationship with the US, ""based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over.""

While tensions have also been stoked with Europe, as in JD Vance's visit to Greenland, the relationship hasn't reached the same boiling point.

It's highly unlikely to stay that way for long since Trump announced tariffs on Wednesday — charging the European Union with a higher rate of 20%.

Even travelers who aren't put off by American isolationism may still be wary of harsher border security.

Germany and the UK last month updated their advisories for travel to the US, warning of stricter entry rules following more reports of Europeans being turned away at the border.

For example, France's higher education minister told Agence France-Presse that a scientist had been denied entry to the US after he was found to have sent texts criticizing Trump.

""Aviation is part of the globalization that we've seen growing in the last decades,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told a company summit in Toulouse last month. 

""We are obviously in a more fragmented world, and that's probably even more true by the day, and that brings challenges.""

With hotel bookings already falling ahead of a looming trade war, transatlantic travel could be next to sink.

President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs had two surprising omissions: Mexico and Canada.

Many countries, including China, were slapped with large reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. After Trump's announcement, CNBC reported that Chinese goods could receive a 54% tariff when combining the new tariffs (34%) with ones that have been previously announced. European Union goods will be subject to a new 20% tariff.

According to the White House, this doesn't mean the US's neighbors are off scot-free. Preexisting 25% tariffs on most Mexican and Canadian goods will remain.

Under Trump's previous order, a 25% tariff was applied to all Mexican and Canadian goods that aren't compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The White House has said the tariffs are necessary because the two countries aren't doing enough to stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States from the northern and southern borders. Leaders of both countries have disputed this claim.

The USMCA trade deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, maintains NAFTA's zero-tariff treatment for most agricultural products, textiles, apparel, and other goods that meet the trade agreement's rules of origin.

Non-compliant energy and potash from the bordering nations remain subject to a 10% tariff; the latter was viewed as the White House bowing to pressure from the farm industry worried about a key ingredient in fertilizers.

Chris Tang, a UCLA professor who's an expert in global supply chain management and the impact of regulatory policies, told Business Insider the Trump administration's choice to leave Canada and Mexico off the tariffs list on Wednesday might be a symbol that the president recognized the neighboring nations' significance to the US economy — but it was also probably a negotiation tactic.

""So, for example, right now, the products that comply with the USMCA are still tariff-free,"" Tang said. ""But that's temporary. Trump has said, 'Well, that may adjust.' And that gives him still some wiggle room to negotiate.""

A spokesperson for the White House told BI that if Trump's prior order were terminated, all non-USMCA-compliant goods would be reduced to a 12% tariff.

Margaret Kidd, an instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology at the University of Houston, told BI, ""It's not in our best interest for the United States to alienate our two closest trading partners.""

She added that there was about $945 billion in trade between Mexico and the US in 2024, with most of the products exchanged flowing through Texas. The tariffs on the southern country, she said, have an outsize effect on the border states, which rely on the local economy built around international trade.

""It's all intermingled,"" Kidd said.

Tang said he was hopeful that the omission of Canada and Mexico from Wednesday's tariffs could act as a sort of olive branch with the nation's allies to soothe the trade tensions that had increased since Trump took office.

""Really, our economies are interlinked,"" Tang said. ""So, hopefully, they can really sit down and work it out because these are our allies, our neighbors — this is very important. So I hope there is a possibility that these three countries can work together.""

Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days — and President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs threaten to make things even worse.

The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%. 

Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue.

""For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers"" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider.

The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it ""impossible"" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said. 

The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a ""game of Whack-A-Mole"" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next.

Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for countries with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes.

The news sent S&P futures down more than 3% in premarket trading on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled 8% and 6% respectively.

Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively.

One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as ""prosperity killers.""

During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found.

Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will ""cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation.""

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday.

""I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader — nearly every person — I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,"" he wrote.

Another wave of tariff chaos is now threatening to hit stocks that have already retreated. The timing is terrible for boomers living off their nest eggs, who could see their retirement funds dwindle if they're pulling money out at the same time their stock holdings are falling in value.

Ricchiuti bemoaned that the economy was on a good path with falling inflation and record corporate earnings and stock prices ahead of Trump's inauguration.

""The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self-inflicted,"" he said.

Small-cap stocks, which were once thought to be primary beneficiaries of President Donald Trump's policies, entered bear market territory on Thursday after a massive stock market rout that followed the administration's sweeping and aggressive tariff rollout.

The Russell 2000 Index was down more than 5% on Thursday, bringing its losses from its November 25 record close to about 21%. On Wall Street, a 10% pullback is considered a correction, but a 20% decline is a bear market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both in correction territory, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is just below that mark.

""They're getting hit because the economy is softening. That's going to hurt profits,"" Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, told CNBC. ""On the other side, they're still paying high levels of interest payments on debt because they have more of this floating-rate debt.""

""They're getting squeezed on both sides,"" he said.

This is a sharp reversal from the gains seen in the trading days following November's election, with small caps viewed as beneficiaries from deregulation, lower tax rates and even tariffs since the group has fewer multinationals than large cap stocks.

The Russell 2000 closed out that election week with an 8.6% advance, almost four percentage points higher than the 4.7% weekly gain of the S&P 500. Along with that, it became one of the hottest Trump trades. In fact, Tom Lee – managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat – said at that time that small caps could outperform by more than 100% over the next couple of years.

But the Russell 2000 was dragged lower Thursday in names like Victoria's Secret and Urban Outfitters, which source a lot of products from other countries and could see significantly higher costs and lower margins from the tariffs.

And the group is particularly sensitive to economic shifts given their small size, and therefore less financial flexibility as large-cap stocks. JPMorgan predicted that if Trump's sweeping new reciprocal tariffs remain, the U.S. economy will likely fall into a recession.

The Russell 2000 previously neared bear market territory in March amid a monthlong market sell-off spurred by uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs plans and growing concern on the Street of a slowing economy.

""Small caps, in the first half of an economic recession, are usually down 13%, so it's already worse than where we were for the average recession,"" said Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist covering small- and mid-cap companies at Jefferies, in an interview with CNBC. ""For the average bear market, small caps are down 26%, so we're nearing that number.""

While small caps are in turmoil right now, DeSanctis believes the group could eventually find a bottom, especially if the Federal Reserve starts lowering interest rates again.

Traders are currently pricing in a 58.5% chance of four quarter-percentage-point cuts by year-end 2025, with more than 90% odds of the next cut being at the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

""If the economy gets weak enough, do we get support from the Fed? We say yes. That's usually good for small caps,"" the equity strategist said.

DeSanctis added that the path from here might look like a ""tough"" first two quarters, though no recession, before the Fed possibly comes to the rescue in the summer. From there, he anticipates that some of the concerns surrounding tariffs – which could raise input costs for businesses – may be resolved, prompting the market to focus on deregulation once again.

Lerner, who is underweight small caps, is similarly constructive. He noted that in addition to deregulation, a greater focus on tax cut extensions and a return of animal spirits leading to a pickup in mergers and acquisitions should provide an opportunity for small caps to do well later in the year, or whenever investors feel that the worst of the economic outlook is behind them.

What's more, because things ""don't move in a straight line,"" it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for small caps as well as large caps to soon see an ""oversold bounce,"" Lerner said.

Lerner doesn't believe large caps will face a similar fate of entering bear market territory as small caps. The S&P 500 is still a considerable distance away from a bear market, being more than 11% off its Feb. 19 high in correction territory.

""With small caps being down 20%, it tells you they've already been down – the bear market didn't start here. It's been going on for several months,"" the co-CIO said. ""Correspondingly, large caps are also down, but they are down about half relative to small caps. Our base case for large caps is you may see further downside, but we're not calling for a bear market.""

In this article

DETROIT — Stellantis is pausing production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico as the company attempts to navigate President Donald Trump's new round of 25% automotive tariffs, the company confirmed Thursday.

The actions are the swiftest and most drastic by an automaker regarding the new tariffs, which took effect Thursday and are imposed on all vehicles imported to the U.S., including from Canada and Mexico.

Stellantis' downtime starts Monday and is set for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.

As a result of the pause in production, about 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to about 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant, according to a company spokeswoman. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the facility but not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, the spokeswoman said.

In an email to employees Thursday, Stellantis North American chief Antonio Filosa said the plant downtime is tied to the tariffs, as the company reviews its options.

""We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,"" Filosa said. ""Those actions will impact some employees at several of our U.S. powertrain and stamping facilities that support those operations.""

The Canadian plant produces the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and the recently released Dodge Charger Daytona EV. The Mexico plant produces the Jeep Compass SUV and Jeep Wagoneer S EV.

Filosa said the ""current environment creates uncertainty,"" but assured employees that the company, which continues to search for a new CEO, is ""very engaged with all of our key stakeholders, including top government leaders, unions, suppliers and dealers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.""

Halting production also will help Stellantis lower vehicle inventory levels that have built up amid lackluster sales for many of its brands.

Stellantis' Detroit rivals Ford Motor and General Motors also responded to the tariffs, but not by idling production.

GM plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana.

The increase in workers is in addition to those who the company was already hiring for the plant as supplemental workers to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans.

GM, in an emailed statement, confirmed the plans Thursday without mentioning tariffs.

The Detroit automaker produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

GM has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs like Stellantis is doing, said the person, who was not authorized to speak to media.

Hours after Trump's tariffs went into effect, Ford announced it will offer its employee discount to all customers.

Ford said the sales program — running from April 3 through June 2 — includes ""significant savings"" but did not release exact details on the discounts.

The program, which it's calling ""From America, For America,"" excludes some larger vehicles like the Ford Raptor, 2025 Ford Expedition, Ford Super Duty trucks and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

""We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.""

U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices.

— CNBC's Michele Luhn contributed to this article.

Aggressive tariffs that President Donald Trump announced Wednesday will begin a ""reordering"" of global trade that will force other nations to open their doors to more American goods, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Thursday.

Under an executive order the president signed, the U.S. will retaliate against duties imposed on American goods elsewhere.

Lutnick, in a CNBC interview, said the moves will push countries to reexamine their policies and provide greater market access for U.S. products.

""This is the reordering of fair trade,"" he said on ""Squawk Box."" ""It's about those nontariff trade barriers. That's what we are addressing.""

""I expect most countries to start to really examine their trade policy towards the United States of America, and stop picking on us,"" he added. ""Stop saying that we can't sell our corn to India, stop saying that we can't sell our beef anywhere. Just stop treating us so poorly.""

As Lutnick spoke, traders recoiled against the tariff announcements, sending futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging by more than 1,100 points as Treasury yields also fell sharply.

Asked what it would take for products to be given exemptions from the new tariffs, Lutnick said the issue runs deeper.

""I don't think the word exemption is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,"" he said. ""I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.""

In the Wednesday announcement, Trump said the U.S. would apply 10% blanket duties on all products coming into the U.S., while also unveiling a menu of other reciprocal rates against individual trading partners.

The move represented another leg up in the president's strategy to open more markets for U.S. products. However, economists fear the tariffs will ignite a damaging global trade war and spike inflation amid signs of a slowing economy.

""We're talking with all of the major countries of the world, and we've been talking to them for more than a month,"" Lutnick said. ""The key is, will they take our agricultural products? Will they treat us fairly? Can they treat us fairly? And the answer is, over time, that is going to be yes, American products are going to be better sold elsewhere in the world.""

The U.S. ran a $122.7 billion trade deficit in goods and services in February, down $8 billion from January but still near a record, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. The imbalance for the first two months of the year has soared 86% from the same period in 2024.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's new tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their impact, live all day on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

General Motors plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana as the auto industry adjusts to Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles.

GM confirmed the plans without mentioning tariffs: ""General Motors will be making operational adjustments at Fort Wayne Assembly, including hiring temporary employees, to support current manufacturing and business needs. We continuously update and revise production schedules as part of our standard process of evaluating and aligning to manage vehicle inventory.""

The increase in workers is in addition to the supplemental workers GM was already hiring to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans.

GM produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

The Detroit automaker has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs, like its crosstown rival Stellantis is doing, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak to media.

— Michael Wayland

American drinkers may be swapping out their Aperol spritzes for margaritas this summer.

The Trump administration's 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union will hit European wines, spirits and beer, Reuters reports. Mexican-imported canned beer like Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., will also face a new 25% tariff.

Shares of Constellation Brands, which owns Mexican-brewed beers like Modelo and Corona, are down less than 1% in afternoon trading. Investors have been anticipating the levies since Trump's election.

But the tariffs weren't as harsh as the 200% duties Trump threatened on European wine, Champagne and spirits last month. The president also held off on imposing the 25% tariffs on Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky, lifting shares of Campari, Heineken and Diageo higher.

Read the full story here.

— Amelia Lucas

Matt Mittelsteadt, a tech policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that the new tariffs ""directly threaten American AI. These massive tax hikes are slamming during the exact window U.S. industry has to set the global standard — risking innovation and ceding the market.""

Shares of CoreWeave, which recently became the first pure-play AI company to IPO, were down more than 17% on Thursday. Nvidia stock was down nearly 7%, while shares of Microsoft and Google were both down more than 2%.

— Hayden Field

Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman encouraged foreign leaders to reach out to Trump ""immediately"" to negotiate, according to a post on X on Thursday.

Ackman endorsed Trump in the 2024 election and has been a vocal supporter of the president on social media. In his post Thursday, he described Trump as ""dealmaker"" and a ""tough, but fair negotiator"" who thinks about the world as a series of transactions.

""I expect Trump will reward the early dealmakers with fairer deals than those that wait to sit down at the negotiating table,"" Ackman wrote. ""Countries that respond with additional tariffs on our goods will be severely punished. The carrot and the stick writ large, Big Boy style.""

— Ashley Capoot

Canada will impose 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S., Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, matching Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles that took effect today.

The tariffs will only apply to autos that are not compliant with the USMCA, the North American free trade agreement, Carney said. He said the tariffs will not affect auto parts or vehicle content from Mexico.

""We know the benefits of our integrated production system,"" Carney said.

He added that Canada is ""developing a framework for auto producers to avoid our counter tariffs, as long as they maintain their production and investment in Canada.""

— Michele Luhn

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump ""is not going to back off"" his newly announced tariffs.

""I don't think there's any chance"" that Trump will reverse course, Lutnick said in a CNN interview. ""This is the reordering of global trade, right? That's what's going to happen,"" he said.

Asked to clarify, Lutnick said, ""the president is not going to back off.""

But, he added, ""countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers, which are much, much rougher.""

The comments came as some Trump allies have expressed hope that the sweeping tariffs are negotiating tools to secure better trade relationships, rather than permanent import taxes.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump's tariffs have boxed in retailers — and jeweler Pandora is not immune.

The Danish company said it expects an annual hit of 1.2 billion crowns, or roughly $178 million, from the new duties on U.S. imports, before it takes any steps to mitigate the effects. For 2025, it expects a hit of 700 million crowns, or about $103 million.

Pandora said it could raise prices or change its supply chain to help offset the levies.

The jeweler said U.S. tariffs of 36% on imports from Thailand will have the biggest effect on its business. Pandora said it made 92% of its jewelry at facilities in Thailand as of last year.

— Jacob Pramuk

A bipartisan bill introduced to the Senate seeks to require that Congress approve tariffs if they are to continue 60 days after their implementation, NBC News reported.

The bill also would require the president to notify Congress within 24 hours of announcing new tariffs.

""For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.

It is not clear when or even if the bill will be voted on.

— Dan Mangan

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back on the looming prospect of grocery prices suddenly rising as a result of Trump's new tariffs.

""I don't think that's going to happen,"" Lutnick said on CNN when asked what he would tell Americans who voted for Trump and are about to face higher store prices.

Lutnick said that when the U.S. opens the markets that he says are blocked by other countries, ""our volumes grow, our farmers will thrive, and the price of groceries will come down.""

""Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,"" Lutnick said.

— Kevin Breuninger

Investors are seeking safety in fast-food chains, betting consumers will trade down to cheaper restaurant meals as tariffs weigh on their wallets.

Shares of McDonald's, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are up more than 1%, while other publicly traded restaurant companies' shares take a beating.

Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Roadhouse are both down 3%. The two chains have reported stronger sales than the broader industry in recent quarters. Other eateries have seen even steeper declines in their share prices. Starbucks stock dropped 11%, Shake Shack's shares slid 13% and Sweetgreen's tumbled 16%.

Typically, during economic downturns, fast-food chains report stronger sales than other restaurants, as price-sensitive consumers trade down from full-service dining and fast-casual lunches to less pricey combo meals at McDonald's or Burger King.

The restaurant industry is already anticipating that the latest wave of tariffs will mean higher menu prices for diners.

""The biggest concerns for restaurant operators — from community restaurants to national brands — are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers,"" the National Restaurant Association said in a statement.

— Amelia Lucas

Shares of GE HealthCare, which manufactures medical imaging, ultrasound and other health devices, tumbled more than 10% on Thursday following Trump's tariff announcement. GE HealthCare produces its products in more than 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 countries around the globe, according to its website.

""Our top priorities are to make sure patient and customer deliveries for products and services are not interrupted under any circumstances and at the best quality and cost possible,"" a GE HealthCare spokesperson told CNBC.

""This is a dynamic issue,"" the spokesperson noted. ""Our teams are working on potential mitigation plans as these trade policies evolve. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.""

Shares of Siemens Healthineers, a German med tech company, fell nearly 7% on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

— Ashley Capoot

Trump's aggressive and sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" affected more than 180 countries, from major trading partners to even tiny islands and remote locations.

The tariff plan targeted numerous external Australian territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, one of the most remote locations on earth, populated by seals and penguins.

Norfolk Island, also an Australian territory with a population of nearly 2,000 people, was hit with some of the highest tariffs of 29%, despite Australia only facing 10% tariffs.

""I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian.

Chipmaking stocks dropped Thursday as markets sold off after Trump revealed wide sweeping tariffs.

Although the sector was excluded from the latest levies, duties targeting the sector are still coming. Semiconductors, which typically come to the U.S. in finished products such as personal computers, are also under pressure due to fears that tariffs will quell demand for technology gadgets and electronics.

As of late morning trading, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF shed nearly 7%. Qorvo and Micron Technology plunged more than 12% each, while Qualcomm, Broadcom and Lam Research each dropped more than 7%. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slumped more than 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell about 5%.

— Samantha Subin

French President Emmanuel Macron urged companies in his country to pause investments in the U.S. after Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs.

He said Trump's tariffs are a shock for international trade after his meeting at the Élysée Palace with representatives of industries affected by the heavy levies.

Trump's plan sets a 10% baseline tariff across the board, while adding steep duties on many countries, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union.

— Yun Li

Former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he believed ""the market can adjust"" to the new 10% baseline tariff on nearly all other countries, but hoped the larger tariff rates will be ""negotiated down.""

""I do hope there's the ability to negotiate them down, because, as we've seen for certain businesses, it is going to take a long time to move that manufacturing base,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

""And we've seen the stock market, particularly in certain stocks, react pretty negatively,"" he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

In another executive action signed Wednesday, Trump ended the so-called de minimis exemption on China and Hong Kong that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free.

The trade loophole has helped Chinese cheap-goods manufacturers such as Temu and Shein flood the U.S. with inexpensive products.

It will end May 2, according to the executive order.

Trump had previously ended de minimis in early February but paused that move days later following concerns it could overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

— Kevin Breuninger

On a brutal day for the stock market, shares of retailers — including Target and Nike — have been hammered particularly hard.

Target, Nike, Wayfair, American Eagle Outfitters, Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers, as well as toymaker Hasbro all hit 52-week lows.

Retailers are expected to face tough choices in the weeks and months ahead, as they manage higher costs from broad tariffs on imports from nations including China and Vietnam, which are major manufacturing hubs for shoes, clothing, toys, furniture and more.

Some, such as Steve Madden, were slashing their sourcing from China in recent years and moving more production to other countries such as Vietnam. Yet, now, even imports from many of those alternative countries are subject to tariffs. Goods from Vietnam, for example, will face a 46% tariff.

Some sectors of retail are particularly exposed: Nearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group.

Barclays retail analyst Seth Sigman said retailers will have a hard time absorbing all of the steep additional costs or sharing them with vendors.

""Unfortunately, some of it will result in higher prices,"" he said.

— Melissa Repko

CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman and on-air editor Rick Santelli held an impromptu debate about the effect of Trump's tariffs on global trade.

The spirited exchange on ""Squawk Box"" followed an appearance from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Watch the full exchange below:

— Kevin Breuninger

Stellantis is idling production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico due to tariffs.

Roughly 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to roughly 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the plant but will not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, according to a company spokeswoman.

The downtime starts Monday and will last for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.

""We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,"" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis North American chief.

— Michael Wayland, Michele Luhn

Vice President JD Vance argued that Trump's trade agenda, coupled with its deregulatory efforts and tax-cut plans, will ultimately bring down prices.

But ""we're not going to fix things overnight,"" he said in a Fox News interview Thursday morning when asked if costs will go up and for how long.

He framed the situation as one in which the Trump administration was tasked with fixing ""what was left to us"" by the Biden administration.

""You don't fix that stuff overnight. We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately,"" Vance said.

Many economists warn that Trump's sweeping tariff policies will raise prices and lower growth, and even some administration officials have acknowledged the import duties will cause at least temporary economic disruption.

— Kevin Breuninger

Tariffs and economic uncertainty are threatening to slow construction of new hotels by driving up building-material costs, Baird's hotel analyst says.

The cost to build in the U.S. could now be as much as 10% higher because of tariffs, particularly on materials that are largely imported from China and Vietnam, Baird hotel analyst Michael Bellisario wrote. Construction of new hotels was already strained compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic because of higher costs and interest rates.

""Signings and starts could slow over the near term given heightened macroeconomic and trade policy uncertainties; projects' opening dates are likely to slip as well, in our view,"" he said in his Thursday note, adding that Hilton, Marriott and Choice Hotels International are the most exposed to U.S. construction headwinds.

Hotel stocks were all sharply lower in morning trading, and airline stocks, already battered this year, also fell. United was down more than 12% while American and Delta were each down more than 8%. Tariffs and economic weakness could add to both leisure and corporate bookings, while duties are set to drive up the cost of new aircraft.

— Leslie Josephs

President Trump's son Eric Trump says the first countries to negotiate a trade deal with his father ""will win,"" as he warned the world not to be among the last nations to cut such a deal.

""I wouldn't want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,"" Eric wrote in a post on social media site X.

""The first to negotiate will win — the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,"" he wrote.

But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" brushed aside the idea of countries winning exemptions from new tariffs on some products.

""I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,"" Lutnick said. ""I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.""

— Dan Mangan

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed aside the idea that some imports from certain countries will win exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs.

""I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,"" Lutnick said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly,"" he said.

Lutnick also said other countries would be making a mistake if they impose their own reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. in retaliation.

""I don't think it's effective in the world to retaliate,"" Lutnick said. ""I mean, those things are silly.""

— Dan Mangan

New tariffs will raise the price of shoes that Americans buy and lead to cheaper-quality merchandise, says a major trade group.

Trump's tariff policy ""is catastrophic for American families,"" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.

The massive new import duties will hit footwear-producing nations such as Vietnam and China especially hard.

""Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase,"" Priest said in a statement.

The tariffs will ""drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence,"" he added.

Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group. About 37% of footwear imports came from China in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.

— Melissa Repko

Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman wrote on X, ""Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy.""

Ackman, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, is a frequent defender of the president on social media.

He argued in a prior X post Wednesday that other countries should not retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

Citing a ""changing economy"" and its position as the the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks, Ford said it's putting most of its vehicles on sale.

The automaker is offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers from April 3 to June 2.

The promotion excludes the some large vehicles like the Ford Raptor, the 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs and Super Duty trucks.

""We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.""

U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices.

— Michele Luhn

The White House Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has ""charged"" the U.S.

It didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula — to confusing results.

Many observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.

Such methodology doesn't necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.

The U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus.

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website which appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences.

Trump quickly declared his ""reciprocal"" tariff rollout a success.

""THE OPERATION IS OVER!"" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post.

""THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!""

The new tariffs have not yet taken effect.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump's 25% auto tariffs are in effect, but the impacts of the new levies could take years to unfold.

The tariffs are on any vehicles imported into the U.S., but even if final assembly takes place domestically, autos are made up of thousands of parts that are sourced from all around the world.

That means the industry is watching and waiting to see what happens with potential upcoming tariffs on auto parts.

In the near term, auto industry investors should expect continued volatility in automaker and supplier stocks, according to Wall Street analysts.

Read more about how the auto tariffs will affect individual vehicles and automakers here.

U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive and far-reaching ""reciprocal tariffs"" were signed into effect on Wednesday, hitting over 180 countries, ranging from major trading partners to remote islands.

The newly elected White House leader unveiled a raft of levies on April 2, marking the date as  ""liberation day,"" and set a baseline tariff of 10% on goods imported to the U.S. across the board.

Key trade partners absorbed some of the steepest tariff rates from 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, 46% on Vietnam, and 32% on Taiwan.

Trump and the White House shared a series of charts on social media detailing the tariffs applied to each country affected. Strikingly, near the end of the list were a series of remote uninhabited Australian islands, offshore territories, and even a military base.

An external Australian territory, the Heard and McDonalds Islands, are located 4,100 km from Perth in Western Australia and 1,700 km from Antarctica.

The territory is considered one of the remotest locations on earth with ""rare pristine island ecosystems,"" according to UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and it is populated by a number of species including flying birds, penguins, seals , and invertebrates.

To reach the islands, it takes a two-week boat voyage from Perth — meaning visits are rare.

Despite having no economic activity, Heard and McDonalds Islands were hit with 10% tariffs on Wednesday.

A number of other Australian territories were barraged with tariffs, including Norfolk Island with a population of nearly 2,000 people; Cocos Island, with a population of just 544, and Christmas Island which is populated by 1,692 people.

Norfolk Island was hit with some of the highest duties of 29% — despite Australia only facing 10% levies. The U.S. is one of its top trading partners, with 31% of its exports heading to the States, according to the CIA. Meanwhile, Cocos Island and Christmas Island are facing 10% tariffs.

""Norfolk Island has got a 29% tariff. I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian.

The British Indian Ocean Territory is an overseas British territory with no permanent population, but its largest island, Diego Garcia, has a joint U.K.-U.S. military facility inhabiting about 4,000 people — mainly consisting of military personnel.

The territory is a major exporter of fish, with the U.S. being a top destination, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

It's been hit with 10% tariffs.

A French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean, Réunion, is facing staggering duties of up to 37%, while the European Union has been hit with tariffs of 20%.

Réunion has a population of roughly 882,000, per the latest data.

Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand in the Southern Pacific Ocean, has a population of just over 1,600, per the CIA — and is facing 10% tariffs.

The region is made up of three coral atolls — Fakaofo, Atafu, and Nukunonu — and is not an easy place to get to, with no harbors, ports, or airports. Travelers would have to take a ship from Samoa, which runs every two weeks, and undertake a journey of roughly 24 to 36 hours.

Eight key OPEC+ producers on Thuesday agreed to raise combined crude oil output by 411,000 barrels per day, speeding up the pace of their scheduled hikes and pushing down oil prices.

The Ice Brent contract with June delivery was trading at $70.50 per barrel at 1:32 p.m. London time (8:32 a.m. ET), down 5.94% from the Wednesday close. The front-month May Nymex WTI contract was at $67.11 per barrel, 6.41% lower.

Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman met virtually to review global market conditions and decided to raise collective output by 411,000 barrels per day, starting in May. The group was widely expected to implement an increase of just under 140,000 barrels per day next month.

The May hike agreed on Thursday is ""equivalent to three monthly increments,"" OPEC said in a statement, adding that ""the gradual increases may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions.""

The eight OPEC+ producers this month started gradually unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts undertaken independently from the production strategy of the broader 22-member OPEC+ alliance, which has roughly 3.66 million barrels per day of separate cuts in place until the end of 2026.

The Thursday meeting was the first one attended by Erlan Akkenzhenov, the new energy minister of Kazakhstan, which has struggled with producing above its assigned quota.

Without referencing individual countries, OPEC said in its Thursday statement that the May output hike will ""provide an opportunity for the participating countries to accelerate their compensation"" by way of additional production cuts in line with overproduction.

The Thursday decision was taken against the backdrop of broader market tumult triggered by sweeping tariffs on key trade partners unveiled on Wednesday by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been simultaneously championing higher U.S. oil output.

DETROIT — President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles to the U.S. have taken effect, but the impacts of the new levies on investors and the global automotive industry will play out over the months, if not years, to come.

The 25% tariffs are on any vehicle not assembled in the U.S., which S&P Global Mobility reports accounted for 46% of the roughly 16 million vehicles sold domestically last year. The White House has said it also plans to place tariffs on some auto parts such as engines and transmissions, but those are set to take effect no later than May 3.

Wall Street analysts and investors have been bearish on the tariffs, which some believe could decimate company earnings and drive the automotive industry into a recession.

""A 25% on automotive imports lasting beyond four to six weeks would likely have a chilling effect on the entire sector as [automakers] need to grapple with significant impact to the bottom line,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in a recent note to investors.

TD Cowen's Itay Michaeli described the tariffs to investors as ""close to the worst case outcome vs. recent expectations,"" while Barclays' Dan Levy said ""there are no 'winners' in the absolute – only relative winners.""

Trump has admitted there may be some ""pain"" initially with the tariffs, but the president said he believes the actions will bolster American jobs in the long term and result in more than $100 billion of new annual revenue to the U.S.

Automakers were lobbying for vehicles and parts that are compliant with Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to be tariff-free, but so far there have been no exemptions for vehicles.

There might end up being caveats for auto parts that are still yet to be finalized, but auto stocks will likely remain volatile, Wall Street analysts warned.

As the impacts of the tariffs continue to unfold, investors should be aware of which companies are expected to be most at risk, what vehicles will be impacted and just how much the levies are expected to affect earnings.

Simply put, no vehicle is completely sourced and produced domestically.

Even if vehicles are produced in the U.S. — meaning the final assembly takes place in the country — the tens of thousands of parts for new cars and trucks come from a global supply chain.

""We stress that the concept of a U.S. car maker with parts all from the U.S. is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an investor note Wednesday.

For example, Ford Motor's F-150 is exclusively assembled in the U.S. but has roughly 2,700 main billable parts, which exclude many small pieces, according to Caresoft, an engineering benchmarking and consulting firm. Those parts come from at least 24 different countries, Caresoft said.

Ultimately, the rollout of the tariffs on auto parts will be key, and could potentially bring some relief for automakers, depending on their supply chain network.

Parts that are currently compliant with the USMCA trade deal will be tariff-free, but only until the secretary of commerce and Customs and Border Protection establish processes to impose levies on non-U.S. content.

Automakers under USMCA also are expected to have an opportunity to have U.S. content equate to a reduction in their tariff calculation, according to the White House.

S&P Global Mobility reports Volvo, Mazda, Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor (including Genesis and Kia brands) are the most at risk from a vehicle standpoint, as at least 60% of their respective U.S. sales were imported from outside the U.S. in 2024.

Ford, General Motors, Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis produced the most vehicles in the U.S., according to S&P Global Mobility. Those five automakers accounted for 67% of U.S. passenger light-vehicle production in 2024.

But Bernstein estimates 57% of the value content in U.S.-assembled vehicles is imported, which means companies such as Ford — the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks — are still set to be significantly impacted by the tariffs.

Among the Detroit automakers, Bernstein reports GM faces the highest exposure to tariffs, driven by its more than 80% North America revenue share, 48% vehicle import rate, and less than 40% U.S. parts content in domestic builds.

Bernstein estimated GM's earnings before interest and taxes could drop 79% as a result of the tariffs, an 81% decline in earnings per share and a $4.1 billion hit to free cash flow.

That compares with Bernstein's estimates for Ford of a 16.5% hit to EBIT, 23% decline in EPS and 36% drop to free cash flow.

Stellantis, Bernstein estimates, is least affected, with only 40% of global revenue from the U.S. and 56% local parts content, resulting in a roughly $1 billion EBIT impact, 8.75% lower net income and a roughly $540 million hit to free cash flow.

Excluding potential tariffs on parts, U.S. electric vehicle leader Tesla as well as EV startups Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group are far better positioned. All of their vehicles sold in the U.S. have final assembly in the country.

""Tesla is the clear structural winner: localized, strong market share, better insulated from trade risk. For everyone else, this is a margin reset and real drag on near-term earnings power,"" Bernstein's Roeska said.

U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in well above industry expectations, as consumers flocked to buy new vehicles ahead of the tariffs taking effect, which many expect to result in higher vehicle prices.

""Along with increasing costs for importing vehicles, costs will increase for auto manufacturing in the US, and consumer costs for vehicles will increase,"" S&P Global Mobility said in a tariff report last week.

S&P expects U.S. light-vehicle sales could migrate to between 14.5 million and 15 million units annually in the coming years, if the tariffs remain in effect. That compares with roughly 16 million vehicles sold in 2024.

Entry-level, less expensive vehicles are most at risk of being cut or seeing price increases, according to Wall Street and industry analysts. That's because automakers often have tried to produce such vehicles, which historically have small profit margins, in lower-cost countries to the U.S.

For example, GM imported more than 400,000 entry-level crossovers for its Buick and Chevrolet brands last year from South Korea, tariff-free. The company has touted the vehicles as being the pinnacle for the automaker's profitable growth in lower-margin, entry-level vehicles.

Other entry-level or more affordable vehicles that are set to be tariffed include the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V from Canada as well as the Ford Maverick, Ford Bronco Sport and Chevrolet Equinox from Mexico.

Bank of America estimates new vehicle prices — which currently run an average of about $48,000 — could increase as much as $10,000 if automakers pass the tariffs on impacted vehicles in full on to consumers.

Automakers have largely been silent on how much they intend to increase vehicle prices due to the new auto tariffs, as well as additional levies on parts, aluminum and steel — if they raise prices at all.

""We continue to evaluate all of the scenarios,"" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said Tuesday about potential price increases. ""But what I would say to our customers is that, just like all things in life, tomorrow is never guaranteed. And if you're interested in buying a car, right now is a great time to buy a car, because as of today, we haven't [risen] prices.""

A surge in federal government job cuts contributed to a near record-setting pace for announced layoffs in March, exceeded only by when the country shut down in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, according to a report Thursday from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Furloughs in the federal government totaled 216,215 for the month, part of a total 275,240 reductions overall in the labor force. Some 280,253 layoffs across 27 agencies in the past two months have been linked to the Elon Musk-led so-called Department of Government Efficiency and its efforts to pare down the federal workforce.

The monthly total was surpassed only by April and May of 2020 in the early days of the pandemic when employers announced combined reductions of more than 1 million, according to Challenger records going back to 1989. It also was the highest March on record.

""Job cut announcements were dominated last month by Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE] plans to eliminate positions in the federal government,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president and workplace expert at the firm. ""It would have otherwise been a fairly quiet month for layoffs.""

However, DOGE has continued to cut aggressively across the government.

Various reports have indicated that the Veterans Affairs Department could lose 80,000 jobs, the IRS is in line for some 18,000 reductions and The Treasury is expected to drop a ""substantial"" level of workers as well, according to a court filing.

The year-to-date tally for federal government announced layoffs represents a 672% increase from the same period in 2024, according to Challenger.

To be sure, the outsized layoff plans haven't made their way into other jobs data.

Weekly unemployment claims have held in a fairly tight range since President Donald Trump took office. Payroll growth has slowed a bit from its pace in 2024 but is still positive, while job openings have receded but only to around their pre-pandemic levels.

However, the Washington, D.C., area has been hit particularly hard by the announced layoffs, which have totaled 278,711 year to date for the city, according to the report.

Shares of some of the world's biggest automakers appeared surprisingly resilient on Thursday, even after U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on foreign auto imports came into effect.

Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW were all trading around 3% lower at 3:15 p.m. London time (10:15 a.m. ET), while Milan-listed Stellantis — which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot — dipped 4.5%.

Stateside, Ford and General Motors were both around 3% lower.

Analysts and economists said the relatively muted response from auto stocks could be partly attributed to an exemption for Canada and Mexico — where many carmakers have production hubs — from Trump's highly anticipated ""reciprocal"" tariffs announcement.

In a major speech, Trump on Wednesday said his plan would set a 10% baseline tariff across the board, with even higher targeted tariff rates of 34% on China, 20% on the European Union and 46% on Vietnam.

The White House said Canada and Mexico would be exempt from the baseline 10% tariff rate, as well as from reciprocal levies for specific countries for now.

""The long-awaited U.S. reciprocal tariffs announced have been large and broad-based, but critically exempt Canada and Mexico (at least for now) through CUSMA/USMCA compliant trade,"" economists at RBC Capital Markets said in a research note published Wednesday.

""Tariffs on imports from Canada are still set to rise on Thursday. Auto tariffs announced last week will still push the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from Canada to about 3.5% from 2.5% by our count,"" RBC's Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan said.

""That increase will still matter, but looks small now compared to dramatically higher tariffs set to be imposed on other countries,"" they added.

Trump had previously announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, with charges coming into effect as of Thursday. The White House has said a tax for automobile parts will be launched on May 3.

The president's back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have alarmed global investors, corporate executives and U.S. trading partners in recent months.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, on Thursday said that the initial resilience in the automotive sector could be partly explained by investors getting some clarity on Trump's 25% levy on automobile imports.

Asked whether Canada and Mexico's exemption from the new tariff regime might be proving supportive for autos stocks, given that these two countries are integral to the North American supply chain, Luman said there is still ""huge uncertainty"" about the impact of Washington's ""reciprocal tariff"" policy.

He added that the imposition of U.S. tariffs would likely trigger ""significant"" price hikes and a sharp fall in car sales over the coming months.

""We have these tariffs and much of the impact is already priced in, I would say, in stock prices, especially after last week's announcement and prior to that,"" Luman told CNBC over video call.

""The impact will be felt quickly, I would say, in terms of pricing of cars because there is limited stock. There is stock, but not for months and months. There has been some frontloading but after the stock is sold out, prices will be raised, in my view, because the margins are fairly limited,"" Luman said.

""I think investors will probably react by still reducing their exposure to the sector,"" Thomas Besson, head of autos research at Kepler Cheuvreux, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

""We've got now confirmation that for automakers, there will be a substantial hit with some of the OEMs, notably Porsche AG, Stellantis or Volvo Cars most affected but also names like Mercedes, BMW or Volkswagen impacted,"" Besson said.

""We only really have one automaker that is immune to this tariff news, which is Renault, because they have no direct exposure to the space, but everybody else is,"" he added.

Plaid on Thursday announced a new funding round that values the fintech startup at $6 billion, down from $13.4 billion in 2021. The new funding will give some employees a way to cash out.

The $575 million round was led by a batch of new investors including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and BlackRock. Existing backers NEA and Ribbit Capital also participated, Plaid said.

Plaid CEO Zach Perret said the startup saw a ""substantial"" growth year with record revenue and positive operating margins, though he did not provide specifics. The downsized valuation is a reflection of market conditions, he said.

""The reality is our business is much stronger and revenue has grown quite substantially,"" Perret told CNBC. ""The profitability of business has gotten quite a lot better, and yet we are impacted by market multiples, as many companies are.""

Plaid is ""not ready"" for an initial public offering quite yet, but this round will be the last private fundraise until the company lists on public markets, he said.

""An IPO is absolutely on our path for the coming years. We haven't assigned a specific timeline to it,"" Perret said. ""We still have a lot of internal work to do. We're not ready, which is why we didn't consider it right now.""

Plaid's new funding allows employees to cash out of restricted stock units that expire at the end of the year. The startup will also use a portion of the proceeds to enable an employee tender offer.

""That's the motivation for the round,"" Perret said. ""We think it's important to give our employees options to sell and the ability to have liquidity, especially given that Plaid has been private for so long.""

Plaid is the latest in a string of late-stage, private deals designed to enable employees to cash out in private markets. Ramp, DataBricks, OpenAI and Stripe have all announced secondary financings that were designed to let some employees get liquidity. Few of those companies seem eager to wade into public markets. Recent volatility around stocks and lackluster performance of recent IPOs, including CoreWeave's last week, have kept some companies on the sidelines.

""Volatility is definitely going to be one of the key factors,"" Perret said, adding that it was too early to assess IPO market conditions for Plaid.

The startup has been on a roller coaster in private markets since it was founded a decade ago. Plaid was set to be bought by Visa for $5 billion in 2020 in a deal that was eventually called off amid regulatory scrutiny. The following year, it raised money at a $13.4 billion valuation. That also marked the peak for growth and technology valuations before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.

Plaid provides the plumbing to connect consumer bank accounts to popular finance apps. Its APIs let consumers link their bank accounts to services like Venmo, Robinhood and Coinbase. Since then, it's expanded into direct bill pay, cybersecurity and data analytics. It also partners with major banks.

Cybersecurity is one of Plaid's largest growth areas, Perret said. He pointed to financial fraud growing at 20% to 25% per year as a result of the boom in artificial intelligence.

""We've been leaning in to try to build tools to combat deep fakes and a lot of AI-driven financial fraud,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, this is a large market opportunity. It's something that we'd actually like to be smaller. But it's been an area of growth.""

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were under pressure Thursday after President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal jolted the stock market.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last 5% lower at $81,732.99, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 7% and the token tied to Solana dropped 13%.

Meanwhile, stocks cratered, with the broad market S&P 500 on track for its worst day since September 2022. Shares of Coinbase and MicroStrategy lost 9% and 7%, respectively.

Investors were rattled after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs of at least 10% and even higher for some countries, intensifying fears of a global trade war.

""Bitcoin moves at the intersection of narrative, liquidity, and leverage. Right now, it's mostly trading like a high-beta macro asset, tracking real yields, rate expectations, and dollar strength,"" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR.

""Yields pulled back, risk assets caught a bid, and bitcoin responded instantly,"" he added. ""It's not about crypto fundamentals today, it's about global liquidity signals and positioning. When real rates dip and the dollar softens, bitcoin breathes.""

Bitcoin has been trading in the $80,000 to $90,000 range for most of the past month, as investors take cues from the equities market absent a crypto-specific catalyst.

Crypto markets showed resilience relative to equities, according to David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, who noted that bitcoin holding above key technical support signals strong underlying demand.

""Although the tariff rates were slightly higher than expectations, the announcement provided much-needed clarity on the scope and scale of the policy,"" Hernandez said. ""Markets thrive on certainty, and with speculation now largely removed, institutional investors may see an opportunity over the coming days to take advantage of compressed valuations.""

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after U.S. president Donald Trump followed through with his threatened ""Liberation Day"" of global trade tariffs—dropping an “atomic bomb” on markets.

The bitcoin price has fallen back after climbing in the run up to Trump's tariff announcement as traders scramble to parse the so-called reciprocal tariffs (and stay ahead of a serious new threat).

Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock warns bitcoin could end the U.S. dollar's world's reserve currency status, traders are betting the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars.

Short-term interest-rate futures are showing a 70% chance of a Fed interest rate cut when it meets in June, up from about 60% before the tariffs were announced.

Recession fears have seen traders have boost bets the Fed will restart its interest rate cutting cycle this summer and deliver a total of three quarter-point reductions to the policy rate by October, it was reported by Reuters.

Trump's so-called “Liberation Day” barrage of trade tariffs have pushed the probability of a U.S. recession to over 50% on prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi.

""Remember—tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish,"" Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal Fedguy.com posted to X.

In a closely-watched Wednesday announcement, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on most goods imported to the U.S., as well as even higher duties on dozens of countries.

Last September, the Fed's surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut helped kick off the bitcoin price rally that fed into Donald Trump's election victory in November.

“I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post.

“If my analysis of the Fed's major pivot from quantitive tightening to quantitive easing for treasuries is correct, then bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end. Of course, this is not an exact science, but using the gold example, if I had to place a bet on whether I thought bitcoin would hit $76,500 or $110,000 first, I would bet on the latter.”

Last month, Powell warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin-native startups have raised nearly $1.2 billion between 2021 and 2024, according to new research from Trammell Venture Partners. Early-stage activity continues to grow despite broader market declines.

New research from venture capital firm Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) highlights continued growth in bitcoin native startup activity, with nearly $1.2 billion raised by early-stage companies between 2021 and 2024. Despite a broader downturn in crypto and tech venture capital markets during 2023 and 2024, Bitcoin-specific startup formation and funding showed resilience, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage.

According to the 2024 edition of TVP's Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief, Bitcoin Pre-Seed startup transaction volume rose 767% compared to 2021, signalling a maturing and sustained venture category. In 2024 alone, Pre-Seed transaction counts increased 50% year-over-year, while the overall deal count for Bitcoin-native startups grew by 31.8%.

“One or two years' data might represent an anomaly, but with four consecutive years of year-over-year growth at the earliest stage of Bitcoin startup formation, the data now confirm a sustained, long-term venture category trend,” said Christopher Calicott, Managing Director at TVP.

TVP defines a Bitcoin-native company as one whose product success is inherently aligned with Bitcoin's success and which leverages the Bitcoin protocol stack in its core operations.

While overall venture capital dollars in the crypto sector declined, TVP's findings show that Bitcoin-specific investments bucked the trend. In 2024, Bitcoin-native deals made up a growing share of venture activity, with notable participation from institutional VC firms such as Draper Associates, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, and Ribbit Capital.

TVP's report excluded mining operations and late-stage outlier deals to focus on early-stage software and infrastructure startups. The data set includes activity from 2021 through 2024 and aims to offer clarity to allocators seeking long-term exposure to Bitcoin's startup ecosystem.

The full report is available for download via TVP's official website.

As the world awaits US President Donald Trump's announcement on proposed retaliatory tariffs later today, crypto markets continue to show signs of uncertainty. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance may be poised to rise further, potentially worsening conditions for altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH).

According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin dominance is set to climb further, possibly reaching as high as 64%. Notably, this level of BTC dominance is historically significant, as evident from the 2017 and 2020 peaks highlighted in green in the chart below.

For the uninitiated, BTC dominance refers to the ratio of the premier digital asset's market cap to the total crypto market cap. A rising BTC dominance typically means that liquidity is rotating from small market cap coins – called altcoins – into BTC.

As a result, altcoins like ETH may exhibit subdued price action when BTC dominance rises. Fellow crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted ETH's weak performance against BTC, suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is likely to face further declines in the near term.

In an X post, Martinez shared an inverse monthly ETH/BTC chart illustrating a cup-and-handle pattern forming. While this pattern is typically bullish, in an inverse chart like this, it suggests ETH may fall to as low as 0.00240 – an almost 90% decline from its current price relative to Bitcoin.

A decline in ETH would likely drag down other altcoins, causing a sharp spike in BTC dominance. However, some analysts see the prevailing pessimism surrounding ETH as a potential buying opportunity.

In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that ETH's price has returned to its 2021 levels, trading close to $1,900 at the time of writing. However, the trader added that in 2025, multiple factors could work in ETH's favor.

For example, ETH's narrative could strengthen with the potential approval of an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) for staking, rising institutional demand, and improving fundamentals. The analyst referred to ETH as the “most asymmetric bet right now.”

That said, ETH still has a long way to go before confirming a bullish trend reversal. In a recent analysis, Martinez noted that, based on pricing bands analysis, ETH must break through a key resistance level at $2,300 before targeting higher levels. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,901, down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Goes Head To Head With XRP: Analyst Says ETH Will Outperform For This Reason","https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-head-to-head-with-xrp/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:19:24 GMT","

Ethereum (ETH) has been projected to challenge XRP's bullish price performance and possibly surpass it to reach new highs. Despite Ethereum's failure to rally significantly in this bull cycle, a crypto analyst has outlined reasons why this second-largest cryptocurrency is set for explosive upside momentum. 

CredibullCrypto, a prominent crypto analyst, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss the XRP/ETH trading pair. The analyst projects a strong rally for Ethereum this year, presenting a price chart to visualize his analysis while outlining the reasons for his forecast.

According to CredibullCrypto, Ethereum is expected to outperform XRP in the short-to-mid-term as the XRP/ETH trading pair is now undergoing a correction after experiencing a recent rally of more than 250%. Compared to ETH, the XRP price has seen significant gains this year, skyrocketing from a price low of $0.5 to over $3 for the first time in seven years. 

While these gains were impressive, market indicators now suggest that a temporary pullback for XRP is underway, creating an opportunity for Ethereum to potentially take the lead. A major reason for this possibility is the appearance of multiple bearish divergences in the XRP/ETH price chart, signaling a potential cooldown. 

Notably, the analyst expects XRP to decline and revisit range lows at $1.60 – $1.80. At the same time, ETH is likely to stay within a massive high-time frame demand zone, reinforcing the expectation that its price will hold strong while XRP consolidates further. 

Despite Ethereum's projected dominance and outperformance of XRP in the near term, CredibullCrypto remains bullish on the XRP price in the long run. Nevertheless, the analyst's projection of a short-term correction for XRP is seen as a necessary phase for Ethereum's upside momentum. 

Looking at the price chart, the XRP/ETH trading pair is expected to dip into the green demand zone in the range of $0.00087 – $0.00088. After this correction, the analyst suggests a sharp recovery for the pair, signaling a new leg up toward $0.00092, as indicated by the blue arrow. 

Crypto Caesar, an analyst on X, has forecasted that the Ethereum price will hit a market bottom soon. Once this occurs, the analyst suggests a possible reversal to a new high. 

According to the analyst's price chart, if Ethereum fails to hold the $1,800 support level, the next strong low zone around $1,000 – $1,200 could be tested. The red area in the price chart, representing the $3,600 – $4,00 range, has been marked as a crucial resistance zone. Once broken, this resistance could propel ETH to weak highs around $4,400 – $4,800.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that a weakening stock market may cause Ethereum (ETH) to retest lower price levels.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 889,000 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500 may continue to show weakness in April, which, based on historical precedence, may result in ETH also declining.

“What I'm wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there's going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there's a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there's a larger counter-trend rally. 

And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. It could also just simply be due to, there's a lot of macro data coming out in early to mid-April that I think the markets are going to be interested in. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” 

Cowen says ETH may drop to its logarithmic trendline, potentially as low as $1,044, amid recessionary pressures, before reclaiming the $3,000 level as support.

“I'm just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it's over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. We've been talking about that for a while, and it's the whole idea that ETH goes home.”

ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) continues failing to reclaim the $2,100 resistance, dropping 6% in the past week. As the second largest crypto trades within its “make or break” levels, some market watchers suggest it will continue to move sideways before another major move.

Ethereum Trades At 2023 Levels

After closing its worst Q1 since 2018, Ethereum continued moving sideways, hovering between the $1,775-$1,925 price range. Amid last Monday's recovery, Ethereum traded only 6% below its monthly opening, eyeing a potential positive close in the monthly timeframe.

Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency fell over 10% from last week's high to close the first quarter 45.4% below its January opening and 18.6% from its March opening. Moreover, it registers its worst performance in seven years, recording four consecutive months of bleeding for the first time since 2018.

Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH is “still trading in no man's land” despite its recent attempts to break above its current range. In early March, Ethereum dropped below the $2,100 mark, losing its 2024 gains and hitting a 16-month low of $1,750.

The trader suggested that the crucial levels to watch are a breakdown below $1,750 or a breakout above $2,100. “Anything in between is just going to be a painful chop,” he added.

Another market watcher, Merlijn The Trader, highlighted that ETH is at 2021 levels, pointing that it is trading within the breakout zone that led to Ethereum's all-time high (ATH) but has stronger fundamentals and more institutional demand four years later.

“ETH is sitting on the same monthly support that ignited the 2021 bull run. Hold it, and $10K is in play. Lose it… and things get ugly,” he detailed.

More Chop Before ETH's Next Move?

Analyst VirtualBacon considers that Ethereum will continue to trade within its current price range for the time being. He explained that ETH's price has fallen to retest the last bear market resistance levels, as it has erased all its gains since November 2023.

The analyst considers this zone a “good value range” but doesn't expect the cryptocurrency to break out “right away.” However, he added that a bullish breakout is “simply a matter of time” in longer timeframes.

“Ethereum always catches up when the Fed pivots and the global liquidity index beings to uptrend. That's when you see the ETH/BTC ratio start to turn up again, leading the rest of the altcoin market,” he concluded.

Ali Martinez pointed out that the number of large ETH transactions has significantly declined in over a month, dropping 63.8% since February 25.

During this period, large transactions fell from 14,500 to 5,190, signaling a drop in whale activity on the network. He also noted that whales have sold 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks.

As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,903, a 6% drop in the weekly timeframe.

Fidelity's crypto IRA offers US investors tax-advantaged exposure to top digital assets with no maintenance fees.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Fidelity Investments is launching zero-fee retirement plans that will provide investors exposure to three major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). 

The product is available to US citizens over 18 who reside in states where Fidelity Digital Assets supports crypto individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The asset manager is offering three different IRA plans.

 The first plan is a tax-free Roth IRA, which allows investors to save for retirement with already taxed money, while the second is a more “traditional” IRA, which allows for tax-deferred potential earnings growth. 

The third plan is a Rollover IRA, which enables investors to transfer funds from a former employer's plan to an IRA, such as a 401(k), 403(b), or another IRA.

To open a Fidelity Crypto IRA, investors must also hold a Fidelity brokerage IRA with the same registration type, which acts as a funding account. 

Users can transfer funds from the linked brokerage IRA into the crypto IRA to execute trades. If an individual does not already hold a qualifying Fidelity brokerage IRA, the firm will open one in parallel when setting up the crypto IRA.

Additionally, Fidelity's decision to only include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin reflects a focus on established assets with relatively higher market capitalization and liquidity.

According to the company, opening and maintaining a Fidelity Crypto IRA, as well as associated custody services for digital assets, will not carry a fee for customers.

However, Fidelity Digital Assets will apply a 1% spread to buy and sell orders. The spread represents the difference between the price a client receives and the price at which Fidelity Digital Assets sources the asset to fill the order.

The offering allows users to retain familiar features of traditional Fidelity retirement accounts, including beneficiary management. 

The designated beneficiaries for the Fidelity Crypto IRA mirror those established on the user's linked brokerage IRA. Customers can make changes to beneficiaries through the brokerage IRA platform.

The move is the latest from Fidelity Digital Assets, Fidelity's arm that focuses on crypto custody, trading, and management.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction & Analysis: Can It Bounce Back After Brutal Q1?","https://coincentral.com/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-analysis-can-it-bounce-back-after-brutal-q1/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 09:06:39 GMT","

Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to maintain its recovery momentum in early April 2025, with the price failing to break above the $2,000 psychological barrier. The second-largest cryptocurrency has faced significant headwinds in recent months, resulting in a sharp decline during the first quarter of the year.

ETH price attempted to recover above the $1,880 level but faced rejection. The cryptocurrency formed a high at $1,955 before trimming most gains and falling back below $1,850.

Technical indicators show ETH trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart was also broken, suggesting continued bearish pressure.

On the upside, Ethereum faces resistance near $1,850, with the next key hurdle at $1,865. The major resistance level sits at $1,920, and clearing this could potentially push the price toward $1,950.

The first quarter of 2025 proved particularly challenging for Ethereum. The cryptocurrency ended Q1 down 45%, according to Coinglass data, making it the third-worst quarter for ETH since 2016.

This poor performance contributed to approximately $170 billion in market value being erased. Institutional investors have responded cautiously, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds losing $403 million in March alone.

Standard Chartered analysts have reduced their year-end ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000. This adjustment reflects growing competition from Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which have attracted users seeking lower transaction fees.

Network activity metrics further highlight ETH's struggles. The fee generation has fallen dramatically from $142 million in January to just $21 million in March.

Despite price challenges, Ethereum achieved a notable milestone in March by reclaiming the top position in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the first time since September 2024.

Ethereum-based DEXs processed $64 billion in spot trading, outperforming Solana's $52 billion and BSC's $44 billion, according to DefiLlama data.

Overall market activity has slowed across the board. DEX trading volume decreased from $86 billion in January to $85 billion in March. Total value locked (TVL) also declined from $67 billion to $49 billion during the same period.

The network's burn rate has reached its lowest level since August 2021. Data from Ultrasound Money shows just 53 ETH burned daily last week, with Ethereum's total supply growing 3% since the EIP-1559 upgrade.

While current market conditions appear challenging, Ethereum's long-term potential shouldn't be overlooked. The network continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, controlling 54% of this market with $5 billion in tokenized assets.

The RWA sector is projected to become a $16 trillion industry by 2030, potentially driving renewed interest in Ethereum. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has emphasized tokenization's potential, predicting that all assets will eventually have on-chain representations.

Stablecoin holdings on Ethereum are approaching an all-time high of $124.5 billion. The network remains the undisputed leader in decentralized finance with $49 billion in total value locked.

Ethereum could also benefit from staking-enabled ETFs. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange have filed for staking in Ethereum ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The market's sentiment could shift quickly with positive developments. The Trump family's investment in ETH through World Liberty Financial and Eric Trump's public support for Ethereum may provide additional momentum in the future.

For now, both professional traders and retail investors remain cautious about Ethereum's price outlook, with derivatives data showing little confidence in a strong recovery in the near term.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","PayPal Adds Solana and Chainlink to Crypto It Supports, Benefiting Altcoins Like Solaxy","https://bitcoinist.com/paypal-adds-solana-benefiting-altcoins-solaxy/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 09:42:55 GMT","

Wake up, PayPal just added support for two new cryptocurrencies in the US—and it could be huge for altcoins!

Unless you consider reading PayPal's help center a hobby, you probably missed the addition of Solana ($SOL) and Chainlink ($LINK) to its list of supported cryptocurrencies in the US and its territories.

The addition of these two coins expands the digital payment platform's crypto lineup, which also includes its own PayPal USD ($PYUSD), Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), Litecoin ($LTC), and Bitcoin Cash ($BCH).

You can't send $SOL and $LINK to supported external crypto wallets just yet, though.

When it comes to size, nothing currently touches Ethereum. But Solana is gradually making headway.

In a report by Messari, the chain's GDP jumped from $268M in Q3 2024 to $840M the following quarter, translating to a whopping 212.8% growth.

It also became the second-biggest chain by DeFi TVL, representing the total amount of assets currently deposited in a DeFi protocol, with $8.6B in Q4 2024.

While Solana is one of the world's biggest blockchains, it's not perfect. Customers often complain about delayed transactions and service disruptions, which negatively impact user experience. But one project wants to change that.

Enter Solaxy ($SOLX), a Solana Layer 2 blockchain that aims to address Solana's common pain points like network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limitations.



Powering this project is its native token $SOLX. It's a multichain token that will also become available on Solana and Ethereum just like $PYUSD.

This brings together the best of the two blockchains: Ethereum's DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem, and Solana's speed and low fees.

The project is currently preselling its $SOLX token. It's the first of its 4-Phase roadmap, which will eventually see the token being listed on DEXs and CEXs, the full deployment of the Solaxy Layer 2 network, and further expansion of its ecosystem.

$SOLX is still very affordable at $0.001682 each. But another price increase will happen in a few hours, so it's always best to buy sooner than later. After all, analysts expect $SOLX to grow exponentially in the next five years (up to $0.043 by 2030).

Other investors think so too, which has helped the project raise over $28.9M to date, easily establishing it as one of the best altcoins.

When you look at the project's tokenomics, you'll immediately notice that it set aside the biggest chunk of its token supply for development (30%). This signals that the team is serious about making a solid product that can help greatly improve Solana.



You can learn more about Solaxy by reading its whitepaper or following it on X.

Aside from giving users more crypto options on PayPal, adding Solana also helps increase the blockchain's value and its native token.

As such, related projects like Solaxy benefit too, especially since this one adds much-needed improvements to Solana.

But as always, do your own research before you invest in volatile crypto like meme coins. This helps improve your chances of success and limit your risk. After all, the crypto market can be highly volatile and could quickly lose you money unless you're careful.

US President Donald Trump has once again delivered on his campaign promise. Yesterday (Wednesday), he officially ordered reciprocal tariffs to be imposed globally from 5 April. Global stock and cryptocurrency markets are expected to see cautious investor sentiment due to the possibility of an escalated trade war triggered by these US tariffs.

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market intensified following the tariff announcement. Among the top ten tokens by market capitalisation, Bitcoin dropped by 5.2 per cent, falling from nearly $88,000 to just over $83,000 shortly after the announcement. XRP and Ether also declined by 6 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively. Solana, another popular token, also dropped by 6 per cent.

Donald Trump's official meme token also took a hit, falling around 10 per cent in the past 24 hours. It is now showing signs of recovery.

As a result, crypto futures liquidations surged to $511.77 million over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin accounted for the largest portion, with $179.71 million in liquidations. The drop in crypto prices signals a broader shift towards risk aversion across financial markets.

As President Trump pledged during his campaign, he has introduced reciprocal tariffs for all countries with a trade deficit with the US. With a baseline tariff of 10 per cent, South Asian countries were hit the hardest.

From 5 April, Cambodian products entering the US will be subjected to a 49 per cent tariff, while Vietnamese exporters must pay 46 per cent. Laos and Myanmar have been hit with 48 per cent and 44 per cent tariffs, respectively. China, which charges a 67 per cent tariff on US goods, will now face 34 per cent tariffs on all exports to the US. India, another major trade partner, must now pay 26 per cent tariffs on its exports to the US.

However, Mexico and Canada have avoided additional tariffs.

“There has been whipsaw price action in the aftermath of Trump's announcement,” said Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at XTB. “There were no carve-outs or exemptions for individual countries or certain sectors, which spooked traders.”

On April 3, Binance announced that it would add a new set of tokens to its monitoring list. These tokens are under closer scrutiny and may face delisting following the upcoming review period.

This move follows the exchange's aims to increase transparency while offering more clarity regarding the risk levels associated with different cryptocurrencies.

As part of this update, the following tokens will be added to the Monitoring Tag list: Ardor (ARDR), Biswap (BSW), Flamingo (FLM), LTO Network (LTO), NKN (NKN), PlayDapp (PDA), Perpetual Protocol (PERP), Viberate (VIB), Voxies (VOXEL) and Wing Finance (WING).

Tokens added to the Monitoring Tag exhibit notably higher volatility and risk compared to other listed tokens. Binance will closely monitor these tokens, with regular reviews to assess their compliance with the platform's listing criteria. 

“Tokens with the Monitoring Tag are at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria and being delisted from the platform,” Binance said.

Following the announcement, the prices of the mentioned altcoins plummeted by double-digits.

In addition to the new Monitoring Tag additions, Binance will also remove the Seed Tag from Jupiter (JUP), Starknet (STRK), and Toncoin (TON).

Tokens marked with the Seed Tag are those that are still in their early stages of development and have not yet met Binance's full listing criteria. The removal of the Seed Tag indicates a change in the status of these projects. This suggests that they no longer fit the initial criteria for such a label.

Tokens with the Monitoring Tag or Seed Tag come with inherent risks. Binance ensures that users are well-informed before trading them. To access trading for these tokens, users must pass a risk awareness quiz every 90 days. 

The quiz makes sure that users understand the potential risks associated with trading higher-risk tokens. Binance will also display a risk warning banner for these tokens on its Spot and Margin platforms.

Binance will continue to conduct periodic reviews of tokens with the Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag. During these reviews, several factors are taken into account. This includes the project team's commitment, development activity, token liquidity, and community engagement. 

The latest development follows a similar announcement from Binance in March. The exchange routinely delists tokens that fail to keep up with its criteria.

BySandy Carter,

 Contributor. 

With both Circle and OpenAI making two groundbreaking financial announcements this week, shockwaves have been sent through both the tech and finance worlds.

Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, announced plans to go public, signaling blockchain's significant step toward mainstream financial acceptance. USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is fully backed by U.S. dollars. USDC is backed 100% by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets and is redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. It ranks consistently among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Simultaneously, OpenAI, the pioneering force behind ChatGPT, secured an unprecedented $40 billion investment, underscoring artificial intelligence's rapid evolution from futuristic concept to essential economic driver. On the surface, these two developments might seem unrelated, but collectively, they illuminate a powerful convergence between blockchain and AI—one that could reshape our economic future dramatically.

Circle's decision to pursue an IPO is not merely another tech company entering public markets—it's a critical endorsement of blockchain technology by major financial institutions. With heavyweight backers such as JPMorgan and Citi, Circle's public listing represents a major validation from the traditional financial system. It provides mainstream investors a credible entry point into blockchain-driven financial services, potentially setting a standard for other Web3 companies aiming to bridge the gap to conventional financial markets.

Stablecoins, specifically Circle's USDC, offer the predictability traditional investors crave, serving as a digital equivalent to the dollar. By making blockchain accessible, Circle's IPO could be the tipping point for broader adoption. This move isn't just strategic; it positions blockchain firmly within the realm of regulated finance, opening doors for greater transparency and acceptance by skeptical institutional investors.

Parallel to Circle's announcement, OpenAI made history by raising a record-setting $40 billion in private funding, underscoring AI's leap from specialized tech niche to dominant economic force. Investors have now explicitly recognized AI as the cornerstone of the future economy. Such a substantial investment speaks volumes, not only about OpenAI's pioneering role but also about market confidence in AI's potential to revolutionize industries globally.

This $40 billion investment dwarfs prior tech fundraising rounds and reflects a fundamental shift in market dynamics. AI is now seen as essential infrastructure—akin to electricity or the internet—that will reshape business, communications, finance, healthcare, and more. OpenAI, already celebrated for groundbreaking AI models like ChatGPT, now commands the resources to shape global AI innovation decisively.

Individually transformative, Circle and OpenAI together highlight a significant emerging trend: the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. This convergence creates new possibilities, amplifying each technology's strengths while compensating for their respective weaknesses.

Blockchain excels in ensuring transparency, security, and immutability, making it ideal for sectors demanding trustworthy data management. AI, on the other hand, thrives on vast datasets and computational intelligence, capable of rapidly extracting actionable insights from mountains of information. Together, blockchain and AI can foster revolutionary solutions, including intelligent digital identities, AI-driven decentralized financial (DeFi) compliance systems, predictive market analytics, and secure management of sensitive AI-generated data.

Imagine a financial system where intelligent blockchain algorithms automatically ensure regulatory compliance, reduce fraud, and simplify complex financial transactions seamlessly. Or consider healthcare systems leveraging blockchain-secured patient data, analyzed by AI to deliver personalized medical treatments. These scenarios demonstrate just the tip of the iceberg in potential AI-blockchain innovations.

At the core of this AI-blockchain convergence is an economy defined by two powerful ideals: digital trust and autonomous intelligence. Circle represents the future of digital trust—ensuring transactions, currencies, and digital assets are transparent and secure. OpenAI represents intelligence-driven automation and innovation, providing tools and platforms that enable unprecedented efficiency and innovation.

The combination of these elements could create an entirely new economic paradigm. It's an economy where decisions become faster and smarter, bolstered by intelligent automation, yet securely rooted in verifiable blockchain technology. Financial transactions become frictionless, regulations automated, and market predictions increasingly precise. The impact? A dramatic acceleration in innovation, productivity, and economic growth.

These developments are reshaping investor strategies and institutional adoption of new technologies. Circle's public market entry is poised to attract traditional investors who, until now, viewed blockchain ventures as risky or opaque. Institutional investors increasingly see blockchain and AI ventures as strategic, long-term portfolio additions rather than speculative bets.

Similarly, OpenAI's record funding round signifies that AI has moved beyond being a speculative investment. Major venture capital firms and private equity groups now recognize AI as foundational technology—essential for future competitiveness and economic stability.

Together, these shifts may trigger broader acceptance and adoption of advanced technologies. Institutional portfolios might soon routinely include blockchain infrastructure and AI-driven platforms, fueling even greater investment flows and innovation.

With great innovation comes equally significant regulatory scrutiny. Circle's IPO will inevitably invite greater regulatory oversight, particularly around stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure. Regulators will closely monitor how blockchain integrates with existing financial frameworks, ensuring transparency and protecting investors.

Similarly, OpenAI's substantial funding and growing influence means that AI technology will face intensified regulatory examination. Issues such as data privacy, bias in AI models, and ethical use of AI-generated content will come under increased scrutiny, requiring thoughtful governance and responsible innovation.

Regulatory evolution isn't a roadblock; instead, it's indicative of an industry maturing. Constructive regulatory frameworks will provide clarity, fostering innovation while safeguarding ethical standards and consumer interests. Circle and OpenAI's recent successes illustrate that blockchain and AI are now ready for robust regulatory dialogue, positioning these technologies for sustainable growth.

Circle's planned IPO and OpenAI's extraordinary funding aren't merely financial milestones. They symbolize a profound shift in economic thinking, setting the stage for a future economy driven by digital trust and intelligence. Investors, businesses, and regulators alike must prepare for a landscape shaped by the symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain.

As we look ahead, the intersections of decentralized finance and intelligent automation could emerge as defining forces of tomorrow's digital economy. The potential is immense—ranging from transformative impacts in finance and healthcare to sweeping changes in government, logistics, and beyond.

The digital economy isn't just shifting—it's transforming fundamentally. Circle and OpenAI are at the forefront of this new chapter, challenging conventional economic norms and redefining what's possible. This isn't merely the rise of two innovative companies; it's a glimpse into a radically different future—a future shaped by the unprecedented convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Crypto market maker Flowdesk joins Canton Network for blockchain collateral","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/crypto-market-maker-flowdesk-joins-canton-network-for-blockchain-collateral/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:15:17 GMT","

Flowdesk, a cryptocurrency market maker, has become the latest participant in the Canton Network's initiative to create an advanced on chain solution for collateral and margin management in bilateral crypto derivatives. Working alongside Digital Asset, QCP, and various trading counterparties, Flowdesk will contribute to building an innovative infrastructure that utilizes the Canton Network's privacy features.

This collaboration aims to tackle persistent challenges in cryptocurrency derivatives trading, especially the high capital requirements for collateralization. Flowdesk's involvement will strengthen efforts to develop an economical and regulatory compliant framework for managing margin using blockchain technology.

The Canton Global Collateral Network founded by Digital Asset has already attracted a few industry players. Apart from Singapore institutional trading venue QCP joining earlier this year, Circle announced plans to launch a native version of USDC stablecoin on the Canton Network. That follows its acquisition of tokenized money market (MMF) fund startup Hashnote, which had already launched its USYC MMF on Canton. 

“Canton Network's offering provides the ability to manage collateral and margin on chain, aligning with Flowdesk's mission to create scalable and robust infrastructure for the digital asset economy,” said Simon Nursey, Head of Derivatives at Flowdesk.

Key features of the platform will include ISDA CSA-compliant smart contract collateral agreements and automated processes for handling margin calls and resolving disputes.

Earlier this year Flowdesk finalized an $102 million equity financing round as well as debt from BlackRock managed funds.

Collateral mobility is widely considered a prime use case for distributed ledger technology and Digital Asset is tackling the challenge from different angles. For example, it recently collaborated with Euroclear for tokenized collateral to enable instant transfers of non cash assets to meet margin requirements.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC Pink:SILS) hat dargelegt, wie Blockchain-Technologie helfen kann, die Störungen durch globale Handelskriege durch dezentrale Infrastruktur-Lösungen zu mildern. Das Unternehmen hob fünf Schlüsselinnovationen hervor: Direkter Globaler Zugang, der Peer-to-Peer-Asset-Handel ermöglichtAutomatisierung von Smart Contracts zur Reduzierung bürokratischer VerzögerungenStablecoin-Zahlungen zur Senkung der Transaktionskosten um 40-60%Unveränderliche Herkunftsverfolgung für EchtzeitverifizierungDezentrale Schlichtung für schnellere Konfliktlösung

Strategischer Berater Tom Bustamante betonte, dass, obwohl Blockchain die Auswirkungen von Handelskriegen nicht vollständig beseitigen kann, sie die Macht von den Nationen auf die Marktteilnehmer durch transparente, regelbasierte Systeme verlagert. Das Unternehmen hat sich auf private Blockchain-Lösungen für die institutionelle Tokenisierung durch TrustNFT-Technologie spezialisiert.

Direct Global Access: Decentralized platforms enable businesses to engage international partners without intermediaries, sidestepping politicized trade barriers. Projects can tokenize assets (e.g., commodities, invoices) and trade them peer-to-peer via DeFi protocols, avoiding tariff-choked channels.

Smart Contract Automation: Self-executing contracts enforce terms without government oversight, automatically handling customs compliance, payments, and delivery verification. This reduces disputes and eliminates bureaucratic delays.

Stablecoin Payments: Cryptocurrencies like USDC provide tariff-resistant settlement mechanisms, cutting transaction costs by 40-60% compared to traditional forex channels.

Immutable Provenance Tracking: Agricultural and manufacturing sectors use blockchain to verify product origins/quality in real-time, neutralizing protectionist ""dumping"" accusations.

Decentralized Arbitration: Blockchain-based dispute resolution platforms (e.g., Kleros) use tokenized governance to settle cross-border conflicts faster.

""These mechanisms collectively create parallel trade channels where compliance is cryptographic rather than geopolitical"", said Tom Bustamante, strategic advisor for Silver Scott. ""While not eliminating all trade war impacts of course, blockchain does shift leverage from nations to market participants through transparent, rules-based systems. What decentralized systems provide isn't a solution to trade wars, but a means to circumvent their most disruptive effects.""

Digital Watch Observatory

Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes

Home | Updates | Bybit shuts down NFT and IDO platforms

The closure of NFT services follows a $1.5 billion hack and declining NFT market volumes. 

Bybit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced the discontinuation of its NFT marketplace. The platform will also shut down its Initial DEX Offering (IDO) product pages. 

The decision comes shortly after the platform suffered a devastating security breach in February 2025. During the breach, it lost approximately $1.5 billion to North Korean hackers. 

Although Bybit has cited ‘efforts to streamline our offerings' as the reason for the shutdown, many believe it is a direct consequence of the hack and subsequent security concerns.

The discontinuation will take effect on 8 April 2025, at 16:00 UTC. Users have been urged to manage their assets before the deadline. 

The exchange provided alternative NFT trading platforms, including OpenSea, Blur, and Magic Eden, for Ethereum-based assets. IDO participants have also been advised to transfer their airdropped tokens to private Web3 wallets. 

The platform's decision to shut down its NFT and IDO services is seen as a move to mitigate further risks and potential compliance issues. Bybit's shutdown follows a broader trend in the NFT market, where many platforms have closed.

Sofia, Bulgaria – March 31, 2025 – Credefi, a defi platform focused on lending backed by real-world assets, has announced the release of its NFT Bonds product on Polytrade's Marketplace. The launch introduces a tokenized fixed-income instrument that is tradable, fractionalized, and collateralized with over $750,000 in real-world assets.

The NFT Bonds are now live on the Polytrade platform and offer a fixed annual yield of 22%, with returns distributed on a quarterly basis. The bonds have a maturity period of 12 months and are supported by loans issued to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the European Union. Each loan is backed by tangible collateral, including real estate and future receivables, as part of Credefi's approach to lending based on real-world asset security.

Credefi‘s lending model is designed to address the gap in the EU SME sector, which remains underserved by traditional banking systems. All borrowers on the platform are subject to a proprietary credit assessment process validated by Experian, with loan-to-value ratios capped at 120%. According to the platform, the current default rate is 0%, and the risk predictability rate exceeds 85%.

The NFT Bonds product allows users to participate in the lending ecosystem through tokenized exposure to SME credit. Bonds are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), making them tradable on the secondary market. Users can acquire full or fractional ownership, enabling flexible participation levels.

This new product is part of Credefi's broader portfolio, which includes diversified loan portfolios, single-loan exposures, and real-economy corporate bonds. As of the launch, Credefi reports that the platform has facilitated over $3.7 million in total liquidity.

The NFT Bonds are available through Polytrade's Marketplace, a platform focused on real-world asset opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. Polytrade supports a range of on-chain asset types and offers infrastructure for buying, selling, and managing real-world asset exposure.

Credefi incorporates a dual-token system consisting of $CREDI and $xCREDI. $CREDI is used for collateral protection and yield enhancement features, while $xCREDI, earned through staking in the platform's Module X, serves both governance and utility functions. These tokens support user participation and additional security mechanisms across the platform.

Security is maintained through a multi-layered approach. Loans are collateralized with real-world assets to reduce exposure to volatility, and the platform's risk models are developed to support predictable returns. Credefi offers borrowers flexible solutions based on collateral and individual risk profiles, while lenders receive access to products designed to provide stable income derived from real economic activity.

Credefi's NFT Bonds can now be accessed directly on Polytrade's Marketplace at https://lnk.polytrade.finance/credefi-bonds.

Credefi is a decentralized lending platform that enables real-world asset-backed debt products. Based in the European Union, the platform connects crypto lenders with SMEs seeking capital, using blockchain technology to structure loans backed by real estate, receivables, and other physical assets. Credefi applies rigorous credit assessments validated by third parties and aims to provide reliable returns while addressing the SME gap in the region.

ByLawrence Wintermeyer,

 Contributor. 

There are concerns about an impending recession in the United States, with JP Morgan raising its probability to 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the beginning of the year, and Goldman Sachs raising the probability to 20 percent. The “Trump bump” has waned with the U.S. stock markets down since the start of 2025, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the sell off down nearly 8 percent.

Following “liberation day” where President Trump announced new tariffs on U.S. imports, a new era of trade competition has many economists predicting a rise in U.S. inflation. In an interview last month, the President, shared a different perspective, saying the US economy was going through “a period of transition.”

The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the market drop a “healthy correction.”

Similarly, Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said, “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.”

Crypto markets, which are highly correlated to tech stocks, have shed over $1 trillion in the past weeks. Crypto veterans know volatility is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics.

During transient market conditions, experienced crypto allocators and developers return to the trenches and focus on driving crypto innovation. Extended periods of market volatility often present opportunities for investing in and building new and better crypto products.

The crypto economy beyond BTC and ETH can often lack a solid grounding as liquidity circulates from one narrative to another. Instead of generating revenue from businesses with strong fundamentals, shifting capital reserves can often obstruct the industry's sustainable growth.

The memecoin market has shrunk by over 57 percent, from $125 billion in December 2024 to $53 billion in March 2025. Investors' primary activity has been rotating capital allocation as $485 million flowed out of Solana to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain in February 2025.

Byron Gilliam, market strategist and uber-industry pundit at Blockworks says, “Memecoins are not stocks, of course, they're lottery tickets — some of which do pay off.”

Gilliam highlights the memecoin launchpad pump.fun has generated $600 million of revenue in its short 14-month existence and users don't have much to show for it: Of the 8.7 million tokens launched, only four now have market caps above $100 million.

The memecoin market is driven mainly by retail investors.

The Dow Investing Versus Gambling chart lays out the continuum of expected returns to uncertainty that most serious financial professionals involved in allocating capital to and developing the crypto and digital asset ecosystem are at pains to point this out.

Lotteries are the last stop on the uncertainty axis, following casino gambling. There is a strong argument that memecoins are not cryptoassets, per se.

Investing Versus Gambling

Dow Publishing Company Inc.

Roshan Dharia, CEO of Echo Base, a crypto holding company, has elaborated on the retail investor's plight within the crypto domain saying, “No doubt Memecoins have been instrumental in onboarding the crypto-curious, however, to build a sustainable financial market, the crypto industry must stay focused on building products with real economic utility that solve real world problems.

“Memecoins make for great press, but traditional financial institutions are focused on how crypto creates efficiency and transparency in a way that unlocks new value. That value has long been inaccessible but on blockchain rails... everything changes.""

Utility is an important aspect of attracting people to crypto and creating new revenue channels for on-chain companies.

The other important aspect is ensuring safety for retail investors, especially after the $1.4 billion Bybit hack.

According to a CertiK report, there were 760 security breaches with $2.36 billion lost in 2024, a sharp 31 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise. These vulnerabilities expose the risk of investors within the crypto industry and the need to build highly secure crypto products.

CertiK co-founder and ceo, Professor Ronghui Gu commented, “Hackers are using increasingly sophisticated techniques, and it is now more important than ever for blockchain businesses and projects to proactively invest in robust security measures. The Bybit breach is a wake-up call for the entire industry. Security is not simply a competitive edge - it is a shared responsibility.""

Mooly Sagiv, CEO and co-founder of Certora, explained, “As the crypto industry matures, hackers will find more sophisticated ways to siphon off funds. The onus lies with companies to develop safer products for users. Incidents like the Bybit hack erode investor confidence, and stakeholders must take all necessary precautions to initiate a trust-building exercise.”

As the speculative frenzy settles down for a while, companies have the window to focus on building safe crypto products with real use cases. VCs have been doing this for a long time and continue to do so during market volatility.

NFTs and the metaverse didn't feature among the popular crypto narratives of 2024 in any dimension including mindshare. They were remnants of the past crypto bull market cycle, forgotten amidst memecoins and the AI token frenzy. Yet, according to a Galaxy report, VCs invested the largest share of capital in categories like NFTs, metaverse, and gaming in Q4 2024.

The reality is that people like to gamble, play the lottery, and enjoy gaming. These multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, $65 billion, $100 billion, and over $100 billion annually respectively, are growing (globally), and in many instances, and are being transformed by Web3 technologies. It is an important point to bring to attention, especially as it relates to technology innovation and investment where gaming is a leading category of VC investment.

VCs often don't follow a mindshare-based investing strategy. Instead, they identify categories with immense potential and invest early to reap dividends when the industry matures. For instance, in Q4 2024, the majority of capital for NFTs, DAOs, and metaverse went to early-stage companies and projects.

According to Ronald Yung from RaveDAO, “NFTs were once perceived primarily as digital collectibles or icons of the last bull cycle, but their real value lies in their evolving utility. At RaveDAO, we've integrated NFTs beyond art—leveraging them for event ticketing as proof of attendance and participation.

“While the market sentiment around NFTs has shifted, the underlying technology remains a powerful tool for authentication, access control, and community engagement. The solution itself isn't going anywhere — it's simply adapting to real-world applications.”

Similarly, VCs had identified AI's transformative potential long before ChatGPT became a household name, and AI tokens dominated investor mindshare. AI funding has grown steadily from just $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020.

VC capital inflows into emerging tech remain strong. In Q1 2025, AI funding outpaced crypto venture funding by a huge margin, continuing a historically preferential investment trend. Although the traditional AI space attracts more funds, blockchain-based AI startups have also started getting capital investments recently.

Rowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, said, “There's still an enormous gap between legacy AI and crypto-AI investments, with institutional capital favoring the former, but bringing together two emerging categories, like crypto and AI to build frontier consumer-focused tech will likely drive more revenue growth and attract new investments.

“There's more we can accomplish to build a smart AI-driven global ecosystem if we continue to develop good products within the crypto-AI sub-domain.”

The investment patterns show that VCs have identified more “future-proof” segments and deployed capital accordingly for long-term market growth. The Trump administration's assurance that the American economy will experience a transitory period is a promise greatly supported by America's leading Technology and Information sector.

The Technology and Information sector is the third largest U.S. services sector and contributes around 10 percent of GDP (~$2.4 trillion), behind the second, Healthcare & Social Assistance – around 18 percent of GDP (~$4.5 trillion), and the number one services sector leader, Financial Services, which contributes around 20 percent of GDP (~$5 trillion) - the U.S. is the home of the global capital markets.

The American market boom is anything but over for the Financial Services sector, according to Larry Fink, the chairman and ceo of Blackrock, in his Annual Report. In fact, it's just getting started. Historically, markets in transition always presented enormous scope for innovation. The ongoing market transition also provides a good reminder to strive for innovation without getting distracted by daily stock market moves.

Warren Buffet, arguably history's most successful fundamental investor, advises us to, “Remember that the stock market is a manic depressive.” In a recent CNBC interview, he said ""When valuations swing wildly, always focus on the underlying quality — opportunities abound in the chaos.""

Always stay rational.

Key Points

The cryptocurrency market temporarily got a boost following President Donald Trump's electoral win, as some investors hoped his lighter approach to crypto regulation and outright promotion of certain coins would lift many digital tokens higher.

But the threat of tariffs, fears of a potential recession, and increasing pessimism from some investors have caused many cryptos to fall over the past few months. While tech stocks have suffered the same fate, I think the long-term potential in tech stocks is higher and based on more concrete use cases.

Here are two tech stocks that could end up ahead of crypto's gains in the coming years.

Image source: Getty Images.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -6.37%) is the largest semiconductor manufacturing company in the world and has already benefited immensely from the surge of chip demand from artificial intelligence. In addition to its general chip manufacturing dominance, it also makes an estimated 90% of the world's AI processors.

The financial results from Taiwan Semiconductor's chip-manufacturing lead have been phenomenal. The company's sales spiked 37% in the fourth quarter (ended Dec. 31) to $26.9 billion and diluted earnings per share surged 57% to $2.24 per American depositary receipt.

There's been a lot of talk about AI stocks falling lately, but it's far too premature to call the artificial intelligence boom over. Tech companies large and small are investing heavily in AI software and services and that will spur sales of advanced semiconductors for years to come.

Taiwan Semiconductor certainly thinks so, with CEO C.C. Wei saying on the recent earnings call that, ""Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues.""

With Taiwan Semiconductor's stock down 15% after the recent tech sell-off, the company's shares are trading at a relative discount with a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.1, down from a P/E of 30 just six months ago.

Nvidia's (NVDA -6.73%) long-term potential is in the same vein as Taiwan Semiconductor's. While Nvidia doesn't manufacture semiconductors, its chip designs account for some of the most advanced AI processors on the market.

Tech companies have clamored to get their hands on Nvidia processors over the past few years, resulting in the company's accelerators accounting for up to 95% of all AI chips worldwide. The demand has boosted Nvidia's sales and earnings, including a 78% jump in sales in the fourth quarter to $39.3 billion and diluted EPS growth of 82% to $0.89.

But Nvidia isn't done benefiting from all of this AI demand. Management said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that demand for its Blackwell AI processors is ""the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale,"" achieving $11 billion in sales in one quarter alone.

There's increasing debate as to how fast data center spending will grow (or not) in the coming years. A significant slowdown from tech companies buying advanced processors would certainly hurt Nvidia's sales and earnings. But investors seem mostly worried about macroeconomic effects right now, like a recession, and are carrying over those concerns to the tech sector.

While an economic slowdown would have an impact on tech companies, focusing too much on that and forgetting that we're still at the beginning stages of AI is a mistake. PwC estimates AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global GDP in 2030, and tech companies will need increasingly advanced processors to achieve their AI goals.

That means Nvidia still has a massive opportunity in the coming years, even if a temporary economic slowdown materializes. It also means that current worries could be clouding investors' view of Nvidia's long-term potential.

I think there are some legitimate reasons for investors to own cryptocurrencies, but Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia offer investors a much more grounded investment as these two leading tech companies help build an AI future.

Nothing is guaranteed, of course. But while many cryptocurrencies are still very speculative, artificial intelligence is already well-established and technology companies will continue to build their companies around it for years to come.

Chris Neiger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imports from 50 countries, including the BRICS and the European Union. Also dubbed the ‘Declaration of Economic Independence', Trump's prolonged speech declaring reciprocal tariffs had no mention of Bitcoin, blockchain, or even digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) price, which saw a peak at $110,000 during the inauguration of Trump, fell by 1.41 per percent, at around $83,666, as per CoinGecko, a site that tracks the global cryptocurrency market in real time. 

On Wednesday, April 2, President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in what he termed his efforts to counter unfair trade practices. Trump's latest announcement has impacted several of the US's longstanding trading partners. Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and China faced the highest tariffs, while the European Union, the UK, and Japan also faced substantial tariffs. Trump has imposed a 27 per cent ‘discounted reciprocal tariff' on imports from India.

Interestingly, with zero mentions of crypto, the crypto market panicked within minutes from the announcement. Initially, BTC dipped from $88,000 to $85,000; this is a whopping $3,000 drop in just around 10 minutes. BTC later stabilised a bit at $84,800; however, Ethereum (ETH) slid to $1,845 as the overall crypto market took a nosedive.

Zack Burks, the chief executive of NFT company Mintology, told Forbes that Trump's ‘liberation day' speech is going to be an atomic bomb on the current markets, and crypto is not safe in the immediate term. Burks told the news outlet that it was becoming clearer that bitcoin is the retail investor's doomsday asset of choice, while gold is the institutional haven, specifically considering the soft power Trump holds on crypto assets. He was referring to the president's promise to create a US bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile as well as his growing crypto business interests.

In the last 24 hours, the price of BTC and the wider crypto market have been showing mixed signals. Trump's address touched upon inflation, energy, and reviving American manufacturing on the lines with his pledge to boost the economy. While earlier there were murmurs that he may address digital assets, Trump's omission of crypto comes at a time when his supporters and crypto advocates have been buoyed by his campaign promises to make the US a crypto capital. As of now, the crypto world is closely watching for more policy changes.

Despite a higher-than-expected announcement of reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump, domestic stock markets gave a muted response, with Sensex and Nifty ending marginally lower. The BSE's Sensex fell 0.42 per cent, or 322.08 points, to end at 76,295.36. The index opened 805.58 points down but recovered later in the day.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto World News

April 3, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Online gambling sits squarely amidst evolving tech innovations, and cryptocurrency's sudden surge catapults it upward. Crypto betting offers vastly improved security through advanced blockchain technology and enables players to engage with online casinos in a highly secure manner. Traditional online gambling often involves long processing times, bank restrictions, and high fees, but cryptocurrency eliminates many of these barriers. Increasingly, players are turning to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for betting purposes.

One of the biggest reasons crypto betting is gaining popularity is the innovation it brings to the gambling industry. Many modern platforms are integrating blockchain technology to ensure fair play, provable outcomes, and enhanced security. These features create a more transparent betting environment, making players feel more confident in their wagers. And if you want to see these innovations in action, read more about games that accept crypto. Cutting-edge platforms are offering decentralized betting experiences, smart contract-based wagers, and even NFT-based rewards, redefining how users interact with gambling sites.

Slow processing of deposits and withdrawals poses a major issue for users of old-school online betting platforms. Funds get transferred slowly over several days when bank payment providers are involved. Crypto betting pretty much solves this issue, with fast transactions happening almost instantly. Cryptocurrency facilitates transactions when placing bets or cashing out winnings quickly via digital platforms every time. Fees linked with crypto transactions are substantially lower than those of credit cards or e-wallets, so players retain more winnings.

Many players worry considerably about privacy being compromised while betting online. Old-school wagering platforms frequently demand sensitive info like financial data, which deeply deters people who prize secrecy. Crypto betting gets rid of such problems, allowing players to gamble sans sensitive info disclosure. Transactions on blockchain don't require verification, so users place bets pretty freely without necessarily linking their identities. Players in certain regions find this level of privacy super appealing because online gambling gets heavily restricted in some places.

Decentralized platforms radically alter crypto betting landscapes. Many crypto-based betting sites utilize blockchain technology to add transparency in a largely decentralized manner. Smart contracts automate bets instantly ensuring payouts are fair. Blockchain technology renders casinos powerless against outcome manipulation thus providing players a fairly transparent gaming environment. Rising trust levels considerably fuel crypto gambling's growing popularity globally now.

Cryptocurrency operates globally, so players worldwide can participate in crypto betting without worrying about regional restrictions. Regulatory hurdles frequently block users in specific nations from accessing conventional digital gaming sites. Crypto-based gambling sites operate outside traditional financial systems, allowing players from virtually everywhere to place bets without restriction. Global accessibility really makes crypto betting surprisingly more attractive.

Cryptocurrency adoption keeps growing in extreme ways, and online gambling's future has become increasingly innovative. Advancements in blockchain technology facilitate fair betting experiences through smart contracts and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. Mainstream adoption of crypto betting will skyrocket as regulations around cryptocurrency become exceedingly clearer, bringing crypto betting into mainstream gambling. Embracing crypto betting opens the door to novel online wagering experiences for seasoned bettors and newcomers alike.

Bitcoin blockchain's hashrate is surging, revealing a growing dislocation between the network activity and prices for its native token bitcoin (BTC). 

On a 14-day moving average, the hashrate, representing the computational power required to mine a block on the proof-of-work Bitcoin blockchain, recently reached an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s), and on a 24-hour time frame, it spiked to 974 EH/s, the second highest level ever, according to Glassnode data. 

Measuring over a 24-hour window can be misleading due to block time variability, so longer timeframes give more reliable insights. In two days, Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment — which recalibrates every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10-minute block interval — is expected to increase by over 3%, reaching a new peak.

This divergence between hash rate and price is notable. While bitcoin remains about 25% below its all-time high, mining costs continue to rise. For miners to stay profitable and cover operational expenses and capital expenditures, a strong bitcoin price, full blocks and high transaction fees are essential.

Currently, miners earn revenue through two channels: block rewards (3.125 BTC per block in the current epoch) and transaction fees. However, transaction fees are extremely low — averaging around 4 BTC per day, or roughly $377,634. As bitcoin's block subsidy continues to halve every four years, sustained or increasing transaction activity will be critical to maintaining mining incentives.

Developer Mononaut, from Mempool, recently noted that Foundry USA Pool mined the emptiest ""non-empty"" block in over two years, containing just seven transactions — a rarity only surpassed by a block with four transactions back in January 2023.

In other words, while the rising hashrate paints a picture of a booming network, the near-empty blocks make it the case of a powerful train speeding down the tracks but without passengers. 

That's a cause for concern for Nicolas Gregory, creator of the Mercury Layer and a former Nasdaq Board Director.

“Half-empty bitcoin blocks tell a tale — hawking the store-of-value line could scupper its future,"" Gregory said on X.

""I hope bitcoiners realize this space is more than just podcasts, spaces, and the ‘number go up' digital gold narrative. If we don't get people using bitcoin for real commerce, it's game over,"" Gregory added.

CORRECT (April 3, 11:30 UTC): Corrects headline to say bitcoin fell after the announcement; an earlier version of the story said it held steady.

By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Liberation Day is done, and markets finally have clarity on U.S. tariffs. Starting April 5, all U.S. trading partners will face a minimum of a 10% import tariff, with higher, country-specific tariffs kicking in on April 9 for about 60 countries.

President Donald Trump introduced the tariffs based on perceived trade imbalances and non-tariff barriers, saying the goal is to encourage reshoring of production, generate revenue to help fund tax cuts and level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers. 

Among the most affected countries is China, which faces a new 34% tariff on top the existing levy, bringing its total to 54%. Many other Asian economies have also been hit hard, while the European Union faces a 20% tariff.

There's been growing interest in how the U.S. determined the tariff rates, which the administration called reciprocal. One user on X claims to have cracked the formula: Take a country's trade deficit with the U.S. and divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. 

For example, Vietnam exports $136.6 billion to the U.S. and imports just $13.1 billion, resulting in a $123.5 billion trade deficit. When you divide the deficit by exports, you get about 90%, which aligns with the implied reciprocal tariff rate the U.S. has applied.

Global stocks are under pressure, with the Nikkei 225 losing 2.8% after dropping as much as 4.6% and the FTSE 100 losing more than 1%. Nasdaq futures are down over 3.5%. Vietnam led losses in Asia, falling 5.5% in its worst single-day drop for over four years.

The dollar weakened, too, with the yen rallying to 147 against the U.S. currency and the pound to 1.31. The dollar index (DXY) fell to 102.5. Bitcoin (BTC) remains firm above $83,000, though still below its 200-day moving average of $86,400 — a key level it needs to reclaim.

The all-important U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is hovering just above 4%, the lowest level since October, which is seen as a positive for the administration to get interest rates down. Stay alert!

It's a risk-off day in Asia as traders look to Beijing's response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs on China and other Asian nations.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs on imports from 180 nations, including trading partners identified as the worst offenders, such as China and the European Union.

The president imposed a new 34% tariff on goods from China in addition to the existing 20% tax, bringing the total levy to 54%, the highest for any nation. The action did not affect Canada and Mexico.

Observers say the ball is now in China's court, and the nature of its retaliation could determine the market reaction.

""Everything now depends on China. If China devalues the Yuan in response to today's large, additional US tariffs, that sets off a global risk-off that hits EMs first and then - if it persists - spills back to the US. China has so far kept a very low profile. That may now end,"" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said on X.

Early Thursday, China urged the U.S. to lift tariffs while vowing immediate retaliation. Meanwhile, the yuan weakened to a seven-week low of 7 against the dollar alongside losses in the Asian equities and an impending death cross in bitcoin (BTC).

Letting the yuan depreciate, which makes Chinese goods cheaper in international markets, is one way to counter the tariffs. That said, it could spell trouble for carry (currency) trades and scare financial markets, as observed in 2015 and 2018.

Besides, potential intervention by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to stall a rapid yuan decline can boost the dollar, inadvertently weighing on risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.

It's no coincidence that Asian equities traded in the red at press time, with Japan's Nikkei hitting an eight-month low. U.S. stock futures fell over 2%, pointing to risk-off mode.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $83,300, having dropped from $88,000 to $82,500 following Trump's tariffs announcement, according to CoinDesk market data. 

The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the cryptocurrency's spot price appears on track to cross below its 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as the ""death cross"" bearish technical pattern.

Though it has a mixed record of predicting price trends, the latest cross happening against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions warrants attention — more so, as options pricing now shows bias for puts, or downside protection, out to the June-end expiry, according to  Deribit and Amberdata.

Tariffs-led risk-off has payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP trading close to the support zone near $2, a crucial level for confirming a significant topping pattern and renewed downtrend.

We are referring to the head-and-shoulders pattern, comprising three peaks, with the middle being the highest. A horizontal line drawn from the base of the three peaks, the neckline, marks the key demand zone.

In XRP's case, the $1.90-$2 range has been that demand zone since January. So, a price move below the same would trigger the H&S breakdown, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

A potential breakdown could see prices nearly halve to $1.07, according to veteran analyst and trader Peter Brandt. Chart analysts identify targets using the measure move method, which involves determining the distance from the top of the head to the neckline and subtracting that distance from the breakdown point, in this case, $2.

On the higher side, $3, or the lower high created in early March, is the level to beat for the bulls.

 Leading AI chatbots ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok all return the same formula for reciprocal tariff calculations, several X users claim. 

Update (April 3, 10:50 am UTC): This article has been updated to correct the quote attributed to Wojtek Kopczuk

There's a crazy theory on social media that US President Donald Trump's newly announced reciprocal tariff plan — which hits all countries with a minimum 10% tariff — could have been designed by an artificial intelligence chatbot.

Only a short period after Trump announced the tariffs at the White House Rose Garden on April 2, some X users claim they were able to duplicate the same tariff plan with a rudimentary prompt using OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

“I was able to duplicate it in ChatGPT,” NFT collector DCinvestor told his 260,000 followers on X following the Donald Trump announcement of reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries on April 2. 

“It also told me that this idea hadn't been formalized anywhere before, and that it was something it came up with,” he added, referring to the chatbot's ability to calculate the tariff rates. “FFS. Trump admin is using ChatGPT to determine trade policy,” he added.

Of course, the similarities between the artificial intelligence-generated tariff plan and Trump's plan could also be simply coincidental.

DCInvestor's observation came in response to crypto trader Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie, who also asked ChatGPT using the prompt: “What would be an easy way to calculate the tariffs that should be imposed on other countries so that the US is on even playing fields when it comes to trade deficit. Set a minimum of 10%.”

Journal of Public Economics editor Wojtek Kopczuk also experimented with ChatGPT, which generated the same results. “Confirmed, chatgpt... exactly what the dumbest kid in the class would do, without edits,” he said. 

Author Krishnan Rohit postulated on X that this “might be the first large-scale application of AI technology to geopolitics.” ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok all give the same answer to the question on how to impose tariffs easily, he observed. 

Founder and CEO of supply chain logistics platform Flexport, Ryan Petersen, said his firm had reverse-engineered the formula the Trump administration used to generate the reciprocal tariffs. 

An editor at The Yale Review, James Surowiecki, said something similar, “they just took our [US] trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.”

Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which come into effect on April 5, have hit all countries with a 10%  levy, with some nations facing even larger rates, such as China with a 34% tariff, Japan with 24%, and the European Union with 20%. 

Crypto markets reacted particularly badly, plunging 5% after the announcement as Bitcoin (BTC) fell by $5,500 to $82,277 before recovering marginally, according to CoinGecko.

 Kaspersky researchers say they have found 2,600 confirmed infections through this scam in different countries, with the majority of users in Russia. 

Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says it has uncovered thousands of counterfeit Android smartphones sold online with preinstalled malware designed to steal crypto and other sensitive data. 

The Android devices are sold at reduced prices, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs said in an April 1 statement, but are riddled with a version of the Triada Trojan that infects every process and gives the attackers “almost unlimited control” over the device. 

Dmitry Kalinin, a cybersecurity expert at Kaspersky Labs, said that once the trojan grants the attackers access to devices, they can steal crypto by replacing wallet addresses. 

“The authors of the new version of Triada are actively monetizing their efforts; judging by the analysis of transactions, they were able to transfer about $270,000 in various cryptocurrencies to their crypto wallets,” he said. 

Among the trojan's other capabilities are stealing user account information and intercepting incoming and outgoing texts, including two-factor authentication. 

The trojan penetrates smartphone firmware even before the phone reaches users, and some online sellers might not even be aware of the ticking time bomb in the device, according to Kalinin.

“Probably, at one of the stages, the supply chain is compromised, so stores may not even suspect that they are selling smartphones with Triada,” he said. 

At this stage, Kaspersky researchers say they have found 2,600 confirmed infections through this scam in different countries, with the majority of users in Russia encountering it in the first three months of 2025.

The Triada malware first surfaced in 2016 and is known for targeting financial applications and messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook and Google Mail, according to cybersecurity firm Darktrace. It is generally delivered through malicious downloads and phishing campaigns. 

“The Triada Trojan has been known for a long time, and it still remains one of the most complex and dangerous threats to Android,” Kalinin said. 

The best way to avoid falling victim to this scam is to only purchase devices from legitimate distributors and install security solutions immediately after purchase, according to Kaspersky Labs. 

Other firms have also been raising the alarm over new forms of malware targeting crypto users.

Cybersecurity firm Threat Fabric said in a March 28 report it found a new family of malware that can launch a fake overlay to trick Android users into providing their crypto seed phrases as it takes over the device.

On March 18, tech giant Microsoft said it found a new remote access trojan (RAT) that targets crypto held in 20 wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser.

 Economic observers are concerned over Trump's tariff policy, which has markets worried about a possible recession. 

US President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on April 2, sending markets into a tailspin and dividing crypto observers as to their possible long-term effects. 

At a special event at the White House, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, leveling reciprocal tariffs at every country that has a tariff on US goods, starting at a 10% minimum.

The long-term effect that this swathe of new taxes could have on global markets is unknown. The uncertainty is compounded by the ambiguous methodology the Trump administration used to determine the tariff rates. 

Some believe that the crypto market is due for a boom as investors seek an alternative for traditional investments. Others note the effect tariffs could have on mining equipment, hampering profitability. More still are concerned about the broader impact of tariffs and a possible recession. 

Financial markets crashed immediately on the news of the tariffs, with crypto markets no exception. 

Bitcoin (BTC) had nearly reached a session high at $88,500 but dropped 2.6% back to around $83,000. Ether (ETH) fell from $1,934 to $1,797 immediately following the tariff announcement, and the total crypto market capitalization dropped 5.3% to $2.7 trillion.

Some market analysts aren't shaken. Trader Michaël van de Poppe wrote that the tariffs “won't be as bad as the entire population expects them to be.”

“Uncertainty fades away. Gold will drop. ‘Buy the rumor, sell the news,'” he said. “Altcoins & Bitcoin goes up. ‘Sell the rumor, buy the news.'”

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said that while the tariffs may reduce the trade deficit, fewer exports could limit the demand for US Treasurys, requiring domestic intervention from the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market. 

“The Fed and banking system must step up to ensure a well-functioning treasury [market], which means Brrrr,” he said.

“Brrrr” — a reference to the Reserve printing more money — is a theory Hayes has previously suggested could be positive for Bitcoin's price as increased liquidity enters the market.

American crypto miners may have less cause for optimism about the tariffs, as they are directly affected by the markups on goods — namely crypto mining rigs — imported from Asia.

Mitchell Askew, head analyst at mining-as-a-service firm Blockware Solutions, said: “Tariffs have MASSIVE implications for Bitcoin Miners. [Expect] off-shore supply to get squeezed, increasing demand for on-shore miners. If this is coupled with a BTC run we could see ASIC [mining rig] prices rip 5 to 10x like they did in 2021.”

Mason Jappa, CEO of Blockware, said that the tariffs will have “a major impact” on the Bitcoin mining industry. “Most of the current Bitcoin Mining Server imports were coming from Malaysia/Thailand/Indonesia. Rigs already landed in the USA will become more valuable,” he wrote.

Some mining companies are already rushing to get mining rigs out of the export country before the tariffs take effect. Lauren Lin, head of hardware at Bitcoin mining software firm Luxor Technology, told Bloomberg on April 3 that her firm was “scrambling.” 

“Ideally, we can charter a flight and get machines over — just trying to be as creative as possible to get these machines out,” she said.

The convenient tariff percentage charts displayed at the signing event at the White House left many questioning exactly how the Trump administration came up with the numbers and why certain countries were chosen. 

Yale Review editor James Surowiecki wrote that the administration didn't actually calculate tariff rates plus non-tariff barriers to determine their rates, but rather “just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.” 

Some have even floated the theory that the administration used ChatGPT to come up with the countries and numbers. NFT collector DCinvestor said that he was able to nearly exactly duplicate the list through prompts on the generative AI. 

“I was able to duplicate it in ChatGPT. it also told me that this idea hadn't been formalized anywhere before, and that it was something it came up with. ffs Trump admin is using ChatGPT to determine trade policy,” he said. 

Also of note: some of the smaller countries and territories on the White House's list. The full list, as reported by Forbes, levies a 10% tariff on the Heard and McDonald Islands in response to their 10% duties on the United States. 

The Heard and McDonald Islands are uninhabited, barren and some of the most remote places on earth, located 1,600 km from Antarctica. No one lives there; no trade exists.

The dubious maths and contents of the tariff list have many doubting the administration's economic calculus. 

Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory giant deVere Group, told Cointelegraph that the president “peddles in economic delusion.”

“It's a seismic day for global trade. Trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the US and the world more prosperous, and he's doing it with reckless confidence,” he said.

Adam Cochrane, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, said that tariffs “work great for most of those things” when they target industries that also have present-day production to offset the increased cost of imported goods.  

“The US doesn't have that, nor the factories for it, not the labor to offset it, nor the raw materials for it. So you end up just paying more for the same good.”

At the end of March, Goldman Sachs had already tipped the chance of a recession in the US at 35%. After Trump signed the order, betting markets on Kalshi increased that to over 50%.

Trump, for his part, contended that the tariffs will “make America great again” and give the US economy a competitive edge with its former allies and trade partners. He argued in his signing speech that the Great Depression of the 1930s would have never happened if tariffs had been maintained. 

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs during the Depression, is widely credited as being a contributing factor to worsening the Depression and has become synonymous with disastrous economic policymaking.

 CEX listings had an average return of over 80% during the past 180 days, outperforming the NYSE and Nasdaq's average IPO returns. 

Cryptocurrency listings have outperformed the average of traditional stock listings, despite recent community criticism regarding the manipulation potential of token listings on centralized exchanges.

Token listing procedures on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) drew significant controversy after Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of Binance, called the process flawed after disappointing performances of some token listings.

Despite the criticism, crypto exchanges have outperformed traditional stock exchanges in terms of listings with positive returns on investment (ROI) and average ROI, according to an April 3 CoinMarketCap report shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.

Over the past 180 days, crypto exchange listings had an average return of over 80%, outperforming the largest traditional stock indexes such as the Nasdaq and Dow Jones, as well as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

The 80% return refers to the average performance of all listed tokens by the seven major exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Bitget, Gate and KuCoin.

Moreover, 68% of crypto exchange listings boasted a positive ROI, outperforming the New York Stock Exchange's (NYSE) 54% and the Nasdaq's 51%.

“This data suggests that crypto exchanges have made progress in refining their listing,” the report said.

Cryptocurrencies listed on CEXs generally see high demand from investors as the exchanges provide significant new liquidity that can boost the coins' price performances after listing.

Token-listing criteria on CEXs started garnering attention in November 2024, after Tron founder Justin Sun claimed that Coinbase allegedly asked for $330 million in total fees to list Tron (TRX), a surprising allegation since Coinbase claims to charge no fees for listing new cryptocurrencies.

Recent investor disappointment with some token listings may stem from historic profit expectations due to the significant upside of numerous CEX-listed tokens.

Still, the returns of a cryptocurrency after listing depend on the wider market appetite, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Crypto investors' expectations for new listings to perform well are understandable and often shaped by the historic success” of CEX listings, added the spokesperson.

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, listed 77 cryptocurrencies throughout 2023 and 2024, with a 0% delisting rate.

Binance announced a community voting mechanism for token listings on March 9, to make the listing process more decentralized.

 The Bitcoin Development Mailing List on Google Groups was banned for several hours, and one moderator thinks it may have been an intentional attack. 

One of Bitcoin's key communication tools used to discuss potential protocol changes was knocked out for several hours starting on April 2, with one moderator speculating it may have been a targeted attack assisted by bots. 

For several hours across April 2 and 3, Bitcoin core developers and researchers were unable to interact on Google Groups after Google banned the group for spam. 

“Bitcoin Development Mailing List has been identified as containing spam, malware, or other malicious content,” Google's warning stated at the time.

Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told Cointelegraph that the ban may have been triggered by individuals or bots mass-reporting the Bitcoin mailing list from multiple accounts.

It's a common tactic by attackers looking to ban or censor a community, Bishop said, noting that similar incidents occur on YouTube, X and TikTok fairly often.

Google Workspace Support's X account confirmed that the issue had been resolved on April 3 at 2:23 am UTC in response to one of the Bitcoin mailing list's other moderators, Ruben Somsen.

Bitcoin advocate and head of Block Inc, Jack Dorsey, also called attention to the ban, urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to investigate the issue.

The Bitcoin mailing list is used by Bitcoin core developers and researchers to discuss potential protocol changes to Bitcoin, which secures more than $1.6 trillion worth of value for network users around the world.

It has become one of the main Bitcoin mailing lists since the network's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared Bitcoin's white paper on the Cryptography Mailing List on Oct. 31, 2008.

Despite the incident, Bishop said the Bitcoin mailing list moderators have no intention of moving away from communicating via email:

 Bitcoin may see a ""sizeable bounce"" at $71,000 if US trade tariffs result in further BTC price pressure, new analysis predicts. 

Bitcoin (BTC) faces “very high risk” conditions from US trade tariffs, which could spark a slump to $71,000.

In his latest analysis, Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, warned about the impact of “higher than expected” US trade tariffs.

Bitcoin reacted noticeably worse than US stocks after President Donald Trump announced worldwide reciprocal trade tariffs on April 2.

BTC/USD fell up to 8.5% on the day, while the S&P 500 managed to end the Wall Street trading session 0.7% higher.

Edwards said that US business expectations are reflecting the type of uncertainty seen only three times since the turn of the millennium.

“Consider this as tariffs come in higher than expected. The Philly Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022,” he told X followers.

An accompanying chart showed the Philadelphia Fed's Business Outlook Survey (BOS) back under 15 for the first time since the start of 2024. Late 2022 was the pit of the most recent crypto bear market when BTC/USD reversed at $15,600.

In Capriole's latest market update on March 31, Edwards acknowledged that BOS data can produce unreliable signals regarding market sentiment but argued that it should not be ignored.

“While no guarantee of the future outlook (this metric does have false signals) this is a data reading we have had before at very high risk zones (year 2000, 2008 and 2022), telling us to keep a very open mind,” he wrote, adding: 

For Bitcoin, a key level to watch in the tariff aftermath is $91,000, with Capriole suggesting that US macroeconomic moves would “decide the ultimate technical trend from here.”

“All else equal, a daily close above $91K would be a strong bullish reclaim signal,” the update explained alongside the weekly BTC/USD chart.

As Cointelegraph reported, a silver lining for crypto and risk assets could come in the form of increasing global liquidity.

In the US, the Fed has already begun to loosen tight financial policy, with bets on a return to so-called quantitative easing (QE) varying.

“How long until the Powell printer starts humming?” Edwards queried.

M2 money supply, meanwhile, is due for an “influx,” something which has historically spawned major BTC price upside.

“The BIG takeaway (the most important observation) is that a big M2 influx is coming. The exact date is less important,” analyst Colin Talks Crypto predicted in an X thread this week.

Why Some People Follow Authoritarian Leaders—And The Key to Stopping It

To protect democracy and counteract the allure of authoritarianism, reduce people's sense of fear and insecurity, psychology research says

By Danny Osborne 

Nikita John Creagh/Getty Images

The reelection of Donald Trump, perhaps more than any other event in modern history, has thrust authoritarianism into the spotlight. From media pundits to conversations held in coffee shops, people are talking about authoritarian leaders. And for good reasons. President Trump and his warning of being a dictator “on day one,” coupled with his attempts to consolidate power, eliminate government oversight and silence his opposition, poses a grave threat to our democratic institutions.

Without downplaying the dangers of authoritarian leaders, studies from my research group and other labs from across the globe identify an equally serious threat to democracy: “authoritarian followers” who instinctively comply with a dictator. We need to understand this personality type so that we can find ways to encourage authoritarian followers to support democracy instead.

For over 80 years, political psychologists like me have studied the authoritarian personality—a collection of attitudes and behaviors that increase a person's susceptibility to authoritarian leaders. We have found that authoritarian followers share three tendencies: they obey authority figures from their in-group (called authoritarian submission); they punish rule breakers (authoritarian aggression); and they rigidly endorse long-held traditions (conventionalism).

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Work from my lab and others reveals that authoritarian followers express a range of anti-democratic attitudes including anti-gay prejudice, anti-immigrant attitudes, generalized prejudice, nationalism and even the belief in conspiracies. Although peer-reviewed work on 2024 Trump voters awaits, authoritarian followers were more likely to vote for Trump than for either Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden in the previous two elections. Thus authoritarian followers are a powerful force within the MAGA movement.

Why do people become authoritarian followers? Some research indicates that authoritarianism is heritable. For example, the correlation between twins' authoritarianism is over five times stronger among monozygotic twins, whose genetic makeup is almost identical, relative to dizygotic twins, who share roughly half their genes. This strong genetic component to becoming an authoritarian follower does not, however, mean we are destined to obey dictators. Authoritarianism is also fostered by some of the personality traits captured by the so-called Big Five: openness to experience, conscientiousness (a preference for order and the tendency to follow norms), extraversion, agreeableness (the willingness to cooperate and empathize with others) and neuroticism (the tendency to feel anxious and insecure).

Crucially, the social, economic and physical environment also matter. Low levels of openness to experience and high levels of conscientiousness, coupled with an insecure and threatening environment, lead people to chronically view the world as a dangerous and threatening place. When we think that the world is unstable and unsafe, we search for ways to regain control. Unfortunately for our democratic institutions, placing trust in a dictator and becoming an authoritarian follower is one way to reestablish a sense of control.

Far-right politics seem to appeal to authoritarian followers' desire to regain stability and extinguish perceived threats. For instance, fear and distrust of immigrants has been a core issue driving the recent return of far-right extremism. Movements including Brexit, the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Marine Le Pen's successes in France, and Donald Trump's return to power in 2024 all gained momentum by stoking voters' fears that our way of life is under threat. Attacks against transgender rights and DEI initiatives are similarly rooted in perceived threats to traditional values.

What can people do to address the recent global surge of authoritarian leaders and followers? As an educator, my first instinct is to argue that we need to increase people's political knowledge to instill democratic values of tolerance, pluralism and adherence to the rule of law. Yet this approach could backfire. Research on this topic shows that increases in education and political knowledge may make authoritarian followers more, not less, likely to express anti-democratic attitudes. For example, a study in the U.S. found that the relationship between authoritarianism and two core features of conservatism are stronger among those who are knowledgeable about politics.

Alternatively, pro-democracy advocates could employ “jiujitsu” persuasion to target the motivations underlying anti-democratic beliefs. For example, because authoritarianism arises from the need to mitigate perceived threats in the environment, we can expose people to safer ones. Indeed a newly published study by my colleagues and me shows that the diversity of one's neighborhood correlates negatively with authoritarianism. Multicultural neighborhoods likely provide people with the chance to form close friendships with others from diverse backgrounds. In turn these experiences dispel worries that immigrants threaten deeply held cultural values or will take their jobs.

Other work suggests that we can harness authoritarian followers' impulse to submit to authority figures and conform to group norms for the social good. For example, research from Singapore—where authorities endorse multiculturalism—shows that authoritarian followers support cultural diversity. Other work from Poland indicates that authoritarian followers support prohibiting hate speech against minority groups including members of the LGBTQ community, Muslims and people of African descent, because this hostile rhetoric violates social norms. These studies show that, under some limited conditions, leaders can harness authoritarian followers' destructive impulses for the social good.

Although Trump's return to power has reignited popular interest in authoritarianism, social scientists have long wrestled with its origins. Their insights can help us predict what the next four years will look like, as well as identify ways to address the challenges that are likely to come. Democracy rarely falls at the hands of a single individual. Rather it dies through the complacency and obedience of otherwise well-intentioned authoritarian followers. We must help them follow their better angels. As the historian Timothy Snyder has warned, “Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given.”

Yet another reason to love the Bengal cat breed.

Having been domesticated 30,000 years ago, dog breeds display a remarkable amount of genetic diversity—after all, Great Danes and chihuahuas are somehow the same species. Cats, on the other hand, all look relatively similar to their wild ancestors (long hair and smooshed noses, aside). But while many cat breeds look similar to one another in both size and overall coloring, some breeds hide absolutely fascinating genetic secrets. And one of the most sought-after cats—the Bengal cat—may hide one of the most dazzling secrets of all. 

Although their leopard-esque coats hint at an ancient ancestry, Bengal cats are genetic newcomers. Created by a California cat breeder in 1963, the Bengal is a cross-breed between the domestic cat (Felis catus) and the Asian leopard (Prionailurus bengalensis). Although the Asian leopard looks remarkably similar to your average feline, the two species' common ancestor lived some six million years ago—that's more genetic distance than humans and chimpanzees (don't Google “humanzee”). After two decades, the The International Cat Association (TICA) officially recognized the breed in 1986. 

However, after cross-breeding Bengals, a peculiar trait began to emerge—some of their coats sparkled like glitter (which you can see up-close here). To dig into exactly why this special shine showed up, scientists from the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology studied 3,000 DNA samples from Bengal cats and determined that this derived from an alteration of the Fgfr2 (Fibroblast growth receptor 2) gene. Contrary to what you might expect, this trait doesn't come from the wild Asian leopard, but is instead a very rare condition in domestic cats. They published their work last year in the journal Current Biology. 

“Fgfr2 is a gene found in all mammals that is important for embryonic development and organogenesis,” geneticist Kelly McGowan, a co-author of the study, said in a press release in 2024. “Our results show that while a complete loss of Fgfr2 is lethal, a moderate reduction causes a desirable trait to manifest mainly in the hair.”

This trait isn't present in all bengal cats. According to the pet DNA site Wisdom Panel, of the millions of cats in its database, only 5,513 carry this altered ‘glitter' gene. But, as McGowan and her team explain in their research, the gene is present in around 60 percent of the Bengal population. 

And this isn't the only trait that sets Bengals apart from other cats. For one, bengals tend to be much more active than other types of cats. They also tend to eschew the typical feline aquaphobic stereotype and instead love to play with water, similar to other savannah cats and hybrid breeds. 

Of course, with Bengal breeds runnings thousands of dollars, the Bengal breeding industry can be ripe for abuse, and because of their more wild origins, some experts believe keeping Bengals as pets isn't such a good idea due to their increased need for stimulation (compared to domestic cats). In New York City, for example, a Bengal cat needs to be six generations removed from its wild ancestor to be a legal pet. 

Bengal cats may be incredible creatures with glittering coats, but the jury's out if they're really suitable companions for a human's more sedentary, indoor lifestyle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Retinal therapy may restore lost vision","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250402123041.htm","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:17:08 GMT","

Vision is one of the most crucial human senses, yet over 300 million people worldwide are at risk of vision loss due to various retinal diseases. While recent advancements in retinal disease treatments have successfully slowed disease progression, no effective therapy has been developed to restore already lost vision -- until now. KAIST researchers have successfully developed a novel drug to restore vision.

KAIST (represented by President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 30th of March that a research team led by Professor Jin Woo Kim from the Department of Biological Sciences has developed a treatment method that restores vision through retinal nerve regeneration.

The research team successfully induced retinal regeneration and vision recovery in a disease-model mouse by administering a compound that blocks the PROX1 (prospero homeobox 1) protein, which suppresses retinal regeneration. Furthermore, the effect lasted for more than six months.

This study marks the first successful induction of long-term neural regeneration in mammalian retinas, offering new hope to patients with degenerative retinal diseases who previously had no treatment options.

As the global population continues to age, the number of retinal disease patients is steadily increasing. However, no treatments exist to restore damaged retinas and vision. The primary reason for this is the mammalian retina's inability to regenerate once damaged.

Studies on cold-blooded animals, such as fish -- known for their robust retinal regeneration -- have shown that retinal injuries trigger Müller glia cells to dedifferentiate into retinal progenitor cells, which then generate new neurons. However, in mammals, this process is impaired, leading to permanent retinal damage.

Through this study, the research team identified the PROX1 protein as a key inhibitor of Müller glia dedifferentiation in mammals. PROX1 is a protein found in neurons of the retina, hippocampus, and spinal cord, where it suppresses neural stem cell proliferation and promotes differentiation into neurons.

The researchers discovered that PROX1 accumulates in damaged mouse retinal Müller glia, but is absent in the highly regenerative Müller glia of fish. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the PROX1 found in Müller glia is not synthesized internally but rather taken up from surrounding neurons, which fail to degrade and instead secrete the protein.

Based on this finding, the team developed a method to restore Müller glia's regenerative ability by eliminating extracellular PROX1 before it reaches these cells.

This approach involves using an antibody that binds to PROX1, developed by Celliaz Inc., a biotech startup founded by Professor Jin Woo Kim's research lab. When administered to disease-model mouse retinas, this antibody significantly promoted neural regeneration. Additionally, when delivered, the antibody gene to the retinas of retinitis pigmentosa disease model mice, it enabled sustained retinal regeneration and vision restoration for over six months.

The retinal regeneration-inducing therapy is currently being developed by Celliaz Inc. for application in various degenerative retinal diseases that currently lack effective treatments. The company aims to begin clinical trials by 2028.

Dr. Eun Jung Lee stated, ""We are about completing the optimization of the PROX1-neutralizing antibody (CLZ001) and move to preclinical studies before administering it to retinal disease patients. Our goal is to provide a solution for patients at risk of blindness who currently lack proper treatment options.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Study finds nearly five-fold increase in hospitalizations for common cause of stroke","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250402160651.htm","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:28:41 GMT","

Cervical artery dissection is a tear in an artery in the neck that provides blood flow to the brain. Such a tear can result in blood clots that cause stroke. A new study has found almost a five-fold increase in the number of U.S. hospitalizations for cervical artery dissection over a 15-year period. The study is published on April 2, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

A dissection in the artery wall is most often caused by trauma due to motor vehicle accidents but can also occur with smaller injuries. Heavy lifting has also been shown to cause dissection in some people.

""Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, especially in people under 50, so it is crucial to detect it right away,"" said Shadi Yaghi, MD, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. ""Strokes that are not fatal can lead to long-term disability, poor mental health and reduced quality of life. Our research found a dramatic increase in the number of hospitalizations for cervical artery dissection with rates rising steadily year over year.""

For the study, researchers reviewed 15 years of U.S. health data to identify 125,102 people hospitalized for cervical artery dissection. Participants had an average age of 51, and just over half had a stroke at the same time as dissection. Of all participants, 65% were white, 10% were Black, 8% were Hispanic, 3% were Asian or Pacific Islander, and 14% were of other racial groups.

Researchers compared the number of hospitalizations to U.S. Census data to determine the annual rate of cervical artery dissections. They then calculated the average annual percentage change in those rates.

Researchers found the number of dissections increased from 11 cases per one million people in 2005 to 46 cases per one million people in 2019, with an average annual increase of 10%. Results were similar for both female and male participants.

The average annual increase for Hispanic participants was 16%, for Black participants it was 13%, Asian participants, 12% and white participants, 8%.

Researchers also found a greater average annual increase among people 65 and older at 12% compared to 8% for people under 65.

""Possible reasons for this nearly five-fold increase over 15 years include greater awareness of cervical artery dissection by health care professionals, better access to imaging to help identify it and an overall increase in this condition for which a cause has yet to be determined,"" said Yaghi. ""Given the rising incidence of cervical artery dissection, our study underscores the importance of finding prevention strategies as well as new treatments to reduce the risk of stroke.""

A limitation of the study was that the hospital admission data does not include undiagnosed or untreated cases, so the number of cases may be even higher.

Metrics details

Moiré photonic structures permit the engineering of optical band structures and light–matter interactions, offering new opportunities in photonics and optoelectronics, paving the way for new nanophotonic applications such as ultra-low threshold lasing, and versatile nonlinear and quantum light sources; however, the lack of in situ tunability has limited the potential of these structures until now. For example, the lack of control of the twist angle is an obstacle to high-resolution material spectroscopy and the development of new applications that require moiré optical properties. Here we present a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-integrated twisted moiré photonic crystal sensor with a tunable interlayer distance and twist angle. The MEMS actuators modulate the wavelength and polarization resonances of the photonic crystal sensor via a twist- and gap-tuned moiré scattering effect. Using a reconstruction algorithm, this chip-based sensor can be used to simultaneously resolve the spectrum and polarization state of a wide-band signal in the telecommunications range and the full Poincaré sphere. We also demonstrate hyperspectral and hyperpolarimetric imaging using this single sensor. Our research illustrates some of the remarkable applications of multidimensional control of degrees of freedom in twisted moiré photonic platforms and establishes a scalable pathway towards creating comprehensive flat-optics devices suitable for versatile light manipulation and information processing.

Metrics details

Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression mapping within tissues but is often limited by imaging constraints. We present an imaging-free approach that reconstructs spatial barcode locations using molecular diffusion and dimensionality reduction. Validated against ground truth imaging, our method achieves high fidelity and scales to centimeter-sized tissues. This approach enhances spatial transcriptomics' accessibility and throughput, enabling large-scale studies without specialized imaging equipment.

Metrics details

African heritage diets are increasingly being replaced by Western-style dietary patterns because of urbanization, economic development, increased access to processed foods, globalization and changing social norms. The health consequences of this nutrition transition are not well understood. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania to investigate the immune and metabolic effects of switching between Kilimanjaro heritage-style and Western-style diets for 2 weeks and consuming a traditional fermented banana beverage (‘Mbege') for 1 week. Seventy-seven young and healthy volunteers assigned male at birth, some living in urban areas and some living in rural areas, were recruited in the trial. Primary outcomes were changes in the immune and metabolic profile before and after the intervention and at the 4-week follow-up. The switch from heritage-style to Western-style diet affected different metabolic pathways associated with noncommunicable diseases and promoted a pro-inflammatory state with impaired whole-blood cytokine responses to microbial stimulation. In contrast, the switch from Western-style to heritage-style diet or consuming the fermented beverage had a largely anti-inflammatory effect. Some of the observed changes in the immune and metabolic profiles persisted at the follow-up, suggesting a sustained impact from the short-term intervention. These findings show the metabolic and immune effects of dietary transitions and the consumption of fermented beverages, underscoring the importance of preserving indigenous dietary practices to mitigate noncommunicable disease risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa. ISRCTN trial registration: ISRCTN15619939.

Sub-Saharan Africa faces a surge in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic inflammatory conditions1, straining health systems. Urban adult mortality rates now exceed rural rates2, largely because of lifestyle changes, including the adoption of calorie-dense Western diets (WDs). Africa has a rich diversity of heritage diets, often rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains and fermented products. Plant-based diets and fermented foods are increasingly recognized for their beneficial immune and metabolic effects3,4,5. In contrast, Western-style diets, high in calorie-dense and processed foods, drive metabolic dysfunction, systemic inflammation and long-term immune cell reprogramming, a phenomenon called ‘maladaptive trained immunity'6,7, which are key drivers of NCDs8.

African populations are severely underrepresented in nutritional and immunological research, with limited data available on the immune and metabolic impact of African heritage diets (AHDs) compared to well-studied diets such as the Mediterranean or Japanese diet. In a previous cross-sectional study of healthy Tanzanian individuals from the Kilimanjaro region, we found that dietary patterns were associated with cytokine responses, plasma proteome and coagulation markers9,10,11. Urban residents, with greater exposure to WD environments, exhibited a stronger pro-inflammatory profile than those living in rural areas. Most rural dwellers in the study were from the Chagga tribe, whose heritage diet is predominantly plant-based, rich in fiber and polyphenols, and includes ‘Mbege', a fermented banana beverage made with finger millet12. Fermented foods, rich in bioactive microbes, have garnered renewed interest for their health benefits, yet they are becoming increasingly scarce in modern diets because of industrial food processing13,14.

Cross-sectional observational studies are limited in establishing causal relationships and controlling confounders. Therefore, we performed an open-label, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the short-term and long-term immunometabolic effects of a short dietary intervention in young Tanzanian men from rural and urban backgrounds. The study investigated the effects of switching from a Western-style diet to a Kilimanjaro heritage diet and vice versa, and the effects of consuming the fermented beverage ‘Mbege'. Changes in circulating leukocyte profiles, the inflammatory and cardiometabolic proteome, whole-blood cytokine responses and transcriptome, and plasma metabolome were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention and 4 weeks later.

Seventy-seven healthy adult men (median age = 25.6 years; interquartile range (IQR) = 21–27.2) participated in an open-label, short dietary intervention with 4-week follow-up to assess its longer-term immunometabolic effects. Participants were recruited from 22 April 2021 to 3 July 2021 with the final sampling on 9 August 2021. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. Participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 18–25.9 were eligible for inclusion; however, four participants with a BMI > 26 were inadvertently included. Dietary habits were assessed using three nonconsecutive 24-h recalls, including a festival or weekend day, and are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

The trial, depicted in Fig. 1a, consisted of three arms: (1) men living in rural areas (n = 23) who habitually consumed a Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet and switched to a Western-style diet for 2 weeks; (2) men living in urban areas (n = 22) who habitually consumed a Western-style diet and switched to a heritage-style diet for 2 weeks; and (3) men who habitually consumed a Western-style diet (n = 22) and who consumed Mbege, a traditional fermented banana beverage, for 1 week. Five participants who maintained their habitual diets were included in the first two arms as controls to assess diet-independent effects (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Blood samples were collected at three time points: baseline; after the intervention (immediately after the 2-week dietary intervention or 1-week fermented beverage intervention); and at the follow-up (4 weeks after the intervention).

a, The study was conducted at the Moshi district, Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. The illustration describes the dietary interventions carried out in this study. After one participant withdrew from the study before the end of the intervention, the first group included young rural-living men (n = 22) who entered the intervention, whose habitual diet mainly consisted of a Kilimanjaro AHD and who changed for 2 weeks to a WD (top). The second group consisted of urban-living young men (n = 22) whose habitual diet mainly consisted of a WD, and who were switched for 2 weeks to a plant-based, fiber-rich heritage-style diet (middle). In both groups, five controls who remained on their habitual diet were also enrolled. The third group consisted of young men (n = 22) whose diet remained unchanged from their habitual WD, but who were supplemented with consumption of a locally brewed fermented banana beverage (Mbege), approximately 1 l per day for 1 week. Below each group, the number of participants sampled at each of the time points (baseline, t0; after the intervention, t1; and at the follow-up, t2), are presented in green, orange and purple filled squares, respectively. b, In all study arms, samples for hemocytometry, whole-blood cytokine responses and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), as well as plasma proteome and metabolome, were collected at three time points: baseline (t0); on completion of the intervention (after the intervention) (t1) (at week 2 for the dietary intervention and week 1 for the banana beverage intervention); and 4 weeks after completion of the intervention (t2) (‘follow-up'). c, Images of example foods and the fermented beverage provided in the study arms. Schematic in a created using BioRender.com.

In the group of participants switching from AHD to WD, one participant withdrew before the start of the intervention and was excluded from the analyses, while two participants in this arm and one control lacked follow-up samples (CONSORT diagram in Extended Data Fig. 1). Outcomes were assessed based on sample availability and quality control (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 4), and were adjusted according to age, BMI and activity level (Supplementary Table 5).

Meals were provided three times daily in the Uru Shimbwe Juu village (AHD to WD switch) or Moshi town (WD to AHD switch). Examples and a detailed description of switched diets are shown in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Table 2. Weight monitoring showed a notable increase in the group who switched to a WD (median = 2.6 kg, IQR = 2.0–3.4 kg, P < 0.001; Mann–Whitney U-test).

To assess the impact of the intervention on the variance in plasma proteome, cytokine production, plasma metabolome and whole-blood transcriptome, which are primary outcomes of the trial, we conducted variance partition analysis, using the intervention time points as the primary variable, with age, BMI and physical activity as covariates, and participant ID as a random effect (Extended Data Fig. 2). Each intervention induced distinct immune and metabolic adaptations both in the short (after the intervention versus baseline) and long (follow-up versus baseline) term. Switching from an AHD to a WD accounted for over 5% of variance in plasma proteome (25.9%), cytokine production (40%), plasma metabolome (41.3%) and whole-blood transcriptome (19.1%) features, respectively. These effects largely persisted at the follow-up except for plasma proteome variance, which reduced to 9.9%. Conversely, switching from a WD to an AHD mainly influenced plasma proteome and metabolome, explaining over 5% of variance in 27% and 42% of features, respectively. Fermented beverage consumption explained over 5% of variance in plasma proteome (21%), cytokine production (23.3%), plasma metabolome (35.6%) and whole-blood transcriptome (14.5%) features, with sustained variation primarily in cytokine production and whole-blood transcriptome.

Next, we analyzed changes in circulating proteins related to inflammation and metabolism, a prespecified primary outcome, using the 92-plex Olink inflammatory and cardiometabolic panels (proximity extension assays, Olink Proteomics AB)15. Relative protein concentrations were analyzed for 162 proteins (89 cardiometabolic, 73 inflammatory; Supplementary Table 6) after excluding proteins with values below the detection limits in more than 25% of samples. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified using a linear mixed model (LMM) analysis and annotated to biological processes according to the Human Protein Atlas (v.23.0). Analysis focused on proteins that the time point variable explained over 5% of the variance (Methods and Supplementary Table 6).

Principal component analysis (PCA) of participant-corrected values revealed distinct shifts, which were more pronounced in participants switching from a WD to an AHD (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Participants switching from an AHD to a WD exhibited a significant increase in 26 proteins (19 cardiometabolic and seven inflammation panel) and a decrease in one protein after the intervention compared to baseline (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 7). Among the most upregulated proteins were CNDP1, THBS4 (implicated in atherogenesis16), ANGPTL3 and TWEAK (Fig. 2a,b). Key biological processes linked to DAPs included ‘cell adhesion' (for example, THBS2, NID1, CDH1), ‘hydrolase activity' (for example, CNDP1, PAM), ‘apoptosis' (for example, TWEAK, TRAIL, TGFB1) and ‘protease activity' (for example, ANGPTL3, uPA, F7) (Extended Data Fig. 3b), suggesting early pathological adaptations to a WD, characterized by systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

Targeted plasma proteomics was conducted using the inflammatory and cardiometabolic Olink panel. Plasma CRP concentrations were measured using ELISA. Samples were obtained at baseline (t0), after the intervention (t1, week 2 for the dietary intervention and 1 week for the fermented beverage intervention) and 4 weeks later (t2, follow-up). Statistical analysis was carried out for participants who completed the full study, that is n = 20, 22 and 22 in the WD, AHD and fermented beverage intervention groups, respectively. Statistical analysis was carried out using an LMM for each comparison with a two-sided hypothesis test. Fixed effects included time point, baseline BMI, age and physical activity level; participant ID was included as a random effect. a, Triangle plots present DAPs in the (I) WD, (II) AHD and (III) fermented beverage intervention groups. The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates the direction of change, comparing late versus early time points in each comparison as listed at the bottom of the plot, with the color fill depicting the log2 paired fold change value for each comparison. b–e, Combined box and line plots with the group trend line indicating the levels of measured parameters at the three time points. Lines are grouped per participant. Protein concentrations are presented as Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values for Olink measures (switch to WD (b), switch to AHD (c) and fermented beverage (d)) or log2-transformed CRP levels (mg ml−1, e). In all box plots, the line defines the median level, the hinges depict the 25th and 75th centiles and the whiskers extend to ±1.5 times the IQR. The asterisks indicate the significance level based on Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P values (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001).

In contrast, participants switching from a WD to an AHD exhibited a significant reduction in 28 proteins (22 inflammation, 6 cardiometabolic) and an increase in 6 proteins after the intervention compared to baseline (Fig. 2a,c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7). These DAPs were linked to ‘cytokines,' ‘inflammatory response,' ‘chemotaxis' and ‘host–virus interactions' (Extended Data Fig. 3b). At the follow-up, the changes had partially reversed; however, several proteins, including chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL4, CCL5, MCP2, MCP4), cytokines (IL-6, OSM, IL-17C, TNFSF14) and others (CASP8, MMP1, CA1, CA3, STAMBP, ST1A1, 4E-BP), remained significantly decreased compared to baseline. CASP8 and ST1A1 exhibited changes opposite to those in the AHD to WD group. In the control group, most DAPs remained unchanged, except for reduced values of CA1 (follow-up versus after the intervention) and CCL5 (follow-up versus baseline) (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 7).

Consumption of the fermented beverage resulted in a more diverse pattern of protein changes, with plasma concentrations of 29 proteins (27 cardiometabolic, two inflammatory) increasing and three inflammatory proteins decreasing after the intervention compared to baseline (Fig. 2a,d, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7). At the follow-up time point, cardiometabolic proteins returned to baseline but inflammatory markers, including CC chemokines (CCL5, CCL4, CCL28), MMP1, IL-17A and OSM, remained lower than baseline. This is consistent with Wastyk et al.5, who observed reductions in inflammatory markers with a highly fermented food diet. In the control group, most DAPs remained unchanged, except for a decrease in CCL5 (follow-up versus baseline; Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 7).

To confirm the inflammatory effects, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples with values below the detection threshold (24.4% of samples) were assigned the limit of the detection value (0.2 mg l−1; Fig. 2e). Using an LMM analysis as for the Olink data, a significant increase in plasma CRP concentrations was observed in participants switching to a WD (after the intervention versus baseline, P = 0.020), while a trend toward reduced CRP concentrations was observed in participants switching to an AHD (follow-up versus after the intervention, P = 0.059), with no significant changes in the fermented beverage group.

Overall, switching to a Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet resulted in sustained reductions in inflammatory and metabolic plasma proteins. Conversely, switching to a WD increased metabolic proteins and, to a lesser extent, inflammatory proteins, with minimal lasting effects. Fermented beverage consumption induced a rapid shift in cardiometabolic proteins and a sustained reduction in inflammatory proteins.

Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of the interventions on cytokine production capacity, a prespecified primary outcome. Whole blood was incubated with Candida albicans, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) for 48 h. Cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, IL-10, interferon-y (IFNγ)) were measured in supernatants using ELISAs, producing 30 cytokine response measures.

LMM analysis revealed that cytokine responses in participants switching from an AHD to a WD declined in 12 and 14 measures after the intervention and at the follow-up, compared to baseline, respectively, while four measures increased after the intervention compared to baseline. Despite elevated plasma inflammatory proteins (Fig. 2a), TNF and IFNγ responses to all stimuli, except poly(I:C), decreased after the intervention (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 8), which is consistent with reduced cytokine production commonly observed in inflammatory conditions such as aging17, obesity18, endotoxemia19 or sepsis20. The largest decline was observed for C. albicans responses, especially in IFNγ, but also in other cytokines (Fig. 3b). IL-1β and IFNγ responses to poly(I:C) initially increased after the intervention, but this effect was not sustained at the follow-up (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4a). IL-6 responses to LPS, S. aureus, C. albicans, MTB and S. enteritidis decreased at the follow-up compared to baseline (Fig. 3a).

Whole blood collected at baseline (t0), after the intervention (t1: week 2 for the dietary intervention group and week 1 for the banana beverage intervention group) and 4 weeks later (t2, follow-up), was subjected to 48-h ex vivo stimulation using the following stimuli: C. albicans hyphae (1 × 107 ml−1), E. coli LPS (10 ng ml−1), MTB (5 µg ml−1), S. enteritidis (1 × 106 ml−1), S. aureus (1 × 106 ml−1) and the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) (50 µg ml−1). Cytokine concentrations were measured in the supernatants at three time points for participants in the WD (n = 21), AHD (n = 22) and fermented beverage (n = 22) study arms using ELISA. Statistical analysis was carried out using an LMM for each comparison with a two-sided hypothesis test. Fixed effects included time point, baseline BMI, age and physical activity level, while participant ID was included as a random effect. a,c,e, Arrow plots depicting statistical comparisons between time points for switch to WD (a), switch to AHD (c) and fermented beverage (e): after the intervention (t1) versus baseline (t0), follow-up (t2) versus after the intervention (t1), and follow-up (t2) versus baseline (t0). The arrows indicate the direction of change compared to the earlier time point in each comparison (up or down); the fill color represents the log2 paired fold change, indicating the size and direction of change (red to blue, with up or down changes shown by the colors).

Conversely, switching from a WD to an AHD resulted in only few changes (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 8). At the follow-up, TNF, IL-1β, and IFNγ responses to S. aureus and TNF responses to S. enteritidis were decreased compared to both baseline and after the intervention. In contrast, IL-1β responses to MTB showed an increase at the follow-up compared to baseline and after the intervention (Fig. 3c,d). Finally, the fermented beverage group showed increased responses of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after the intervention and at the follow-up compared to the baseline, alongside increased TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 responses to C. albicans (Fig. 3e,f, Supplementary Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 8). In contrast, the transitioning to a WD led to a marked decline in C. albicans responses.

In summary, the interventions had notable effects on cytokine production. Switching to a WD reduced TNF and IFNγ production, while the fermented beverage increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 responses and enhanced C. albicans cytokine responses.

Diet influences plasma metabolome composition21, with immunomodulatory effects from food-derived and microbiome-derived metabolites. We analyzed the plasma metabolome, a prespecified primary outcome, using untargeted metabolomics, identifying 1,266 ions and 1,339 molecular formulas, with 935 metabolites annotated in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (Methods and Supplementary Table 9). PCA revealed altered metabolic profiles after the intervention across all arms compared to baseline (Extended Data Fig. 4a). An LMM analysis was applied to detect differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) (absolute fold change greater than 1.2, Padj < 0.05), focusing on metabolites where time points accounted for more than 5% of the variance (Supplementary Table 10). DAMs observed in control participants were reported in the downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 10). Metabolites were classified into 14 chemical groups; pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the Relational Database of Metabolomics Pathways (RaMP) (https://rampdb.nih.gov/), focusing on WikiPathways terms (1,377 pathways, 3,966 metabolites and 14,191 metabolite–pathway associations) to identify metabolites within or influencing specific pathways (Supplementary Table 11)22.

Transitioning from the AHD to WD resulted in 309 DAMs. Among these, 63 metabolites increased and 58 decreased after the intervention compared to the baseline, while 13 increased and 51 decreased at the follow-up compared to the baseline (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, 43 metabolites increased and 81 decreased at the follow-up compared to after the intervention. Top DAMs and their chemical classes are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4b. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed increases in metabolites linked to ‘glucose homeostasis', the urea cycle (for example, ‘biomarkers for urea cycle disorders'), ‘tRNA aminoacylation' and ‘tryptophan catabolism' after the intervention (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 11), presumably reflecting the higher animal protein content in the WD, also indicated by increases in metabolites as 1-methylhistidine. Conversely, metabolites linked to the ‘flavan-3-ol' pathway, a flavonoid subclass, decreased. The ‘omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid synthesis' pathway was enriched at the follow-up compared to after the intervention and baseline. The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly decreased after the intervention compared to the baseline, while docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) showed a trend toward decreasing (P = 0.09), with both increasing again at the follow-up (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Table 11). Arachidonic acid (ARA) and its pro-inflammatory metabolite leukotriene B4 transiently decreased after the intervention and significantly increased at the follow-up, alongside a rise in 20-carboxy leukotriene B4 after the intervention (Fig. 4b,c). Lastly, dopamine and dopamine sulfate transiently decreased after the intervention, which is consistent with studies linking high-fat diets to hypodopaminergic effects23.

a, For each dietary arm and time comparison, the top bar plots present the number of DAMs at each time point. An LMM was used for each comparison with a two-sided hypothesis test. Fixed effects included time point, baseline BMI, age and baseline physical activity level; participant ID was included as a random effect. Significance level was set to Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P ≤ 0.05 and absolute paired fold change greater than 1.2. The lower dot plots present the top eight significantly enriched WikiPathway metabolic pathways for DAMs using a Fisher's exact test via the RaMP database. The color indicates the direction of the DAM, up or down in red or blue, respectively. The size of the dots depicts the number of metabolites related to the pathway. Pathways are ordered alphabetically. b,d,f, Heatmaps showing examples of the enriched pathways discussed in the main text for switch to WD (b), switch to AHD (d) and fermented beverage (f), with the fill color indicating the relevant log2 paired fold change. c,e,g, Respective associated DAMs for switch to WD (c), switch to AHD (e) and fermented beverage (g) are shown in combined box and line plots with the group trend line indicating concentrations of measured parameters at the three time points. Lines are grouped per participant. In all box plots, the line defines the median value, the hinges depict the 25th and 75th centiles and the whiskers extend to ±1.5 times the IQR. ADA, adrenic acid; ARA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; DPA, docosapentaenoic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; LTB4, leukotriene B4; ALA, alpha-linolenic acid; Valerolactone, 5-(hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone-O-sulphate.

Switching from a WD to an AHD resulted in 334 DAMs. Among these, 93 metabolites increased and 41 decreased after the intervention, while 74 increased and 24 decreased after the intervention compared to the baseline (Fig. 4a). The top increased DAMs after the intervention compared to the baseline included the fatty acids dodecanoic acid (lauric acid) and cis-4-decenoic acid (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Dodecanoic acid was suggested to improve mitochondrial function and glucose and lipid metabolism24. Additional DAMs that increased included benzoic acid, trans-piceid (a resveratrol glycoside with cardiovascular benefits)25 and fumaric acid (a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and immunomodulator)26. In the controls, with the exception of benzoic acid, these metabolites were not differentially abundant or were only observed as differentially abundant at the follow-up compared to the baseline (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 10). Among the top DAMs that decreased after the intervention were cresol, p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, which returned to baseline levels at the follow-up. The latter two metabolites, produced via tyrosine and tryptophan fermentation by gut bacteria, are known to decrease with vegetarian diets27. Pathway enrichment analysis linked increased DAMs, such as the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and EPA, as well as arachidonic acid, dodecanoid acid and fumaric acid, to ‘omega-9 fatty acid synthesis', ‘omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid synthesis', ‘neurotransmitter release cycle' and ‘incretin synthesis, secretion and inactivation' pathways, with varying roles depending on the metabolite (Fig. 4a,d,e and Supplementary Table 11).

Consumption of the fermented beverage resulted in 177 DAMs, with 79 metabolites increasing and seven decreasing after the intervention compared to the baseline, and 29 increasing and nine decreasing at the follow-up compared to the baseline (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 10). Notable increases were observed in metabolites of the ‘flavan-3-ol metabolic pathway', including hippuric acid, hydrocinnamic acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, pyrocatechol and valerolactone-O-sulfate (Fig. 4f,g, Extended Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 11). These metabolites, formed by gut microbial breakdown of dietary polyphenols, have been associated with vascular health and anti-inflammatory effects28. The sustained decrease in cysteinylglycine (a glutathione breakdown product) and transient increase in tyrosol (a microbial metabolite of polyphenols), and organic sulfates like 4-ethylphenyl sulfate, may highlight microbial fermentation effects (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 4b)29.

In summary, the dietary switch and fermented beverage both had distinct effects on metabolic pathways related to glucose, lipid, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, and pathways associated with inflammation.

We also analyzed changes in the prespecified primary outcome of whole-blood transcriptome. We performed differential expression analysis (Padj < 0.2, no fold change cutoff), considering both the individual and control group of each intervention arm (Methods). PCA of the transcriptome alterations revealed subtle shifts across the first (PC1) and second (PC2) PCs in the participants switching to a WD and those in the fermented beverage group intervention, both after the intervention and at the follow-up, compared to the baseline (values corrected for participant; Extended Data Fig. 5a).

The switch from the AHD to WD resulted in the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 97 upregulated and 26 downregulated after the intervention compared to the baseline, and 410 upregulated and 163 downregulated at the follow-up compared to the baseline (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the switch from WD to AHD had minimal effects, with seven upregulated and seven downregulated genes after the intervention compared to the baseline, and no differences at the follow-up compared to the baseline. Fermented beverage consumption resulted in 26 upregulated and 104 downregulated DEGs after the intervention compared to the baseline and 15 upregulated and 58 downregulated genes at the follow-up compared to the baseline (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Tables 12–14).

Whole-blood transcriptome data were analyzed for participants in the AHD to WD switch group (n = 22), the WD to AHD switch group (n = 22) and the fermented beverage group (n = 21). Blood samples were collected at three time points: baseline (t0), after the intervention (t1) and the follow-up (t2), 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. Five control individuals for each dietary arm were included in the differential expression analysis, using DESeq2. The model design incorporated the individual (ind.n), intervention (diet versus control) and time point (baseline, after the intervention or at the follow-up) as follows: ~intervention + intervention:ind. n + intervention:time point. Differential expression analysis was performed between time points using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for P value adjustment and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW). A two-sided significance threshold was set at adjusted P value ≤ 0.2, with no fold change cutoff. a, A scheme presenting the number of DEGs for each comparison in each of the intervention arms are presented. b,e, Dot plots presenting the results of gene set overrepresentation analyses for GO terms performed with the DEGs from each comparison for the switch to WD (b) and fermented beverage (e). The size and color of the dots depict the gene ratio and Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P, respectively. c,d,f,g, Tile plots presenting the log2 fold change of the genes related to selected enriched GO terms for switch to WD (after intervention (t1) versus baseline (t0) (c) and follow-up (t2) versus baseline (t0) (d)), and the fermented beverage (after intervention (t1) versus baseline (t0) (f) and follow-up (t2) versus baseline (t0) (g)).

In participants switching to a WD, upregulated genes after the intervention were enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), including ‘response to ROS', ‘cellular response to hydrogen peroxide' and ‘positive regulation of ROS production', and pathogen defense terms such as ‘response to fungus' and ‘defense response to bacterium' (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Table 15). Key genes included S100A8, MPO, MMP8 and DEFA3 and DEFA4, all strongly expressed in neutrophils30. In contrast, downregulated DEGs at the follow-up compared to the baseline were related to adaptive immunity, showing enrichment in processes such as ‘immunoglobulin production', ‘positive regulation of T cell activation' and ‘MHC class II protein complex assembly', including several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (Fig. 5b,d and Supplementary Table 15). Upregulated genes at the follow-up compared to the baseline were associated with posttranscriptional modification terms, such as ‘production of miRNA involved in gene silencing' and ‘histone modification' (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 5c).

In the fermented beverage group, downregulated genes after the intervention compared to the baseline were linked to cellular migration processes, including ‘positive regulation of cell migration' and ‘regulation of cell development', including genes such as ACTN4, STAT3, DIAPH1, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, LRP1, JAK1 and SEMA4D (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Table 16). Transcription factor enrichment analysis identified STAT3, STAT5B and SON DNA binding protein (an intracellular infection mediator in macrophages)31, and ELF4 (a known regulator of IFN induction)32, as key regulators of downregulated DEGs (Extended Data Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 17). Moreover, aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression encodes a transcription factor responsive to metabolites such as indole-lactic acid and from fermented foods; its targets were increased (Extended Data Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 17)33. Comparing the follow-up with the baseline, a decrease in genes related to inflammation progression and resolution pathways was observed. This included pathways such as ‘cell activation involved in immune response', ‘response to wounding', ‘acute phase response' and ‘positive regulation of cellular component movement', with key genes such as IL6R, DOCK2, DOCK5, DOCK8, DIAPH1 and LRP1 (Fig. 5e,g and Supplementary Table 16).

In summary, these results support that a WD is associated with upregulation in genes of the innate immune system, whereas the fermented banana beverage induced a more anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile.

Possible adverse events were monitored through spontaneous reporting because the risks of the short-term dietary interventions were considered minimal. Participants were instructed to report any adverse events to the study team, but none occurred.

We conducted a post-hoc analysis to assess the intervention's impact on circulating leukocyte subsets and activation status. Using a Sysmex XN-450 hematology analyzer with its extended inflammation parameters, we measured complete blood counts and activation parameters for lymphocytes (reactive lymphocytes (RE-LYMPHs)), monocytes (reactive monocytes (RE-MONOs)) and neutrophils (neutrophil reactivity intensity (NEUT-RI) and neutrophil granularity intensity (NEUT-GI))34. LMM analysis revealed significant leukocyte changes, predominantly in participants switching to a WD, with smaller effects in participants consuming the fermented beverage (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 18). Switching to a WD increased white blood cells, neutrophils, immature granulocytes, NEUT-RI, monocytes, RE-MONOs and RE-LYMPHs from baseline to after the intervention (Fig. 6a,b). While white blood cell counts returned to baseline levels at the follow-up, activation markers (NEUT-RI, NEUT-GI, RE-MONOs, RE-LYMPHs) remained elevated, suggesting persistent immune cell activation. Conversely, switching to an AHD showed no significant leukocyte changes. The fermented beverage reduced NEUT-RI after the intervention, with effects persisting at the follow-up, alongside lower immature granulocytes and higher basophil percentages (Fig. 6a,c). No significant changes were observed in the control participants maintained on their habitual diet (Supplementary Table 18).

a, Triangle plot presenting the significantly different leukocyte parameters across the baseline (t0), after the intervention (t1, 2 weeks for diets and 1 week for fermented beverage) and at the follow-up (t2, 4 weeks after t1) time points (n = 22 from each diet). Parameters were measured using the XN-450 hematology analyzer (Sysmex). The direction of the arrows (up or down) indicates the direction of change, comparing late versus early time points in each comparison as listed at the bottom of the plot. An LMM was used for each comparison, with a two-sided hypothesis test. Fixed effects included time point, baseline BMI, age and baseline physical activity level, while participant ID was included as a random effect. The asterisks indicate the significance level based on Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P values (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). b,c, Combined violin, box and line plots depicting the values of the measured parameters (switch to WD (b) and fermented beverage (c)) across the three time points with participant-specific lines linking observations.

NEUT-RI and NEUT-GI values are expressed in fluorescence intensity (FI) units and scatter intensity (SI) units, respectively. WBC, white blood cell count.

Overall, the intervention substantially influenced leukocyte numbers and phenotype, with the WD promoting myelopoiesis and immune cell activation, while the fermented beverage reduced neutrophil activation.

To validate the findings, we analyzed data from the 300 Tanzania functional genomics (TZFG) cohort, a cross-sectional study of urban- or rural-living Tanzanians (n = 295) from the same region. Participants were previously categorized into ‘Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet' (n = 138) and ‘Western-style diet' clusters (n = 157) based on food-derived plasma metabolome profiles (Extended Data Fig. 6a)9. Differential analysis using the Olink inflammation panel identified 18 proteins that were lower in the heritage-style diet cluster compared to the Western-style diet cluster (Supplementary Table 19). Among these, 83% (15 proteins) also decreased in the current WD to AHD arm (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary Table 19). These proteins included the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL11, MCP2 and MCP4.

AHDs are rapidly being replaced by WDs across the continent. In a randomized controlled trial, we found that switching to a WD impacted key metabolic pathways linked to NCDs and induced a pro-inflammatory state involving leukocytes, inflammatory mediators and gene expression. In contrast, the switch to a largely plant-based heritage diet typical for the Kilimanjaro region and the fermented beverage primarily induced anti-inflammatory effects. Some of these changes persisted for 4 weeks after the intervention, demonstrating a sustained impact. This study highlights the immunometabolic consequences of dietary transitions and suggests their potential effects beyond a short dietary intervention.

The heritage diet in this study is rich in green vegetables, legumes, plantains, root and tuber crops, including cassava and taro, and whole grains (millet, sorghum), providing dietary fiber and bioactive compounds like polyphenols, known for their anti-inflammatory properties and beneficial metabolic effects3,35,36,37,38,39. Additionally, this diet promotes a favorable gut microbiome composition and production of beneficial metabolites40. Our plasma proteomics and metabolomics analyses revealed changes in several classes of immunomodulating compounds and metabolic pathways, including microbiota-derived metabolites. Notably, in the AHD group, inflammatory proteins decreased without changes in circulating leukocytes or gene transcription, suggesting that its anti-inflammatory effects stem from modulation of metabolic processes in tissues and possibly the microbiome, rather than leukocyte transcriptional regulation. The immunometabolic benefits of this diet probably stem from synergistic interactions among diverse foods and bioactive compounds, rather than any single component, a pattern also seen with the Mediterranean diet41.

The WD, rich in calorie-dense processed foods, saturated fats, salt and refined carbohydrates, promotes inflammation. This probably results from both direct immunometabolic effects of cholesterol, saturated lipids and sugars, and indirect effects via gut dysbiosis and weight gain6,42.

Our study also highlights the potential health benefits of traditional African fermented beverages43. The Chagga tribe's heritage beer, Mbege, is prepared by fermenting boiled bananas with germinated finger millet porridge (Eleusine coracana). The beverage has an alcohol content of 1–3%, depending on the duration of fermentation12,44. Besides the health-promoting compounds naturally present in bananas and millet, fermentation enriches Mbege with bioactive metabolites and microbes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactobacilli44. Consumption of Mbege reduced, among others, neutrophil activation and boosted cytokine responses to Candida. We previously showed that β-glucan from S. cerevisiae is a potent inducer of trained immunity45. Metabolites like tyrosol, produced by S. cerevisiae46, were elevated in the participants in the Mbege arm, and therefore support its immunomodulating effects. Moreover, the flavan-3-ol pathway, which involves a subclass of polyphenols with recognized vascular benefits28, emerged as one of the most upregulated metabolic pathways in the Mbege arm. However, consumption of these fermented beverages should be balanced against risks such as the alcohol content and potential mycotoxin contamination.

Chronic inflammation is a key driver of many NCDs8; studies have linked low-inflammatory diets to reduced risks of CVD, type 2 diabetes and cancer47,48. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has shown benefit in both primary and secondary prevention of CVD49,50. Our study found that even brief dietary interventions can have prolonged effects on the immune and metabolic systems. While we cannot entirely rule out that some sustained effects were due to continued adherence to the intervention diets, participants were instructed to revert to their habitual diets after the intervention. Additionally, the limited availability of Western-style food products in rural areas makes continuous consumption of a WD unlikely. The persistent changes in neutrophil count and activation, inflammatory and cardiometabolic proteins, and transcription of immune-related genes at 4 weeks after the intervention align with prior experimental murine studies showing that the WD induces a maladaptive ‘trained immunity' program and that alternating high-fat diets stimulate myelopoiesis, increasing neutrophil counts and progenitor reprogramming, thereby promoting atherosclerosis7,51, The role of neutrophils in CVD is increasingly recognized52. Notably, the Mediterranean diet has been reported to reduce neutrophil counts and carotid intima-media thickness53.

The rapid rise in obesity and NCDs across Africa underscores the need for sustainable, region-specific interventions. Preserving the consumption of heritage diets or incorporating indigenous and traditional foods into dietary practices could have a critical role in preventing and managing NCDs. However, Africa's diverse heritage diets are largely understudied, and the field of nutritional immunology in this context is still emerging. Policymakers often rely on findings from the Global North, which do not account for regional dietary, cultural and genetic differences. Our study provides direct evidence of the health risks of dietary westernization and the benefits of heritage diets and indigenous beverages, emphasizing the need for further research to explore their health impacts before they are lost to globalization, ensuring culturally appropriate and sustainable public health solutions.

Our study also has a few limitations. First, food was offered ad libitum, and the intervention was not isocaloric, resulting in a weight gain in the AHD to WD switch group, which may have influenced immunometabolic profiles54. Second, the dietary intervention was short, although similar or even shorter interventions have demonstrated important immune effects. For example, a 2-week intervention with a vegan or ketogenic diet induced marked immune and gut microbiome changes4, while a 5-day fiber-poor diet was sufficient to alter host responses in both mice and humans55. Furthermore, our controlled setting established a baseline for short-term dietary responses in African environments, laying the foundation for future research on long-term effects. Third, our study included only men because of cultural logistics and confounding variables. Future studies should include women and diverse age groups. Fourth, the sample size is relatively small, although it is comparable to other multiomics dietary studies4,5. Sample size calculations were based on functional immune responses rather than multiomics data, given the challenges in defining meaningful effect sizes for large, complex multiomics datasets. The homogeneous study population and the largely consistent direction of inflammatory and metabolic changes in the intervention groups, reduce the likelihood that our findings are due to chance. Fifth, the study only provided molecular insights into short-term changes in immunometabolic features and pathways because of dietary practices but did not assess long-term clinical outcomes. Sixth, plasma metabolomics analysis used a nontargeted, high-throughput method relying on m/z ratios, which may lack specificity for definitive metabolite identification. Lastly, while the Chagga tribe's plant-rich and fiber-rich diet aligns with healthy dietary practices, Tanzania has over 100 tribes with varied diets. Thus, findings may not be generalizable to all heritage diets in the region.

In summary, our findings highlight the substantial impact of dietary changes on both immune and metabolic systems, with implications for infection susceptibility and NCDs. They underscore the importance of preserving essential elements of AHDs, including fermented products, to mitigate the rising burden of NCDs and immune dysregulation in sub-Saharan Africa. As WDs increasingly replace indigenous diets, documenting the health benefits of heritage diets remains important.

This study was conducted in the Moshi district in the Kilimanjaro region of northeastern Tanzania between April and August 2021, which coincides largely with the wet season. Moshi town serves as the administrative, commercial and educational center for the region, with a population of approximately 220,000 inhabitants. Moshi town borders the foothills of the southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. These foothills are rural areas where people live in smaller villages and are engaged in subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry. Most of the people living in the foothills belong to the Chagga tribe. For this study, rural dwellers were mainly recruited from the village of Uru Shimbwe Juu, which is located approximately 15 km from Moshi town at an elevation of 1,978 m.

Two cohorts of healthy volunteers assigned male at birth were recruited: (1) males residing in the rural village of Uru Shimbwe Juu or its environs, adhering to a predominantly Kilimanjaro heritage diet; and (2) males residing in Moshi town, adhering to a predominantly Western-style diet. Sex was determined based on self-report. Information about the study was disseminated through leaflets, community talks and announcements during church gatherings. Dietary habits in eligible volunteers who agreed to participate were assessed using a dietary recall questionnaire, conducted over three nonconsecutive 24-h periods in 1 week, including 1 weekend day. The questionnaire captured details on different foods, as well as estimated portion sizes (small, medium or large) and preparation methods for each food item. Questionnaires were evaluated by a nutritionist to ensure participants were adhering to either a diet typical of the Kilimanjaro region or a Western-style diet. This assessment relied primarily on the nutritionist's expertise and knowledge of local dietary habits, rather than a standardized set of criteria, incorporating traditional understanding of food patterns.

Only participants adhering to either a Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet or Western-style diet were further considered for participation. Other inclusion criteria were age 20–40 years, BMI between 18 and 25 kg m−2, residing in either the rural or urban areas of Moshi for a minimum of 1 month preceding the study, and commitment to stay in the study area throughout the intervention period. Exclusion criteria were a positive result of human immunodeficiency virus or malaria rapid test, notable blood pressure abnormalities, elevated fasting blood sugar level, food allergies, recent acute illness, use of medication, antibiotics or vaccination in the last 3 months, previous hospitalization within the past year, presence of chronic conditions such as active malignancy, liver or kidney disease, tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or unwillingness to consume alcohol. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect meta-data, lifestyle information, health status and daily activities, including tobacco use, physical activity level, medical history, medication use and vaccination records.

Participants' physical activity was assessed by inquiring about their engagement in daily walking and sports activities. For descriptive purposes (Extended Data Table 1), sports activity levels were classified as follows: very active (more than 2 h of daily activity); active (up to 1 h daily or up to 2 h on some days); less active (up to 1 h on some days or only on weekends); and not active (no reported activity). Daily walking was categorized into three groups: less than 30 min; 30–60 min; or more than 60 min per day. For downstream analysis, we summarized these two estimations of physical activity with the scoring system provided in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, engaging in any sports activity was scored as 2, and no sports activity as 1. The frequency of sports activity was scored as 1, 2 or 3 for ‘only weekend', ‘some days in a week' and ‘every day', respectively. Duration of daily walking was scored between 1, 2 and 3 for less than 30 min, between 30 and 60 min and more than 60 min per day, respectively. Means of transportation was scored as 1 for private or public vehicle transportation or 2 for physical transportation (walking or bicycle). Scores values were scaled, and a sum of physical activity level was generated for each individual (Supplementary Table 5).

The current study was approved by the Ethical Committees of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (KCMUCo) (no. 2483) and the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania (no. NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX 3570). Participant recruitment and experimental procedures were conducted according to the principles mentioned in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All participants gave written informed consent before recruitment.

The study was designed as an open-label, prospective intervention study with three arms: (1) rural-living men with a Kilimanjaro heritage diet who shifted to a Western-style diet for two weeks; (2) urban-living men with a Western-style diet shifting to a heritage diet for 2 weeks; and (3) men with a Western-style diet starting daily consumption of the fermented drink ‘Mbege' for 1 week (fermented beverage arm). To assess for dietary-independent effects, five controls who remained on their habitual diet were also included in the first two arms.

Participants in the dietary intervention arms were randomized to either the dietary intervention (n = 23 in the AHD to WD arm; n = 22 in the WD to AHD arm) or remaining on their habitual diet (n = 5 in each arm, ‘controls'). No controls were included in the fermented beverage arm. Randomization was conducted by an independent statistician using a lottery method. Each preselected participant was assigned a number based on the dietary assessment, from which five numbers (controls) were randomly selected.

The switch group received freshly prepared meals from a cook three times daily (breakfast, lunch and dinner) at a central cooking location in either Uru Shimbwe Juu village or in Moshi town. Food was provided ad libitum and consumed under supervision. Portion sizes were not quantified. In the fermented beverage arm, participants were directed to consume at least 1 l of the beverage daily between 16:00 to 17:00 while maintaining their usual diet. The beverage, produced fresh daily by one local manufacturer, was dispensed at a central location in Moshi town and intake was supervised. Intake of this fermented beverage was restricted in the other groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline, after the intervention (2 weeks for the dietary switch, 1 week for the fermented banana beverage), and 4 weeks thereafter for the follow-up. For the rural group, samples were collected at the field site in Uru Shimbwe Juu, while for the urban group, samples were collected at the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI) research unit in Moshi town.

The dietary intervention diets are detailed in Extended Data Table 2. Using the Tanzania Food Composition Table56, we retrospectively calculated the nutrient composition of the intervention diets offered to participants. Because of the absence of recorded portion sizes, macronutrient contributions to energy intake were calculated per 100 g of food and adjusted based on typical daily intake, assuming standard portion sizes. In the WD, carbohydrates contributed approximately 55% of total energy, primarily from refined sources such as refined maize flour (used for making stiff porridge, ‘ugali'), pancakes, potato chips, white rice, macaroni and fried plantains. Fats accounted for 23% of total energy, mainly from fried foods like fried chicken, beef, potato chips, ‘chips mayai' (a local dish combining potato chips and eggs) and pancakes. Protein contributed 16% of total energy, with chicken, beef and eggs as the primary sources. Simple sugars and dietary fiber contributed 2.2% and 3.5% of total energy, respectively. In contrast, the Kilimanjaro AHD provided 60% of total energy from carbohydrates, mainly derived from whole grains, roots and tubers, such as taro and boiled sweet potatoes. Protein contributed 11% of total energy, primarily from meat, local free-range chicken and fish. Fats accounted for 7% of total energy, while simple sugars and dietary fiber contributed 7% and 14% of total energy, respectively.

The prespecified primary outcomes were the changes in (1) circulating inflammation-related biomarkers; (2) the capacity of the circulating immune cells to produce inflammatory cytokines in ex vivo whole-blood stimulation to different stimuli; (3) whole-blood transcriptome; and (4) untargeted plasma metabolome, at baseline, after the intervention and 4 weeks after the intervention. A secondary outcome was the change in gut microbiome composition, assessed through untargeted metagenomics. These results will be reported separately.

The sample size for this study was determined based on functional immune response outcomes rather than high-dimensional omics data, which typically generate large datasets unsuitable for conventional power calculations. Specifically, the calculation was based on previously reported differences in whole-blood TNF production after LPS stimulation between urban and rural populations in a cross-sectional study conducted in the same region11. The sample size was calculated to achieve 80% statistical power to detect significant differences at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.

Regarding harm, safety and possible adverse events, the risk associated with participation in this short dietary intervention was considered minimal. Therefore, spontaneous adverse event reporting was applied. Participants were instructed to report any adverse events they experienced during the study period directly to the study team. In addition, body weight was monitored throughout the study.

Fasting glucose and blood pressure data from the after the intervention and follow-up periods, although initially planned according to the study protocol, were not recorded because of logistical challenges. Difficult access to the remote study site on Mount Kilimanjaro during the rainy season led to delays that compromised the ability to obtain early-morning, fasting measurements.

EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were analyzed using the Sysmex XN analyzer (Sysmex Corporation) to obtain a complete blood count and the Sysmex Extended Inflammation Parameters, including RE-MONO, RE-LYMPH and NEUT-RI. Blood samples were analyzed at the KCRI in Moshi, Tanzania within 2 h after venipuncture.

Statistical comparisons across the study time points were performed using an LMM. The dream function (variancePartition package v.1.24) was applied to log2-transformed concentration values, with the time point as a fixed variable, participant as a random effect and adjustments for age, BMI and baseline physical activity level. Statistical summary results were extracted using the eBayes and topTable functions, applying false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg correction, with the significance cutoff for Padj set to 0.05. Paired fold change values were calculated using the fcrosFCmat function from the package fcros (v.1.6.1). Statistical results for each dietary arm were presented in a triangle plot, with the direction of change and paired log2 fold change presented for each time point comparison using ggplot2 (v.3.5.1).

To determine the percentage of explained variance by the study intervention time point after the intervention (t1) or at the follow-up (t2) versus the baseline (t0) to the features in each data layer, we performed a variance partition analysis. Variance partition analysis was conducted using the fitExtractVarPartModel function from the variance partition package (v.1.24.1) using time point, age, BMI and physical activity level at baseline as fixed variables and participants' ID as a random effect. Results were visualized in histograms using the ggplot2 and ggridges packages (v.3.5.1 and v.0.5.6, respectively).

The ex vivo cytokine stimulation experiments were conducted at the KCRI in Moshi, Tanzania. Whole-blood samples, obtained with heparin, were stimulated with bacterial, fungal and TLR3 and TLR4 agonists in a 48-well culture plate as described previously11. The following concentration stimuli were used: E. coli LPS (100 ng ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich); MTB (5 μg ml−1, H37Rv strain, in-house); poly(I:C) (50 µg ml−1, InvivoGen); S. aureus (106 ml−1 colony-forming units (CFU), ATCC strain 29213, in-house); C. albicans (106 CFU ml−1, UC820 strain, in-house); and S. enteritidis (106 CFU ml−1, in-house). Stimuli were prepared in Roswell Park Memorial Institute culture medium (Dutch-modified, Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 gentamicin, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 1 mM pyruvate. The resulting supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Cytokine concentrations in the supernatant were quantified using ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions provided by the respective kits (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF, R&D Systems; IFNγ, Sanquin). To ensure consistency, samples were measured using kits from the same lot. For statistical analysis, the cytokine levels measured in the whole-blood assay were log2-transformed.

Statistical comparisons across the study time points were performed using an LMM. The dream function (variancePartition package v.1.24) was applied to log2-transformed concentration values, with time point as a fixed variable, participant as a random effect and adjustments for age, BMI and baseline physical activity level. Statistical summary results were extracted using the eBayes and topTable functions, applying FDR adjustment for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg correction, with significance cutoff for Padj set to 0.05. Paired fold change values were calculated using the fcrosFCmat function from the package fcros (v.1.6.1). Statistical results for each dietary arm were presented in a triangle plot, presenting the direction of change and paired log2 fold change for each time point comparison using ggplot2 (v.3.5.1).

Plasma proteins were assessed using proximity extension technology (Olink Proteomics AB)15. The Olink 92 Inflammation and 92 Cardiometabolic panels were processed at the Laboratory of Experimental Internal Medicine, Radboudumc, the Netherlands. The assay involves the binding of target proteins to paired oligonucleotide antibody probes, followed by subsequent hybridization and amplification. NPX values, represented as arbitrary units on a log2 scale, were calculated from normalized cycle threshold data. Comprehensive validation details for the assay can be accessed on the Olink website (https://www.olink.com). All samples were measured in a single run in the same batch. Proteins with values below the limit of detection in more than 25% of subsequent samples were excluded. This resulted in the removal of 22 proteins, leaving 162 out of 184 proteins for further analysis. Most of these proteins had values below the limit of detection in almost all samples. Quality control measures and outlier detection were performed, revealing no significant batch effects or outliers attributable to technical issues. Additionally, control participants from both urban and rural groups exhibited consistent overall proteomic profiles, suggesting minimal batch-related bias. PCA was conducted using the prcomp function (stats v.3.6.2) on scaled NPX values or scaled NPX values corrected for participants (removeBatchEffect function, limma package v.3.50.3). To decrease the load of multiple testing, the proteins further tested in the differential analysis showed more than 5% of variance explained by the study time point (considering time point, age, BMI, physical activity level and participant as variables in the equation). The differential analysis for upregulated and downregulated proteins among the study time points was conducted using an LMM (variancePartition package v.1.24.) including time point as the main fixed variable, age, BMI and physical activity level at baseline as covariates, and the individual as a random effect (dream function). Statistical summary results were extracted for each time point comparison using the eBayes and topTable functions, FDR-adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction, setting the significance cutoff for Padj ≤ 0.05. Paired fold change values were calculated using the fcrosFCmat function from the package fcros (v.1.6.1), calculating the fold changes as a trimmed mean of the fold changes obtained using pairs of samples. The statistical results for each dietary arm were summarized in a triangle plot, presenting the direction of change and paired log2 fold change for each time point comparison using ggplot2 (v.3.5.1). In addition, beyond protein assignment to the designated Olink panels, DAPs were annotated to biological processes, based on biological process information obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (v.23.0).

Plasma concentrations of highly sensitive CRP were measured using an ELISA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quantikine ELISA Kit, R&D Systems). For samples with CRP levels below the detection limit, a value equivalent to the lower limit of detection (0.2 mg l−1) was assigned. A comparative analysis of CRP among the study time points in each study arm was conducted using an LMM (variancePartition package v.1.24.), with statistical summary results extracted for each time point comparison using the eBayes and topTable functions, FDR-adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg correction, setting the significance cutoff for Padj at 0.05.

Results from the 300 TZFG cross-sectional cohort were used to validate the findings in the dietary intervention study. This validation was based on previously published plasma metabolome and plasma proteome data9. Individuals from the 300 TZFG cohort (n = 295) were previously classified into two food clusters based on their food-associated plasma metabolome profiles: a Kilimanjaro heritage diet food cluster (n = 138) and a Western-type diet food cluster (n = 157). Differential proteins were detected using a linear model correcting for age, sex and BMI with the variancePartition package dream function followed by eBayes and topTable functions to extract summary statics (v.1.24). Differential proteins were visualized in combined violin-box-scatter plots, presenting the NPX values measured for each food cluster using ggplot2 (v.3.5.1). A qualitative comparison was conducted between the differential proteins in the 300 TZFG cohort and those in the heritage diet dietary arm, with results presented in a colored dot plot indicating proteins associated with the heritage diet in both datasets.

Untargeted plasma metabolomics was performed by General Metabolics as described previously57. Briefly, an untargeted metabolomics approach was used to analyze plasma metabolites via high-throughput mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies). The high-throughput method used is based on flow injection, without separation of compounds using a liquid chromatography gradient, allowing for efficient analysis of large cohorts. Polar metabolites were analyzed using the General Metabolics' high-throughput, nontargeted metabolomics platform in negative ion acquisition mode. Technical replicates were acquired for all samples. The data obtained, covering a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 50–1,000 at a flow rate of 150 μl min−1, were subjected to further analysis through centroiding on a high-performance computing cluster using MATLAB R2018a. The resultant matrix was constructed from centroid lists. Annotation coverage was typical for human plasma, with 1,266 annotated ions and 1,339 unique molecular formulas matched against ion libraries derived from the HMDB (https://www.hmdb.ca/), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) databases within 0.001 atomic mass unit of theoretical mass. The analytical method and approach to data processing and annotation have been described previously57. Given that the data were derived from human plasma, we prioritized annotation using the HMDB and converted KEGG or ChEBI IDs to HMDB IDs when available, using the Metabolite ID Conversion (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/ConvertView.xhtml, accessed March 2024). This resulted in a total of 935 metabolites that are present in the HMDB. Drugs that were detected using manual curating in the downstream analysis were flagged in the summary table and were disregarded in the analysis. Ion intensity values were normalized through log2; scaled values were used for the calculation of the PCA using the prcomp function (stats, v.3.6.2). Differential analysis for upregulated and downregulated metabolites between study time points was conducted using an LMM, including time point as a main fixed variable, age, BMI and physical activity level at baseline as covariates, and the individual as a random effect using the variancePartition package dream function followed by eBayes and topTable functions to extract the summary statics (v.1.24). Paired fold change values were calculated using the fcrosFCmat function from the fcros package (v.1.6.1), calculating the fold changes as a trimmed mean of the fold changes obtained using pairs of samples. DAMs were enriched for and assigned to chemical classes and enriched for metabolic pathways by querying the RaMP database (v.2.3.0, last updated 27 July 2023, accessed August 2024) using the website's Application Programming Interface /api/combined-fisher-test and /api/combined-fisher-test using the R json function (jsonlite, v.1.8.4).

Whole blood was collected in Qiagen PAXgene tubes. Total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN PAXgene RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's guidelines; eluted RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water. RNA quality was evaluated in the TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies) by estimating 28S and 18S band integrity. TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Globin (Illumina) was used to convert total RNA into double-stranded complementary DNA molecule libraries. Briefly, depletion of ribosomal and globin mRNA was performed on 750 ng purified total RNA using biotinylated, target-specific oligonucleotides combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. Under elevated temperature, the remaining RNA was fragmented using divalent cations. The first strand was generated using SuperScript2 RT (Invitrogen) supplemented with actinomycin D, followed by second-strand synthesis with deoxyuridine triphosphate replacing deoxythymidine triphosphate. Before PCR amplification, adenylation of the 3′ ends and index adapter ligation were done before subsequent yielding of the final library. The remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease and polymerase activities, and enzymes were removed. Selective DNA fragment enrichment with ligated adapter molecules was performed using Illumina PCR primers in 15 cycles of PCR reaction, followed by purification of complementary DNA using SPRI Beads (Beckman Coulter). High-throughput sequencing was carried out with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System on an S4 flow cell with v.1.5 chemistry (76-bp paired-end reads); data were converted into FASTQ files using bcl2fastq2 v.2.20.

Raw RNA-seq data were aligned using STAR (v.2.7.3a) and human reference transcriptome version HG38 to generate the gene counts table. Raw gene counts were normalized using DESeq2 (v.1.26.0) in R (v.4.1.2)58. Each one of the dietary arms was analyzed separately, together with its control group; the following analysis was applied: low-expressed gene counts (genes with fewer than five counts in more than 10% of the samples) as well as hemoglobin or ribosomal genes were excluded, resulting in 19,887–20,585 genes present in each of the dietary groups and comparisons. Variance stabilizing transformation (VST) was applied on normalized data (exact numbers used for the analysis are provided in Supplementary Table 4). Before differential analysis, quality control was done with all study samples using robust PCA on VST-transformed corrected counts of all present genes using the PcaHubert function from the rrcov package (v.1.7-5)59, excluding six samples that presented high score and orthogonal distance. PCA was conducted using the prcomp function (stats, v.3.6.2) on scaled VST values or scaled VST values corrected for participants (removeBatchEffect function, limma package v.3.50.3). For the differential analysis, we followed the strategy for group-specific condition effects, with individuals nested within groups, which assumes a common time effect in the diet or control groups. The DESeq2 model design applied included the individual (ind.n), treatment (diet or control) and time point (baseline, after the intervention or at the follow-up) resulting in the following model: ~treatment + treatment:ind.n + treatment:time point. Differential expression analysis was performed between each two time points using the FDR correction method for PadjIHW60, setting the threshold for Padj at 0.2, with no fold change threshold. Gene set enrichment analysis for the GO terms of DEGs was performed using the clusterProfiler package (v.4.2.2) using the compareCluster function with Padj < 0.05 (with Benjamini–Hochberg correction) defining all expressed genes as the universe. The function simplify was used to reduce the number of similar terms (clusterProfiler), setting the threshold to 0.7; further selection of pathways of interest was done manually for visualization using dotplot or heatplot with the respective clusterProfiler visualization functions. The full list of DEGs and enriched GO terms is found in Supplementary Tables 14–19.

Transcription factor enrichment analysis was performed using the ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis 3 (ChEA3) tool via its Application Programming Interface (https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/api/enrich/; accessed April 2024), using the jsonlite package in R (v.1.8.4)61. Transcription factor and gene targets found in the same DEG group were visualized in a circular plot using igraph (v.1.2.11) (Supplementary Table 19).

All statistical analyses and visualizations were conducted in R (v.4.1.1.), using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5) unless otherwise specified. For all statistical analyses, intra-individual measurements were assessed using an LMM, with time point as the main fixed variable, and age, BMI and activity ranking at baseline as covariates. The individual was included as a random effect, using the dream function from the variancePartition package, followed by the eBayes and topTable functions (v.1.24) to extract summary statistics, or by including the individual in the model (see the DESeq analysis above). Measurements from the control groups were used for qualitative comparison with the intervention groups or as a contrast group for modeling transcriptional differences.

Paired fold change values were calculated using the fcrosFCmat function from the fcros package (v.1.6.1), calculating the fold changes as a trimmed mean of the fold changes obtained using pairs of samples. For gene expression, fold change values were calcualted using results function (see the DESeq analysis above). To reduce the burden of multiple comparisons in the omics data, differential plasma protein (Olink assay) and metabolite analysis was performed on analytes where time points contributed more than 5% of the variance. P values were calculated using two-tailed hypothesis testing, and Benjamini–Hochberg correction adjusting for multiple testing on the overall tests performed at each time point contrast to control the FDR, with a significance threshold set at Padj < 0.05 when using mixed model analysis (setting the correction to ‘BH', topTable function, variancePartition package). For transcriptome analysis, IHW was applied by setting the filter to ihw within the results function of the DESeq2 package, as described in the previous section.

Flow diagram illustrating the enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis of participants.

Histograms of the percentage of explained variance by dietary intervention in the switch from African heritage diet (AHD) to Western diet (Switch to WD), switch from Western to African heritage diet (Switch to AHD), consumption of the fermented beverage (top, middle and bottom, respectively). Variance partition analysis was performed considering the change in features in each omics layer between post-intervention (t1, orange) or follow-up (t2, purple) vs baseline (t0) measurements. Age, BMI and physical activity levels at baseline were included as additional fixed variables and individual ID as random effect. The percentage of features in each data layer that intervention contributed to more than 5% in its variance is marked in each plot.

Targeted plasma proteomics was conducted using the inflammatory and cardiometabolic Olink panel (Olink® Proteomics AB). Samples from N = 20, 22 and 22 individuals in the switch from African heritage to Western diet (Switch to WD), switch from Western to African heritage diet (Switch to AHD) and the fermented beverage intervention arms were obtained at baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1), and four weeks follow-up (t2). a- PCA was calculated on (i) scaled original NPX values, or (ii) scaled values corrected for participant ID. Dot plots depict the principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2, with color indicating the measurement time point (t0, t1 and t2 in green, orange and purple) and geometric ellipses drawn at 95% confidence for each time point. b- Dot plot showing the biological terms (derived from the Human Protein Atlas) for the differential abundant proteins in each intervention arm and time point comparison, with size indicating the number of proteins related to each term.

Plasma metabolome was performed using untargeted metabolomics (General Metabolics, Cambridge, MA) to assess changes during the transition to a Western diet (WD), African heritage-style diet (AHD) and fermented beverage consumption. Samples were obtained at baseline (t0) post-intervention (t1, week 2 for the WD or AHD diet interventions and one week for the fermented beverage intervention, N = 22/group), and after four weeks follow-up (t2, N = 22/group). a- Dotplots showing principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2 from principal components analysis (PCA) of log2-scaled ion intensity scaled values using all metabolites as input. Color indicates the time points (green, orange, purple for t0, t1 and t2, respectively). A geometric ellipse is drawn at 95% confidence for each time point. b- Triangle plots present top differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs, adjusted P value < 0.05 and absolute paired fold-change > 1.2). Arrows' direction (up or down) indicates the direction of change, comparing late vs. early time points in each comparison as listed at the bottom of the plot, with color fill depicting the log2 paired fold-change value for each comparison. Statistical analysis was carried out using a linear mixed model for each comparison, including time point, BMI, physical activity level and age as fixed variables, and participant ID as random effect. Asterisks indicate significance level based on BH-adjusted P value (*, **, ***, **** represents adj. P values < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001).

Whole blood transcriptome data were analysed for participants in the heritage to Western diet switch group (Switch to WD, N = 22), the Western to heritage diet switch group (Switch to AHD, N = 22) and the fermented beverage group (N = 21). Blood samples were collected at 3 time points: baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1), and follow-up (t2), four weeks after the end of intervention. Five control individuals for each dietary arm were included in the DE analysis using DESeq2, with model design including the individual (ind.n), treatment (diet or control) and the time point (baseline, post-intervention or follow-up): ~ treatment + treatment:ind.n + treatment:time point. DE analysis was performed between each two time points using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) controlling method for P value adjustment and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW). The two-sided significance level was set to adjusted Padj ≤ 0.2, with no fold change threshold, a, PCA was calculated on scaled variance stabilized transformed (vst) count values. Dot plots depict the data on based on principal component (PC)1 and PC2 (x and y-axis respectively). Dot colors represent time points: t0 (green), t1 (orange), and t2 (purple). b, c - Tile plots display the log2 fold-change (log2FC) of genes related to selected GO terms enriched in the switch to the Western Diet (WD) group (indicated by color). d- Circular plot shows the predicted transcription factors (TF) and their targets among upregulated genes in the fermented beverage intervention group (t1 vs t0, based on ChEA3 analysis). Gene names are displayed around the circle's perimeter, with turquoise marking the TF, and arrows indicating the predicted regulated genes.

Results from the 300 TZFG cross-sectional cohort were used to validate the findings in the dietary intervention study. a- Participants in the 300 TZFG cohort (n = 295) were assigned, based on their food-derived metabolome profile, to a food cluster associated with a more African heritage-style diet (AHD food cluster; n = 138) or a more Western diet (WD food cluster; n = 157), as previously described9. b- Results of the Olink 92 inflammation panel were compared between the African heritage diet and Western diet food clusters using a linear model, correcting for age, sex and BMI. The dot plot shows differentially expressed proteins between the two clusters, with blue indicating proteins that also exhibited significant changes in the Western to heritage diet intervention arm of the current study. c- Combined violin-box-scatter plots present the levels of measured parameters across the two food clusters in the 300 TZFG cohort. Proteins levels are presented as NPX values.

Metrics details

Escherichia coli is the most widely studied microbe in history, but the population structure and evolutionary trends of its extrachromosomal elements known as plasmids remain poorly delineated. Here we used long-read technology to high-resolution sequence the entire plasmidome and the corresponding host chromosomes from an unbiased longitudinal survey covering two decades and over 2000 E. coli isolates. We find that some plasmids have persisted in lineages even for centuries, demonstrating strong plasmid-lineage associations. Our analysis provides a detailed map of recent vertical and horizontal evolutionary events involving plasmids with key antibiotic resistance, competition and virulence determinants. We present genomic evidence of both chromosomal and plasmid-driven success strategies adopted by distant lineages by independently inheriting the same genomic elements. Further, we use in vitro experiments to verify the importance of key bacteriocin-producing plasmids for clone success. Our study has general implications for understanding plasmid biology and bacterial evolutionary strategies.

The extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) have been of particular interest to both eco-evolutionary and epidemiological research communities since they near-universally colonize the healthy human gut in an asymptomatic fashion, while also causing a high global burden of opportunistic infections, predominantly in the urinary tract and bloodstream1. ExPEC possess an arsenal of iron acquisition mechanisms, toxins, and adhesins that enhance their persistence in this niche2,3,4,5.

The ExPEC population is composed of a high diversity of clones, but a relatively small subset of lineages contributes disproportionately to the majority of urinary tract and bloodstream infections6, where increasing levels of antibiotic resistance represent a challenge for effective treatment. Epidemiological investigations have uncovered an intriguing feature of ExPEC, showing stable maintenance of pandemic lineages over longer timescales and the emergence of novel successful clones in clinical surveillance, many with foodborne associations6,7,8,9. The new clones typically expand rapidly initially, but are then constrained within only a few years such that the population transits to another equilibrium still maintaining a considerable diversity of lineages. Unbiased longitudinal genomic surveys have demonstrated that the transient disruption of the equilibrium bears the hallmarks of negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS)10,11,12, and further modeling work suggested this selection is acting on accessory genomic elements rather than on core genome variation13.

Plasmids, initially described as transmissible agents carrying antibiotic resistance and competitor-inhibiting determinants in E. coli in the 1950s14,15,16,17, play a key role in accessory genome dynamics. Numerous traits involved in antibiotic resistance, iron-acquisition mechanisms, bacterial competition, immune evasion and metabolism are encoded by genes residing on plasmids. In particular, some E. coli carry colicinogenic plasmids that produce bacteriocins: toxic proteins typically active against close relatives18. Bacteriocins play an active role in intra-species competition19,20 and have been proposed as one of the mechanisms maintaining NFDS21,22. Despite the strong evidence that plasmids have played a critical role in the emergence and dissemination of successful clones23,24,25,26, the structure of the plasmidome, and the horizontal and vertical evolutionary dynamics of plasmids and ExPEC hosts remain largely unknown. This is due to the paucity of scalable computational approaches to type complete plasmid sequences, and the lack of large-scale longitudinal long-read sequencing studies, which has hindered developing a firm understanding of the plasmidome structure and prevalence of particular plasmids.

Except in a recent study27, ExPEC plasmids have previously been explored on a small-scale, most often in association with specific selective criteria, e.g. isolates carrying a particular resistance locus such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), and using mostly short-read sequencing data24,28,29,30. To circumvent this, we long-read sequenced 2045 E. coli isolates representing the genomic diversity of earlier short-read sequenced 3245 bloodstream infection isolates from a 16-year national longitudinal study11. These isolates were sampled regardless of their clonal background, antibiotic resistance profile or any other bacterial genotypic or phenotypic characteristic, making it ideal for the study of evolution, expansion and persistence of the plasmidome.

Our approaches resulted in a total of 4485 circularized plasmid sequences and through inferred evolutionary rates and dated phylogenies we estimated the timing of plasmid emergence/acquisition into major ExPEC clones. We demonstrate multiple cases of acquisition of the same plasmid-driven phenotypic traits in distant genetic backgrounds, supporting the conclusion that plasmids play key roles in initial clonal establishment and later endemic maintenance in the host population. In particular, we found that some ExPEC clones were strongly associated with pColV-like plasmids encoding microcin V, a narrow-spectrum bacterial toxin involved in bacterial competition17. By exploring the bacteriocin content present in the ExPEC population, we propose that plasmid-encoded bacteriocins play a pivotal role in shaping and maintaining the NFDS dynamics in E. coli. Through experimental approaches, we further demonstrate microcin V activity in different clonal backgrounds to inhibit the growth of multi-drug resistant ExPEC clones, thus contributing to the clonal success and maintenance of non-resistant clones in the population.

To elucidate the ExPEC plasmid repertoire and its stability over time, we focused on a unique Norwegian epidemiological longitudinal collection (NORM collection) spanning a period of 16 years and involving 3245 bloodstream infection isolates. This study included isolates regardless of their sequence type (ST) or antibiotic resistance background (e.g. presence of ESBL genes) and showed that almost all STs found in Norway were internationally circulating by a comparison to earlier systematic longitudinal studies conducted elsewhere10,11,12. To ensure the inclusion of isolates representative of the whole ExPEC population for long-read sequencing, we first selected 1085 isolates (33.44%, 1,085/3,245) using a statistical method informed by the accessory genome diversity of the isolates (Fig. S1) based on short-read sequences31. Next, we included all the remaining 960 isolates belonging to the four major STs, referred to as pandemic clones (ST69, ST73, ST95 and ST131) that caused nearly half of the bloodstream infections (44.19%, 1438/3254)11. Thus, a total of 2045 isolates (62.85% of the NORM collection) were selected for long-read sequencing, representing 216 distinct STs covering the entire ExPEC phylogeny (Fig. S2).

Highly contiguous assemblies were obtained for 1999 genomes (Fig. S3A) with median N50 chromosome length 4.98 Mbp (Fig. S3B) and an average L50 chromosome count 1.09. A total of 5417 contigs were identified as plasmid-derived, including 4485 circular plasmid sequences, collectively here referred to as the plasmidome. Chromosome lengths differed significantly between the major clones (Fig. S3C, p-value < 0.05), where ST69 and ST73 showed a larger chromosome size on average compared to ST95 and ST131. The total length and the number of plasmid sequences observed per isolate was significantly lower for ST73 (p-value < 0.05) compared to the other major clones (Fig. S3D). This finding confirms previous reports showing that ST73 frequently carries lower plasmid load, demonstrated by lower conjugation frequencies and higher fitness costs32,33.

To type the circular plasmid sequences (n = 4485) identified from the hybrid assemblies, we first removed redundancy with cd-hit-est resulting in a set of 2560 non-redundant plasmid sequences (Fig. S4). Next, we applied our previously developed method ‘mge-cluster', that is well-suited for typing plasmid sequences derived from large studies34. To ensure robust typing results, we clustered plasmids using a weighted undirected network based on multiple runs of mge-cluster with distinct parameter combinations. In the resulting network, nodes correspond to plasmids and edges to the association strength among plasmids co-clustering together in the distinct solutions (see Methods).

The network consisted of 15 components (connected subgraphs) encompassing 2392 non-redundant plasmid sequences (93%) while 168 sequences remained as singletons (7%) (Fig. S4). Next, we used a popular community detection algorithm based on modularity optimization (Louvain method) to assign highly connected communities into non-overlapping groups (bins)35. After quality control (see Methods), 2285 non-redundant plasmids were clustered into 30 distinct groups referred to as plasmid types (pTs) labeled with two digits representing their network component and the community bin defined by the Louvain algorithm (Fig. S4). To obtain a consistent typing scheme and a compact visualization (Fig. 1), we selected the mge-cluster solution (perplexity = 62, cluster size = 49) closest (adjusted Rand index 0.99) to the network typing system.

A Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the 1999 ExPEC isolates with an associated hybrid assembly. Isolates corresponding to the ten most prevalent sequence types (ST) in the NORM study are indicated with a distinct color and their position marked in the phylogeny. In the case of ST131, the distinct clades present in the clone (A, B, C1, C2) are represented. B The closest mge-cluster solution (perplexity = 62, minimum cluster size = 49) to the network approach was considered to visualize the position of the pTs in the 2D embedding space. For visualization purposes, we computed the mean tsne1D and tsne2D coordinates of all sequences belonging to each pT and considered those coordinates to represent the position and anchor each pT in the embedding. Each pT is labeled with its associated pT consisting of two digits indicating their graph component and associated bin and its size is proportional to the average plasmid length. C Barplot indicating the total number of plasmid sequences assigned to each pT and belonging to the main STs found in the ExPEC collection.

Finally, the redundant sequences (n = 1925) discarded by cd-hit were assigned to the same pT as their representative sequence (Fig. S4). Using the existing operational mode of mge-cluster, we could further assign 498 non-circular plasmid sequences to specific pTs without the need to re-consider the entire network and to modify the typing scheme. In total, 4569 plasmid sequences (84%, 4569/5417: 4071 circular and 498 non-circular) were assigned to the 30 defined pTs (Fig. S4) representing the ExPEC plasmidome.

Figure 1A shows the maximum likelihood phylogeny of the 1999 ExPEC isolates with hybrid assemblies, based on core genome variation. To avoid visual overloading of the phylogeny, only the ten most prevalent STs are labeled, including the subclades of ST131 (A, B, C1, C2) which have been of wide interest to the research community given their rapid diversification and distinct evolutionary trajectories. Joint inspection of the pT map (Fig. 1B) and the corresponding frequency distribution of individual pTs (Fig. 1C) reveals that both the smallest plasmids (e.g. pT3-3, pT4-1, pT7-1, pT20-1) and large plasmids (e.g. pT1-1, pT1-3, pT5-1, pT8-2) can be widely disseminated across the phylogeny, indicating their persistence in the population by successful horizontal transfer. In a stark contrast, only some large plasmids display a much narrower phylogenetic distribution and evidence of overwhelmingly clonal expansion aided by their host lineage (pT1-4, pT8-1, pT10-1). Comparison of the plasmidome structure for the genomes sequenced in this study (Fig. 1B) with that of the published plasmid sequences of E. coli as delineated recently34 revealed a very high degree of congruence between the two (adjusted Rand Index 0.94; a standard measure of congruence between two partitions of data). This suggests that plasmid evolution in ExPEC is more constrained than previously considered, and that there are only a limited number of successful plasmid backbones which can serve as stable vehicles for the dissemination of advantageous genes.

To link our assigned pTs with existing plasmid classification and typing schemes, we identified the dominating replicons (PlasmidFinder), plasmid MLST schemes (pmlst) and checked their congruence with another well-established plasmid typing tool (MOB-suite) (Supplementary Data 2). In a previous publication34, we showed that mge-cluster and MOB-suite were concordant on the typing of E. coli plasmids, but mge-cluster was generally better at grouping together sequences with a shared plasmid backbone. For each pT, we further determined the degree of gene sharing, predicted mobility (conjugative, mobilizable or non-mobilizable) and the presence of antibiotic and virulence genes (Supplementary Data 2).

Our analyses revealed that all pTs with a large average plasmid size (>100 kb) contained IncF variant replicons, harbored antibiotic and/or virulence determinants, and displayed high degrees of gene sharing (Fig. S5) as measured by their containment index36. Our results support large plasmids as a key source of bacterial adaptive traits.

Gene synteny analysis (minimum identity 0.8) among representative sequences of large IncF pTs (>100 kb) (Fig. 2) revealed the presence of large genomic blocks in common including siderophore-operons (iroBCDEN, iutA-iucABCD and sitABCD operons), antibiotic resistance genes and the prototypical conjugation F-type transfer system. By increasing the stringency to create a link between genes in synteny (minimum identity 0.99) (Fig. S6), we observed that the F-type transfer region among pTs 8-2/9-1/10-1 and pTs 2-1/2-2/2-3 was highly conserved and these pTs differ mainly by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. Our data initially suggested that these pTs have recently evolved from the same ancestral pT and we confirmed this by reconstructing a recombination-free phylogeny using the aligned plasmid sequences from each combination of plasmid types (Fig. S7), which showed that pT 8-2 and pT 2-3 were the ancestral plasmid types. Furthermore, pT 9-1 and pT 2-2 arose respectively from pT 10-1 and pT 2-1. In addition, these pTs were clustered in the same group by MOB-suite confirming their relatedness (Supplementary Data 2).

For each pT, we selected a plasmid sequence (tagged with its sequence ID) representing the most predominant features present in the cluster (as summarized in Supplementary Data 2). The gene synteny analysis was performed using clinker88 considering a minimum identity threshold of 0.8 to draw a link between genes. Virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using the EcOH database81 (indexed in Abricate) and AMRFinderPlus82 and their names curated according to well-studied ExPEC reference plasmids.

After elucidating and typing the ExPEC plasmidome, we explored whether particular pTs could have contributed to the success of pandemic ExPEC clones. We focused our analyses on pTs corresponding to medium and large plasmids (>10 kb) and in more detail on pColV-like and pUTI89-like plasmids which have previously been linked to: (i) ExPEC virulence, (ii) adaptive traits influencing host range, (iii) zoonotic potential, and (iv) antibiotic resistance carriage37,38,39,40. To this end, we inferred the evolutionary rates and dated the phylogenies of the four major clones (ST69, ST73, ST95, ST131) using BactDating41 and further detected probable clonal expansions associated with the acquisition of pTs using CaveDive42. This permitted us to estimate when ExPEC clones may have acquired specific pTs and whether a clonal expansion was followed by that association.

ST95, an ExPEC clone mostly susceptible to antibiotics, showed a high prevalence (37%) of the pColV-like plasmid pT 10-1 (Fig. S8). As illustrated in Fig. 2, this plasmid possesses all features representative of pColV-like plasmids37 including several iron-acquisition mechanisms (salmochelin, aerobactin), bacteriocin genes involved in clone competition (microcin V, colicin Ia)38,43, immune evasion genes conferring resistance to serum (iss)39 and virulence genes (e.g. hlyF)44. The distribution of pT 10-1 in the phylogeny of ST95 (Fig. 3A) suggests that the plasmid was introduced in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of ST95 dating back to 1768 (95% CI, 1721–1806). Furthermore, the major branch leading from the root of ST95 was identified as a clonal expansion occurring in 1823 (95% CI, 1789-1851). By comparing plasmid versus core-genome distances, we observed a positive correlation (0.78) between pT 10-1 and ST95 phylogenies further supporting that the plasmid has been vertically transmitted in ST95 instead of being repeatedly acquired (Fig. S9A). However, we cannot discard the possibility of a joined transfer evolution event for which pT 10-1 has been horizontally acquired several times and clonally expanded afterwards. In some instances, we observed the replacement of pT 10-1 with pT 9-1, the alternate version of the pColV-like plasmid characterized by the presence of an antibiotic and heavy-metal resistance gene cassette. A particular clade of ST95 (fimH41:O1/O2:H7) showed multiple and independent replacements of pT 10-1 with pT 2-3 (Fig. S8, Fig. S9B), a pUTI89-like plasmid labeled by the pmlst scheme as F29:A-:B10. This plasmid has been characterized by its immune evasion properties45, and by playing an important role in virulence and biofilm regulation (senB and parAB genes)46,47.

A Dated phylogeny of ST95 with clades indicated based on fimH/O/H typing and presence/absence of the pColV-like plasmids (pTs 10-1 and 9-1) and the pUTI89-like plasmid (pT 2-3). B Dated phylogeny of ST69 with clades indicated based on fimH/O/H typing and presence/absence of the pUTI89-like plasmid (pT 2-2). C Dated phylogeny of ST73 with clades indicated based on fimH/O/H typing and presence/absence of the pT 13-1. D Dated phylogeny of ST131 with clades indicated based on existing nomenclature (A, B, B0, C0, C1, C2), fimH/O/H typing and presence/absence of multiple associated pTs.

The basal part of the ST69 phylogeny represents isolates notably void of larger plasmid carriage, suggesting that such plasmids did not play a central role in the early evolution of this lineage (Fig. 3B). However, a particular clade of ST69 (fimH27:O17/O15:H18/H4) showed the ubiquitous presence of the plasmid type pT 2-2, a pUTI89-like plasmid version highly similar to the pT 2-3 described in the specific clade of ST95. In contrast, this plasmid harbors several antibiotic resistance genes providing resistance to multiple antibiotic groups (e.g. β-lactams, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and trimethoprim) and to heavy-metals (mercury) (Fig. 2). The plasmid type was estimated to be acquired around ~1990 (95% CI, 1986–1992) and notably this acquisition was nested with a major expansion event occurring two nodes earlier in the tree (1987, 95% CI, 1984–1990).

Consistent with its generally smaller inferred plasmidome size (Fig. S3D), ST73 only carries large plasmids in a minority of isolates (181/560, 32%). Out of these, the plasmid type pT 13-1 (prevalence 18%) (Fig. S8) encoding similar virulence traits as pUTI89-like plasmids (e.g. senB) has been introduced multiple times into ST73. In particular, we detected a clonal expansion event in 1983 (95% CI, 1977-1989) after the plasmid had acquired the β-lactamase blaSHV-1 gene, displaying increased ampicillin resistance, around 80 years after the initial pT 13-1 acquisition (1900, 95% CI 1877-1919) into the ST73 fimH10:O6:H1 clade (Supplementary Data 3, Fig. 3C). This IncF plasmid (pmlst F51:A-:B10) frequently encoded several antibiotic resistance genes including β-lactam (blaSHV-1, blaTEM-1), aminoglycoside (aadA1, aph(3”)-Ib, aph(6)-Id) and sulfonamide (sul1, sul2) resistance genes (Supplementary Data 1) and has been shown to be associated with a higher carriage of resistance genes within ST7348. Despite the general trend of susceptibility for this clone, this demonstrates that particular subclades of ST73 can become multi-drug resistant by incorporating this plasmid type.

In agreement with previous reports based on short-read sequencing data24,28, we observed strong plasmid-clade associations between particular IncF pTs and ST131 clades. In clade A (fimH41:O16:H5), the most basal clade of ST131, pT 1-1 was present in the MRCA of the clade (1984, 95% CI 1978-1989) and later replaced around 1991 (95% CI, 1986-1996) by pUTI89-like plasmids (pTs 2-1, 2-2). The branch where this plasmid-type replacement occurred was inferred to correspond to a clonal expansion event estimated to have occurred around 1992 (95% CI, 1988-1996), recapitulating the detected association between plasmid and clonal expansion observed for ST69.

In clade B (fimH22:O25:H4), which is generally strongly associated with antibiotic susceptibility11, we observed a similar plasmid distribution as described above for ST95. The pColV-like plasmid, pT 9-1, was introduced in a sublineage of clade B around 1955 (95% CI, 1944-1964) while the pUTI89-like plasmid (pT 2-3) entered between 1957 and 1981 (95% CI, 1946-1986) in another clade B sublineage (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Data 3).

Finally, we explored the plasmid associations in clade C (fimH30:O25:H4) which is characterized by gyrA and parC mutations conferring fluoroquinolone resistance, and further subdivided into C1 (associated with the blaCTX-M-27 allele) and C2 lineages (associated with blaCTX-M-15). ST131-C1 showed a high prevalence of pT 1-1 (pmlst F1:A2:B20) (Fig. S8). Its distribution suggests that this plasmid was present in the MRCA of ST131-C1 (~1993, 95% CI 1989-1996) (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Data 3). This plasmid encodes for the senB gene cluster and frequently harbors multiple non-fixed antibiotic resistance genes, including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-27 genes (β-lactams), or aac(3)-IId (aminoglycoside) among others. In contrast, ST131-C2 harbored pT 8-1 (pmlst F36:A4:B58) (Fig. 2) which was also present in its basal subclade (C0) (Fig. 3D). This plasmid type contained a variable set of antibiotic resistance genes including the blaCTX-M-15 ESBL gene, dfrA17 (trimethoprim), aadA5 (aminoglycoside), and sul1 (sulfonamide) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1). pT 1-4 (pmlst F2:A1:B-, Supplementary Data 2) was introduced later in the ST131-C2 clade (~1992, 95% CI 1988-1996), rapidly increasing in prevalence and including the blaCTX-M-15 ESBL gene.

Taken together, IncF pColV- and pUTI89-like plasmids played a key role in the evolution of pandemic ExPEC clones and are associated with clonal expansion events often linked to antibiotic resistance gene acquisition.

We previously showed that antibiotic resistance is not the sole driver of clonal success, highlighted in particular by the stable circulation of ST95, ST73 and ST131-B clades which all remain largely susceptible to most classes of antibiotics11. Our data suggest the presence of bacteriocins encoded in pColV-like plasmids for both ST95 and ST131-B could play a fundamental role in bacterial competition. To investigate the role of bacteriocins across the entire set of lineages, we expanded our analysis by searching for genes coding for bacteriocins regardless of their genomic location.

The majority of identified bacteriocin genes were located on plasmids (Fig. 4A), with the exception of mchB, encoding microcin H47, typically found in the chromosome of ST73 isolates (Fig. 4B). The most frequently found plasmid-encoded bacteriocins were cvaC (microcin V) and colicin Ia (also termed as pECS88_0104) (Fig. 4A), typically co-occurring in the pColV-like plasmids (Figs. 2, 4). These corresponded to large plasmids (pTs 9-1, 10-1)(Supplementary Data 2) and were associated with ST131-B and ST95, respectively (Fig. 4B). Some of the pTs with smaller average sizes (pTs 3-3, 3-4) occasionally carried bacteriocins (Fig. 4A) and were found in a wide diversity of STs indicating multiple acquisitions/losses of the genes, but showed no evidence of clonal expansions in contrast with pColV-like plasmids (Fig. 4B).

A Stacked barplot showing the preferred genomic location of colicin genes: chromosome, plasmid, virus (bacteriophage) or unclassified (unknown). In the case of plasmid location, we have indicated the particular plasmid type (pT) associated. B Distribution of the colicin genes in the ExPEC phylogeny (as shown in Fig. 1A). Each colicin was colored according to whether the gene was encoded in the chromosome, plasmid, virus (bacteriophage) or an unclassified contig.

To elucidate the role of microcin V and colicin Ia in clone competition, we examined their activity experimentally. The microcin V gene cluster is composed of four genes (Fig. 5A): cvaC encodes the toxin, the immunity gene cvi encodes a peptide that protects the toxin-producing cells, and the genes cvaA and cvaB encode a secretion system to secret the toxin17. Production of microcin V is induced by iron limitation, and in target cells recognized by the siderophore receptor Cir17. When grown in iron-limiting conditions, the culture supernatants of three ST95 and one ST131-B plasmid-harboring isolates strongly inhibited the growth of the E. coli lab strain MG1655 (Fig. 5B). The killing effect was dose-dependent, which is consistent with bacteriocin activity and the absence of visible plaques ruled out bacteriophage-mediated killing. In the absence of induction, the ST95 isolate 27-61 (Supplementary Data 4) produced a weaker inhibition zone, possibly due to some basal expression of one of the two bacteriocins. As a further control, the ST131-B isolate 27-56 not harboring a bacteriocinogenic plasmid was unable to produce inhibition despite growing under iron-limiting conditions (Fig. 5B). The isolates 31-16 and 31-17 (Fig. 5) served as further controls (see Methods).

A Description of bacteriocinogenic plasmids from pT 9-1 (ST131 clade B) and pT 10-1 (ST95). These archetypical pColV-like plasmids encode two bacteriocin gene clusters: microcin V and colicin Ia. Darker and lighter arrows indicate respectively the toxin (cvaC, cia) and immunity genes (cvi, iia) of each cluster. Control isolates either harbor no plasmid (ST131 clade B isolate 27-56) or harbor plasmid versions encoding only a single bacteriocin (colicin Ia for ST131 B isolate 31-16, microcin V for ST95 isolate 31-17). B Susceptibility of E. coli MG1655 to microcin V. Production of microcin V is induced by iron limitation (simulated experimentally with the addition of the chelating agent 2,2'-bipyridyl). Bacteriocinogenic activity is demonstrated by growth inhibition in the spotted area (in a dilution-dependent way and without formation of individual plaques). C Susceptibility of E. coli MG1655 to colicin Ia. Production of colicin Ia is induced through SOS induction (stimulated experimentally with UV irradiation). Bacteriocinogenic activity is demonstrated as in B. Created in BioRender. Gama, J. (2025) https://BioRender.com/e79b562.

Having demonstrated that microcin V is functional, we further tested its range of activity against 51 E. coli isolates belonging to the four major STs, as well as against ST10, which is an ancestral clone ubiquitously present in the gut of mammals and avian species49,50. As expected, the bacteriocin-producing isolates mentioned above all displayed resilience to any of the corresponding four batches of microcin V, while 39 of the remaining 47 isolates were sensitive (Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 4). Sensitive isolates were generally inhibited by all four batches, except in a few cases where inhibition was only observed for the more concentrated bacteriocin batches (produced by isolates 23–46 and 27–61). Overall, ST69 and ST131 isolates were sensitive to the action of microcin V, while isolates belonging to the other STs displayed a more heterogeneous behavior. The supernatants of uninduced 27–61 and induced 27–56 (lacking colicinogenic plasmid) did not affect growth of the clinical isolates, as expected.

Pruned phylogeny of the 51 E. coli NORM isolates tested experimentally for bacteriocin susceptibility (right). Susceptibility to microcin V and colicin Ia is individually indicated in the heatmap in blue, while yellow indicates bacteriocin insensitivity (no effect detected). Isolates harboring the archetypical pColV-like bacteriocinogenic plasmids are indicated in gray.

The colicin Ia gene cluster is composed of two genes (Fig. 5A): ciaA encoding the respective toxin, and iia that encodes immunity. This colicin also uses the Cir receptor, and is induced by the SOS response43. The same four plasmid-harboring isolates used above were exposed to UV irradiation to induce the SOS response and consequently production of colicin Ia. All four culture supernatants inhibited the growth of E. coli MG1655 in a dose-dependent manner with no observable phage plaques (Fig. 5C). As shown for microcin V, the uninduced ST95 isolate 27-61 produced a weaker inhibition zone, while the induced ST131-B isolate 27-56 not harboring a colicinogenic plasmid was not affected. Testing the four supernatants against the 51 isolates mentioned above, only six displayed sensitivity (Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 4). Supernatants of isolates 27-56 (induced, no plasmid) and 27-61 (uninduced) did not display inhibitory activities.

Altogether, these results show that pColV-like plasmids present in ST95 and ST131-B encode functional bacteriocins, and in particular we show the microcin V gene cluster inhibits the growth of a wide range of E. coli isolates from different genetic backgrounds supporting their role in clone competition and possibly NFDS maintenance.

Plasmids are generally considered as the ultimate vehicle of rapid evolution in bacterial genomes, while also sometimes regarded as parasitic elements to their host cells14,15,16,51. Our analysis indicated that larger plasmids in E. coli are frequently associated with traits falling under bacterial competition, pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance among other traits which could not be annotated. A recent study comparing plasmids in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from bloodstream infections at a single hospital in the UK with those circulating globally showed that key antibiotic resistance loci such as extended-spectrum β-lactamases and carbapenemases were likely to “piggyback” common successful plasmid backbones, which increases the risk of their further dissemination27. In our study even many of the small plasmids were found to incorporate likely beneficial bacteriocin-producing systems, and were scattered around the population phylogeny, indicating their repeated horizontal acquisition, but lacking evidence of further clonal expansion.

Only two co-occurring plasmid-encoded bacteriocins (microcin V and colicin Ia) were frequent enough and showed evidence of clonal expansion in different genetic backgrounds to indicate a major role in colonization competition and contribution towards maintaining stable population equilibrium. To further examine their role in competition, we experimentally confirmed the ability of microcin V to inhibit the majority of frequently observed clones in the population that lack this system. Notably, this bacteriocin shows a stable association with lineages/clades displaying a notable degree of susceptibility to antibiotics (ST95, ST131-B) and is able to inhibit isolates from the most successful multi-drug resistant lineages/clades (ST69, ST131-C1, ST131-C2), suggesting it is an important factor contributing to the continued maintenance of the susceptible lineages in the population. Similarly, only a single dominant chromosomal bacteriocin, the microcin H47, was identified in our collection. Characteristics of these bacteriocins thus stand in stark contrast with the substantial bacteriocin diversity previously found to contribute to the maintenance of a stable equilibrium in the Streptococcus pneumoniae population over time22. However, two ST10 isolates were found insensitive to microcin V, despite lacking this bacteriocin-producing system. This is well aligned with the frequently observed colonization ability of ST10 and its lower virulence potential49 that was recently quantified at the population level by systematically comparing neonatal colonization rates with those observed in bloodstream infections5. Why a subset of ST10 population would remain insensitive to microcin V is currently unclear and warrants further investigation into evasion of the effects of these inhibition mechanisms.

The unique characteristics of our dataset allowed detection of multiple events of phenotypic evolution following the same path across distant lineages, associated with acquisition and stable maintenance of certain plasmid types over time. In addition to the same plasmid-based bacteriocin-producing systems observed in ST95 and ST131-B discussed above, these two distant lineages display congruent phenotypes also in other clades, that host plasmids different from the pColV-like plasmids. These correspond to the widely studied reference plasmid pUTI89, encoding virulence traits archetypal for uropathogenesis45. In both evolutionary backgrounds, these clades were non-overlapping with the clades hosting pColV-like plasmid, and have been found to be strongly associated with avian pathogenic E. coli25,38,52. ST131-B has been previously widely indicated as a foodborne uropathogen, in particular related to consumption of poultry meat53,54. Combined, this evidence indicates that ST95 and ST131-B lineages circulating in human hosts are stably divided into human vs. avian adapted subclades assisted by their plasmid-associated traits, and that the latter likely reflects a constant spillover from the avian niche via foodborne transmission24,25. Interestingly, the estimated timing of the pColV-like plasmid acquisition in ST131-B during 1950-60 s coincides with a rapidly intensifying poultry production in many countries after WW2, which may have provided an opportunity for E. coli equipped with particular plasmid-derived traits to quickly expand in this niche.

Similar to the previously discussed observations, ST69 and ST131-A display clades characterized by a shared plasmid content, which we showed arose from the pUTI89-like virulence plasmids and absorbed additional resistance genes that remain in a stable association with the virulence determinants. This again exemplifies plasmid-associated phenotypic evolution following the same trajectory in two lineages belonging to different phylogroups (D, B2). ST69 was originally detected in an outbreak in California55, and later epidemiological investigation suggested it emerged in the late 1990s and then became endemic globally within 10 years56. Our dating analysis gives the narrow time interval between 1987–1992 for the acquisition of the plasmid which ultimately led to a global dissemination of this clone with the specific virulence and antibiotic resistance characteristics. Further, as shown by our results, this evolutionary process closely reflects the parallel acquisition of the same plasmid by ST131-A subclade, which is again associated with remarkably similar epidemiological characteristics, i.e. a rapid expansion11,12 and global endemicity over time. These two evolutionary trajectories across the successful lineages of E. coli bear the same hallmarks as the convergence of hypervirulence and multi-drug resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae, which were first identified as non-overlapping traits57, but later studies pinpointed to plasmid-driven merging of the two in particular genetic backgrounds58,59.

Our observations of multiple cases of highly similar phenotypic evolution in distant genetic backgrounds by plasmids as a vehicle, suggests that they function as a significant means for new clones to first establish, and then later endemically sustain themselves in a host population. Future studies, including mechanistic modeling of plasmid evolution and maintenance, could shed further light on the factors that clone success ultimately depends on.

Despite the strong association between specific plasmid types, we observed that some isolates across the phylogeny have lost their associated plasmid. The normalized coverage of those plasmid types in the hybrid assemblies suggests that a proportion of the cells sequenced have lost the plasmid as they are present in a copy number lower than the chromosome. Such lower coverage could be explained by deletions of large plasmid regions, which can be adaptive by rendering plasmid variants less costly relative to the original plasmid23,60. Plasmid stability within its bacterial host is dependent on the ecological context, and some of the isolates could lose the associated plasmid when cultivated in the lab environment61. In addition, some E. coli plasmids carrying ESBL genes have lower fitness costs for the population when present in low frequencies62. Altogether, these factors could thus hide the true prevalence of some of the plasmid types we identified in the ExPEC clones. It should further be noted that the current analysis does not prove the causal roles of the plasmids that were found to be associated with the inferred clonal expansions, despite that the combined evidence from functional characterization and population genomic modeling is strong. Indeed, predicting the stability of a plasmid in a host population is a difficult endeavor63,64,65,66. Plasmid-host associations result from multiple factors such as the level of benefit provided by the plasmid67, the ability to acquire compensatory events during co-evolution65, the pre-existence of host genotypes that favor the acquisition/maintenance of a plasmid67,68,69,70, as well as the ecological context71,72. Furthermore, the highlighted ExPEC plasmids might provide essential bacterial traits for the survival, evolution and/or competition of the distinct lineages which could result in oversampling isolates carrying those particular plasmids and potentially affecting their true prevalence in the population. Definite causal quantification of the impact of these plasmids is challenging to obtain since the conditions for their expansions in the human host population are very difficult to replicate in any experimental setting and a counterfactual analysis remains practically an impossibility in this ecological context.

To resolve the accessory genome and mobile genetic elements of the extensive Norwegian Surveillance System for Resistant Microbes (NORM) ExPEC population11, we selected 2045 isolates (2045/3254, 62.85%) for long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing and, subsequently, for hybrid assembly. This selection was performed following a two-step strategy. First, to ensure that the resulting genomes represented the accessory genome diversity inherent in the NORM collection, 1085 isolates (1085/2045, 53.06%) were selected regardless of their clonal complex using an unbiased statistical approach specifically designed for selecting representative isolates for long-read sequencing31 (Fig. S1A). Briefly, we considered the presence/absence matrix of the orthologous genes computed by Panaroo (version 1.2.3)73 on the 3254 Illumina assemblies11 and color the isolates based on their previously described PopPUNK (version 2.0.2) groups11,74. From these, we used the k-means algorithm to select 1085 isolates on the dimensionally reduced matrix computed by t-sne (perplexity = 30) (R stats package Rtsne, version 0.15) considering Jaccard distances as input.

Second, we focused on the four major ExPEC clones (ST73, ST95, ST131 and ST69) and sequenced all their remaining isolates not selected within the first step (960/2045, 46.94%). This permitted us to directly estimate the prevalence of particular plasmid types among the four major ExPEC clones.

Long-read sequencing of the 2045 isolates was performed using a high-throughput multiplexing approach based on ONT reads31. All the isolates were separately grown on MacConkey agar No. 3 (Oxoid Ltd., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C overnight. Individual colonies were picked for overnight growth at 37 °C in 1.6 mL LB (Miller) broth (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) each. Genomic high-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from cell pellets using MagAttract R HMW DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to a final elution volume of 100 μL. Output concentration and DNA integrity were measured using NanoDropOne spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The samples were then adjusted to 400 ng for long-read sequencing. The ONT libraries were prepared using SQK-LSK109(-XL) or SQK-NBD110-96 barcoding kit for 24- and 96-barcoding runs, respectively, and 40 fmol per sample was loaded onto FLO-MIN106 flow cells. Sequencing was run for 72 h on GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) using MinKNOW Core versions 3.6.0 to 4.2.5. Basecalling and demultiplexing were performed using Guppy versions 3.2.8 to 4.3.4, with fast basecalling for the 24-barcoding and high-accuracy basecalling for the 96-barcoding runs.

ONT long reads were combined with the existing short-read data11 using a previously published hybrid assembly pipeline75 publicly available at https://gitlab.com/sirarredondo/hybrid_assembly. This pipeline is largely based on Unicycler (version 0.4.7) and was designed to automate the generation of (near-)complete genomes.

In total, we could obtain a hybrid assembly for 1999 genomes (1999/2045, 97.75%). The information derived from Unicycler regarding the length, circularity and depth of each contig was extracted and considered for the downstream analyses. The hybrid assemblies were split into individual contigs and circlator (version 1.5.5)76 was used with the command fixstart to rotate the starting position of each contig. A phylogeny displaying the species wide coverage of the hybrid data and complete sampling of the four major lineages was created by mapping illumina reads for each of isolates with hybrid assemblies to the ExPEC EC958 (GCF_000285655) reference and building a SNP-sites phylogeny with IQtree77.

Each contig was classified either as chromosome-derived, plasmid-derived or virus-derived (bacteriophage) considering both the predictions of mlplasmids (species ‘Escherichia coli') (version 2.1.0) and geNomad (command end-to-end) (version 1.5.0)78. First, contigs were labeled as chromosomal if they either had a size larger than 500 kbp or a mlplasmids chromosome probability higher than 0.7 and geNomad chromosome score higher than 0.7. Second, contigs were labeled as plasmids if they had a minimum mlplasmids plasmid probability of 0.3 and geNomad plasmid score of 0.7. These settings were used to compensate for the number of false negative predictions reported previously for mlplasmids using the E. coli model79. Third, contigs not meeting any of the previous criteria were classified as virus-derived if they had a minimum geNomad virus score of 0.7. Fourth, the remaining contigs were considered as unclassified.

Prokka (version 1.14.6)80 using the genus Escherichia and species coli was considered to annotate each of the contigs resulting from the hybrid assemblies. Abricate (version 1.0.1) (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) coupled with the databases of PlasmidFinder81, ecoli_vf (https://github.com/phac-nml/ecoli_vf), and EcOH82 was used to assign the presence (minimum identity and coverage of 80%) of plasmid replicon sequences, E. coli known virulence factors (including colicin genes) and E. coli O-H serotype predictions respectively. AMRFinderPlus (version 3.10.18)83 using the flag --plus and Escherichia as organism was also considered to identify antibiotic resistance, stress-response and virulence genes. The presence of plasmid replicon sequences was assessed using PlasmidFinder81, while relaxases, mate-pair formation types and the predicted mobility of the contig was computed using the module mob_typer (version 3.0.3) of MOB-suite84,85. The latter tool was used to extract the ‘primary_cluster_id' which clusters sequences based on a fixed Mash distance threshold85. Plasmid multi-locus sequence typing (pMLST) was computed using the IncF, IncA/C, IncHI1, IncHI2, IncI1, IncN and pbssb1-family schemes using the pmlst.py script available at https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/pmlst81. For the plasmids with an IncF scheme annotation, we reported the FAB formula to contextualize them with previous literature.

We removed the redundancy within the set of circular plasmid sequences using cd-hit-est (version 4.8.1)86,87 using a sequence identity threshold of 0.99, alignment coverage of 0.9 and length difference cutoff of 0.9. Cd-hit-est computed a total of 2560 clusters from which a single representative sequence was chosen.

The set of non-redundant plasmid sequences (n = 2560) was considered as input for performing the plasmid clustering based on mge-cluster (version 1.1.0)34. This tool relies on two main parameters: perplexity and minimum cluster size. To avoid choosing an arbitrary parameter selection, we explored the hyperparameter space with: (i) perplexity values ranging from 10 to 100 and (ii) minimum cluster size values ranging from 10 to 50. By selecting 100 random combinations of these two parameters, we generated 100 distinct models with mge-cluster using the --create operational mode considering a unitig filtering variance of 0.01. For obtaining a robust plasmid assignment, we only considered plasmids with a minimum membership probability of belonging to a specific cluster (‘Standard Cluster') of 0.8. The distinct mge-cluster models were combined into a single solution using a co-occurrence network approach. In this case, the network consisted of nodes belonging to plasmids (n = 2560) and edges to indirect connections with a weight ranging from 0 (plasmids are never part of the same cluster in the solutions) to 100 (plasmids are part of the same cluster in all solutions).

This network was scanned with the Louvain algorithm available in the R igraph package (version 1.2.6) to detect highly-connected communities within each non-singleton graph component, establishing a modularity threshold of 0.2. These communities were considered as plasmid types (referred as pTs) and are labeled using two digits representing their network component and their inferred community bin. For each pT, we discarded any sequences differing by two standard-deviations of the average plasmid length. This criteria was included to ensure that only plasmids with a similar size were part of the same pT.

To validate and contextualize the resulting pTs, the circular and non-redundant plasmid sequences of each pT were sketched (k = 31,scaled=1000,noabund) with sourmash (version 4.8.2)36 and a containment matrix computed using the command compare and the flag --containment. This matrix contains containment values corresponding to the fraction of a particular sketch found in a second sketch. The containment values were averaged within and between pTs. For each pT, we reported the most predominant (prevalence > 0.3) (i) replicon found by PlasmidFinder, (ii) pMLST scheme, (iii) mobility (conjugative, mobilizable, non-mobilizable) as reported by MOB-suite, (iv) cluster id (‘primary_cluster_id') reported by MOB-suite, (v) antibiotic resistance genes detected by AMRFinderPlus, and (vi) virulence genes detected by ecoli_vf (part of abricate). This information was summarized in Supplementary Data 2.

The redundant sequences discarded by cd-hit (n = 1925) were assigned to the same pT as their representative sequence.

The results of the plasmid typing approach based on the co-occurrence network were compared to the 100 distinct solutions provided by mge-cluster using the adjusted Rand Index implemented in the R package mclust (version 5.4.7). The most similar solution provided by mge-cluster (perplexity = 62, minimum cluster size = 49) was used to visualize the clustering of the network approach by anchoring the sequences in a 2D embedding space. In addition, we used this solution in combination with the --existing operational mode to predict the position in the 2D embedding space of non-circular plasmid sequences (n = 932) and the following well-studied ExPEC plasmids: CP000244 (pUTI89), CP007150 (pRS218), CU928146 (pECOS88), CU928148 (p1ESCUM), DQ381420 (pAPEC-O1-ColBM), EU330199 (pVM01), LQHK01000003 (pG150_1) and NC_022651 (pJJ1886_5). These sequences were assigned to the same pT as their closest (Euclidean distance) circular plasmid sequence. We only considered predictions differing by less than two standard-deviations of the average pT plasmid length.

For the pTs corresponding to large (>100 kbp) IncF plasmids pTs (1-1, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 9-1, 10-1, 13-1, 14-1), we selected a plasmid sequence representative of the most common pMLST annotation and antibiotic resistance/virulence gene content of the cluster and with the earliest year of isolation (Supplementary Data 2). The starting position of these sequences was changed to their IncFIB replicon using circlator (version 1.5.5)76 with the command fixstart. Clinker (version 0.0.21)88 with default settings was used to perform a gene synteny analysis and visualize which genomic blocks were shared among pTs, considering a minimum sequence identity of 0.8 (Fig. 2) and 0.99 (Fig. S6) to draw a link between genes.

We performed recombination-free phylogenies using the circular plasmid sequences from pTs 8-2, 9-1, 10-1 and 2-1, 2-2, 2-3. To create a core-genome alignment from these pairs of pTs, we used snippy (version 4.6.0) https://github.com/tseemann/snippy which mapped the sequences from pTs 8-2, 9-1, 10-1 and 2-1, 2-2, 2-3 against the reference genomes 30348_1#293_2 (pT 10-1) and 30224_1#245_5 (pT 2-3), respectively. The resulting core genome alignment was polished using the module from snippy (snippy-clean_full_aln). Gubbins (version 3.1.3)89 was used to compute a recombination-free phylogeny of the pTs using 100 bootstrap replicates, 50 algorithm iterations, and RAxML90 as the application for model fitting and other default settings (GTRGAMMA as nucleotide substitution model). The branch lengths of the resulting trees are measured as substitutions per site multiplied by the number of recombination-filtered SNPs.

The four major ExPEC clones were each mapped to a reference genome belonging to that lineage and recombination was removed using Gubbins v2.4.189. Gubbins output was supplied to the R package BactDating v1.1.1 41 in three replicates and one with randomized tip dates. The R CaveDive package v0.1.1 was used to detect probable expansion events in the dated phylogeny42. To report the dates of the distinct plasmid acquisition or introduction dates, we indicate in the text the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals (CI). For instance, pT 8-1 was acquired by ST131 from 1979 (95% CI 1971-1986) to 1984 (95% CI 1978-1989) (Supplementary Data 2). This is reported in the text as acquired around ~1981 (95% CI 1971-1989).

We aimed to investigate whether pColV-like plasmids had a role in mediating bacterial competition, and selected four isolates carrying pColV-like plasmids (predicted to encode both microcin V and colicin Ia) for experimental work. When selecting the isolates we aimed to minimize potential confounding factors (e.g., presence of additional bacteriocins), and include strains that could serve as controls as well. The features of these isolates are summarized in Supplementary Data 4: pT of the pColV-like plasmid, bacteriocins encoded and respective genomic location.

We produced four independent batches of microcin V by growing plasmid-harboring isolates 23-46, 27-20, 27-61 (ST95) and 28-33 (ST131 clade B) for 20 h at 37 °C with aeration in 10 mL Lysogeny Broth (LB; LB Broth, Miller, Difco) with 0.2 mM 2,2'-bipyridyl (to limit iron availability; Sigma-Aldrich). The cultures were then centrifuged (4000 rpm, 10 min), filtered (0.2 μm polyethersulfone filter; VWR), and stored at 4 °C. As controls, a plasmid-free ST131 clade B isolate 27-56 was treated in the same conditions, while isolate 27-61 was further treated without induction (no 2,2'-bipyridyl added).

To produce batches of colicin Ia, the four plasmid-harboring isolates mentioned above were grown in 10 mL LB overnight (15–16 h) at 37 °C with aeration, centrifuged (4000 rpm, 10 min) and then the pellets were resuspended in 10 mL PBS. The suspensions were UV-irradiated (254 nm wavelength) with a dose of 0.36 mW/cm2/second for 10 s. 500 μL from these irradiated suspensions were inoculated into 9.5 mL LB and incubated 4 h at 37 °C with aeration (covered in aluminum foil to prevent photoreactivation). The cultures were then centrifuged (4000 rpm, 10 min), filtered (0.2 μm polyethersulfone filter; VWR), and stored at 4 °C. As controls, the plasmid-free isolate 27-56 was treated in the same conditions, while isolate 27–61 was further treated without induction (no UV-irradiation).

51 NORM isolates (Supplementary Data 4), as well as E. coli MG1655, were grown in 1 mL LB in 96-deep-well plates overnight at 37 °C with aeration. Indicator plates were prepared by inoculating 15 μL of each overnight culture into 15 mL LB top agar (LB with 0.75% agar; Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.1 mM 2,2'-bipyridyl (to limit iron availability and promote expression of the colicin receptor Cir). 10 μL of each bacteriocin and control batch were spotted on indicator plates, which were incubated overnight at 30 °C after drying. These assays were performed three independent times. E. coli MG1655 was further exposed to 10-fold dilutions of the bacteriocin batches to verify the characteristic dose-dependent inhibition and exclude phage activity.

During pilot experiments to optimize the conditions for these assays we generally observed a lack of inhibitory effect during the assay if the indicator strain was not growing in iron limitation conditions (data not shown). We argue that the probability of the pColV-carrying isolates to encode undetected inhibitory factors that behave exactly (e.g., same induction conditions and required cell receptor) like the predicted bacteriocins would be quite rare. Especially considering the conserved patterns observed with both ST95 and ST131-B isolates. Thus we can likely exclude the effect of bacteriocins not predicted from the sequencing data. However, while most of the sensitive NORM isolates displayed sensitivity only against microcin V, the six sensitive to colicin Ia were sensitive to both bacteriocins. Because the supernatants could contain both bacteriocins (since at least one seems to be spontaneously produced at low concentrations), and they have a common receptor in target cells, we added a further control to unequivocally test the sensitivity of these isolates to each of the bacteriocins. From genomic data, a few isolates were predicted to encode only one of the bacteriocins and we used two of those (isolates 31–16 and 31–17) for further controls. These two isolates were treated, with and without specific induction for each bacteriocin, as described above. The ST95 isolate 31–17 encodes only microcin V, and produces inhibition only when grown under iron-limiting conditions (Fig. 5B). Alternatively, ST131-B isolate 31-16 encodes only colicin Ia and always produces inhibition, albeit at stronger levels upon SOS induction (Fig. 5C). Combined, this shows that the spontaneously produced bactericion is colicin Ia. This isolate is sensitive against the supernatant of 31-17, verifying the loss of the microcin V genes (lack of the immunity genes). Each of these two supernatants was tested against the six isolates mentioned above, and both were inhibitory to all six (as displayed in Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 4).

To select isolates for long-read sequencing, we used the presence/absence matrix inferred by Panaroo (version 1.2.3) on the short-read genomes of the 3254 isolates included in the NORM study. This matrix was embedded into 2D using the R package Rtsne (version 0.15). The k-means algorithm part of the R stats package (version 3.6.3) was used to allocate 1085 centroids and the ratio of the between-cluster sum of squares (betweenss) and the total sum of squares (totss) was considered to assess if the chosen isolates represented the diversity present in the 2D embedding.

The contiguity of the hybrid assemblies was given based on the N50 value reporting the sequence length of the shortest contig representing 50% of the total assembly length. This value was reported using exclusively contigs predicted as chromosome-derived which better reflects the contiguity status of a hybrid assembly as previously reported31.

The total sequence length of contigs predicted as chromosome and plasmid (termed plasmidome) was compared among ExPEC clones using the pairwise.wilcox.test function in the R package stats (version 3.6.3) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for accounting for multiple testing correction. In addition, the length of each plasmid contig was multiplied by its copy number as reported by Unicycler which normalizes the depth of contigs in the assembly graph to the median value. This was performed to evaluate the total number of base-pairs present in each genome devoted to plasmid sequences.

The cophenetic.phylo function from R package ape (version 5.5) was used to extract pairwise distances between the pairs of tips of the ExPEC phylogenies and specific pT phylogenies. Pearson correlation implemented in the R package stats (version 3.6.3) was used to estimate the correlation between plasmid-based (recombination-free) and ExPEC phylogenies (core-genome based) distances. A positive correlation among the two distances was considered suggestive of vertical transmission of the plasmid in the ExPEC phylogeny indicating a shared evolutionary history. In contrast, the lack of correlation between the two distances was indicative of multiple acquisitions of the same pT in the ExPEC phylogeny.

The R package Bactdating (version 1.1.1) was used to date the phylogenies of the ST69, ST73, ST95 and ST131 clones. We considered three independent models (replicates) and a model with randomized dates to infer the significance of the given dates. Each model ran through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of 100,000,000 generations sampled every 1000 states with a 10,000,000 burn-in using the Additive Relaxed Clock (ARC) model41. The three replicate MCMC chains were deemed to have converged with Gelman diagnostic of approximately 1 for mu, sigma and alpha using the coda R package91. We assessed whether the effective sample size (ESS) on the first replicate model was greater than 200 using the effectiveSize function of the coda R package91 and determined that the true dates model was better than the randomized dates model.

Pyrazoles are heterocycles commonly found as key substructures in agrochemicals and medicinally active compounds alike.1,2 Despite their pervasiveness, established methods fall notably short in delivering complex pyrazoles selectively due to issues of differentiation during either assembly or N-functionalization.3 This is a direct consequence of a dominant synthetic strategy that attempts to control selectivity-determining bonds between poorly differentiated starting materials. To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, “Strategic Atom Replacement”, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a “swap” of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.4,5 Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-Thiadiazine-S-Oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped.6 By proceeding via these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products.

Metrics details

Microbiota-mediated drug metabolism can affect pharmacological efficacy. Here we conducted a systematic comparative metabolomics investigation of drug metabolism modes by evaluating the impacts of human gut commensal bacteria on 127 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-targeted drugs. For the most extensively metabolized drugs in our screen, we elucidated both conventional and unconventional drug transformations and the corresponding activities of generated metabolites. Comparisons of drug metabolism by a gut microbial community versus individual species revealed both taxon intrinsic and collaborative processes that influenced the activity of the metabolized drugs against target GPCRs. We also observed iloperidone inactivation by generating unconventional metabolites. The human gut commensal bacteria mixture incorporated sulfur in the form of a thiophene motif, whereas Morganella morganii used a cascade reaction to incorporate amino-acid-derived tricyclic systems into the drug metabolites. Our results reveal a broad impact of human gut commensal bacteria on GPCR-targeted drug structures and activities through diverse microbiota-mediated biotransformations.

(a) Number of GPCRs and their class that interacted with the 127 selected drugs. The drug target information was obtained from the DrugBank database. (b) Mapping specific interactions between drugs and GPCRs. Agonist interactions were labeled in red and antagonist interactions were labeled in grey. Aligned with the prevalence of antagonistic GPCR drugs in the DrugBank database, our drug panel was composed primarily of antagonists (74.8 %, 95/127), but they were complemented with some agonists (20.5 %, 26/127) and dual-function drugs (4.7 %, 6/127).

(a) The bar graph illustrates that out of the screened 127 drugs, 12 were heavily consumed (drug consumed ≥ 80%). n = 3 biological replicates. Data represent mean ± s.d. (b) The EICs of parent drug ions for both Bac+ and Bac- (after 24 h of drug incubation) offer a relative quantification of their concentration in the supernatants. The significant differences in drug concentration observed between the presence and absence of bacteria strongly suggest that drug consumption is dependent on the presence of bacteria. The EICs (with a ± 20 ppm window) of drug ions were determined using the following ions: [M + H]+, m/z 559.2300 for olmesartan medoxomil; [M + H]+, m/z 569.1667 for azilsartan medoxomil; [M + H]+, m/z 389.2071 for trimethobenzamide; [M + H]+, m/z 412.2846 for fesoterodine; [M + H]+, m/z 497.2217 for selexipag; [M + H]+, m/z 427.2028 for iloperidone; [M + H]+, m/z 405.1921 for ozaminod; [M + H]+, m/z 461.1296 for ponesimod; [M + H]+, m/z 430.2224 for sarpogrelate; [M + H]+, m/z 501.1360 for SB756050; [M + H]+, m/z 388.2118 for Trimebutine; [M + H]+, m/z 457.1904 for GSK1292263. The experiment was conducted in triplicates for both Bac+ and Bac- conditions. Data are means ± SEM. n.d., not detected. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed t-test.

The chemical structures of SB756050 metabolites, including SB-487, SB-473, and SB-459, were determined through 2D NMR analysis of materials isolated from the culture broth. A chemical synthesis approach and/or standard comparison was used to determine the structures of the metabolites of GSK1292263 (GSK-459), olmesartan medoxomil (olmesartan), azilsartan medoxomil (azilsartan), selexipag (ACT-333679), sarpogrelate (sarpogrelate-330), and fesoterodine (fesoterodine-342). MS/MS analysis was used to predict the chemical structures of ponesimod-463a/463b, trimebutine-374, trimethobenzamide-361, trimethobenzamide-347, ozanimod-407, ozanimod-408, doxazosin-438, doxazosin-424, SB-445, and GSK-460. The chemical structures of the remaining metabolites were proposed based on MS analysis. Ten microbial transformations, including those of azilsartan medoxomil, olmesartan medoxomil, clopidogrel, selexipag, candesartan cilexetil, sarpogrelate, nicergoline, ozanimod, doxazosin, and fesoterodine, were conserved with the transformations observed in human metabolism.

Metrics details

Nitric oxide (NO) emissions pose significant environmental challenges that demand sustainable remediation strategies. Here we report an electrochemical approach to convert NO into salt-free, concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) using a carbon-based catalyst at near-ambient conditions. The system achieves >90% HNO3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100 mA cm−2 with pure NO and retains >70% FE with dilute NO (0.5 vol%). Mechanistic studies identified nitrous acid as a critical intermediate, diverging from conventional thermocatalytic nitrogen dioxide pathways. By implementing a vapour-fed strategy in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, we directly synthesized 32 wt% HNO3 from NO and deionized water, achieving 86% FE at 800 mA cm−2 without electrolyte additives or downstream purification. This work establishes an electrochemical route to valorize NO emissions to high-purity HNO3, advancing sustainable pollution mitigation and chemical manufacturing.

Metrics details

Although being highly demanded in organic electronics, functional conjugated polymers face challenges on scalable synthesis with batch uniformities. Here a reactivity-regulated sequent cross-coupling carbon–nitrogen polycondensation method is developed to enable the precise synthesis of functional polyarylamines with excellent batch-to-batch uniformity. It is revealed that the stepwise regulation of intermediate reactivities is key to accomplish controllable polycondensation via two sequent palladium-promoted carbon–nitrogen coupling cycles, which is distinct to the unicyclic carbon–carbon coupling. A variety of polyarylamines are prepared to improve the material functionalities, where a ternary polymer consisting of polar substituents is shown to optimize the interfacial and bulk properties of perovskite layers fabricated on top. The corresponding inverted perovskite solar cells achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 25.2% (active area, 5.97 mm2) and 23.2% (active area, 128 mm2), along with decent operational stabilities. Overall, this work provides an effective polymerization method for advanced conjugated polymers to enable high-performance optoelectronics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","We Played With the Nintendo Switch 2. It's Refined but Unsurprising","https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-the-nintendo-switch-2/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

the naming of Nintendo's Switch successor might seem like pretty straightforward choice, but developers say they spent years during the development process, brainstorming names and scrapping them. Eventually producer Kouichi Kawamoto, director Takuhiro Dohta, and technical director Tetsuya Sasaki landed on what was, for them, an unconventional route: the Switch 2.

They first discussed calling it the Super Nintendo Switch, Kawamoto told media during a private event held in New York City, paying homage to the jump from the original Nintendo to the Super Nintendo console—but there was an important distinction. The NES and SNES do not share compatibility between their games.

“We wanted to make sure that the name really reflected the idea that this is the latest Nintendo Switch, this is the latest standard, a new standard for what Nintendo Switch is,” Kawamoto said.

After a few hours spent with the hybrid handheld during a hands-on event, that description feels appropriate. The Switch 2 is not a leap forward, as the original Switch was from the Wii U, but rather a product of iteration. It's a collection of ideas and designs, refined, to create a product that feels both familiar and improved from its predecessor.

Mario Kart World is the Switch 2's key launch game.

It's bigger. Nintendo has increased the handheld's size from the original 6.2-inch screen to a 7.9-inch LCD display and magnetized its Joy-Con controllers, which are also slightly longer to accommodate the change. In my hands, the difference was barely noticeable. The Switch 2 feels comfortable to hold and play as a handheld, neither too heavy nor too clunky; I've had more difficult tactile upgrades with my iPhone.

At the event, I played the newly announced Mario Kart World both on the console itself and on a TV with the Joy-Cons attached to a Joy-Con grip. I've always preferred the original system's handheld mode, and the experience of playing on the Switch 2 is much the same.

The biggest change to the Joy-Con functionality is its new mouse-like mode. While the previous system's Joy-Cons slid off the handheld, those on the Switch 2 are magnetic; by clicking a release button on the controller's back, they snap off. To reattach, you simply snap them back on with a very satisfying click. But once detached from the handheld, both can be used, separately or together, as an impromptu mouse by placing them onto a surface at the point they'd typically attach.

My experience with the mouse functionality was a little hit or miss. I played two games which used it: Drag x Drive, a wheelchair basketball game, and Metroid 4: Beyond. Drag x Drive, announced at the event for a summer release, uses both Joy-Cons simultaneously, with the left and right controls corresponding to their respective wheel. To move, you push the Joy-Cons against whatever surface you can find—Nintendo set up a large, flat table for the demo, but they also worked well on the surface of my clothes, including tights, which means your lap will do in a pinch.

Drag x Drive is … tiring.

Using the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode.

The game requires constant motion with the Joy-Cons, whether you're sliding them across whatever available surface you've got to weave across the court, spinning your virtual wheels to do tricks, or taking aim for a shot by flipping your hand in the air. Technically, this all works just fine. But physically, it's tiring. My arms got sore quickly, and unless I decide to suddenly get very good at pilates, I can't imagine long play sessions.

Metroid 4: Beyond's experience was a far better one. As an admittedly terrible shot, my aim on a typical controller could use some work, and with the Joy-Cons detached and free to wave around, I'm even worse. With the new mouse functionality, however, I was able to use the right Joy-Con on a table to steady my wobbling and actually hit my targets.

Most impressive about the experience was being able to seamlessly switch from regular Joy-Con controls to the mouse functionality. But according to director Takuhiro Dohta, during a developer roundtable held with press, how players are able to use the feature is all down to the game. “We wanted that to be an available option for developers to explore,” Dohta said. “If a [developer] decides that it's actually better to have a setting or a switch that turns it from mouse control to Joy-Con control, that's also available.”

One downside to the Switch 2? A shorter battery life. The handheld will last from an estimated 2 to 6.5 hours—barely enough to get you through a flight from New York to California, if it holds the full charge. Compare that to a Switch OLED's 4.5 to nine hours, and it is a bit of a downgrade. The portability of the original Switch is what made it so special, and the prospect of both carrying its charger and finding a place to set up that charge on the go is a mark against an otherwise promising Switch successor.

According to the developers, the Switch 2 has a larger battery, but its life depends on how the system is being used. “There's a lot of the system side [that's] a lot more complex,” said director Takuhiro Dohta, pointing to features like the newly added Gamechat. It seems that using these features will make it more likely to drain the battery faster.

Other unknowns about the console include whether the team has finally managed to fix Joy-Con drift, a well-known issue with the original Switch where the the controller would trigger movement on its own.

When asked whether Nintendo had been able to fix this problem with its new console, technical director Tetsuya Sasaki replied only that the Joy-Con 2 controllers “have been really designed from the ground up from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movements and also, smoother movements.” Here's hoping.

While our time with the new console was short, and some unknowns remain, the Switch 2 certainly left us wanting more—with plenty more games and new features to dig into and understand. We'll bring you all of our thoughts on those and more in WIRED's full review, which should be out in time for the console's official launch on June 5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Blunt Force Trauma of the Trump Tariffs","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-tariffs-penguins/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:44:00 GMT","

There are situations in which tariffs are a useful tool to address a trade deficit, or to protect key sectors of a country's economy. Then there are situations where you accuse a bunch of penguins on an uninhabited island of currency manipulation. Guess which one we're living in?

This is the takeaway of the manifold tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the penguin-occupied Heard and McDonald Islands, the tariffs target the British Indian Ocean Territory, whose sole occupants live on a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia island. Yes, the United States is levying reciprocal tariffs against its own troops.

And then there are the tariffs against countries that have actual goods and services on which US consumers depend. China: 54 percent. Vietnam: 46 percent. Cambodia: 49 percent. South Korea: 25 percent. No corner of the US consumer economy will go untouched. Prices will rise. The stock market is spiraling. A recession looms. The tech industry will be turned upside down. Mark Cuban, noted billionaire, is encouraging people to stockpile consumables before it's too late.

It's reckless, it's absurd, and it's also everything Donald Trump said plainly he would do on the campaign trail. True, he didn't telegraph how misguided the methodology would be—you can read about it more here, but suffice to say it's thoroughly detached from the realities of international trade—but he loudly, repeatedly promised to tariff his way to glory.

The stated goal is to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, which is a bit like resurrecting the dodo. The US still manufactures plenty of goods; it's second only to China in annual output, according to the World Bank. But many of the industry's jobs have been replaced by automation, a bottle you can't re-cork. And higher domestic labor costs mean US-made products will inherently be more expensive, a trade-off American consumers have consistently rejected. All of this was already true in Trump's first term. It's even more so now.

And let's say a plurality of companies did decide to reshore or set up factories in the United States. The timeline for those decisions and implementation is measured in years, if not decades, and follow-through can be spotty. (Just ask Foxconn.) So what happens in the meantime?

The rationale has all the weight of a soap bubble. There isn't a world where the US suddenly manufactures all the items the country has decided to target. There's a 47 percent tariff on Madagascar now. Do you know why the US has a trade deficit with Madagascar? They produce vanilla; we don't. Unless we're suddenly setting up vanilla assembly lines in Ohio, that's not changing.

But maybe Trump's so-called Liberation Day is all just a master negotiating ploy. “Everybody sit back, take a deep breath. Don't immediately retaliate. Let's see where this goes,” said Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on CNN Wednesday. “Because if you retaliate, that's how we get escalation.”

It's an interesting tactic, to start a bar brawl and ask everyone not to punch back in case someone gets hurt. It's not working. China has already vowed to retaliate; the EU suggested that it could as well. (New Zealand is officially chill.)

Set the economics of this aside for a moment, though. The insult on top of that looming injury is how sloppy this all is. It's the same blunt-force destruction that DOGE has implemented within the US government, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has imposed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now projected on a global scale. Yes, Elon Musk and DOGE have taken a blowtorch to federal agencies. But the tariffs are a helpful reminder that it's Trump who's fiddling while it all burns.

It's the instinct to measure wins in units of pain and suffering. It's an assumption that the only way to help yourself is to hurt other people. This is just what America is now.

The optimist's case is that this is all a feint, that other countries will capitulate or at least make enough of a show of it that things will go back to normal. Seems unlikely. First of all, they're already doing the opposite, all apologies to Bessent. But even if they weren't, even if this is just posturing from the US, that posturing has consequences. Whatever equity the US has built up over the last century as a reputable trade partner has been largely wiped out by a businessman-president best known for his bankruptcies.

And then there's the pessimist's case, which also seems increasingly like the realist's. The US is barreling toward a recession for no good reason, and dragging the world—and a few thousand penguins on remote Antarctic islands—down with it.

Will these tariffs lead to a US manufacturing renaissance, or a prolonged recession?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump's Tariffs Could Reshape the US Tech Industry","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-global-tariffs-tech-industry-impacts/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 02:23:49 GMT","

Sweeping tariffs unveiled by US president Donald Trump on Wednesday will have ripple effects across the tech industry, according to experts who study global trade. The measures, which include a minimum 10 percent tariff on most countries and steep new import duties on key US trading allies like Europe, China, Vietnam, India, and South Korea, sent stocks nosediving in after-hours trading.

Meta and Nvidia stock prices each fell by around 5 percent, CNBC reported, while Apple and Amazon fell around 6 percent. The iPhone maker earns roughly half its revenue by selling phones that are manufactured in China and India, while some of its other products are manufactured in Vietnam. Amazon's online shopping marketplace is similarly heavily dependent on goods sold by third-party merchants in China.

These market dips may be just the beginning. Many economists warn that the White House has set in motion one of the largest shifts in global trade in decades, and among the results could be higher prices for US consumers and more inflation. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs raised the probability of a US recession in the next 12 months to 35 percent, up from 20 percent.

“There's this idea that consumers are willing to pay higher prices for American goods,” says Tibor Besedes, a trade expert and professor at the School of Economics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “There's no evidence of that ever taking place.”

Besedes adds that one reason Americans said they voted for Trump was because they were displeased with inflation during the Biden administration, and he can't imagine they'll be happy about prices potentially rising now.

Some of the new country-specific tariffs, such as those levied on the United Kingdom, Chile, and Brazil, are relatively low. Others, such as those levied on China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, and Thailand, are much higher, ranging from 26 percent to 49 percent. (Trump even targeted islands that aren't independent countries, some with no exports or human inhabitants.)

For now, at least, Trump has given an exemption to one crucial category of tech imports: semiconductors. That means US companies like Nvidia, which puts advanced chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) inside their AI graphics processing units, won't have to pay the 32 percent tariffs Trump imposed on Taiwan. It's not immediately clear, however, if TSMC would still be subject to the blanket 10 percent tariff Trump also announced. Overall, about 44 percent of logic chips imported to the US come from Taiwan, according to one estimate.

Within the tech sector, Trump's tariffs could deal perhaps the biggest blow to ecommerce. “Online retailers will feel the pain, and so will consumer device brands,” says Ian Bremmer, a political scientist and the founder and president of the consulting firm Eurasia Group.

In addition to introducing sweeping tariffs, Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday ending a trade loophole for packages from China and Hong Kong that allows American consumers to directly import goods to the US valued under $800 without paying anything.

Known as the de minimis exemption, it has been used by the Chinese shopping giants Shein and Temu to send millions of packages to the US each year duty-free, helping keep the prices of their products low for Americans. But the exemption is also important for marketplaces like eBay and Etsy that allow people in the US to buy goods from China-based sellers.

Scrapping the measure may also negatively impact Amazon, which recently launched a division for affordable made-in-China products that competes directly with Temu and Shein. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump tried scrapping the de minimis provision for Chinese packages in February via a separate executive order, but he quickly walked back the measure after it became clear that US Customs and Border Protection did not have the resources in place to inspect millions of additional packages a day and ensure the correct associated tariffs were being paid. His new order says the duty-free exemption will go away on May 2, giving CBP a few weeks to prepare.

Ram Ben Tzion, cofounder and CEO of Publican, a digital shipment vetting platform, says he believes Trump intends to use eliminating de minimis as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China, because if the policy is really scrapped and replaced by high tariffs, it could radically reshape online shopping as Americans know it.

“The magnitude and the importance of this, if it does ultimately come into effect, is gigantic,” says Ben Tzion. “It could dramatically change ecommerce. It could dramatically change some of the giants that we have known over the past few years.”

Some tech companies, however, especially those already entrenched in areas like logistics and data analytics, may see opportunities in Trump's trade policies. Almost immediately after the tariffs were announced, defense contractor Palantir published a blog post promoting an artificial intelligence service that the company boasted integrates “a wide array of data sources” to help businesses ensure that “tariff-related decisions consider the full operational context.”

Jay Gerard, the head of customs and logistics at the Mexico City–based tech and logistics startup Nuvocargo, says that as much as he “hates tariffs,” they've created more demand for his company's services. Nuvocargo operates as a freight broker between Mexico and the US and sells software that helps customers get their goods across the US border. It also helps them process customs documents. The company is now forecasting an increase in customer activity for April, May, and June, predicting that the tariffs will boost business.

Still, the past month has been “chaos” for importers and shippers, Gerard says, leaving many of them in expensive holding patterns. Early in March, Trumped slapped a 25 percent tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports, only to walk it back a couple days later. During that short time, Gerard says, if a freight truck crossed the border, the importer paid the fee.

“If they imported $100,000 worth of drinks that day,” he explains, “they were paying $25,000 in duties. If the truck crossed a day later, that disappeared.”

Other companies that specialize in logistics seem allergic to the chaos as well. “Historically all chaos has been good for Flexport,” Ryan Petersen, chief executive of the logistics unicorn Flexport, wrote on X. “This might be too much though.”

Nick Vyas, founding director of the Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute at USC's Marshall School of Business, acknowledges that tariffs are ultimately a tax that gets passed onto consumers. “You and I at some point will pay for it,” he says.

But Vyas believes that tariffs, if implemented strategically, could benefit the US in the long run. Over the past 30 years, he says, the country has shifted from a creation mindset to a consumption mindset, and in the process, has become increasingly reliant on one major node in the global supply chain: China. “When you get into that stage, it's very addictive. You want to continue to consume by finding the cheapest ways to do it,” Vyas tells WIRED. “But you lose the appetite and knowledge and know how to create something.”

Vyas believes the US should take a multi-tiered approach to trade and manufacturing. First, it should build out infrastructure for advanced manufacturing of semiconductors and defense tech—industries critical to national security. Then, to help rebuild the labor force, introduce apprentice programs for semi-automated industries, like auto manufacturing, while continuing to outsource the production of “widgets,” or small goods, electronics, and accessories that the US would not be able to produce affordably. At the very least, this would be a three- to five-year project, Vyas says.

But that strategy also requires formulating a plan and sticking with it. “The US should create a policy that openly encourages a group of allies,” says Vyas. “Right now, people feel confused, because we're seeing much more emotional outbursts than strategic ones.”

I write this while cocooned in my favorite hoodie, a beloved garment that has tenure in my wardrobe. At this moment, one with my couch, I am flirting with the idea of an afternoon nap. Sometimes I work from bed. I'm not exactly the poster child for productivity. But on the days I swap my emotional support hoodie for, say, a sweater, I sit up straighter at my desk. My emails are crisper. I act like a functional adult.

Clothes are psychological armor, and the hoodie is an invitation to dissolve into sentient fleece. It's the sartorial equivalent of a Do Not Disturb sign. Studies support this: A 2023 paper published in the Academy of Management Journal found that employees who dressed better than usual experienced higher self-esteem and productivity. Another survey from 1999 reported that casual workwear policies were linked to increased tardiness and absenteeism. The hoodie encourages you to clock out.

What we wear affects how we behave, think, and perform—a concept psychologists call “enclothed cognition.” Clothes carry meaning, and we absorb that meaning when we put them on. A notable experiment from Northwestern University found that people who wore lab coats, an item associated with intelligence, demonstrated better focus and task performance.

Whether we like it or not, clothes shape how others see us, too. Even in my remote world—where most of my professional interactions involve floating heads on screens—I ditch the hoodie for interviews and important meetings. Clothing sends a message. In a professional setting, a hoodie tells your boss, coworkers, or clients that you'd rather be anywhere else. That's perfect for a lazy Sunday—it's not so great for climbing the corporate ladder.

Once upon a time, workplaces had dress codes. Then the late 1990s happened, and Silicon Valley ditched suits for sweats. Tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg enshrined the zip-up as a power move, styling it with Adidas slides and an expression of monotony. Even though Zuckerberg has abandoned his hoodies in favor of tailored tees (and the occasional sparkly jumpsuit), one of his old sweatshirts recently sold for nearly $16,000 at auction.

The Covid-19 pandemic supercharged this casual revolution, with companies relaxing dress policies under the guise of boosting employee morale and staff retention rates. But this experiment in radical coziness has a built-in inequality.

The “red sneakers effect,” a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, suggests that individuals who break dress norms—like wearing red sneakers in a corporate environment–are perceived as having higher status. But this rule-breaking is only powerful when the rule-breaker is already powerful. A CEO in a hoodie, for example, reads as too brilliant to care. An entry-level employee in a hoodie, on the other hand, signals a lack of seriousness. Women and people of color face even steeper biases.

According to a 2024 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, 54 percent of employers have a business-casual dress code, and 43 percent allow casual attire. In theory, this means more freedom for all. In practice, it means more ambiguity. Very few people can get away with looking like they've just rolled out of bed. If you have to work harder to prove that you belong, you don't have that luxury. The hoodie masquerades as an everyman's garment, but in the office, it's a rich man's privilege. For the rest of us, it just makes it easier to be overlooked.

The hoodie, in particular, carries a complicated history. It's been a flash point for racial profiling, particularly against Black men. Studies from Oregon State University found that Black male athletes were viewed as more intelligent and hardworking when dressed in formal clothing compared to athleisure. Even when their garments signified success (i.e., championship tees), their perceptions didn't improve. The biases tied to hoodies don't disappear when one steps into the office.

Of course, not all workplaces are the same—not even all people are the same. Even as tech titans have long since abandoned their humble uniforms in favor of Loro Piana and Lanvin, everyday working people are redefining what professionalism looks like.

None of this is to say that workplaces should return to suits and pantyhose. Formal wear has its own gendered, classist, and uncomfortable baggage. But now that we're all returning to the office, we have to start redefining what professionalism looks like. And I don't think it should look like pajamas all the time. We adore hoodies because they're comfy and schlumpy, but that's not how you want your boss to describe you in your performance review.

The takeaway here isn't to submit to old standards but to be intentional about how we present ourselves in the environment we're in. Wear whatever makes you feel confident and capable, but remember that others will make judgments based on your attire. If you work on a construction site or in the field, pair your hoodie with your hard hat proudly. But if you're in an office—even a home office—consider a structured sweater instead. Like picking the right tote bag, your attire can be a professional asset. When used thoughtfully, it can work for you instead of against you.

As with all pocketable items, it's hard to keep track of the charging case for my earbuds—not to mention the buds themselves. I pop them in my ears and walk off. At some point I take them out and set them down without thinking about it. Then, when I need them next, I'm surprised to find the case empty. And when I do locate them, they're often dead. Worst of all, sometimes the buds migrate away from each other between listens, so I'm left with just a left or a right.

That's why I love the snap-together, magnetic connection that comes with the new ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds. Between trips to the case, you can turn the buds off by just clicking the left and right buds together. You'll never lose one or the other (or battery life between charges) again. That's really helpful for this pair specifically, because they have more than 15 hours of battery life with noise canceling on. You might actually not want to take the case with you to recharge them for a day or two.

If you're looking for a pair of noise-canceling buds in the AirPods price range, I think these are a compelling choice, especially if you're as forgetful as I am.

At first glance, these new buds look a lot like pairs that came out in the earlier days of wireless earbuds, when it was hard to pack all the modern conveniences into tiny packages. The bulky outer shell of the ATH-CKS50TW2 fully covers your ear canal on the outside when you put the buds in your ears, but the folks at Audio Technica have hidden a surprisingly comfortable bud beneath that bulk.

A long elephant trunk extends into your ear canal, with a soft silicone tip that seals it very comfortably from the outside world. Passive noise isolation is pretty solid, good enough for me to operate my myriad of Ryobi power equipment outside without turning ANC on.

The large exterior of these buds carries with it one awesome benefit: huge batteries. As I said earlier, you'll get 15 hours of playback in the buds with ANC on (a whopping 25 hours with it off), and the included wireless charging case offers an additional 40 hours. That means up to 65 hours of playback in a pair of wireless earbuds, which is well over double what you can expect from the vast majority of competitors.

The included charging case has a see-through top that lets you see the two magnetically attached buds inside, which makes it easy for folks who might take out the buds and leave them outside the case between charges. This is especially important because with battery life this long, you might actually want to just click the earbuds together and set them down on occasion, rather than needing to hunt for the charging case between listens because of shorter battery life.

For this reason, I'm not super upset that the case itself is a bit larger than I'd like for daily pocketability. It's about twice the size of an Airpods Pro case, which means you'll likely want to leave it at home, or in the car, or in your gym bag, when you take the buds out with you. Still, the rounded edges are nice, and it fits just fine in jacket pockets and book bags, with enough heft that you can feel around and actually find it in the depths of your storage compartments.

IP55 waterproofing and multipoint pairing mean these are ideal work/life companions, where you can pair them to your computer for work and to your phone or watch for instant connections, without having to constantly mess with swapping between devices manually.

Another thing I'm happy about is the physical buttons included on the top of each bud when they're in your ears. You can play/pause and adjust ANC settings via these buttons, and they're way less easy to bump than the touch controls employed by so many earbud makers these days.

A pair of 9-mm dynamic drivers were designed explicitly for these earbuds, and they are generally pretty well suited to most kinds of music.

Sound quality is warm and fuzzy, with a lower midrange warmth that makes them less tiring to listen to than many other buds. Songs like Son Volt's “Mystifies Me” have a blanket of organic tape sound over them, with a bit of bloom in the lower end of the acoustic guitar that I don't hear on all pairs.

It works better on some productions than others. I liked it on much acoustic music, but a recent version of “Seventeen” by Sharon Van Etten with Norah Jones gets a bit too forward in the kick drum and bass, leaving out a bit of the vocal detail that sits just above it on higher-end pairs.

Adjusting the EQ inside the associated Audio Technica Connect App to the Clear Vocal setting (you can also pick between Bass Boost, V-Shaped, and Treble Enhance, among others) worked well to solve this problem. The app also has controls for noise canceling and hear-through modes, and you can tailor an individual five-band EQ to your liking if you don't like the presets.

The app is also where you'll get software and firmware updates for the headphones, which easily install in a few minutes as long as the headphones are paired via Bluetooth.

Dual microphones on the earbuds mean that you'll sound fine on calls, and the noise canceling quality is actually very solid, especially for buds in this price range. It's nearly impossible to hear the clicks of my very bright-sounding mechanical keyboard with even low-level music playing, thanks to the excellent seal of the earbuds. HVAC noises all but disappear as well. You'll get better reduction from the best of Apple, Bose, and Sony, but these hold their own with the vast majority of competitors this side of $250.

The weirdest part of these buds is a “Soundscape” function in the app, in which Audio Technica included “relaxing sounds of nature, a masking noise to help you concentrate, or sounds for meditation.” I'm not sure why I needed that in an app to control wireless earbuds, but sure.

As far as a pair of earbuds that sound decent, work awesome, and can take all that life throws at them (including the occasional misplacing of their charging case), there is very little to dislike about these. They work well, fit great, and have the longest battery life I've ever seen from a pair of wireless buds. For $150, that's a solid deal.

People love to hate their phones. After all, smartphones are an easy culprit of a collective sense of digital despair. They're devices designed for doomscrolling, portals to a media ecosystem dominated by neverending ads and social media algorithms that hoover up every scrap of our attention. And yet, we just can't seem to quit them.

Not that there haven't been a plethora of efforts over the years to claw back that focus and attention. Both Android and iOS have a swath of digital wellbeing tools that can limit app permissions and restrict the amount of time you spend in places you'd rather not. Older “dumb” phones have passionate adherents, as does the rise of efforts to deliberately hobble your smartphone. There are even whole devices, like the Light Phone, which offer only the bare necessities (i.e. no internet browsing capabilities) as a way to keep you from getting sucked into a device.

Some of these efforts work better than others, but an art studio in London thinks it has found an even better way to help keep you from staring into your rectangular glass abyss: Just cover the damn thing.

Special Projects, a design agency that focuses on digital wellness, has a prototype it calls Aperture. It is a concept phone case that aims to keep you from staring at your screen all day—namely, by covering most of it. The pitch works like this: Pop the case off the back of your phone, flip it around, then slap it over the top of your screen. There you go. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

Not that the whole screen will be completely covered. Most cases have a small hole where your case makes room for the cameras on the back of the device. It is in that space that Special Projects wants to present a small window that prioritizes only the most important things you do on a phone—messages, calls, asking for directions.

Behind the scenes, an app on the phone controls what you see and presents it in a clean, minimalist format—ideally one that fades to black the second you don't need it anymore. But that window is all you get to see on your screen. The rest is physically covered, keeping you focused on the important things you want your device to display.

The idea, according to Special Projects cofounders Clara Gaggero Westaway and Adrian Westaway, is to make it just enough of a bother to remove the case from your screen once you've got it on there.

“What's nice with this is that it is quite a pain,” Adrian says. “I mean, taking your case off is not a real pain in the scheme of life, but it has that sweet spot of friction that you're not going to be flipping it and doing it all the time.”

“It's basically transforming a compulsive behavior into a conscious behavior,” Clara says.

The Aperture case doesn't actually exist yet, mind you. It's more art project than actual project. But while it may not be a reality, Special Projects hopes it inspires more thoughtful reflection about the time we spend on our phones. Something like an app that keeps you off your phone by guilt-tripping you about killing a digital tree if you scroll too much.

“This is something that many people are struggling with,” Adrian says. “There are many solutions, but there was something about this that just clicked.”

Aesthetically, Special Projects' works evoke a sort of Teenage Engineering ethos in the pursuit of digital wellness. The idea for Aperture came about while the team worked on a project called Paper Phone, an app that let you print out a sheet of paper with all the information—contacts, calendar meetings, grocery list, for example—you might need from your phone for a day.

During this project, the Westaways noticed that the window carved out for the cluster of camera lenses on the back of a phone case were about the same size as an Apple Watch. With Apple managing to get plenty of information into the limited window of its wrist-mounted device, the Westaways figured it would be easy enough to do the same on the phone. What if you could enable that by just flipping your phone case around?

“We just started playing with these ideas,” Adrian says. “The idea that we quite liked was by using two things you already own, you can transform them into what feels like a new kind of device.”

However, while the original vision was to transform any phone case into an Aperture-enabled helper, the reality is unlikely to play out that way. Firstly, the switcheroo might not work with just any phone case, because depending on how the case is manufactured, it simply might not fit the other way around, or might inadvertently press buttons along the side of a phone.

The other problem is accessing the operating system to be able to display information in the cutout window. To get that to work, you'd need to download an app, then grant that app all sorts of permissions to create its minimalist display onscreen—messages, phone calls, proximity. In order for all that to work—and to work without exposing all your data—the app would need to work with manufacturers like Apple and Google.

Despite the appeal of not having to buy a new device, a la the Light Phone, Aperture might wind up having to be a separate product after all. But as a starter, the Westaways say Special Projects is working with a phone case manufacturer to design cases that can fit just fine either on the back or front of the device.

“It's a vision,” Adrian says. “And now we've had in a small group of people some interests and we're now trying to see how much of this we make real.”

They're hopeful that the physical blocking of a screen will be more impactful than what software tools let you do. It's easy to ignore a warning notification, or just go back into your settings and turn off an app timer when you really need just one more minute of TikTok this time, you swear. But a recent study found that hard blocking mobile internet access on phones resulted in boosting people's attention spans, mental health, and “subjective well-being.” Perhaps hard blocking a screen could have the same impact.

“I'm very aware of how much control has been taken,” says Matteo Bandi, a designer at Special Projects about his own efforts to reclaim his attention. “I've tried a lot of things. The turning the phone black and white, making a no-phone safe area around kind of tactical places, like the bedroom and all that. It works—for brief periods of time.”

Again, the Aperture case isn't out yet, but Special Projects is asking for feedback for what features should be included if the idea of just covering your screens actually takes off.

“We never think that taking away technology altogether would be the right choice,” Clara says. “But how can we help people to use the phone, to use technology rather than be used by it?”

At a presentation unveiling the Nintendo Switch 2, longtime Nintendo producer Kouichi Kawamoto revealed that at one point, he considered calling the Switch's successor the “Super Nintendo Switch.”

It would have been a nice nod to Nintendo's second console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which followed the original NES about 35 years ago. But Kawamoto, along with directors Tetsuya Sasaki and Takuhiro Dohta, didn't think that “Super Nintendo Switch” was quite the right fit.

It's not that the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't super — I'll go out on a limb and call it the Pretty Good Nintendo Switch. Rather, the Switch 2 tries to take a console that's already beloved and simply just make it better.

The Switch was well-received when it came out in 2017, but it exploded in popularity when the world went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales more than doubling between March 2019 and March 2020. But even before the Animal Crossing: New Horizons craze, this trio of Nintendo bigwigs was already plotting the Switch's successor.

“The three of us were assigned to [the Nintendo Switch 2] back in 2019,” Kawamoto said. “Even before that, the hardware team had always been looking into what kind of hardware can be used in the next iteration of the hardware, so it's really hard to tell what the exact [start] was.”

Suddenly, Nintendo was trying to solve what has to be a really good problem for any company to face: There was so much demand for the Switch that the company couldn't keep up with production.

“COVID certainly had a large impact in the development and design process,” Sasaki said. “Even with the chip shortage, we were working with our partners to be creative to work our way through that.”

Though we're five years since the pandemic hit, chip shortages persist, thanks in no small part to the generative AI boom. That could be less than good news for the Switch and Switch 2, both of which use Nvidia processors.

Maybe that's why Nintendo took so long to make what's essentially just a Switch with extra bells and whistles. But why create an entirely new console when the Switch is still popular eight years later?

The Switch 2 is a bit larger than its predecessor, measuring 4.5 inches tall by 10.7 inches wide when the Joy-Cons are connected. So, it's about an inch longer and half an inch taller than the Switch, while it's just about as thick. The Switch 2 is slightly heavier, but the difference in weight is minimal.

It definitely feels a little odd to hold the Switch 2 after years of getting used to the Switch, but the experience is similar to getting a new phone — you'll feel the difference for a few minutes, but it doesn't take long to get used to. I didn't feel like I had to adjust how I played, which is saying something — I once complained that I needed to adjust to a friend's Pro Controller for the Switch, which has resulted in years of jokes about how I am not “pro” enough to use it.

The display is bigger too, at 7.9-inches, though it's LED only (sorry, OLED diehards) and has a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels that can manage 120Hz. When docked to a TV, some games can render at 4K resolution at 60Hz. The console also supports HDR10 and variable refresh rates up to 120Hz.

As someone who only owns Nintendo consoles, I wouldn't say I have particularly high standards when it comes to graphics. I never sprung for the OLED Switch, and I spend a lot of time playing games like Stardew Valley or Undertale, which aren't exactly in want of the most powerful chips.

Still, it was clear to see that the Nintendo Switch 2 presents a definite upgrade when it comes to graphical fidelity. I am a changed woman. I have seen the contours of Bowser's scales, the spaces in between each tuft of Donkey Kong's fur… which we don't really need to see, but you can imagine how this step up can make games like Tears of the Kingdom look that much more magnificent.

These updates are most noticeable with games like the recent Zelda installments, but even with Hades II's 2D art, you can see the difference in quality.

Nintendo was reluctant to give a clear answer when asked about the Switch 2's battery, only saying that the battery will drain faster when players use new features like GameChat (more on that below). Nintendo claims the Switch 2 can go between two to 6.5 hours on one charge, compared to the Switch's 4.5 to nine hours. At least the USB-C port on the top will make it easier to continue playing while charging.

As for other useful upgrades, the Switch 2 comes with 256 GB of built-in storage, and the kickstand actually works well this time.

The entire event was jam-packed with too much news to fully digest (Silksong 2025!), but the new Joy-Cons were a buzzy topic of conversation among those of us who got to try out the new console.

Joystick drift was (and still is) a big problem on the original Switch's controllers, so everyone was eager to see how the new version would compare. I only got to try it out for a few hours so I can't promise you that the Switch 2's joysticks will be drift-free, but Sasaki seemed confident.

“The new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been re-designed from the ground up, and they've been designed to have bigger movements and smoother movements,” Sasaki said.

We also have a new way to connect Joy-Cons to the console body: magnets. The design feels much more intuitive than the design of the Switch, where Joy-Cons slide into place through a small plastic column. The Joy-Cons won't detach easily either — you still need to press a little button on the back to be able to remove it from the screen.

Sasaki mentioned that Nintendo had been considering using magnets to connect Joy-Cons to the console since the original Switch was being developed. Though some players might worry that magnets won't be as secure as the previous iteration, Kawamoto was confident it wouldn't be an issue.

“The connector has a little bit of give, so if, for example, there is a lot of force applied, that give will let the force dissipate so it doesn't apply too much onto the connector itself,” he said.

What makes the Joy-Con 2 really different, though, is that these can be used like a computer mouse: Each controller has a mouse sensor, a gyro sensor, and an accelerometer, letting you wave the controller around to move the camera, for example.

Nintendo showed off this mouse function with a game called Drag x Drive, a 3-on-3 wheelchair basketball game. You use the Joy-Cons to mimic the wheels on a wheelchair, sliding the controllers on a table forward and backward to move around — to shoot the basketball, you flick your wrist.

“As I was playing PC games […] I was thinking, what if we could bring this to the Nintendo Switch 2?” Kawamoto said. “Usually, the table is quite far away when you're sitting on the sofa, so it depends on the material, but we have made adjustments so that you can control the mouse on your pants.”

Kawamoto made this revelation after I had already demoed Drag x Drive, so we'll have to take his word for it. Apparently, your pants are your desk now.

Games like Drag x Drive are designed specifically for the mouse feature, but it seems like the novelty will wear off fast. The functionality is actually more impressive in games where it's integrated as a small piece of the game play, rather than the whole meat of it.

For example, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the right Joy-Con transitions seamlessly between mouse mode and the normal mode. Instead of using the joystick to look around and change the angle of your sight, you can just move the controller around. This could be a way for Nintendo to cater to first-person shooter fans, who may be accustomed to using a mouse when playing games for the PC.

There's a lot that's different this time with the Joy-Cons, but thankfully, Nintendo is still letting us use the original Switch Joy-Cons with the Switch 2 via Bluetooth. You just can't attach them to the console body for handheld play.

Nintendo also gave us a glimpse into the upcoming Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza games. Yes, Mario Kart now has a cow as a playable character, and just wait until you see Boo's aristocrat costume.

Both games appear to embrace a sort of faux open world. They're not as primed for exploration and free play as, say, Breath of the Wild, but they feel like they will be more like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. You're free to explore the landscape, but you are ultimately trying to accomplish certain goals in a certain order.

Mario Kart World transposes all of the playable race courses onto a world map. Will this finally answer my years-old question of how fantastical courses like Rainbow Road and real tracks like London Loop can exist in the same game where Mario is canonically from Flatbush, Brooklyn? A girl can dream.

The way this translates into the game is pretty cool. In previous Mario Kart games, grand prix races generally had you racing through a series of courses. In Mario Kart World, each race bleeds into the next.

In this 24-player grand prix, you have to finish in the top 20 to advance to the next race. Then, the top 16 advance, then the top 12, and so on until the final four players face off. There is no break between races, so you are zoomin' all the way from the first lap of the course until the end.

During matchmaking, the game lets you explore the world freely. If you run off the edge of a track, instead of falling into a bottomless void, you simply keep going. And if you land in the water, then you just keep driving until you reach another landmass, which turns into some other course on your map.

The demo version we played was far from comprehensive, obviously, but there's a lot of potential for Nintendo to stick the landing with the concept of a broadly explorable Mario Kart.

Meanwhile, Donkey Kong Bananza marks the gorilla's first 3D platformer in over 10 years. In the limited demo, you, as Donkey Kong, set out to rack up bananas and punch bad guys. You can punch enemies to defeat them, but certain foes are vulnerable to different attacks — flying enemies, for instance, can only be defeated by throwing rocks at them. Luckily, Donkey Kong can turn pretty much any bit of the ground into a throwable rock.

It's not clear exactly how expansive the Bananza world is, but after the 20-minute demo, I felt like I had barely scratched the surface. But I can happily report that if you accidentally punch Diddy Kong, the game will make you high-five him instead.

Some Switch games like Mario Party Jamboree are getting extra features in Switch 2 expansions. The game will use the attachable Switch 2 camera for special mini games that put a live video feed of each player into the game.

The camera seems like it's built as a social feature for GameChat, but it can also put you into the game. In one mini-game, for example, players are tasked with stacking as many Koopas on their heads as possible — Koopas fall from above and you have to physically move your body back and forth to catch them.

The camera quality is nothing to write home about, but it functions as it should, and it brought us a second USB-C port, so we must be forever grateful.

At $450, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a hefty price tag for a handheld console.

By comparison, the Steam Deck starts at $400 for its simplest model, plus another $79 for its docking station, so the price is not unheard of. But Nintendo's last two handheld consoles, the Switch and the WiiU, both launched with a $300 price tag, so some Nintendo fans could get a bit of sticker shock. Still, even hardware manufacturers have to deal with inflation.

The Switch 2's improved specs, GameChat feature, and impending lineup of exclusive games make it an alluring console, but if you're not a dedicated Nintendo fan and don't know what VRR means, you probably won't feel left out if you wait a little bit — especially if you're not really drawn to the slate of exclusive games so far.

On the Nintendo side, titles like Mario Kart World, Metroid Prime 4, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby AirRiders have already been announced, and it's likely that the next main series Pokémon game (not Legends Z-A) will bring us onto the Switch 2. Games from other developers like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition, and Yakuza 0 are coming to the console, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods will see an exclusive Switch 2 release.

So, if you're not dying to see what a 3D Donkey Kong platformer looks like, you're probably safe holding off for a bit. On the other hand, Nintendo rarely ever reduces the price of its consoles, so if you know you're going to cave at some point in the next eight or so years, then you might as well just take the plunge now.

Apple lost more than $250 billion in market value Thursday, with shares down as much as 8.5% as a result of President Donald Trump's tariff spree. 

The iPhone maker took one of the biggest hits on Wall Street, where tech stocks dropped as investors shifted money away from volatile assets. Tesla, Nvidia, and Meta were down 6%, and Amazon shares fell by 7.2%. 

Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs Wednesday afternoon of at least 10% across the board, and even higher for some countries – China's total tariff rate soared to 54% – that will go into effect April 5. Wedbush Securities analysts said the tariffs are “worse than a worst case scenario” for tech investors. 

The White House insists the tariffs aren't a negotiation tactic but a necessity to boost domestic manufacturing. The president called them a move to “liberate” the American economy. 

Trump's huge tariffs on imported goods to the U.S. affect all of Apple's biggest suppliers and manufacturing hubs in Asia, from China to Taiwan, India to Vietnam, despite CEO Tim Cook's efforts to court the administration. That means every model of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and accessory that Apple sells will be impacted. 

Cook will either choose to hike up the cost for consumers or have Apple take the losses, wiping out tens of billions in potential profits.

The quality of AI-generated voices is good enough for things like creating audiobooks and podcasts, having articles read aloud to you, and basic customer support. But many businesses don't think AI voice tech is quite reliable enough to deploy.

That's why two MIT grads, Moin Nadeem and Nikhil Murthy (pictured above), founded Phonic, a company offering an end-to-end voice stack to increase synthetic voice reliability while decreasing latency.

Nadeem and Murthy met at MIT, and have known each other for more than seven years. When the duo started building Phonic last year, they felt there weren't many companies crafting complete voice tech solutions.

“Voice AI is at a place where you tie up different parts, such as automatic voice recognition [and] text-to-speech, and [then integrate] intelligence,” Murthy told TechCrunch. “However, when we talked to actual customers, we found that there is a lack of [solutions] that [are] reliable at scale.”

Nadeem, who previously worked at MosaicML, a company Databricks acquired for $1.3 billion in 2023, said that a lot of companies that are building in the voice AI space (e.g. Vapi, Rounded) are creating workflows to piece together separate AI models. 

Phonic takes a different approach: It trains its models in-house end-to-end. Murthy said that there are a few advantages to this.

“Owning the models allows us to deeply integrate some […] reliability pieces into the [models themselves],” he said. “If you don't own that layer […] you're just tying disparate pieces that don't really fit seamlessly.”

Murthy added that Phonic's method also allows the company to host and run models cost-efficiently. He claims that Phonic trains its models on a range of recordings, including recordings of accented and muffled speech, to make the models highly robust. 

Phonic is currently working with a limited set of partners, including companies in the insurance and healthcare spaces, but plans to launch its product broadly in a few months. Soon, prospective clients will be able to try out Phonic's tech from its website, Nadeem said. 

Phonic has raised $4 million in a seed round led by Lux with participation from Replit co-founder Amjad Masad, Hugging Face co-founder Clem Delangue, Applied Intuition co-founder Qasar Younis, and Modal Labs founder Erik Bernhardsson.

Grace Isford, a partner at Lux Capital, said that the company's in-house way of training models was appealing to the investment firm.

“We think both Moin and Nikhil are incredible technologists,” she said. “They founded [a] machine learning club at MIT. And they have worked on training models for a while now. Plus, their approach of combining diffusion and proprietary models in the voice AI sector is novel.”

Expanding into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remains a costly and complex challenge for global businesses, thanks to fragmented regulations and banking systems. Dubai-based fintech Fuse aims to simplify that with a cross-border payments API and has raised $6.6 million in seed funding to make it happen.

Founded in 2023 by George Davis, former co-founder of BVNK, and CTO James Smith, Fuse says it's the first infrastructure-grade payments platform offering virtual International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) in the region. This is a product Davis says is commonplace in Europe but nearly absent across MENA.

“We're currently the only provider of virtual IBANs in the Middle East,” Davis told TechCrunch. “It's a hyper-commoditized product in Europe, but here, it simply didn't exist.”

Fuse's core product includes USD virtual accounts for cross-border money movement and dirham-denominated IBANs for local UAE payments. That allows the startup to offer first-mile collections and last-mile payouts for international businesses without requiring them to set up a local entity, handle their own FX, or navigate licensing.

Davis outlines two legacy options for global companies trying to move money in MENA: local payment firms that lack scale, or larger cross-border players like Thunes, which often operate without local licenses and rely on patchy partnerships. 

Fuse sits in the middle with a fully licensed, infrastructure-grade platform that simplifies money movement across the Middle East using virtual IBANs and local payout rails. With these options, global businesses can operate in the region without setting up local infrastructure or navigating regulatory red tape.

Most of Fuse's clients are businesses in the U.S., Europe, and Asia that want to operate in MENA but lack the banking setup or licenses to do so quickly.

One use case is employers of record (EORs). For instance, a U.S.-based company with employees in the UAE typically needs a local bank account—something hard to obtain without residency or licensing—to pay salaries in dirhams under the correct business name. Fuse solves this by issuing USD-denominated virtual IBANs, allowing businesses to top them up and pay salaries locally in AED (dirhams) directly to named beneficiaries.

Customers can “create unlimited IBANs in their end customers' names and make local payments,” said CEO George Davis. “Those customers don't need to be residents or have local entities; they can be anywhere in the world.”

Fuse now serves over 20 clients, including EORs, remittance firms, crypto platforms, marketplaces, and PSPs. Clients include DLocal, RemotePass, and platforms like Deel, Airbnb, and Etsy as they expand into MENA.

The UAE remains Fuse's anchor market, but the platform has begun enabling direct payouts in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan and supports wholesale foreign exchange for Indian and Chinese businesses operating in the UAE that need to repatriate funds through controlled corridors, some of the region's busiest trade and remittance routes.

There are many startups in various regions with identical offerings but Davis sees more similarities with Visa-backed Currencycloud. Both offer virtual accounts, FX, and cross-border payments, “but while Currencycloud is global, Fuse is built for the Middle East,” he said.

And it's striking at the right time. Businesses across MENA aren't just underserved; they're transacting more than ever, driven by a surge in e-commerce and digital payments. That demand, Davis believes, creates a rare window for regional infrastructure players to win.

“Global cross-border payments tend to be winner-takes-all markets,” he said. “But to win, you now need local specialists. That's what we're building.”

So far, it's working. Fuse is processing hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter and growing revenue more than 50% month-over-month. In fact, Davis says Fuse made more this quarter than it did all of last year. The company makes money by charging fees on each transaction.

Davis's interest in solving cross-border payments for the Middle East came from firsthand experience. At TrueLayer, he helped scale the fintech from a data aggregator to a payments and open banking platform serving over 100,000 businesses. At crypto infrastructure startup BVNK, which he co-founded and served as chief product officer, he saw how hard it was for global businesses to expand into the Middle East.

“We were supporting global businesses using stablecoins to move money out of emerging markets,” he said. “We felt the pain of entering MENA—and so did others I was advising. That's what sparked Fuse.”

He launched Fuse in 2023 with CTO James Smith, a longtime collaborator who led engineering at both TrueLayer and BVNK. The two now lead a 12-person team across engineering, product, and compliance.

Northzone, the European multi-stage VC that has backed the likes of Klarna and Spotify, led the $6.6 million round, with participation from Flourish Ventures, Alter Global, and notable angels, including Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga “GB” Agboola and former Morgan Stanley MENA president George Makhoul.

“The Fuse team is transforming payment infrastructure in one of the world's fastest-growing markets,” said Sanjot Malhi, partner at Northzone. “Their ability to simplify MENA's complex cross-border flows is exactly what the region needs.”

Fuse plans to use the fresh capital to grow its team, secure additional regional licenses, and expand its product suite beyond the UAE.

Djamo is one of several digital banking startups targeting Africa's underbanked. But unlike many that focus on large markets like Nigeria, Egypt, or South Africa, Djamo has carved out a niche in Francophone West Africa, specifically the Ivory Coast and, more recently, Senegal. It now serves over 1 million customers across both countries.

The Y Combinator-backed fintech just raised $17 million to expand its product suite for these retail customers and the thousands of small businesses it has onboarded in the last two years.

The equity round, the largest ever for an Ivorian startup, surpasses Djamo's $14 million Series A in 2022 and reflects continued investor confidence in its mission to make banking accessible and affordable.

Co-founder and CEO Hassan Bourgi declined to share the new valuation but said it has doubled since the last raise.

Bourgi founded Djamo with chief product and technical officer Régis Bamba in 2020 to close the financial access gap in French-speaking African countries, where few adults have bank accounts. Traditional banks in the region often cater to the affluent, leaving most of the population reliant on mobile money, a cheaper method that includes using phone numbers to make financial transactions.

Mobile money has been instrumental in expanding financial access across Africa. As of 2022, only 28% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa had a mobile money account, per the World Bank, and the region holds more than half of the world's total. But that progress has also created a ceiling.

Most mobile money platforms offer basic services: cash-in, cash-out, P2P transfers, and bill payments. While useful, they don't unlock more advanced financial tools like credit, investments, or long-term savings.

Djamo is positioning itself between mobile money and traditional banking. The startup offers the accessibility of mobile money with the financial depth of a bank account, a similar playbook that SoftBank-backed Opay and Transsion-owned PalmPay have used to scale to tens of millions of customers in Nigeria.  

Its target is a growing segment of users, mostly younger customers, who've outgrown mobile money wallets but still find traditional banks expensive, outdated, or inaccessible, the founders say.

“These users are evolving,” said Bourgi. “But they don't want to go where their parents went, into institutions with predatory pricing and aren't adapted to the new generation of customers. And this is what we are building, trying to become the go-to bank for this huge cohort of customers that is evolving now to more complex, wealth-building financing opportunities.”

Since our last coverage, Djamo has expanded beyond cards and peer-to-peer transfers. The Ivorian fintech now offers savings vaults, investment products — thanks to the region's first fintech-issued brokerage license — and salary-linked bank accounts, which Bourgi sees as important to boosting customer engagement.

Like many neobanks, Djamo attracts banked users who treat it as a secondary account for smoother bill payments and mobile money integration. But it's the unbanked, who are more difficult to activate, who show greater long-term potential. These users, who make up over 55% of Djamo's base, often treat the app as their primary financial service.

Bourgi says nine in 10 users who rely on Djamo as their main account come from this segment. To reach more of them, Djamo has adopted a hybrid approach, combining its app with offline agents who meet customers in person to facilitate transactions, similar to the mobile money model now more broadly adopted by fintechs across the continent.

Currently, only 5% to 10% of Djamo users receive salaries through the app. “The next phase for us,” Bourgi said, “is figuring out how to move from 10% to 50% of our users getting their salaries paid directly into Djamo.”

Meanwhile, Djamo is also ramping up services for small businesses — about 10,000 of them, many of whom started as retail users. According to CTO Bamba, the startup now provides bulk payments, payment links, and QR code tools to help merchants accept and manage payments directly within the app. 

The fintech generates revenue from merchant fees on online card purchases and a premium tier plan, which 25% of users pay for. Bamba adds that the company is exploring additional revenue streams, including lending and earning interest on customer deposits. It is in the process of securing licenses that will allow it to offer interest-bearing savings accounts and credit products.

Djamo's founders say the company has grown revenue 5x since 2022 and processed more than $4.5 billion in transactions since launch.

With its recent expansion into Senegal, Djamo has entered a market dominated by Wave, one of Africa's largest fintechs known for low-cost mobile money transfers. But rather than compete directly, Djamo positions itself as a complementary service, offering a digital banking experience where users can store funds and access more advanced tools like savings, investments, and credit.

Now a 250-person team, Djamo is betting that its new round of funding, led by Pan-African, gender-focused VC Janngo Capital, will help it scale those services across French-speaking Africa.

“We are thrilled to lead the largest VC round in Ivory Coast and double down on Djamo, a mission-driven fintech transforming access to financial services across Francophone West Africa,” said Fatoumata Bâ, founder and executive chair of Janngo Capital. 

“In a region where fewer than 25% of adults have access to formal financial services, and where women are twice as likely to be excluded, this is a vital mission. With women making up a third of its users, Djamo is not only closing the gender gap but unlocking economic opportunity at scale.”

Other investors participating in the round include SANAD Fund for MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), managed by Finance in Motion; Partech; Oikocredit; Enza Capital; and Y Combinator.

Runway, a startup developing a range of generative AI models for media production, including video-generating models, has raised $308 million in a Series D funding round.

General Atlantic led the round, which had participation from Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Nvidia, SoftBank, and others. The fresh capital will be put toward AI research and hiring, Runway said in a press release, as well to expand its Runway Studios film and animation production arm.

To date, Runway has raised $536.5 million, according to Crunchbase.

“Today marks an important milestone as Runway announces a significant next step towards our goal of creating a new media ecosystem with world simulators,” the company wrote in the press release. “[Our recent] advancements aren't merely incremental improvements; they form the foundation for an entirely new approach to media — an ecosystem built on AI systems that can simulate our world.”

Runway offers a suite of AI media tools, including video- and image-generating models. It faces stiff competition in the video generation space, including from OpenAI and Google. But the company has fought to differentiate itself, inking a deal with a major Hollywood studio and earmarking millions of dollars to fund films using AI-produced footage.

This week, Runway released Gen-4, a video-generating model that the company claims can create consistent characters, locations, and objects across scenes, maintain “coherent world environments,” and regenerate elements from different perspectives and positions within scenes. With products like Gen-4 and its recently launched API for video models, Runway hopes to hit $300 million in annualized revenue this year.

One possible roadblock is a lawsuit brought by artists against Runway and other generative AI companies that accuses the defendants of training their models on copyrighted artwork without permission. Runway argues that the doctrine known as fair use shields it from legal repercussions. It isn't yet clear whether the company will prevail.

Updated 6:21 a.m. Pacific: The original version of this story mistakenly indicated that Runway had raised $300 million in its Series D. It has, in fact, raised $308 million. We regret the error.

Zig has SIMD vectors, but I frequently need 3D vectors, and refuse to use things like vec3_add(vec3_mul(a, 2), b) etc since I mainly develop 3D graphics software.

I do all my coding in Python, but if I ever find myself needing to reach for C again, I'll certainly consider this.EDIT: Though is there a reason why ""fn"" is needed?  I would think the AST builder would still be able to identify the beginning of a function definition without it, and as a programmer, I can identify a function definition easily.

It is a pretty big improvement on C without changing the ABI. Maybe not the improvements I would make if I was smart enough to make a compiler, but better than doing C which I also enjoy despite it's warts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/03/1114198/rivals-are-rising-to-challenge-the-dominance-of-spacex/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Startups and legacy aerospace companies alike are aiming to take a chunk out of its launch business.

SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country's orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA's launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. 

Other space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. 

A host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX's main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX's Starship. 

Some of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX's Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.

But if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. “More players in the market is good for competition,” says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “I think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.” But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..

There are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk's financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA's commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. 

“They got government contracts from the very beginning,” says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. “I wouldn't say it's a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they're still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.”

SpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. 

The company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. “I think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,” says Combs. “SpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven't been. That's easier to do when you're backed by a billionaire.” 

What's finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors' deep pockets. 

Some of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX's Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. “There is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,” says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.

Rocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company's smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron's first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. 

Another challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates–backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.

Competitors are also rising for SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It's expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn't reusable, but it's less expensive than its predecessors, ULA's Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. 

Mark Peller, the company's senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. “One is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,” he says, “and the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.” He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. 

Vulcan's fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon's Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.

Meanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that's only a bit shorter than NASA's Space Launch System and SpaceX's Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. 

Competition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe's heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency's temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.

China is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. “They had no less than seven ‘commercial' space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,” Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China's efforts. “They are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they're successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.” The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer's reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap's Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a “chopstick clamp” recovery of the first stage, where it's grabbed by the launch tower's mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.

Before SpaceX's rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. 

The process is not without its challenges. Boeing's Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn't land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. 

SpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.

Any company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner's malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.

Another issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. 

Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump's NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX's Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. 

It is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.

SpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review's requests for comment for this story.

“I think there's going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,” Samson says. “I thought there'd be a separation between [Musk's] interests, but now, it's hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.”

Regardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: “It's going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.”

Sea-based launches are hitting their stride. That could lead to a lot more space missions with a lot less red tape.

The radiation-hardened technology will get its first test in an upcoming mission to the lunar south pole.

Building such facilities off Earth could have a lot of benefits. Early projects are underway.

The continent's imminent attempt at a commercial orbital launch could be the start of a bold new era that ends Europe's reliance on SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the US.

Even gargantuan Jupiter, with its whirling superstorms and volatile temperatures, has a soft side. A team of researchers recently documented stellar winds from the Sun, squishing the planet's magnetosphere and raising the temperatures in the planet's atmosphere by 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).

The team's research, published today in Geophysical Research Letters, is the first to document this phenomenon—a burst of solar energy hitting Jupiter. That said, the scientists believe the solar beatdown occurs a few times each month.

“We found that Jupiter's upper atmosphere responds globally—and quite dramatically—to compressions by the impinging solar wind,” said James O'Donoghue, a planetary scientist at the University of Reading in the UK and lead author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo. “A fast solar wind stream slammed into Jupiter's magnetosphere, which acts like a giant magnetic bubble pushing back against the solar wind, triggering intense auroral activity which dumped heat into the atmosphere.”

The atmosphere around Jupiter's poles then expanded, producing a thermal wave across the planet about 12 times as long as Earth's diameter. The team managed to spot the event using data from the Keck II telescope and measurements taken by the Juno spacecraft above Jupiter, which happened to be “in the right place at the right time” to witness the event, O'Donoghue said.

Juno was within Jupiter's magnetosphere up until the great squishing (as I'm calling it), at which point the compressed boundary suddenly put Juno outside of the magnetosphere. O'Donoghue added that astronomers have only seen similar heating on Earth—though on a much smaller scale.

“This may also happen at Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, but we haven't seen it yet,” O'Donoghue said. “It's a rare event, though… compressions like this might reach Jupiter (or any planet) about a couple of times a month, depending on solar activity.”

“Our solar wind model correctly predicted when Jupiter's atmosphere would be disturbed,” said Mathew Owens, a researcher also at University of Reading and co-author of the paper, in a university release. “This helps us further understand the accuracy of our forecasting systems, which is essential for protecting Earth from dangerous space weather.”

The research indicates that planetary atmospheres—including that of our solar system's largest world—may be more susceptible to the behavior of host stars than previously known.

In our solar system, bursts from the Sun could change the atmospheric dynamics of the larger planets, generating winds that move energy throughout the worlds.

The work is also a reminder of how dynamic our Sun is, and how many solar system processes remain poorly understood. More observations, both of our host star and our solar system's planets, will help scientists understand not only our solar system as an ecosystem, but also how similar—or unique—our system is from other star systems and exoplanets in the universe.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally here. The successor to one of the most innovative and popular consoles of all time is taller, heavier, and loaded with even more fun little bits that make the gadget brain go “brrrr.” We've got a bit until the Switch 2 is available for order, and you'll need to be jumping through some hoops if you want to get physical with it before then. But I snagged some time with it, and I am here to tell you: I love mouse gaming on the Switch 2.

Now, it would be irresponsible to say it's flawless. I didn't have ages with it, and I only tried it with a few games, and most of those games are still in development. What I experienced is just a little tease of what could be coming June 5, yet I'm all ready to proselytize.

Because the thing works exactly as you'd expect. It's so intuitive that I felt a little rattled—surprised by how much I liked it. You pointer finger naturally finds the shoulder button, and your thumb almost immediately finds the joystick. It feels a little taller than a normal mouse, and the Joy-Con digs into the palm. It feels similar to using a vertical mouse, but its definitely more slender, and I can see that possibly getting annoying after a few hours. It's also important to note I have tiny hands, and larger handed folks will probably want to explore the wonderful hobby of 3D printer ergonomic add-ons.

The thumb rests easily on the joysticks, too. Using them in conjunction with the mouse feature was like double fisting trackballs, and I personally think we now need a new category of mice that have a joystick under the thumb. I want to see where this goes. It was particularly useful in Civilization VII,where one joystick let you zoom in and out and the other controlled the camera. Having logged nearly 50 hours on the game on the MacBook Pro, I was surprised to find I liked the Joy-Con more than a touchpad.

Where I really understood how valuable this double mouse set up can be was in Drag X Drive. In the game, you use both Joy-Cons to control the wheels on your character's wheelchair. To move forward, you push both Joy-Cons forward, and to go in reverse you drag them both back toward you. Your only real limit for speed is how quickly you can move the two Joy-Cons in mouse mode.  My lil guy couldn't go too fast. What my character could do was turn on a dime. Dragging just on Joy-Con left or right had my character turning quickly. It felt nimble and was a sensation I desperately wanted to chase.

And that's a lot of my experience with the Switch 2. It gave me glimmers of something cool that I want to explore further. I like the webcam integration, even if the webcam's quality is a bit lackluster and the way it separates people from their backgrounds is crude. The built-in microphones are useful in a game like Mario Party Jamboree and will be even more useful for more casual gamers looking to play with their friends. As far as the device itself goes, the display is big and pretty. The thing feels lighter than a Steam Deck but more substantial and premium than the Switch or the Switch OLED.

But its the Joy-Cons I'm most enamored with. As more and more games come to handhelds that are better off with mouse control, we've watched a lot of companies come up with control solutions. There are touch pads and extra buttons and options for connection a mouse. But Nintendo's gone and done a Nintendo and over-engineered the hell out of its controllers, so that when you want a mouse it's as simple as a tug on some magnets. I'm super curious to see how this will work in the long term. Will the novelty of the ability wear off after hour two of Civilization VII? Will I find myself preferring Cyberpunk 2077 with the normal controller mode instead of mouse mode? Those answers will come with time and the June 5 launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. But after a couple of hours with the Switch 2, I can definitely say I'm optimistic about the future of mobile mouse gaming.

The planet Eternia still doesn't quite exist yet, but that didn't stop Amazon and MGM from giving CinemaCon 2025 attendees a sneak peek at the new film Masters of the Universe. Director Travis Knight is currently on set in the United Kingdom filming the highly anticipated adaptation of the popular Hasbro toy line, but sent a little featurette/sizzle reel to the convention so theater owners know that next summer, He-Man is coming.

Again, most of the fantasy world of Eternia is going to be made with huge elaborate sets and lots of CGI, so we didn't see much of that in the footage. What we did see was star Nicholas Galitzine in what looked like a young man's bedroom, sitting on the bed thinking about something. Later he was lying on the floor in those kind of pink and white clothes we associate with Prince Adam, He-Man's alter ego.

“We're making a film I've spent my entire life dreaming about,” Knight said in the footage.

“Bringing Eternia to life is no small task. The characters, the sets, the sheer scale,” Galitzine and co-star Camila Mendes, who is playing Teela, said. “We're doing it all. And with one thing in mind: to create an epic movie theater experience for audiences around the world.”

Further footage showed a stone room with a huge metal display in the middle of it showcasing the Sword of Power. We saw Galitzine swing it around a bit, as well as footage of him in the gym, lifting weights with Masters of the Universe posters on the walls.

“It's incredibly exciting to me to bring this world to life for a whole new generation,” Knight said.

“We're not making a cartoon here,” added one of his production team. “We're making a live-action fantasy film about the most powerful man in the universe.”

Of course, you can't have He-Man without an incredible cast of supporting characters and a killer villain. We didn't get to see Skeletor's face in the footage but Jared Leto plays the role, and it looks like very little of him, at least from the neck down, will be in CG. He had a highly detailed costume on with blue skin and seemed incredibly confident in it. There was also a rapid-fire edit of concept art featuring characters such as the Sorceress, Evil-Lyn, Man-at-Arms, Tri-Klops, and many, many more. Basically, each looked extremely close to the original animated versions you know and love, but just with a live-action twist.

The footage continued with time-lapses of sets being built and ended with a few scenes of Galitzine fighting in the He-Man outfit, and even a close-up of his long hair billowing in the wind.

Masters of the Universe is currently in production, aimed at a June 5, 2026 release.

The past two years, Universal chose CinemaCon to debut the first footage from its adaptation of Wicked and now, with the second and final film on the way, it had to happen again. Director Jon M. Chu, producer Marc Platt, and stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were all on hand to debut the first footage from the highly anticipated Wicked: For Good, and while it's not yet online, here's what happened.

Glass breaks on what appears to be a brand new apartment. Glinda is living in in the Emerald City. She goes out to her massive balcony and says, “Elphaba Thropp, I know you're out here, come in before the monkeys see you.” The camera circles her twice and then, boom, Elphaba is there.

Elphaba has set up a home for herself somewhere in the woods. There, she looks at some of the propaganda that has been spreading about her. Monkeys fly through Oz. Glinda gets a massive crown placed upon her head. Madame Morrible says that the witch will be caught soon, now that Prince Fiyero and his squad are hot on her trail. So, we see Fiyero riding a horse through the woods, in uniform, with many soldiers behind him.

The words “Our Wizard Lies” are written in the sky. People are on the streets of the Emerald City with torches. Glinda returns to the tower from the end of the first film and walks up the stairs.

Glinda and Elphaba are sitting together on a swing discussing all the good they can do together. A shot of Glinda in a huge church-like place, wearing a long, pink, flowing gown, is followed by a shot of Fiyero standing on an altar. Are they getting married?

A scene shows what appears to be Glinda and Elphaba back in the Wizard's big room, with massive flashing colored lights all around, and it looks like they are all dancing together. Someone handles a few yellow bricks.

The Wizard has what is clearly Dorothy, the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow in his palace and tells them to “Bring me the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West.” A follow-up to the dancing scene sees Fiyero pointing a gun at Elphaba with the Wizard there, only for him to shift it over to him. He's still on her side.

Elphaba is talking to Glinda and says, “You're the only friend I ever had.” “And I've had so many friends,” Glinda jokes back, and the two hug and cry.

As the footage ends, Elphaba is standing in place. She puts up her right arm and draws her hat in. She puts up her left arm and draws her broom in. Then she says, “I'm off the see the Wizard,” followed by scenes of her flying through Oz, being chased by the monkeys.

I know—much of that doesn't make sense, but it was a trailer filled with lots of very cool and intriguing moments. It certainly felt like a trailer audiences are sure to see later this summer, but we'll have to wait and see.

Wicked: For Good comes to theaters on November 21.

Details trickled out at a roundtable with the Switch 2's creators.

On Nintendo's specs page, the CPU and GPU in the Nintendo Switch 2 are boiled down to a vague ""Custom processor made by NVIDIA."" At a developer roundtable with some of the Switch 2's creators, we learned more about what to expect from the Switch 2's hardware, and the tools it can deliver to game developers.Producer Kouichi Kawamoto, technical director Tetsuya Sasaki, and director Takuhiro Dohta took questions from the press (questions and answers through interpreter Raymond Elliget) about the new Switch. ""Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,"" Sasaki said. ""What we really like to focus on is the value we can provide to our consumers."" Still, the group did drop some knowledge that can let us know what to expect.We learned a bit about the tech Nintendo is leaning on, as well as some details about the hardware that didn't make the spec sheet. Here's what we found out:

By sticking with Nvidia, Nintendo will be able to access its DLSS technologies.

Dohta confirmed that Nintendo uses DLSS upscaling technology and is offering it as a tool to others in response to a question from Inverse's Shannon Liao.""When it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K and whether the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to a smaller rate and an upscale is something that the software developer can choose,"" he said. ""And that's, I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from.""

As for hardware ray tracing, Dohta confirmed the chip can support it, and suggested this is yet another tool for software developers to choose to implement.

Nintendo's official spec sheet claims that the Switch 2's 5220 mAh battery lasts between 2 and 6.5 hours on a charge as a ""rough estimate."" The developers of the system were reluctant to put a more specific number on it. Sasaki pointed out that it depends heavily on the game you're playing and the conditions you use the system in.Dohta added that with features like GameChat, there are far more features on the system side that are more complex than the original system, and that the variability of battery life is even… wider than it was in Nintendo Switch, making it difficult to even compare the successor to the original system in terms of battery life.

When asked about Nintendo's solution for backwards compatibility with Switch games and the GameCube classics available on the system, the developers confirmed these games are actually emulated. (This is similar to what Xbox does with backwards compatibility).""It's a bit of a difficult response, but taking into consideration it's not just the hardware that's being used to emulate, I guess you could categorize it as software-based,"" Sasaki said of the solution.

The new Joy-Cons connect to the Switch 2 with Bluetooth 3.0. When asked about struggles players had with connecting multiple Bluetooth devices, including controllers and headsets, to the original Switch, Sasaki kept it simple: ""Yes, it has improved,"" he said.He added that the size of the system and its bigger antennas should have ""a big impact"" and enable better connections. Additionally, the number of antennas has increased and ""a lot"" of further adjustments have been made.

The Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch LCD display with support for HDR. A premium version of the original Switch had an OLED screen, which one member of the press said could be perceived as a downgrade.Sasaki said that during development, many advancements had been made in LCD technology.Kawamoto added that the OLED version of the original Switch didn't have HDR support, which this new LCD screen does.

When asked by CNET's Scott Stein if the top USB-C port on the Switch 2 could be used for external displays like Xreal glasses, Kawamoto said that only the bottom port on the system supports video out. ""So in terms of supporting the glasses, it's not an official Nintendo product, so it's hard to say, ""Kawamoto said.

The top USB-C port has been demoed with the new Nintendo Switch 2 camera and can also charge the system in tabletop mode.

The Switch 2 is an evolution, not a revolution, but it's got an exciting game lineup.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Nintendo Switch 2 feels familiar, but it doesn't feel the same. At a hands-on event in New York, I was among the first to play the successor to Nintendo's most popular ever console, and I came away largely excited, though that may be more because of the games than the hardware itself.Don't get me wrong, the Switch 2 itself is quite nice. But that $450 handheld-turned-console is only as good as the games that Nintendo and third-party developers create.The Switch 2 is very much a sequel, but one that's also clearly an evolution of Nintendo's point of view on gaming. The few hours I spent playing early games made me excited to spend more time with the device. Better start saving up.

That black matte finish on the Joy-Con 2 controllers and the system itself make an incredible first impression. The system, at 1.18 pounds with the Joy-Con 2 controllers attached, is a bit heavier than I expect a Switch to be, but the larger 7.9-inch display is worth it. (And that's still lighter than the best PC gaming handheld gaming PCs, like the Steam Deck OLED, which is 1.41 pounds.)There is something about the lack of color (other than the callbacks to the neon red and orange around the joysticks and under the Joy-Cons) that doesn't feel very Nintendo. Even the company's last attempt at having any sort of edge, with the GameCube, had indigo and orange options alongside black. But Hey, I had the black GameCube, so I can get past it. I'm sure there will be variant colors eventually.



The Joy-Cons come off with the press of release buttons on each side. I didn't spend a ton of time connecting and disconnecting controllers (in fact, most demos had the system hidden away). But on one unit I briefly tried it on, my first impression was that the click was strong. I wouldn't purposely wiggle the connector the wrong way, but I'm definitely not worried about accidentally pulling the Joy-Cons off.

Those longer controllers fit better in my hands than the originals did. They're still thin, but I found the length to be more comfortable, though I'm not sure many people will notice a huge difference.

The control sticks still seem to be potentiometer-style like on the original Joy-Cons. In a round-table discussion, the Switch's developers told the press that the Joy-Cons 2's sticks have been entirely redesigned for larger, smoother movements. But the words ""hall effect"" were never mentioned, if that was something you were hoping for. The sticks didn't feel all that different in a series of 10-15 minute demos, but I need more time with these to really feel how they've changed.Nintendo's new kickstand is a huge improvement over the original Switch, which had a kickstand so tiny it felt like an afterthought. On the Switch 2, you get a much larger, stable stand that leans to any angle you want. I could actually see using this one on an airplane tray.But it's not until you start gaming that you see the biggest improvement over the original Nintendo Switch: the new display. No, it's not OLED, so I can understand why some might think this is a step down from the OLED Switch model. But this LCD screen has been bumped up to 1920 x 1080 with a 120 Hz variable refresh rate. as well as HDR10 support that made Mario Kart World look fantastic. I sure didn't mind the lack of OLED in my brief time with the device, though I look forward to trying more games on the system, as most demos were presented on televisions.

As for the dock, I only saw it in one demo, paired with the Nintendo Switch 2 camera. It's definitely bulkier, which makes room for a cooling fan, but other than that, it seems to be similar to the existing Switch dock in practice.

While Nintendo's consoles have a reputation for ease of use and a focus on games above all other features, there's some PC gaming leaking into the Switch.First, there's the mouse —or mice, actually. Both Joy-Con 2 controllers have sensors that, when combined with the accelerometers and gyroscopes, letting them act as mice. I sought these games out at Nintendo's showcase, wanting to see if it felt like to use a mouse on a modern Nintendo console (After all, it's been a while since the 1992 SNES mouse). The Switch 2 wrist straps include little mouse skates to make scrolling smoother.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



The results were a mixed bag during my brief trials. In the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Metroid Prime 4 Beyond, you can switch between using the Joy-Con as a controller or mouse at will. With the mouse mode, I was far more exacting with Samus Aran's arm cannon than I was with a combination of the right joystick and motion controls. But while Nintendo has made the ZL and ZR buttons larger to accommodate this kind of use, the new Joy-Cons aren't much thicker, and I found wrist and index finger a bit uncomfortable by the end of the demo. By the end, I had switched back to the standard experience.

But I had a much better time with the upcoming Switch 2 version of Civilization VII. It felt similar to playing a Civ game on PC, and the slower pace made for a more comfortable experience. In fact, the game only requires a single Joy-Con to use as a mouse, but I do wish you could program some quick actions to the other controller.



For some, the standout mouse experience might be Drag x Drive, in which you use both mice simultaneously to play what is effectively Rocket League meets wheelchair basketball with robots. I've never seen a mouse used like this in a game, and I'm curious if this could actually send some ideas back to the PC space. Here, you use each mouse to control the wheels, rolling the robot around the court and revving to gain speed. It's a cool trick, though by the end of my demo I wondered if there would eventually be a mode where you could use a joystick.

Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition was demonstrated with a Pro controller, but developer CD Projekt Red has already committed to mouse control. I'm curious to see how that pans out.The big question here is how many people will be in a position to use their Joy-Cons like mice. While I play PC games at my desk, I tend to play console titles on my couch, and it's a literal stretch to reach forward to my coffee table. The Drag x Drive tutorial pointed out that you can use mouse mode on your pants, which did work, but I don't think that's a solution for long play sessions. And if that's the case, there's the question of how long developers will support it.

I couldn't help but note that Nintendo had nice mouse mats and a variety of sitting and standing desks for games with mouse control.

The other area where the Switch 2 feels like it's getting into more enthusiast territory is with various resolution options and quality modes. This occurred to a degree on the original Switch, with its 720p display (with some games that played at 540p) and an option to output at 1080p on the dock, but the Switch 2 is far more capable. This is a trend we've also seen on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.The Switch 2 can output to 4K at a max of 60 frames per second when docked. In games where you can pick a lower resolution, like 1080p or 1440p, that goes up to a 120 Hz variable refresh rate.Alternatively, the built-in screen can go up to 120 fps at 1080p, in handheld or tabletop mode. I played my original Switch in handheld mode on the couch all the time, so that's still quite an upgrade.

But it's not just the system that has graphics options. Games, too, will give you a degree of customizability. For example, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition has quality and performance modes to choose from.

At its showcase, Metroid Prime 4 was the only game in which Nintendo was explicit about what resolution and frame rate a game was playing at. In this case, it was in docked 1080p 120 fps performance mode, and the game felt extremely responsive. Between the high frame rate and the mouse option, that felt surprisingly like a Nintendo-made PC experience.

Otherwise, the only graphics performance data I heard about was from a Civilization VII developer, who said Firaxis Games is aiming for 1080p 60 fps, which seems fine for that game.

Nintendo is also releasing additional hardware accessories in a $79.99 Pro Controller and a $49.99 camera.



The Pro Controller feels much like the existing controller for the Switch, though I did feel the buttons were a bit clicker. My favorite part was the two buttons on the rear that can be mapped to face buttons, though I didn't see any demonstration controllers set up to use these features. The Pro Controller, like the right Joy-Con 2, features the new C button to enable and use the Switch 2's Game Chat.The Nintendo Camera will be a more divisive piece of technology. It's intended for use in Game Chat, but can also be used to put your face in games like Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, which put me and other players in the game to get roasted by Bowser if we didn't please him by winning mini games. The green screen effect was rough, though, with lots of jagged lines. You won't necessarily have to buy Nintendo's camera, though, as Nintendo's own website says you can use a ""compatible USB-C camera."" I guess I'll keep my Logitech StreamCam around just in case.

Did I mention Nintendo showed off a bunch of games? Nintendo's first-party library often consists of hit system sellers, and the system is launching with Mario Kart World, which is sure to be a huge seller (Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was a sales behemoth on the existing Switch). Here are a few standouts:

Mario Kart WorldThis game was the most memorable moment of the showcase. (My guess is it was being played at around 90 fps, but no one would say.) The game looked great both on TVs and on the Switch's HDR display. Racing was fine enough, but my favorite part was the Knockout Tour mode.Knockout Tour pits you against 24 other players as you race towards milestones rather than one finish line. At each milestone, a number of players are removed from the game, raising the stakes every few minutes. Dirty play seemed fair in this scenario, and luck and skill were equally important. This mode alone could sell some Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.

Playing with 24 racers makes the game feel far more grand, and the ability to drive off-road on huge maps gave me an idea of the type of varied environments the Switch 2 is capable of. I also got laughs out of the huge character selection, including alternate outfits like Mariachi Waluigi and surprising guests, like a cow.

Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate EditionThe fact that this game is coming to the Switch 2 seems to be a testament to the system's power. But in the corner of the demo area with mature games, it looked a bit rough, with pixelated edges on characters and some lackluster textures. A permanent watermark on the screen said this was an early build that isn't representative of the final product, so I'm hoping CD Projekt Red can put in some more optimization. I was told there are performance and quality modes for this game, but I'm not sure which I played.

Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome TourI only got to try a handful of the mini games and demos that showcase the Switch 2's new features, but I was shocked to learn this game isn't free. It's cute, and I particularly enjoyed a game in which you guess the frame rate objects are thrown at. Ends up I can tell 120 fps vs 60 fps after all.But I wouldn't pay for this. I think it would have made a fun pack-in like Astro's Playroom did for the PlayStation 5.

Donkey Kong BananzaPunching things is cathartic. But since I can't just punch things in real life, doing it as Donkey Kong is the next-best thing. This game showed off the way the Switch 2 handles destructive environments, which was impressive. You can break just about anything in certain levels of this game. There were points where I dug tunnels under an island just to see where I would eventually come out when I hit the end.

There's a ton of collectibles here, too. I have a feeling this game will keep completionists going for a while.Oh, and there was a cute robot hanging out with DK for part of the demo. It seems like a partner, but Nintendo reps wouldn't tell me anything about it.

Metroid Prime 4 Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 EditionThis long-awaited sequel to the first-person shooter arm of the Metroid franchise impressed. It looked great, and ran very smoothly at 1080p at 120 fps. While the game supports mouse mode, it didn't feel explicitly built for it. Still, I had enough fun in this demo to give either control mode a try again.

Drag x DriveI can see this combination of Rocket League and wheelchair basketball developing a cult following. Using both Joy-Cons in mouse mode was a workout, and I'm not sure how many people will have space for this kind of mouse movement. Still, I was surprised by the deep level of strategy, including extra points for jump shots and getting air off of ramps. I'm hoping for a more typical control scheme, which would make me consider playing this game more regularly.Nintendo Classics: GameCubeSoul Calibur II and F-Zero GX felt perfect during my demo. The controller felt awesome, though I noticed it didn't rumble. No notes. You will, however, need Nintendo Switch Online and a new Expansion Pack to access this library, which also includes The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (the second-best Zelda game) and Super Mario Strikers. Other games on display included Civilization VII, Hades 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Street Fighter 6, and Kirby and the Forgotten World — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.

Semiconductor industry can relax, for now.

Donald Trump introduced a sweeping set of import taxes on Wednesday that targeted nearly all U.S. trading partners — but offered a notable exemption for the high-tech industry.

The tariffs include a flat 10% fee on all incoming goods beginning April 5, followed by higher, customized rates for about 60 countries starting April 9. However, numerous items, including computer chips, copper, medicine, and lumber, will be excluded from the new import fees. Initial reports indicate the administration has said tariffs for semiconductors could come at a later date.

There is a catch with the exceptions. A senior official from the White House told a Reuters correspondent that the Trump administration is preparing separate tariffs for industries like semiconductors, drugs, and critical minerals. On the one hand, this means that these items will remain outside the scope of the current tariff framework (i.e., no 32% tariff on Taiwanese chips for now); on the other hand, it remains to be seen how high those import taxes will be.

Initially excluding semiconductors from the sweeping import taxes enables American companies to buy chips made in Taiwan without any curbs — good news for AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, as the majority of their chips are produced in Taiwan. Also, the exemption of semiconductors applies to chips produced in Europe, Japan, and South Korea, which is again good news for automotive and consumer electronics industries in the U.S. as both use loads of chips.

The exclusion also concerns chips made in China, however, including those made by companies controlled by the state and at fabs sanctioned by the U.S. For now, China's semiconductor industry can rejoice, unlike the American semiconductor industry, which will now have to pay 20% extra for European and 24% extra for Japanese tools they import to their fabs in the U.S.

While 20% to 24% does not sound like a lot compared to the over 50% tariff set on China-originated goods, we are talking about very expensive equipment. ASML's lithography tools cost a significant amount of money: a Low-NA EUV litho machine costs around $200 million, whereas a High-NA EUV litho system is projected to cost $380 million even without extra taxes. With Trump's tariffs, these tools will cost $240 million and $456 million, respectively, disrupting all the capital expenditure plans for companies building advanced semiconductor production facilities in the U.S., including Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Foundry.

Those who use mature process technologies — such as GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments — will also have to pay extra for their tools. Ultimately, this will make chips produced in the U.S. more expensive.

The highest adjusted rate goes to Vietnam at 46%, followed by Cambodia at 49%, Taiwan at 32%, and China at 34%, which on top of a previous 20% duty, brings China's total to 54%. Other countries affected include the European Union at 20%, Japan at 24%, South Korea at 25%, and India at 26%. The tariffs look massive and, in the case of China, even prohibitive.

While the punitive tariffs set on the majority of goods made in China were something to be expected, the massive import taxes on products from countries like India (32%), Taiwan (32%), Thailand (36%), Vietnam (46%), and other countries in the region will clearly hit the high-tech industry supply chain as large PC makers have moved their production away from China to these countries to avoid tariffs from the U.S. administration.

It seems manufacturers cannot actually avoid these tariffs, so expect products like PCs, smartphones, TVs, and other high-tech items to get more expensive in the U.S. and profitability of American companies to get lower.

However, some goods and countries (such as those already under heavy sanctions) are excluded. These exemptions include semiconductors, copper, drugs, lumber, specific minerals that the U.S. does not produce domestically, precious metals, energy resources, steel, aluminum, and vehicle-related goods already taxed under existing rules, and products covered under national security provisions.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that will create the United States Investment Accelerator Office within the Department of Commerce. According to the White House, it “shall focus on delivering the benefit of the bargain for taxpayers by negotiating much better deals than those of the previous administration.”

The order did not detail how this would affect already existing contracts and awards.

There were hints that Trump did not like President Biden's CHIPS and Science Act strategy to get semiconductor investments into the U.S. during his campaign. This became crystal clear in his first address to Congress in March, when he told the House Speaker to “get rid of the CHIPS Act” and spend the money for it to “reduce debt or any other reason you want to.”

Aside from this, the federal government staff purge hit the CHIPS Act office just a few days before the speech, with at least two-fifths of the current staff reportedly terminated.

The White House started reviewing CHIPS Act awards in February; some people familiar with the matter said the new administration wanted to renegotiate the terms enforced under the deal to “align with President Trump's executive orders and policies.” It's still unclear how these reviews will affect CHIPS Act winners, but scheduled fund disbursements are expected to be delayed.

Still, it's not all bad news for the semiconductor industry. The setting up of the U.S. Investment Accelerator office implies that the White House is seemingly continuing with the CHIPS Act and that companies that expect to receive subsidies aren't going to be completely stiffed by the new administration.

Furthermore, the executive order also directs it to assist investors for efficiency, reduce regulations, increase access to and use of national resources, facilitate research, and reduce regulatory barriers to increase investment in the United States. This new office is designed not just to release new federal funding for semiconductor investments but also to use the existing frameworks in Federal law so that anyone investing in the U.S. can take advantage of them.

Despite Trump's criticism of the CHIPS Act, he still understands the importance of the semiconductor industry. He even had TSMC announce an additional $100 billion investment in its Arizona plant in the White House, while Congress introduced an act that would give tax credits to chip designers. The current administration says that the most advanced AI chips will be built in the U.S., and the U.S. Investment Accelerator office will likely pave the way to help massive tech companies achieve that within its borders.

Nvidia promises 10x graphics performance over the original Switch

While Nintendo made a splash at yesterday's formal unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's hardware developers stayed quiet on the chip powering it. Now, Nvidia, which makes the custom system on a chip, has provided some more information in a blog post.

""Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,"" Switch 2 technical director Tetsuya Sasaki said at a developer roundtable. ""What we really like to focus on is the value we can provide to our consumers.""

Nvidia is following Nintendo's lead, withholding information like core counts and speeds. Still, the company claims the new chip offers ""10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch.""

Nvidia's RT cores allow for hardware ray tracing, lighting, and reflections, while tensor cores power DLSS upscaling. DLSS is likely being used to achieve up to 4K performance when the system is docked, and to help hit up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode.

The company also confirmed that the tensor cores allow for face tracking and background removal with AI, which was shown off with the new social GameChat feature as well as in Switch 2 games we went hands-on with, such as Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV. It isn't clear if this uses any of the same technology as Nvidia Broadcast on PC.

Additionally, Nvidia confirmed that the Switch 2's new variable refresh rate (VRR) display is powered G-Sync in handheld mode, which should prevent screen tearing.

Nvidia also powered the original Nintendo Switch, which used a custom variant of the Tegra X1. Nintendo managed to get a lot of mileage out of that chip, which was old when it launched; games are still coming out eight years later.

China is doubling down on the RISC-V architecture.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


RiVAI Technologies has launched the Lingyu CPU, China's first domestically designed high-performance RISC-V server processor. The unveiling occurred in Shenzhen, reflecting the country's ongoing push for greater self-sufficiency in semiconductor development.

The Lingyu CPU adopts a one-core, dual architecture approach, integrating 32 general-purpose computing cores (CPU) alongside eight specialized intelligent computing cores (LPU). The configuration efficiently handles tasks such as inference for open-source large language models. The architecture aims to balance processing power and energy efficiency, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO).

RiVAI Technologies was founded by Zhangxi Tan, who studied under Professor David Patterson, a pioneer of RISC-V and 2017 Turing Award recipient. Professor Patterson continues to serve as RiVAI's technical advisor, promoting RISC-V adoption in China.

The company is also said to have partnered with over 50 companies, including Lenovo and SenseTime, to promote adoption and ecosystem development for its RISC-V processor. These collaborations are expected to support the deployment of the Lingyu CPU across various industries and encourage further advancements in RISC-V-based computing solutions.

RiVAI's announcement comes amid broader efforts in China to shift away from reliance on x86 and Arm processors by promoting the adoption of RISC-V chips. The Chinese government is driving this initiative, encouraging research institutions, chipmakers, and companies to invest in RISC-V development.

Unlike proprietary architectures controlled by Western companies, RISC-V is an open-source instruction set that allows Chinese firms to design and manufacture processors without external restrictions. The push for RISC-V adoption comes in response to ongoing trade tensions and sanctions that have limited China's access to advanced foreign-made chips.

To accelerate this transition, the Chinese government provides policy support, funding, and incentives for companies working on RISC-V technology. Major domestic tech firms, including Alibaba and Tencent, have already started developing RISC-V-based solutions, while state-backed research institutions are working on software optimization for the architecture.

This shift could help China build a more self-sufficient semiconductor industry, reducing its dependence on Western technologies. However, challenges remain, including software compatibility and ecosystem development, which will determine the long-term viability of RISC-V as a mainstream alternative to x86 and Arm processors.

Urodynamics plus comprehensive clinical assessment (CCA) showed no superiority over CCA alone in treating women with refractory overactive bladder symptoms. CCA for female incontinence offered equally valuable insights for guiding treatment without the need for invasive procedures.

""The FUTURE trial is an important reminder for clinicians of all specialties to think critically about the diagnostic evaluations ordered for patient management. Urodynamics should not be a reflexive step before pursuing invasive treatments, but rather viewed as a tool to facilitate individualised care for patients,"" experts wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Mohamed Abdel-Fattah, MD, Aberdeen Centre for Women's Health Research, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom. It was published online on March 22, 2025, in The Lancet.

The majority of participants underwent BoNT-A treatment, reflecting UK practices, which may have limited the applicability of the results to countries with different treatment protocols. Follow-up was limited to 15-24 months, resulting in a lack of information on whether women in the CCA-only group would eventually require urodynamics. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in several participants not receiving the intervention or treatments during the initial 15-month follow-up period; however, an additional follow-up timepoint was arranged at 24 months for those who experienced these delays.

 April 03, 2025  

Atrial fibrillation diagnosed before age 70 years is associated with a 21% increased risk of developing dementia and a 36% higher risk for early-onset forms of the condition, according to the results of a large population-based study.

The findings strengthen a growing body of evidence linking atrial fibrillation and dementia, raising questions about optimal monitoring and intervention, said Julián Rodríguez García, MD, of Bellvitge University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, who helped conduct the research.

“While this is a population-based study and does not establish causality, it strongly suggests that early detection of atrial fibrillation in younger patients, along with more proactive management of atrial fibrillation and its aggravating factors — such as cardiovascular risk factors — could be key to reducing dementia risk,” said Garcia, who presented the findings at the 2025 annual congress of the European Heart Rhythm Association.

The study included more than 2.5 million men and women in Spain, aged 45 years or older without a history of dementia in 2007. García and his colleagues used anonymized data from the region's primary care research database, which covers more than 80% of the population, to identify incident diagnoses of dementia between 2007 and 2021.

At baseline, 3.25% of participants had atrial fibrillation. Across the entire population, atrial fibrillation was a significant, yet weak, predictor of dementia, raising risk by just 4%.

Stratifying participants by age revealed a more striking association. Among people aged 45-50 years, those with atrial fibrillation were 3.4 times more likely to develop dementia than those without the arrythmia (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.32-3.46).

Multivariate analysis showed patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation before age 70 years had a 21% increased risk for dementia and a 36% increased risk for early-onset dementia compared with those who were not diagnosed with the heart condition. These increased risks were even higher in the absence of stroke, at 23% and 52%, respectively, according to the researchers.

The findings align with previous studies suggesting that atrial fibrillation contributes to cognitive decline through mechanisms independent of clinical stroke.

“Dementia is often a multifactorial condition,” García said. “This may explain why atrial fibrillation has a greater impact in younger patients, where it could be one of the primary pathogenic factors. Conversely, in older individuals, additional contributors to cognitive decline — such as age-related neurodegeneration — may lessen the relative impact of atrial fibrillation.”

While cognitive screening may be beneficial in younger patients with atrial fibrillation, Garcia said “an even greater priority should be the intensive management of atrial fibrillation risk factors — hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea — as well as atrial fibrillation itself through anticoagulation and rhythm control.”

John Dodson, MD, MPH, director of the Geriatric Cardiology Program at NYU Langone Health, New York City, highlighted the study's strengths, including its large sample size and long follow-up period. “Since dementia takes a long time to develop, this period allows enough cases to accrue so that they can look at independent risk factors for the outcome,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Dodson also said the findings raise important questions about treatment. “It's unclear whether strategies that we use to treat atrial fibrillation as cardiologists could reduce the incidence of dementia,” he said. “It's a plausible hypothesis that proper anticoagulation, and maybe even maintaining normal physiology with restoration of sinus rhythm, could lower patients' risk. These are very difficult things to prove but I think a worthy avenue for more research.”

Alan Go, MD, associate director at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, said the findings echo US data showing stronger associations between atrial fibrillation and dementia in younger populations.

“Based on current evidence, for a person found to have atrial fibrillation without an obvious reversible cause, especially if under age 70 years, systematic evaluation for and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors should be performed,” Go said. People at risk for ischemic stroke should also engage in shared decision-making about oral anticoagulation, he said.

Go underscored the need for randomized, controlled trials that test whether preventing or effectively managing atrial fibrillation can delay or prevent dementia. “This observational study is limited as it didn't address several potential explanatory factors,” said Go. “But it highlights the need for trials that look at whether preventing development or recurrence of atrial fibrillation has any impact on a person's rate of cognitive decline and risk of ultimately developing dementia.”

This study was funded with a restricted grant by Bayer. The investigators disclosed no conflicts of interest. Dodson and Go reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

An exhalation delivery system that releases fluticasone into the nasal cavity for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis enhanced sleep quality and alleviated sinonasal symptoms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

“While this study provides important insights into chronic rhinosinusitis management, particularly in the context of sleep quality, it also emphasizes the need for personalized treatment strategies,” the authors of the study wrote. “The identification of IL-6 as a biomarker for predicting responses to nasal steroid therapy offers a promising tool for optimizing treatment outcomes.”

Rachel Nolte, with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on March 22 in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. 

The study lacked a control group and excluded patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

The study was funded by an investigator-initiated grant from Optinose, which markets the exhalation delivery system. One author reported serving on the advisory board of Neurent Medical.

More than 80% of Malaysian primary healthcare providers lacked training in intimate partner violence (IPV) management. Factors such as longer work experience in primary care, prior training in managing IPV, and knowledge of the issue were associated with greater perceived preparedness.

“By recognizing IPV as a significant public health burden, healthcare systems can enhance their response capacity and contribute to reducing the negative physical and psychological impacts of violence on victims,” the authors wrote.

“A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders, policymakers, and healthcare educators is needed to establish a supportive health system with clear referral pathways across all levels of care,” they added.

The study was led by Ying Ying Chan, of the Institute for Public Health, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, in Shah Alam, Malaysia. It was published online on March 31, 2025, in BMC Primary Care.

The study's cross-sectional design limited the ability to establish causal relationships between variables. The predominance of female participants may have influenced the findings as male perspectives were underrepresented. Additionally, the self-reported nature of the data introduced the potential for social desirability bias, considering the sensitive topic of IPV.

This study was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme of the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education. No relevant conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

The sponsor of two phase 3 clinical trials of an add-on agent to treat age-related macular degeneration has decided to halt both trials after they showed the add-on treatment did not outperform either of the anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents it was designed to boost when the medications were used alone.

The studies of sozinibercept 2 mg (Opthea), also known as OPT-302, failed to meet their primary endpoint of improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after a year of treatment when compared with the singular agents. One trial evaluated sozinibercept in combination with aflibercept 2 mg (Eylea), the other in combination with ranibizumab 0.5 mg (Lucentis). The comparator in both trials was aflibercept or ranibizumab used alone.

Vascular endothelial growth factor is responsible for the growth of new blood vessels in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Aflibercept targets VEGF-A and -B along with placental growth factor; ranibizumab targets VEGF-A. Sozinibercept acts by blocking VEGF-C and -D, according to Opthea.

“The hope was that by blocking VEGF-A, -C, and -D, we would see improved efficacy above and beyond our current VEGF-A blockade, especially given that there are a subset of patients who have a suboptimal response,” Jason Hsu, MD, codirector of Retina Research at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News.

The aflibercept trial, known as COAST, evaluated intravitreal sozinibercept every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with intravitreal aflibercept administered every 8 weeks after three loading doses delivered 4 weeks apart, comparing with the use of aflibercept only every 8 weeks. The ranibizumab trial, known as ShORe, compared sozinibercept every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with ranibizumab every 4 weeks vs ranibizumab only.

After Opthea announced results last week of the failed COAST trial, the company decided to speed up the readout of topline data from the ShORe trial, which also failed to show the combination treatment with sozinibercept was superior to ranibizumab alone.

In COAST, patients receiving sozinibercept combination therapy with a dosing regimen of every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks had an average change in BCVA of 13.5 and 12.8 letters from baseline to week 52, respectively, vs 13.7 letters with aflibercept only (P = .86 and .42, respectively), the company reported.

In ShORe, patients who received sozinibercept combination therapy had an average improvement of 13.3 letters with treatment every 4 weeks or 12.6 letters with treatment after 8 weeks after a year of treatment, whereas those on ranibizumab only experienced an average improvement of 14.3 letters (P = .32 and .09, respectively), the company said.

“We are disappointed that COAST and ShORe did not demonstrate the improvements in vision with sozinibercept combination therapy compared to standard of care that we had hoped for,” Frederic Guerard, PharmD, CEO of Opthea, said in a press release.

In the press release, Opthea stated it must sort out a number of obligations to regulators and investors. “In light of these matters, there remains material uncertainty as to Opthea's ability to continue as a going concern,” the company stated.

Hsu noted the phase 2b study of sozinibercept in combination with ranibizumab “looked promising,” and demonstrated an improvement in BCVA of more than three letters over ranibizumab alone, and gains of more than six letters in patients with occult choroidal neovascularization.

“Therefore, many of us were looking forward to the results of COAST and ShORe,” he said.

The phase 3 trials included a dosing regimen of sozinibercept injections every 8 weeks along with the standard dosing of every 4 weeks used in the phase 2b trial.

“In the published subgroup analysis of the phase 2b trial by lesion type, OPT-302 demonstrated the greatest benefit in occult lesions, so it will be important to see what proportion of patients in the phase 3 trials had occult lesions and if these proportions were similar to the phase 2b trial,” he said. “If there ended up being a higher proportion of minimally classic lesions in the phase 3 trials, for example, that may have contributed to the apparent negative study results. In retrospect, it might have been better to specifically focus on recruiting a high proportion of occult choroidal neovascularization.”

Adding a second agent to the standard anti–VEGF-A regiment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration has been “a high bar,” Hsu said. He cited the previously published CAPELLA phase 2 trial of an anti–platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (rinucumab) combined with aflibercept to treat the neovascular form of the condition, which failed to show any benefit of the combined treatment.

The bispecific antibody faricimab (Vabysmo), which blocks both VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2, is one combination therapy that has demonstrated durability in treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration, Hsu said.

“I think there will be other combination therapies that may also prove fruitful in the future,” he said. “For instance, blocking other inflammatory mediators in combination with VEGF-A may prove to yield better results. I'm still optimistic.”

The phase 3 and phase 2b studies were funded by Opthea. Hsu disclosed his group has received grant support as a clinical trial center for Opthea, Genentech/Roche and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that patients trying to lose weight should first try 6 months of behavior interventions that include a calorie-restrictive diet, weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity, self-monitoring of food intake, and removing unhealthy food triggers if possible. Yet many patients are unsuccessful at modifying their behaviors, even with regular health counseling.

In a study published last month in Nature Medicine, researchers found that patients who did just 1 month of behavior modifications instead of 6 months before starting a weight-loss medication doubled their weight loss when they added an obesity medication to the mix. The study showed that many patients who struggle to lose weight on lifestyle modifications alone could benefit from their primary care physician prescribing obesity medications earlier. 

“We showed more success when we added medication early on,” said lead study author Jena Shaw Tronieri, PhD, director of Clinical Services at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Whether patients add glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) medications really depends on if they're having success with weight loss, said Tronieri. Patients wouldn't want to add them if they were seeing success because of the potential side effects, but a large percentage of patients don't experience clinically meaningful weight loss without the addition of medications, and those patients can be determined fairly early in the process.

“Our study showed that you can tell within a month who is going to be successful with behavior modifications and who is not,” said co-study author Thomas A. Wadden, PhD, a professor of psychology in psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine.

While recommendations from USPSTF still suggest that patients should continue with behavioral modifications for 6 months, this study showed that between 35% and 40% of patients aren't going to lose significant weight within 6 months without obesity medications, said Wadden.

Behavior modifications are even more difficult because many patients don't have the counseling shown in this study and are, therefore, trying to change their eating and lifestyle habits on their own, which can be an uphill battle. This is especially true for patients who are on the verge of a potential comorbidity like diabetes or heart disease and could turn the tide if they saw the scale tick down more rapidly.

It's important to note that this study used an older-generation obesity medication called Phentermine, a prescription medication used to lessen appetite that's much less effective than a GLP-1 drug. The expected weight loss on Phentermine is 5% to 7%, while the expected weight loss on a GLP-1 medication is around 10% to 15%.

“You can imagine that if a GLP-1 were used for the study, it would have been even more effective than this weight loss medication,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine & Geriatrics at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine in St. Louis.

This study tells us that if you try behavioral interventions for a month or so and it doesn't work, then it's most likely not going to work, said Al-Aly. For many patients, spending an extra 5 months struggling to lose weight ends up being a waste of time, he said.

The driver for making behavioral interventions doesn't just depend on the individual but also on their environment, including their relationships, social habits, and the food environment in which they exist, said Al-Aly.

“In our society, all of those can be headwinds against you,” he said.

While a person is trying to push with their individual willpower with behavior modifications, it's not so easy in a country with an ultra-processed food culture, huge food portions at restaurants, long working hours, and so many people seated all day at desk jobs, said Al-Aly.

“It's often a David and Goliath struggle, and that's why eventually a lot of behavioral interventions fail. You're a small factor in an ecosystem that's constantly pushing you to consume more, to exercise less, and to drive more,” said Al-Aly.

For many Americans, GLP-1s help them to push back against the tides.

How long patients continue with behavioral modifications might also depend on their insurance coverage, said Supriya Rao, MD, director of Medical Weight Loss and clinical assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.

This might not change until results from studies like this one are replicated in larger studies with GLP-1s and the recommendations from USPSTF also change, which could take time. While some insurance companies only require a BMI of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one weight-related comorbidity like diabetes or high blood pressure to cover GLP-1 drugs, “others require patients to stay on behavior modifications for a longer period of time in order for them to cover the cost of the medications,” said Rao.

Behavior modifications are an important aspect of living a healthier life on GLP-1s, but many patients have found that they're more inspired to eat a healthy diet and to exercise once they've started taking the medications. A study published in the March 2024 issue of the International Journal of Obesity found that GLP-1s altered food preferences in patients, causing them to eat fewer high-fat and high-sugar foods.

Once the food noise is gone and they're finally able to concentrate on something other than their next meal, exercise becomes easier, and so does eating healthy. “When you lose weight, it's encouraging, so you might become more physically active. Once you've lost 10 or 15 pounds, you might be more excited to go to the gym and workout,” said Wadden.

It's a positive feedback cycle for many patients, which means that just because you add the medications doesn't mean you give up the modifications. It's important that you do both, and these medications might make it easier to do just that.

“When you have some success, that begets more success,” said Wadden.

 April 03, 2025  

Diagnosing and treating cardiac ailments can be difficult for primary care clinicians, with initial symptoms of serious heart disease, at times, mimicking less serious and transient issues.

In addition, those in primary care are usually juggling to try and address several medical issues within fairly short visits. For instance, patients may only feel comfortable enough to share or recall troublesome symptoms in the final minutes of a routine visit, such as an annual physical, said Bimal Ashar, MD, clinical director of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore.

“On their way out the door, they [patients] say, ‘I didn't mention that I'm getting these heart palpitations every now and then — sometimes they'll last for minutes,'” Ashar said.

Consider the following recommendations on diagnosing and addressing cardiac illnesses in primary care settings.

Patients may unknowingly make light of early symptoms of severe cardiac illnesses. In fact, this can even happen amongst fellow physicians, Ashar said. There is a tendency to shrug off signs, such as a persistent feeling of heartburn.

“As we age, we start to ignore more and more symptoms. ‘Yes, yeah, my back's bothering me, but I'm now in my upper 50s, and you know that happens, right?'” Ashar said. “That mentality can creep into other symptoms that may be a little bit more ominous.”

Primary care physicians (PCPs) are often called to detect signs of cardiac disease that fall outside of classic textbook definitions for it, such as crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm accompanied by shortness of breath, Ashar said. Most patients present with less clear signs, he said.This is the case “especially when we think about heart disease in women,” Ashar said. “Women having heart attacks may not present with that crushing chest pain and shortness of breath. Instead, they may present with more atypical-like jaw pain, arm pain, and nausea.”

Recent papers drawing from patient experience in the United Kingdom and the United States — including the US Veterans Health Administration and Medicare Advantage programs — have pointed to missed opportunities in detecting heart failure in primary care. Researchers, including Clare Taylor, PhD, of Oxford University, Oxford, England, have called for increasing use of the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing to aid in diagnosis of heart failure in primary care settings.

Physicians are often faced with competing and emerging guidelines and recommendations about when to test and treat cardiac conditions, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), Ashar said. Additionally, some physicians in their 50s and 60s may not be familiar with newer, helpful tools, such as the H2FPEF Score calculator, said Ashar.

It is difficult for PCPs to stay current on all symptoms and conditions they may see in the office and apply that knowledge effectively, especially when they may have only 20 minutes with a patient. “Staying current is getting to be more important, given that there are now specifically designed treatments that can help treat conditions like HFpEF,” Ashar said.

Another potential challenge for PCPs is considering diagnoses that were once thought to be quite rare, Ashar said. Cardiac amyloidosis may mimic HFpEF symptomatically, but there can be clinical clues — such as low voltage on an ECG and a very high BNP level — that may point to the former, Ashar said.

“This may be less important to primary care providers who have easy access to cardiologists, but for those who don't, a condition like cardiac amyloid can easily be missed,” Ashar said. “Given advances in treatment, delays in diagnosis can be very consequential.”

“Patients who have had any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or postpartum are at higher risk of heart disease earlier in life,” said Scott Hartman, MD, associate professor of family medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York. Hartman served as a co-author on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-commissioned Million Hearts Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package, a toolkit for outpatient clinicians aimed at improving patient outcomes.

Yet, postpartum hypertension can often be missed due in part to limited medical visits following pregnancy.

Insurers tend to cover one postpartum visit to check on the health of new mothers, with these visits often occurring about 6 weeks after these women give birth. In too many cases, this visit is missed entirely. A 2022 study based on records of patients with commercial health insurance found that only about 60% of new mothers or birthing people had at least one postpartum outpatient visit within 8 weeks of hospital discharge. The study results — published in AJOG Global Reports — also showed that around 30%-40% of patients with preexisting medical morbidity did not attend a postpartum visit.

But even when these visits do happen, postpartum hypertension can be overlooked. 

At these visits, for example, patients may be reconnecting with their PCPs after seeing mostly their obstetricians or midwives. The physician already has a long list of issues to cover with a returning patient, including checking on their experience with the delivery, persisting pain, mental health, and possible issues with nursing.

The Family Medicine Education Consortium's IMPLICIT Network: The 4th Trimester Program can help in ensuring postpartum hypertension diagnoses are not missed, Hartman said. The American Academy of Family Physicians also offers a toolkit on postpartum care, including hypertension. The Million Hearts Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package offers a downloadable toolkit with resources for clinicians engaging in prenatal and postpartum care, as well.

“Increasing emphasis on inpatient-outpatient care handoffs and transitions and communication between perinatal care and primary care clinicians offer important solutions to the prevention of hypertensive complications in the postpartum period,” Hartman said.

For primary care, one of the critical roles in protecting the heart is helping patients develop and maintain habits that prevent cardiac illnesses, as well as identifying factors that could put patients at higher risk, such as genetics.

Jennifer Buckley, MD, chair of the Rhode Island Academy of Family Physicians, Providence, Rhode Island, makes a point of asking patients to talk about their health goals, thus carving out time for these important conversations. This gives patients time during their visit to identify areas where they may need extra help, such as working on their nutrition, mental health and stress management, tobacco cessation, and body movement and exercise plans.

“I have found that this is something that has opened up the conversation in a way that is really patient-centered, because they can go anywhere with it,” Buckley said.

This approach also helps Buckley work with patients to come up with simple ways to improve their health. For example, she sometimes pulls up videos on YouTube to show patients accessible fitness options, such as 10-minute high-intensity interval training, seated strength training, or yoga.

“I'll say, ‘Let's watch this together. Look what this person is doing. You can do this in your home,'” Buckley said. “You have to figure out what is important for your patient at that point in time and then help them to develop a plan to achieve it.”

 April 03, 2025  

Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped to its lowest level since 1983, according to a major survey. 

An analysis of the latest British Social Attitudes survey by The King's Fund and the Nuffield Trust showed a “startling collapse” in the proportion of people satisfied with the health service and social care.

The survey by the National Centre for Social Research, conducted between 16 September and 27 October 2024, polled nearly 3000 adults in England, Scotland, and Wales. It found that 59% of adults were dissatisfied with the health service, up 7% in a year and the highest level on record.

Only 21% reported being satisfied with NHS services — the lowest figure recorded. Satisfaction has plummeted from 60% of adults in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and from a peak of 70% in 2010. 

Dissatisfaction was highest in Wales, where 72% of respondents expressed discontent.

There was a divide between generations. Younger people reported significantly lower satisfaction rates than older age groups, with satisfaction among under-65s falling from 24% to 19%. In contrast, satisfaction among over-65s rose slightly from 25% to 27%.

For the first time, accident and emergency (A&E) services were rated as the NHS's worst-performing area. The survey found:

Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust and one of the report's authors, said it was “the most dramatic loss of confidence in how the NHS runs that we have seen in 40 years of this survey.”

The findings demonstrated “just how dismayed” people are about the state of the NHS, said report author Bea Taylor, fellow at the Nuffield Trust. “The government says the NHS is broken, and the public agree,” she underlined.

In a statement, Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the “barometer of public feeling” agreed with the government's view of a broken NHS and it needed to “get on with the job of fixing it.”

The analysis also showed a sharp drop in satisfaction with GPs. Until 2018, general practice had consistently been the most highly rated NHS service. However, declining levels of satisfaction meant that by 2024, only 31% of adults said they were satisfied with GP services, while 49% said they were ‘very' or ‘quite' dissatisfied. 

Only 23% of respondents said they were satisfied with the length of time it took to get a GP appointment, whilst 62% said they were dissatisfied.

“The unfortunate reality is that patient need for GP care and services continues to outstrip the resources available to us to deliver it,” commented Dr Michael Mulholland, honorary secretary of the Royal College of General Practitioners, in a statement.

Public satisfaction with NHS dentistry fell to a record low of 20%, compared with 60% in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, whereas dissatisfaction (55%) was at a record high and the highest for any specific NHS service. 

The survey highlighted widespread concerns beyond emergency and primary care:

Despite these concerns, 51% of the public said they were “very” or “quite” satisfied with the quality of NHS care. This view was more dominant among older people, with 68% of over-65s satisfied with the quality of care compared with 47% of those under 65.

“Support for the core principles of the NHS — free at the point of use, available to all and funded by taxation — endures, despite the collapse in satisfaction,” noted Taylor.

Survey respondents also identified key priorities for improving NHS services. These included making it easier to get a GP appointment (51%), improving A&E waiting times (49%), and increasing staffing levels (48%).

Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers, described the analysis as “a wake-up call for the NHS.” She called for “radical action” to restore public confidence and “turn the tide on falling patient satisfaction.”

Dr Rob Hicks is a retired NHS doctor. A well-known TV and radio broadcaster, he has written three books and has regularly contributed to national newspapers, magazines, and online. He is based in the UK.

The pathogens Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium are common causes of sometimes-fatal intestinal diseases in humans, other mammals and birds worldwide.

Now, findings from researchers at Texas A&M University provide new, evidence-based insight into minimizing the risk of these diseases at canine facilities.

""In adult, healthy humans and animals, these diseases usually cause diarrhea and occasionally other minor ailments, but for infants, puppies and the immunocompromised, infection could be deadly,"" said Loni Taylor, PhD, DVM, an epidemiologist with the Texas A&M University School of Public Health, who led the study. ""We wanted to identify the factors associated with kennel-housed dogs in Texas that test positive for both diseases.""

For their study, published in Comparative Medicine, Taylor and five colleagues with Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences sought to find out if a dog's score on the Purina Fecal Scoring chart, breed, sex or age was associated with testing positive on a fecal screening test for either Giardia, Cryptosporidium or both organisms together.

To accomplish this, they tested fecal samples collected from a census sample of 153 clinically normal dogs housed at Texas kennels between March and October 2021. Breeds included golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, beagles and a variety of large hounds and hound mixes.

The sex, age, breed and location were noted for the 153 dogs studied. In addition, fecal scores were determined by a single researcher using visual assessment of the samples, based on the Purina Institute metric (where 1 is hard and 7 is watery).

A secondary data analysis and statistical analysis found that dogs were significantly more likely to test positive for Giardia (45%) than Cryptosporidium (7%) (P < 0.01), although no clear link was found between sex or breed and these infections.

In addition, kennel-housed dogs 18 months of age or younger had 3.4 times the odds of Giardia infection compared with older dogs, and hard stool was associated with negative test status for Giardia in the stool.

No statistically significant relationship was found for age or fecal score and Cryptosporidium-positive test status, and Taylor noted that additional studies with larger sample sizes could help identify such a relationship.

The primary takeaway is that age and fecal score are important factors for choosing which dogs to screen for subclinical Giardia. And given the increased odds of Giardia infection, screening should be as robust as the recommended combination of testing methods.""

Hospitals, some of the busiest places, can also be among the loneliest. 

Amid the din of care teams and clinicians, security and custodial teams, those dealing with illness and hospitalization often feel alone in the crowd. Groups like the Patient Stories Collective help patients and caregivers find the words to reflect and articulate their experiences during hospitalization and illness. 

It is one of 24 groups this quarter that received Penn Medicine CAREs grants to support their work. 

The funds will be used to help train volunteer medical students, who will then be paired with patients referred from palliative care, oncology, family medicine, and social work.

Patients will then be paired with a medical student volunteer who will, over the course of a month, work closely with the patient to explore the narrative shared and finally, transcribe the patient's story. At the end of this experience, patients will receive a copy of their story, and for interested patients, student artists will create an accompanying illustration.

""The aim is to empower patients to tell their stories of their health care experience using their own words. We hope that from storytelling, patients can find greater meaning,"" said fourth year medical student Isabel Yoon, who added that that the group hopes to work with patients across the health system interested in sharing their stories.

Yoon is joined by co-leads Grace Wu (fourth year medical student), Jennifer Guo (first year medical student), and the group's faculty advisor Amanda Swain, MD, assistant professor of Family Medicine and Community Health and faculty director for UME Medical Humanities Curriculum. 

Other funded projects this quarter will seek to ease the overdose crisis, combat social isolation, and address unmet mental health needs in our communities. For more than 12 years, Penn Medicine faculty, staff, and students have used the Penn Medicine CAREs Grant program to increase the impact their community service activities can have, with more than $1 million in funding powering more than 1,000 projects since the program's inception.

Other projects getting funding this quarter include:

Non-fatal overdoses in the Norristown area have increased by almost 20 percent since 2023. The community goals in Norristown, Bridgeport, and King of Prussia include raising public awareness about the opioid crisis and the importance of naloxone (Narcan) in saving lives. Karen Brooks, MSN, RN, Nurse Manager with the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, will use the funding to cover the cost of holding community training workshops and providing Narcan kits to participants. Attendees will receive training on how to spot signs of an overdose, safely administer Narcan, and follow up with emergency services.

Since 2013, the Penn Center for Community Health Workers (PCCHW) has delivered IMPaCT©, a proven approach to improving health and well-being through community health worker (CHW) support. The Renegades, led by lead community health worker Anthony Davis, is a support group for Veterans Administration (VA) patients facing chronic illness and social isolation. 

Although PCCHW's formal partnership with the VA ended in March 2024-after seven years of supporting more than 900 veterans-Anthony and The Renegades remain highly active. They meet during the growing season at Bartram's Garden, run a mentoring program at Guy Bluford Elementary for 7th and 8th graders focused on conflict resolution and career development, and host community outings like bowling, movies, and museum visits. Anthony's funds will cover refreshments, activities, garden tools, and transportation.

Leonie Kurzlechner, a second-year medical student, is co-president of the Perelman School of Medicine chapter of the National Association for Mental Illness. Her funding will support mental health first aid training and resources for local schools. Goals include screening for mental health conditions and abuse, connecting students to free social work and psychiatric resources, and training school staff and students in mental health first aid. The aim is to reduce stigma around mental illness, improve access to care, and support Penn Medicine's mission of promoting community well-being.

CAREs grant recipients are selected according to criteria outlined in hospital community needs assessments, which document areas for improving health in the community, from treating substance use disorders, to addressing neighborhood conditions and navigating health systems and beyond.

Human perception is the ultimate standard for assessing display quality. However, using human inspection as a metrology method in display evaluation for development or production presents challenges due to variations between observations and observers.

Human vision is subjective, unquantifiable, and difficult to replicate, making it hard to apply consistent standards across inspectors.

In a production environment, this variability makes it difficult to apply visual quality standards consistently across multiple sources in a supply chain. It increases the risk of approving defective devices or rejecting functional ones, both of which add costs to the manufacturing process.

Human inspection also lacks detailed quantitative data on defect types and occurrences, as observers tend to identify only the most obvious defects. Additionally, with displays serving as key user interfaces in consumer devices—from televisions to smartphones to automotive interiors—quality control measures that consider human visual experience are especially important in display manufacturing.

Visual display testing is increasingly being automated using photometric and colorimetric imaging systems that objectively quantify visual qualities such as brightness (luminance), color, and contrast. These systems also detect defects like stuck-on or stuck-off pixels, lines, and mura (non-uniform areas or blobs in a display).

Imaging systems with light and color measurement capabilities (imaging colorimeters) provide spatial tolerances for a display's visual qualities, including size, position, and location. An imaging colorimeter maintains the spatial relationship of measurements across the display, which is essential for assessing spatial variations.

Currently, several commercial systems use imaging colorimeters to detect display non-uniformities in color and brightness, as well as discontinuities such as line and point defects. However, developing an automated system that accurately identifies more subtle defects in a way that aligns with human perception has been more challenging.

Until recently, creating precise software algorithms for automated defect classification that directly correlates with human perception has been difficult. This is partly because human perception of noticeable differences across a display depends on contextual factors that influence defect severity. Standard defect analysis algorithms—such as threshold setting and edge detection—do not always align with how humans perceive these imperfections.

Cervical artery dissection is a tear in an artery in the neck that provides blood flow to the brain. Such a tear can result in blood clots that cause stroke. A new study has found almost a five-fold increase in the number of U.S. hospitalizations for cervical artery dissection over a 15-year period. The study is published on April 2, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

A dissection in the artery wall is most often caused by trauma due to motor vehicle accidents but can also occur with smaller injuries. Heavy lifting has also been shown to cause dissection in some people.

""Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, especially in people under 50, so it is crucial to detect it right away,"" said Shadi Yaghi, MD, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

Strokes that are not fatal can lead to long-term disability, poor mental health and reduced quality of life. Our research found a dramatic increase in the number of hospitalizations for cervical artery dissection with rates rising steadily year over year.""

Shadi Yaghi, Brown University

For the study, researchers reviewed 15 years of U.S. health data to identify 125,102 people hospitalized for cervical artery dissection. Participants had an average age of 51, and just over half had a stroke at the same time as dissection. Of all participants, 65% were white, 10% were Black, 8% were Hispanic, 3% were Asian or Pacific Islander, and 14% were of other racial groups.

Researchers compared the number of hospitalizations to U.S. Census data to determine the annual rate of cervical artery dissections. They then calculated the average annual percentage change in those rates.

Researchers found the number of dissections increased from 11 cases per one million people in 2005 to 46 cases per one million people in 2019, with an average annual increase of 10%. Results were similar for both female and male participants.

The average annual increase for Hispanic participants was 16%, for Black participants it was 13%, Asian participants, 12% and white participants, 8%.

Researchers also found a greater average annual increase among people 65 and older at 12% compared to 8% for people under 65.

""Possible reasons for this nearly five-fold increase over 15 years include greater awareness of cervical artery dissection by health care professionals, better access to imaging to help identify it and an overall increase in this condition for which a cause has yet to be determined,"" said Yaghi. ""Given the rising incidence of cervical artery dissection, our study underscores the importance of finding prevention strategies as well as new treatments to reduce the risk of stroke.""

A limitation of the study was that the hospital admission data does not include undiagnosed or untreated cases, so the number of cases may be even higher.

Sedentary behavior has become a national health crisis, with 1 in 4 U.S. adults sitting for more than eight hours a day, increasing their risk for heart disease, stroke, and mental health challenges, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To help people move more, the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health of all, invites communities nationwide to walk together on Wednesday, April 2.

Adopting healthier routines doesn't have to be intimidating or overwhelming according to Eduardo Sanchez MD, MPH, FAHA, the Association's chief medical officer for prevention. Routine walks can be a simple yet powerful way to break the cycle of sedentary behavior.

Walking is one of the easiest and most accessible ways to improve both physical and mental well-being. Even small steps can lead to big changes. By making movement a part of your day - whether that's walking your dog, picking parking spot a little further away from the entrance, or strolling with family - you're investing in your heart health and improving your overall wellness.""

Eduardo Sanchez MD, MPH, FAHA, chief medical officer, American Heart Association

To make the most of National Walking Day, consider these tips:

If walking isn't accessible for you, consider seated exercises or gentle stretching to stay active.

Regular physical activity, such as walking, is one of the most effective ways to improve overall health and is also a key component of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8™, a collection of the most critical factors for achieving optimal cardiovascular health.

The Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking or gardening, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, such as running or aerobic dancing. Additionally, two days of moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activities, such as resistance training, are recommended weekly.

A new CT-scan based risk score facilitates the identification of patients at risk of revision endoscopic sinus surgery due to chronic rhinosinusitis.

This allows for early prediction of disease progression and planning of further treatment.""

Professor Sanna Toppila-Salmi, University of Eastern Finland

The results of the Finnish multi-center study were published in Clinical and Translational Allergy.

Symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, i.e., inflammation of the nasal and sinus cavities, include nasal congestion, mucus secretion and a feeling of pressure. In the polypoid form of the disease, mucosal protrusions, or polyps, block the nasal and sinus cavities. The severe form of the disease is often associated with asthma or NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, N-ERD.

The disease is treated with nasally administered corticosteroids and, in the case of the polypoid form and as the diseases progresses, also with orally administered corticosteroids. If these treatments are insufficient, endoscopic sinus surgery can be considered.

Initial surgery is routinely preceded by a computed tomography scan, a CT scan, which generates CT slice images of the head. In the present study, the researchers used a new risk score that is based on CT slice images to assess the risk of revision surgery. In the new sinonasal radiological score, or the SR score for short, indicators of a high risk of revision surgery include non-detectable anatomy of the nasal turbinates, which is often associated with polypoid mucosal swelling, as well as obstructed drainage of the frontal sinus.

The existing Lund-Mackay scoring of CT scans, or the LM score for short, is based on inflammatory findings in the sinus mucosa, and on the obstruction of the maxillary sinus draining pathway. ""The present study shows that the new SR score, together with the old LM score, is increasingly accurate at predicting relapse and risk of revision surgery in patients who have undergone surgery following a CT scan, regardless of the surgical method used,"" Toppila-Salmi says.

In addition, conditions such as asthma and N-ERD increase the risk of revision surgery. If the disease cannot be managed with conventional medical and surgical treatments, biologics, among other drugs, may be considered as well, following a risk assessment.

The study included 483 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, 85 of whom underwent endoscopic sinus surgery in one year's time following their CT scan. During the follow-up, 28 per cent of these patients underwent revision surgery.

The study was conducted in collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Helsinki, and a number of hospital districts across Finland.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Addressing low lung cancer screening rates through awareness and access","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250403/Addressing-low-lung-cancer-screening-rates-through-awareness-and-access.aspx","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:30:00 GMT","

Lung cancer screening has the potential to catch lung cancer early and save lives-but only if people get screened. Although lung cancer screening is recommended in the U.S. for certain individuals with a history of smoking, only 18% of eligible individuals in the U.S. get screened. One suggested explanation has been that those eligible are resistant to receiving preventive healthcare, but a new study published in JAMA and led by researchers at Mass General Brigham indicates otherwise.

Researchers from Mass General Brigham sought to investigate use of other preventive healthcare services among individuals eligible for lung cancer screening. Using the 2022 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset, the researchers analyzed data from 28,483 individuals aged 50 to 79 who were eligible for lung cancer screening. They found that while only 17-18% of eligible individuals received lung cancer screening, 65% of those eligible received breast and colorectal cancer screening-a nearly 4-fold higher rate.

""Our findings show that many individuals eligible for lung cancer screenings are open to receiving preventive care services. The data suggest that these individuals aren't necessarily resistant to receiving cancer screenings-other factors are likely driving low rates of lung cancer screening,"" said first author Alexandra Potter, a researcher in the Division of Thoracic Surgery at MGH.

These other factors may include difficulty assessing eligibility for lung cancer screening. In contrast to breast and colorectal cancer screening eligibility criteria, which are based on age alone, lung cancer screening eligibility criteria are more complex and include both age and multiple smoking history requirements. Challenges accessing lung cancer screening clinics are also likely an important factor driving low rates.""

Alexandra Potter, Researcher, Division of Thoracic Surgery, Mass General Brigham

The researchers concluded that many individuals eligible for lung cancer screening are already engaged in preventive care. They emphasized that their findings underscore the need for interventions to increase awareness of lung cancer screening and reduce barriers that prevent high-risk individuals from undergoing lung cancer screening.

""As a community, we need to work together to improve lung cancer screening awareness and address the notable barriers that currently make it challenging for high-risk individuals to get lung cancer screening,"" said senior author Chi-Fu Jeffrey Yang, MD, of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.

A new study investigating D-dimer testing in patients who are at higher risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) has been published in the February issue of Academic Emergency Medicine (AEM), the peer-reviewed journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

The study, titled Failure rate of D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism: Ancillary analysis of three European studies, evaluates the safety of ruling out PE based on D-dimer testing among patients who present a high clinical probability of the condition.

Pulmonary embolism is commonly suspected in emergency departments (EDs) and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Accurate diagnosis is critical for ensuring effective management and treatment. For patients who are at a low or moderate risk for PE, a diagnostic strategy based on D-dimer levels is advised due to its high negative predictive value. In patients with a high clinical probability of PE, the high prevalence may reduce the negative predictive value of D-dimer testing and increase the risk of diagnostic failure. Therefore, guidelines recommend that these high-risk patients undergo chest imaging (CI) without D-dimer testing, although very little evidence supports this approach.

The study aims to address the uncertainty surrounding the safety of excluding PE based on D-dimer levels in high-risk patients. Lead author Héloïse Bannelier, MD, and colleagues conducted a post hoc analysis of three European studies (PROPER, MODIGLIANI, and TRYSPEED). Patients included in the analysis had a high clinical probability of PE, according to either the Wells or the revised Geneva score, and had undergone D-dimer testing.

The findings indicated that ruling out PE based on a D-dimer level below the age-adjusted threshold was safe, with no missed cases of pulmonary embolism. However, the study's sample size was not large enough to draw a definitive conclusion on the safety of this diagnostic strategy. The results of this study may have important implications for the clinical management of high-risk PE patients. Further research is necessary to validate these findings in larger populations.

Genevieve Graaf spent years as a mental health social worker specializing in children and youth with complex behavioral health needs. Many had to travel to other states or hundreds of miles from family to access adequate medical care. Drawing on her experience, Dr. Graaf, an assistant professor of social work at The University of Texas at Arlington, has continuously sought ways to improve community-based support programs and ease the burden on families.

She will build on that work with her latest research through UT Arlington's Center for Innovation in Health Informatics (CIHI), which recently received funding from the Raj Nooyi Endowed Research Award Fund. Graaf's project was one of two selected for inaugural seed grants from the award.

The other project, led by Salman Sohrabi, an assistant professor of bioengineering at UTA, focuses on healthy aging.

The seed grants were made possible by a $5 million gift from Raj Nooyi ('78 MS, Industrial Engineering) and his wife, Indra, to position UTA at the forefront of the growing health informatics field.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Raj Nooyi for his generous support. His funding for a seed grant initiative was instrumental in encouraging our researchers to refine their ideas and submit impactful proposals to national funding agencies and foundations, with a special focus on cancer, aging and pediatrics.""

Marion Ball, executive director for CIHI and the Raj and Indra Nooyi Endowed Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering

Graaf's project will examine four distinct populations of children-those with physical disabilities, intellectual or developmental disabilities, complex behavioral health needs and complex medical needs. Over an eight-year period, the study will assess and compare child and family characteristics; health care and support service needs; and the social, community and educational challenges each group faces.

""Our study will aid state policymakers and administrators in monitoring performance, evaluating programs and designing more responsive community-support initiatives for these children and their families,"" Graaf said.

Dr. Sohrabi will lead a study on healthy aging focusing ""not merely on prolonging life, but on enhancing its quality.""

""I am passionate about translating discoveries in aging biology into meaningful interventions that improve health and quality of life,"" Sohrabi said. ""My work focuses on extending reproductive longevity, preventing neurodegeneration in conditions such as Alzheimer's, and preserving muscle function with age. By targeting the underlying mechanisms of age-related decline, I aim to promote healthier aging.""

To uncover the molecular basis of healthy aging, Sohrabi said researchers must continuously and quantitatively study the progressive decline of various biological functions over time. The most effective way to do this is through short-lived, millimeter-sized model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)-a tiny transparent worm often used in research to study genetics, aging and disease-that allow real-time monitoring of age-related changes over just a few weeks.

""Our research aims to uncover the mechanisms that either compromise health or extend the health span by developing a novel approach to quantifying quality of life independently of lifespan,"" Sohrabi said.

Mosquitoes have been transmitting the West Nile virus to humans in the United States for over 25 years, but we still don't know precisely how the virus cycles through these pests and the other animals they bite.

A federally funded project aims to help pin down the process by using mathematical models to analyze how factors like temperature, light pollution, and bird and mosquito abundance affect West Nile virus transmission. The ultimate goal is to advise health departments of the best time of year to kill the bugs.

I'm hopeful that what we will uncover in this grant will help us to better understand what's driving West Nile virus transmission, and seasonal cycles of transmission, so we can determine when and where to direct control interventions to limit transmission and keep people healthy.""

Megan Meuti, principal investigator (PI) on the grant and associate professor of entomology at The Ohio State University

The project, based on Ohio data but structured to develop models adaptable to other U.S. regions, is funded by a $3 million grant from the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease program through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common insect-borne virus in the U.S. Most infected people have minimal or mild flu-like symptoms, but about 1% can become seriously ill – especially those over 60 or people with chronic health problems – if the virus enters the brain.

Previous research gives us a general idea of how and when viral transmission occurs: As days get shorter, female mosquitoes from the Culex genus, known carriers of WNV, prepare for the winter dormancy period called diapause by fattening up on nectar from flowers – though they may take a viral infection they caught from birds with them into their winter downtime. After mosquitoes emerge from diapause in warmer months, more of them may become infected by taking blood meals from infected birds, and then transmit the virus when they feed on people, horses and other mammals.

Among the questions asked by Meuti's team: How does viral transmission re-initiate each spring, and how does the virus's presence persist in the environment during fall and winter?

The dormancy period appears to be delayed – or even prevented – by artificial light at night and heat in urban areas, according to previous studies in Meuti's lab in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences. That disruption may mean the mosquitoes in cities are biting humans and animals longer into the fall, and also suggests urban and rural transmission patterns may differ.

""We know humans tend to get infected in the late summer and early fall, and other studies have shown that birds are infected before then, but we don't really know where West Nile virus is going in the winter,"" Meuti said.

The grant team started collecting mosquitoes and birds last fall and will continuously collect specimens for three years. Urban collection sites are located in Franklin and Lucas counties, and rural sites are in Union and Ottawa counties.

Bird trapping focuses on nine species known to be bitten by Culex mosquitoes: American robins, mourning doves, Northern cardinals, house sparrows, common grackles, European starlings, gray catbirds, Swainson's thrushes and red-winged blackbirds. Researchers tag and release captured birds after collecting blood samples that will show their infection status – never infected, active WNV infection, or antibodies indicating they've been infected and recovered.

During the winter, researchers are collecting mosquitoes spending diapause in culverts to see if they're already infected with the virus. Analysis of the blood contents in mosquitoes' bellies will tell researchers what animals they've been biting – birds, horses or humans. Researchers will also sequence the RNA of the virus detected in mosquitoes.

The data and modeling will enable the team to test their hypotheses about how the transmission process plays out in rural and urban settings. In general, researchers predict mosquitoes are more likely to be infected with WNV over the winter in urban areas than in rural areas, suggesting that in rural areas, migratory birds are infecting mosquitoes, or the virus is spilling over from urban settings – or both.

""If RNA sequences are very similar from fall to spring, that would suggest the virus is staying local and, most likely, the way it's staying local would be in the overwintering mosquitoes. But if we see differences in sequences from fall to spring, that would be more suggestive that it is a new WNV strain or a slightly different strain coming from migratory birds,"" Meuti said.

""Once we have the models in place, we can predict what West Nile virus transmission might look like in a given year. And in partnership with local health departments and mosquito control districts, our ultimate goal is to understand what's driving West Nile virus transmission and use this information to better predict when and where we can direct specific interventions.""

Co-PIs on the grant are Laura Pomeroy, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Ohio State, who is building the mathematical models; Jaqueline Nolting, assistant professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State, who is analyzing biological samples from captured birds; and Brendan Shirkey, research coordinator for the Winous Point Marsh Conservancy, who is overseeing collection of birds and mosquitoes. Andrew Bowman, professor of veterinary preventive medicine, serves as senior personnel, designing experiments and assisting with data analysis.

Ovarian cancer, a leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies, has a poor prognosis and low 5-year survival rate, necessitating new therapeutic strategies. CDK4/6 inhibitors show promise but their efficacy varies, highlighting the need for biomarkers. This study explores TRIM4's role in ovarian cancer's response to CDK4/6 inhibitors, revealing that TRIM4, an E3 ligase, influences sensitivity by modulating hnRNPDL and CDKN2C levels.

The research established patient-derived ovarian cancer organoid models to assess TQB3616, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, efficacy. RNA sequencing and analyses identified TRIM4 as a key gene correlating with drug response. TRIM4 expression was higher in organoids resistant to TQB3616, and this pattern was confirmed in cell lines and clinical samples. The study also found an inverse relationship between TRIM4 and CDK4/6 expression levels.
Mechanistically, TRIM4 interacts with hnRNPDL, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction reduces hnRNPDL levels, which in turn affects CDKN2C expression. hnRNPDL regulates CDKN2C mRNA splicing, and its degradation leads to increased CDKN2C levels, potentially reducing the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors. The study used various techniques, including immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down assays, and RNA analyses, to confirm the interaction between TRIM4 and hnRNPDL and its impact on CDKN2C expression.
The researchers further demonstrated that reducing TRIM4 expression enhances ovarian cancer cell sensitivity to TQB3616, both in vitro and in vivo. This was shown through cell cycle analyses, apoptosis assays, and tumor growth studies in mice. The combination of TRIM4 siRNA and CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment significantly reduced tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach.
In summary, the study provides insights into TRIM4's role in ovarian cancer's response to CDK4/6 inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. By elucidating the TRIM4-hnRNPDL-CDKN2C regulatory axis, the research offers a foundation for developing more effective treatment strategies for ovarian cancer patients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Wealth inequality drives higher US mortality compared to Europe","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250403/Wealth-inequality-drives-higher-US-mortality-compared-to-Europe.aspx","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 05:58:00 GMT","

Comparing wealth and survival rates in the U.S. with those in Europe, researchers found that over a 10-year period, Americans across all wealth levels were more likely to die than their European counterparts.

The findings were detailed in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine by a team led by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health.

The analysis compared data from more than 73,000 adults in the U.S. and different regions of Europe who were age 50 to 85 in 2010 to determine how wealth affects a person's chances of dying. The results revealed that people with more wealth tend to live longer than those with less wealth, especially in the U.S., where the gap between the rich and poor is much larger than in Europe.

Comparison data also showed that at every wealth level in the U.S., mortality rates were higher than those in the parts of Europe the researchers studied. The nation's wealthiest Americans have shorter lifespans on average than the wealthiest Europeans; in some cases, the wealthiest Americans have survival rates on par with the poorest Europeans in western parts of Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.

U.S. life expectancy has been declining in recent years, said study author Irene Papanicolas, a professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown. The study provides a more detailed picture of life expectancy across demographics in the U.S. compared to different parts of Europe, she said.

""The findings are a stark reminder that even the wealthiest Americans are not shielded from the systemic issues in the U.S. contributing to lower life expectancy, such as economic inequality or risk factors like stress, diet or environmental hazards,"" said Papanicolas, who directs the School of Public Health's Center for Health System Sustainability.

If we want to improve health in the U.S., we need to better understand the underlying factors that contribute to these differences - particularly amongst similar socioeconomic groups - and why they translate to different health outcomes across nations.""

Irene Papanicolas, Professor, Brown University

According to the study, individuals in the wealthiest quartile had a death rate that is 40% lower than for individuals in the poorest quartile. Individuals in Continental Europe died at rates approximately 40% lower than participants in the U.S. throughout the study period. Participants from Southern Europe had estimated death rates around 30% lower than U.S. participants over the study period, while participants from Eastern Europe have estimated death rates 13% to 20% lower.

""We found that where you stand in your country's wealth distribution matters for your longevity, and where you stand in your country compared to where others stand in theirs matters, too"" said study author Sara Machado, a research scientist at Brown's Center for Health System Sustainability. ""Fixing health outcomes is not just a challenge for the most vulnerable - even those in the top quartile of wealth are affected.""

The study, which analyzed data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study and Europe's Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement, underscores how weaker social safety nets and structural disparities in the U.S. may contribute to poorer survival rates across all wealth groups. These shortcomings disproportionately affect the poorest residents but ultimately leave even the wealthiest Americans more vulnerable than their European counterparts, the researchers argued.

The study noted how systemic cultural and behavioral factors, such as diet, smoking and social mobility, may also play a role. For example, smoking rates and living in rural areas - both linked to poorer health - were more common in the U.S.

The researchers also highlighted a ""survivor effect"" in the U.S., where poorer individuals with worse health outcomes were more likely to die earlier, leaving behind a population that is healthier and wealthier as age groups progress. This creates the illusion that wealth inequality decreases over time, when in reality it's partly due to the early deaths of the poorest Americans.

""Our previous work has shown that while wealth inequality narrows after 65 across the U.S. and Europe, in the U.S. it narrows because the poorest Americans die sooner and in greater proportion,"" Papanicolas said.

The researchers said the findings provide a sobering view of U.S. health outcomes and a call to action for policymakers to address a growing wealth-mortality gap with policies that have a broader focus than the health system's shortcomings.

""If you look at other countries, there are better outcomes, and that means we can learn from them and improve,"" Machado said. ""It's not necessarily about spending more - it's about addressing the factors we're overlooking, which could deliver far greater benefits than we realize.""

Researchers at The University of Queensland have found improving the function of the gut microbiome may delay the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D). 

Professor Emma Hamilton-Williams, from the Frazer Institute said 21 individuals with T1D were given an oral biotherapy containing short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are metabolites usually produced by gut bacteria during the fermentation of dietary fibre. 

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune illness, and we know there is something different about the gut microbiome and gut barrier function that we think changes the immune response in individuals with the disease.

We've learned that it is possible to change the microbiome in individuals with T1D, and when we have done that, we have seen changes in the gut barrier function.

Then when we further tested that microbiome by transferring it into mice, it delayed the onset of diabetes.""

Professor Emma Hamilton-Williams, Frazer Institute

Short chain fatty acids are one of the cornerstone beneficial functions of the gut's community of microorganisms, which play essential roles in digestion, immunity and overall health. 

""There have been other approaches to restoring short chain fatty acids, like giving probiotic bacteria or capsules, but they haven't really worked,"" Professor Hamilton-Williams said.

""This has been the first time in T1D studies where researchers have managed to increase short chain fatty acids in individuals."" 

Co-senior author Dr. Eliana Mariño, from Monash University, said by analysing the unique profiles of small molecules or metabolites in individuals with T1D, the study uncovered new ways to measure and potentially manipulate the pathways that influence immune function. 

""These findings suggest microbiome interventions could stop Type 1 Diabetes in its tracks to potentially delay, or even prevent T1D, giving patients a chance to stay healthier for longer and increase their lifespan,"" Dr Eliana Mariño said.

""The next step is to conduct a trial involving individuals right at the onset of type 1 diabetes, followed by those who have not received a diagnosis but are at high risk."" 

The research was funded by Breakthrough T1D (formally JDRF Australia), Children's Hospital Foundation, the National Health and Medical Research Council, and Monash University.

The work was carried out in collaboration with researchers from Monash University, University of Sydney, Université libre de Bruxelles, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and the Translational Research Institute. 

The study was published in Nature Communications.

A team of scientists from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has identified a promising new drug target for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a deadly blood cancer with a five-year survival rate of just 30%, according to the National Cancer Institute. Their study, published in Cell Stem Cell  in February, highlights the crucial role of a protein called paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) in the progression of AML.

An aggressive blood cancer, AML originates in the bone marrow and is known to disrupt the normal production of blood cells. Treatment is difficult because patients may not respond to chemotherapy or experience a relapse of the disease.

AML is highly diverse, with more than 70 known driver mutations. Even targeted therapies like IDH inhibitors can only treat a small subset of AML patients. Given this diversity, we need a uniform, one-for-all drug target to effectively treat AML.""

Mingjiang Xu, PhD, professor of molecular medicine at the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine and CTRC Council Distinguished Chair in Oncology at UT Health San Antonio's Mays Cancer Center

Xu is one of the study's primary investigators. Co-primary investigators include Feng-Chun Yang, MD, PhD, a tenured professor in the Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, A.B. Alexander Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research, Mays Cancer Center and Jianlong Wang, PhD, Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

In mouse models, depleting PSPC1 significantly delayed AML progression and improved survival rates. Removing PSPC1 inhibited cancer cell growth without affecting normal blood cell formation. Xu suggests that targeting PSPC1 could provide a new treatment for AML.

PSPC1 has been found in 21 different cancer cell lines, primarily in solid tumors, playing a role in worsening or advancing the disease more quickly. This suggests that therapies targeting PSPC1 could have broader applications in oncology, beyond just AML. Researchers are now investigating methods to selectively inhibit PSPC1 in cancer cells while preserving its function in normal cells, potentially offering a targeted treatment with fewer side effects.

Xu states the next step is to test potential drugs that could inhibit PSPC1, significantly impacting not only AML, but also solid tumors like lung and prostate cancer by preventing metastasis, offering new hope for cancer patients.

USWNT's Jaedyn Shaw discusses dealing with expectations following her move to North Carolina Courage from San Diego Wave. (1:58)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said the United States and the United Kingdom are poised to be named as hosts of the Women's World Cup in 2031 and 2035, respectively.

Infantino told the UEFA Congress in Belgrade on Thursday that the joint bid from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was the only ""valid bid"" of interest for the 2035 tournament after the deadline passed, with the United States also putting forward the only bid for the 2031 edition.

""As part of the bidding process, we received one bid for '31 and one bid, valid bid, I should add for '35,"" he said.

""The '31 bid is from the United States of America and potentially some other Concacaf members together and the '36 bid is from Europe from the Home Nations so the path is there for the Women's World Cup to be taking place in '31 and '35 in some great countries and some great nations to boost even more the women's football movement.""

The UK has never hosted a Women's World Cup. England hosted the Women's Euros in 2022, winning the tournament on home soil. The men's team last hosted the World Cup in 1966. The 2035 bid could pave the way for the men's team to host a subsequent edition.

The UK's 2035 project was quickly supported by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in March when FIFA said it was formally seeking bids from member federations. FIFA excluded Europe from the 2031 contest, clearing the way for a long-expected U.S. win.

The Spanish Federation said last week they hoped to bid, possibly in conjunction with Portugal and Morocco -- the trio are hosting the men's 2030 World Cup. However, Infantino stated that there was only one ""valid bid"" for the 2035 edition, ruling out the possibility of the reigning world champions hosting the tournament.

""We are excited about the opportunity to co-host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup and, in collaboration with our @Concacaf partners, are committed to delivering a tournament that leaves a lasting legacy - one that elevates women's soccer across the world and inspires future generations of players and fans,"" U.S. Soccer said in a statement on Thursday.

""As FIFA finalizes the number of participating teams in the tournament, we will solidify our partnership structure with fellow Concacaf nations. We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling our full vision for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup in the near future.""

The United States were the only bid for the 2031 edition, having withdrawn plans to host the 2027 edition which Brazil will host. Likely in combination with several other Concacaf nations, likely Mexico, the U.S. will host their third edition after hosting the 1999 and 2003 tournaments.

The four-time winners will be the first country to host the tournament three times, with China having hosted the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 and again in 2007.

""We are honoured to be the sole bidder for the Women's World Cup 2035. Hosting the first FIFA World Cup since 1966 with our home nations partners will be very special. The hard work starts now, to put together the best possible bid by the end of the year,"" England FA CEO Mark Bullingham said in a statement.

Following a successful expansion of the tournament at Australia and New Zealand in 2023, the 2027 tournament will again feature 32 nations. The competition is set to expand to 48 teams for the 2031 World Cup.

Formal bids for 2035 must be submitted this winter, with a vote taking place next year to confirm hosts for 2031 and 2035.

The two sides meet for the first time after the Olympic final.

The United States Women's National Team is back in action after opening the year with an underwhelming second-place finish at the SheBelieves Cup, albeit with a roster that was missing several key performers. Next on the schedule awaits what has been dubbed “Olympic Gold Medal Rematches,” with two friendlies against Brazil. The South American power has maintained consistent dominance and put in strong showings at global competitions, continuing to keep pace with a rising tide. The first match is set for SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, a 70,240-seat venue with a recently-installed “natural grass test system”; San Jose, California's PayPal Park, an 18,000-seat soccer-specific stadium with a hybrid SISGrass surface, will host the latter fixture. 

These are the 42nd and 43rd all-time meetings between the two nations, with the USWNT holding a 33-3-5 advantage and triumphing most recently in the Olympic final. Ranked eighth internationally by FIFA, Brazil has been on an undefeated friendly run since claiming the silver medal with a draw and a win against Colombia (1-1 and 3-1) and two road warrior victories over Australia (3-1 and 2-1). Seleção (The National Squad) reigns as the clear dominant program in South America with eight out of nine Copa América titles and appears to be the odds-on favorite to claim another trophy this summer.

Appointed in September of 2023, Arthur Elias took over for Pia Sundhage and hit the ground running, feeling that his team can “lift their heads” after claiming the silver medal at the Olympics. The 43-year-old from São Paulo was a well-regarded domestic manager who won a bevy of titles at the club level with Corinthians, including four Copa Libertadores. He expressed positivity at the first training camp of the year, believing that the group was able to “further develop [their] game model” without “any type of incident,” instead focusing on “improvement in ideas and execution with possession of the ball, attacking behavior, and transitions.”

Elias named a 23-player roster for the pair of friendlies, a young group that demonstrates the commitment to “renewal” for the current World Cup cycle. The domestic Campeonato Brasileiro is home to nine of the call-ups, while five compete in the National Women's Soccer League and seven are on the books of European clubs. Notable absences include Rafaelle, Ary Borges, Ana Vitória, Vitória Yaya, and Priscila.

***

GOALKEEPERS (3): Lorena (Kansas City Current), Natascha (Palmeiras), Camila (Cruzeiro)

DEFENDERS (8): Tarciane (Lyon), Isa Haas (Cruzeiro), Kaká (São Paulo), Lauren (Atlético de Madrid), Bruninha (Gotham), Antônia (Real Madrid), Yasmim (Real Madrid), Fê Palermo (Palmeiras)

MIDFIELDERS (4): Duda Sampaio (Corinthians), Angelina (Orlando Pride), Laís Estevam (Palmeiras), Mariza (Corinthians)

FORWARDS (8): Adriana (Al-Qadsiah), Gio (Atlético de Madrid), Jheniffer (Tigres), Amanda Gutierres (Palmeiras), Kerolin (Manchester City), Gabi Portilho (Gotham), Ludmila (Chicago Stars), Luany (Atlético de Madrid)

***

With intense study and preparation, Elias juggles tactics depending on the opponent but seems to prefer the 3-5-2 or 3-4-2-1 formations, pressing high against teams that play out of the back. Total Football Analysis describes the defensive set-up as “aggressive,” forcing the game to the sides and limiting passing options in order to create turnovers and quickly transition into the counter. However, Brazil is methodical during the build-up phase, whether surging through the lines or attempting more direct medium-range balls to the wing.

Over the past few months, Elias rotated the goalkeeper position between two options. Lorena has been in the number-one role for several years and recently joined the Kansas City Current, using her imposing six-foot size to cover the frame and also corral crosses with ease. She is quick to come off of her line and displays decent enough footwork to adjust and regain an angle, comfortable when facing down the opponent on short- and long-range opportunities. Former Switzerland youth international Natascha Honegger has been steadily receiving more matches, providing another tall option in net but more of a shot-stopper presence with deliberate movement. The Palmeiras 27-year-old was named the Best Goalkeeper due to “shining” during the triumphant 2024 Campeonato Paulista campaign, providing “decisive saves, especially during the final stages” and “guaranteed [her] team safety in moments of the greatest pressure.”

Isa Haas is the new addition to the lineup, making her senior debut after the Olympics and picking up four friendly starts by using her “maturity and strength to neutralize” attackers. The 24-year-old Cruzeiro centre-back employs a physical style that set the tone against Australia while also displaying leadership and “a skilled ball release” that leads to line-clearing balls over the top. After a single season with the Houston Dash, Tarciane was the subject of one of the largest transfer fees in NWSL, bringing “one of the best young players in the world” to Lyon. Standing at six-feet tall, she has a rangy athleticism with a long stride to chase down opponents, obvious aerial prowess, long distribution, and a willingness to send a message with some instigation. At the young age of 22, Lauren is already well traveled with stops at São Paulo, Centro Olímpico, Madrid CFF, the Kansas City Current, and now Atlético Madrid, emerging as one of the top passers in Liga F. Her athleticism enables her to chase down pacey wingers on the outside, but her the size and strength allow her to engage with physical forwards and win headers in both boxes. There is also the potential for São Paulo's Kaká to feature following an “eye-catching campaign” that saw her lead the Tricolor to a second-place finish in the domestic league and win the ensuing Supercopa do Brasil title. Following “a period of adaptation,” her “firm and confident performances” along with a nose for the goal have the Brasiliense pushing for a spot in the rotation amidst significant program turnover. 

After a decorated tenure with Corinthians, Yasmim made the jump to Real Madrid and has jumped into the starting lineup, registering solid per-90 statistics in the attacking and build-up phases. She can be quite productive in the final third and has a fantastic free kick, capable of beating goalkeepers from distance with a hard, bending shot. On the other side of the formation, Ludmila had an encouraging first few months in the NWSL with three goals in seven appearances, carrying over her scoring prowess from Atlético Madrid. The 30-year-old Chicago Stars wide player is devastating off of the dribble and constantly looks to run directly at opponents but also employs a tireless effort. The experienced Adriana of Al Qadsiah should also factor into proceedings following three finishes for Brazil in 2024, bringing speed on the outside and the ability to act as an additional forward in the final third. Known as Maga (the Wizard), her “great technical ability and work rate” endue her with the ability to “set the tone for pressure and defensive shape,” providing accurate tackles and a good rate of success in aerial duels. 

With “refined passing and creativity,” Duda Sampaio is one of “the best midfielders in Brazil” with a vast array of accolades born from her dominant work in the build-up, replete with pressure avoidance and shutdown of the opponents. The 23-year-old at Corinthians prevents her team from getting trapped in the defensive half and “is constantly seen moving up the field” into advanced areas, serving as a progressor and facilitator. New Jersey-born Angelina recently entered her fifth season in the NWSL, having spent time with OL Reign and the Orlando Pride, with 24 combined appearances and two goals in 2024. Total Football Analysis praises her as a versatile option with “outstanding interception abilities and physical strength” while also providing an element of “influential playmaking” that gives her a balanced profile. Manchester City's Kerolin is a dynamic “difference maker” who boasts “searing pace and an eye for goal,” displaying “clever movements in the box, quality on the ball, and [the] ability to go on either foot.” She can deploy in a variety of positions but does her best work when receiving the ball in transition and charging into the final third, jockeying with defenders and placing her shots into the corner. For another offensive option, Lais Estevam of Palmeiras is a regular source of production at the club level with an aggressive style and a willingness to fight for her chances in the box. In addition to setting up teammates, her late runs into the box and streak of opportunism or luck make her an intriguing figure who can open up crowded areas.

Former United States youth international Giovana “Gio” Queiroz has struggled to find her spot at the professional level due to “injuries and a lack of continuity,” having passed through Barcelona and Arsenal before landing at Atlético Madrid and “getting her confidence back.” She likes to “press high, get forward quickly, and go one-on-one,” displaying “change of pace and brilliant ball-carrying abilities that are particularly dangerous weapons on counterattacks” with the abilities to create and score. After several decorated seasons at Corinthians, Gabi Portilho moved to NJ/NY Gotham FC and began her NWSL tenure with a fantastic volleyed finish from the top of the box. The “star of the Olympic Football Tournament” looks to drive inside with weaving dribbling runs and also has the innate sense of movement in the box to get onto the end of crosses. The five-foot-nine Amanda Gutierres contributed nearly a goal per game over the past two years with a dizzying array of conversions that utilize her combination of speed, strength, and comfort with the ball at her feet. The 24-year-old Palmeiras striker scored two goals in the 3-1 victory over Australia and could become one of the leaders during the current World Cup cycle, filling the role of a poacher at the top of the formation.

Despite the recent gold medal, the USWNT remains in a transitional phase and will benefit from continuing to compete against quality opposition. Brazil looks to maintain standing as the top dog in CONMEBOL and ideally close the gap with the world's top programs, continuing to hunt for a first global title. Over the course of the two friendlies, both managers will likely shuffle the deck with mass substitutions and test out different tactical tweaks, which could lead to unpredictable results.

The first match is scheduled for Saturday, April 5th at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, 2:00 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TNT, truTV, Telemundo, Universo, Max, Peacock, and FUBO TV (free trial).

The second match is scheduled for Tuesday, April 8th at 10:30 p.m. Eastern, 7:30 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TBS, truTV, Universo, Max, Peacock, and FUBO TV (free trial).

Despite losing two games in the Concacaf Nations League last month, the U.S. men's national team remained in 16th place in the latest FIFA men's rankings, which was released on Thursday morning.

Despite losing two games in the Concacaf Nations League last month, the U.S. men's national team remained in 16th place in the latest FIFA men's rankings, which was released on Thursday morning.

The host Americans lost to Panama in the semifinals, 1-0, and then to Canada in the third-place match, 2-1.

Argentina remained on top thanks to impressive wins away to Uruguay (1-0) and at home to Brazil (4-1), but the Albiceleste has new company, as Spain moved up to second place, past France, which slipped to third place after a loss to Croatia. England was fourth and Brazil.

The Netherlands moved up a spot to sixth place, overtaking Portugal, which dropped to seventh. Belgium stayed in eighth, followed Italy (ninth) and Germany (10th).

Croatia moved up two places to 11th, as did Morocco to 12th. CNL champions Mexico climbed two spots to 17th, while runners-up Panama jumped three spots to 33rd place.

Norway (38th, up 5), Czechia (39th, up 3) and Côte d'Ivoire (41st, up 5) have made notable headway, while positive results for Paraguay (48th, up 5) and Tunisia (49th, up 3) have seen them return to the top 50 following a recent hiatus.

Slovenia (51st, up 4), Bosnia and Herzegovina (70th, up 4) and Gabon (79th, up 5) are also amongst the risers, while Kyrgyz Republic (103rd, up 4), Vietnam (109th, up 5), Zimbabwe (116th, up 5), Sierra Leone (124th, up 5), the Philippines (146th, up 4) and Eswatini (155th, up 4) have all made similar leaps. But it is Myanmar (162nd, up 7) who are the biggest climbers in terms of rank.

Last but not least, Canada (30th, up 1) and Kosovo (97th, up 2) each find themselves in their highest-ever position in this, the April 2025 ranking.

Jhonder Cádiz acknowledged that the team is going through a difficult time emotionally after FIFA's decision to exclude them from the Club World Cup, which has affected their recent performance.

""Mentally, the issue of the Club World Cup has affected us a lot, it was a big shock, we did not expect it,"" commented the forward.

The team led by Eduardo Berizzo started the Clausura 2025 with good performance, but recently suffered three consecutive losses against Santos, Necaxa and Pumas, which prevented them from staying at the top of the table.

""We have not been mentally 100%, for whatever reason,"" admitted Cádiz.

Regarding the possibility of another team taking the place of León in the Club World Cup, the forward expressed his dissatisfaction. ""It seems kind of ugly not to have earned it in the competition and now want to invent a match or an excuse to justify it,"" he affirmed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Bastoni: ‘Millimetre offside makes the difference' and frustrated with Club World Cup","https://football-italia.net/bastoni-millimetre-offside-make-the-difference/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:57:57 GMT","

Alessandro Bastoni explains why a millimetre offside ‘makes the difference,' the sacrifices made by players, his experience being bullied by teammates, and his irritation with the Club World Cup format.

The centre-back sat down with Alessandro Catellan for the Supernova podcast and you can read the rest of his comments here.

Much is said about the changes to modern football, with an increasingly packed fixture list, changing formats in major tournaments and the introduction of VAR.

Unusually, Bastoni stands against the tide of complaints about the tiny margins provided by Semi-Automatic Offside Technology (SAOT), which has only now been introduced to the Premier League after two years in Serie A.

“I like the way offside works now and it is the only thing I absolutely would not change,” said Bastoni.

“If a striker gets to the ball a centimetre before me, that makes the difference. If you are offside, then you are offside. In our sport, a hundredth of a second can change a game. If you are a millimetre in front of me, then it is not a fair goal.

“Now everyone is so well-drilled, they study their opponents carefully and prepare tactically, so every millimetre makes the difference.”

When it comes to the ever-expanding fixture list, the feelings are mixed for the Inter and Italy defender.

“People think sacrifice is just getting up at 6am to work on a building site, but players make other types of sacrifices. Nobody can give us back the time that we lost. We play so often that we're always away from our families and you can never get that back. My daughter will be three years old soon, I see her growing up via the videos that my wife sends me.”

Inter are in the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, the Coppa Italia semi-final with Milan, and still at the top of Serie A.

This is the first season since the Champions League shifted to the new format playing against eight different opponents in the opening phase, with all the results going into a single league table.

“At the start, I would've said I didn't like this format, but now I do. Every game is important, we've seen big clubs fail to finish in the top eight and have to go through the play-offs,” replied Bastoni.

“It's also good to face strong opponents from the very start, it is really motivating. The negative side of that is there are extra games in an already packed calendar. In the NBA, they play what feels like 100,000 games, but they also stop from June to October. We are playing in the Club World Cup until mid-July and two weeks later go into pre-season training.”

The Club World Cup is also a new, expanded format, and one that seems to be appreciated far more for its business opportunities than the sporting merit or entertainment factor.

“It has never been done before, so we'll see how it goes, but it's in June, we'll be exhausted after a long season, it will be played at midday in New York in July to fit the European television schedules, so sure, great,” he laughed bitterly.

At least there are some areas where Bastoni feels that football has improved, revealing some of the experiences he had in the Atalanta youth academy.

“I don't see the same level of bullying, which was really unjust and unseemly. At Atalanta, I dealt with Stendardo, Masiello and Zukanovic, people who went a bit overboard. I nutmegged one of them in training once and I practically had to leave to save my life!

“In all seriousness, it's not a good attitude to have. If a youth team player nutmegs me, I give him credit for that. I don't need to beat him up over it. That's not fair.”

Inter Milan are confident that they can sign Marseille winger Luis Henrique ahead of Bayern Munich.

This according to Sky Sport Italia transfer market expert Gianluca Di Marzio. He reports on his homepage that the Nerazzurri are hoping to seal a deal for the Brazilian by the start of May.

Inter Milan are eyeing up a move for Marseille winger Luis Henrique.

However, the Nerazzurri are not the only club who consider the 23-year-old a target.

Bayern Munich in particular are keen to sign Henrique from Marseille.

Therefore, Inter are feeling the pressure to move fast to sign the Brazilian.

According to Di Marzio, Inter Milan have already been in talks to sign Luis Henrique for around three weeks.

The Sky transfer expert reports that the Nerazzurri have been contacting Marseille regularly regarding the Brazilian.

That has given Inter confidence that they are in the driver's seat to sign Henrique.

According to Di Marzio, Inter's aim is to wrap up a deal by the start of May or so. That would mean that Inter can register the 23-year-old as part of their squad for the upcoming Club World Cup.

Inter are aiming to pay a fee of around €25 million for Henrique, reports Di Marzio.

However, Marseille want a figure closer to €30-35 million.

However, Inter are confident that their positive rapport with Marseille can make the negotiations go along smoothly.

Particularly if they offer a player going the other way, or inch closer to Marseille's valuation with add-ons.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Real Madrid, the most successful club in the history of European football, will be present at the first new FIFA Club World Cup. The other Spanish place (as there are only two teams per country) was contested between Atlético Madrid and Barcelona. Both finished last year's Champions League in the quarter-finals, but Atlético, with a six-point lead in the UEFA rankings, are the second Spanish team to qualify for the tournament.

We have prepared a full analysis of Real Madrid's role in the Club World Cup, with details of their schedule, squad, track record in the competition and key players who could lead Los Merengues to another international triumph. We also analyse the top favourites and their chances of victory, along with a detailed look at Real Madrid's group stage opponents. Plus, find out where to watch the 63 matches scheduled for the competition on TV.

The tournament kicks off on June 14th, 2025, with the final scheduled for July 13th, 2025, at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Real Madrid's opponents in the group stage

Real Madrid have been drawn in Group H alongside Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg.

Al Hilal (Saudi Arabia): The most successful team in Asia and reigning champions of the Saudi Arabian League. They have outstanding players such as Bono, Cancelo, Milinkovic-Savic and Mitrovic. They were Real Madrid's opponents in a previous Club World Cup final. They are the former team of Neymar Jr.

Pachuca (Mexico): Current CONCACAF Champions League 2024 champions. One of the most financially powerful teams in Mexico and boasts players such as former Sevilla player Idrissi, veteran Salomon Rondon and Argentinian Gustavo Cabral, formerly of Celta Vigo.

Red Bull Salzburg (Austria): Although they were not Austrian champions last season, they are known for their project to develop young talent. They have recently sold key players such as Pavlovic and Sucic, and brought in Clark from Liverpool. The Israeli Gloukh, striker Konaté and midfielder Kjaergard stand out in attack.

Real Madrid's fixture list for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup group stage

Real Madrid vs. Al Hilal

Date: Wednesday, 18 June 2025

Time: 20:00 (GMT)

Stadium: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami

Real Madrid vs. Pachuca

Date: Sunday, 22 June 2025

Time: 20:00

Stadium: Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte

Red Bull Salzburg vs. Real Madrid

Date: Friday, 27 June 2025

Time: 02:00

Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia

Real Madrid's possible matches in the knockout phase of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025

There is a strong likelihood that Real Madrid will advance through the group stage and finish in the top two of Group H. If so, the dates for the knockout phase of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be as follows

If so, the dates and fixtures for Real Madrid's round of 16 at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup would be as follows (depending on qualification):

Monday, June 30th

1st G vs. 2nd H, 19:00, Camping World Stadium, Orlando

Tuesday, July 1st

1stH vs. 2ndG, 13:00, Hard Rock Stadium, Miami

In other words, if Real Madrid finish the group stage first, they would play the second-placed team in Group G. If they finish second, they would play the first-placed team (also from Group G). A group made up of Manchester City, Wydad Casablanca, Al-Ain and Juventus.

Once the round of 16 is over, the quarter-final and semi-final match-ups can be seen in this table designed by FIFA.

 

As FIFA president Gianni Infantino has already said, ""we already have the 63 matches that every football fan should make a note of in their diary, whether they live in the United States, travel from their countries to the different venues to follow their team or decide to follow the tournament from home via DAZN and FIFA+"".

Thus, all matches of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will be available for free on DAZN and FIFA+.

This is the possible Real Madrid squad for the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025. It should be noted that all players who have been called up to the first team at some point this season are mentioned.

Goalkeepers

Thibaut Courtois, Andrii Lunin, Fran González and Sergio Mestre.

Defenders

Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, David Alaba, Lucas Vázquez, Jesús Vallejo, Fran García, Antonio Rüdiger, Ferland Mendy, Youssef Lekhedim, Jacobo Ramón, Raúl Asencio, David Jiménez, Lorenzo Aguado, Diego Aguado and Mario Rivas.

Midfielders

Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga, Federico Valverde, Luka Modric, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Arda Güler, Dani Ceballos, Brahim Díaz, Chema Andrés and Hugo de Llanos.

Strikers

Vinícius Júnior, Kylian Mbappé, Rodrygo, Endrick, Gonzalo García, Daniel Yáñez, Víctor Muñoz and Pol Fortuny.

Players to watch

Vinícius Júnior: With his outstanding career at Real Madrid, Vinícius Júnior remains one of the most exciting players in world football. The Brazilian has cemented his place as a key player in the Merengues' forward line, contributing goals and assists in the 2024/25 season, and demonstrating his ability to make the difference in key matches. Throughout his seven years at Real Madrid, he has been instrumental in keeping the team in the fight for titles and, evidently, lifting them: at 24, he has won fourteen titles, including two Champions League titles and three league titles.

Kylian Mbappé: After several years of chasing him, Real Madrid managed, in the 2024 summer transfer window, to secure the services of one of the most sought-after and followed players in the world of football. Kylian Mbappé landed better than ever, as in his first official match in the white shirt he scored against Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup. After a difficult first few months and, as the press and the Madrid faithful were saying, a period of adaptation, the Frenchman managed to settle with the team and by mid-March he had scored 29 goals in 46 games. Not bad for his first season in one of, if not the most, demanding clubs in Europe.

Jude Bellingham: The Englishman's first season at Real Madrid was one of the top scorers of the 2023/24 season. It is true that his goalscoring figures have suffered a significant drop, also due to the naturalness of his position. Even so, the Stourbridge-born player has a remarkable 34 goals and 24 assists in 79 games.

All of them, as well as others like Rodrygo or Federico Valverde, essential in the team, or Raúl Asencio, a promise of La Fábrica made reality, will be fundamental for the team led by Carlo Ancelotti to lift their first Club World Cup with the new FIFA format.

Real Madrid are the overwhelming favourites to lift the Club World Cup title, with the odds on them to win at 4.50. Other big favourites include Manchester City (5.50), Bayern Munich (6.50), Chelsea (10.00), Inter Milan (11.00) and Paris Saint-Germain (13.00).

Odds, correct at the time of publication, are subject to change.

Los Blancos qualified for the 2025 Club World Cup as champions of the 2022 Champions League. Recall that the qualification system for European clubs consisted of 12 places with four champions and eight places by UEFA ranking. With Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester City confirmed as the latest UEFA Champions League champions, those who achieved their presence through the UEFA ranking were Bayern Munich, RB Salzburg, PSG, Inter Milan, Porto, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Atlético Madrid and Juventus.

Ultimately, Real Madrid secured their place automatically by lifting the most prestigious title in club football in 2022. However, the club presided over by Florentino Pérez would also have been able to qualify through the 2024 title.

Real Madrid have not yet presented a specific kit for this year's Club World Cup in the United States, but we should not rule out the possibility of seeing something new at a later date. Given the prestige that surrounds this year's event (and, of course, the immense financial opportunity it offers), it is likely that a high percentage of participating clubs will launch a specific kit for the occasion.

To understand Real Madrid's history at the Club World Cup, we must contextualise the history of the competition and its relationship with the Intercontinental Cup. At the end of the 20th century, the Intercontinental Cup pitted the champions of South America and Europe against each other, i.e. the winners of the Copa Libertadores and the Champions League. Later, FIFA wanted to include Asia, Africa, Oceania and CONCACAF. It was then that it created the Club World Cup, which replaced the Intercontinental in 2004.

How many times has Real Madrid won the Club World Cup?

In total, Real Madrid have four Intercontinental Cups (24/25, 2002, 1998 and 1960) and five Club World Cups (22/23, 18/19, 17/18, 16/17 and 14/15). This latest edition of the Intercontinental Cup was the return of the competition, which was played in the knowledge of the change of format of the Club World Cup, which will be played every four years. Thus, the Intercontinental Cup will be played every year and the FIFA Club World Cup every four years.

Real Madrid is the club with the most titles in both the Club World Cup and the Intercontinental Cup, having lifted the trophy in a total of nine editions between the two competitions.

Only on two occasions did they fail to win the trophy. The first was in 1966, when they lost the final of the Intercontinental Cup to Penarol in a two-legged match (2-0 and 0-2).

FIFA President Gianni Infantino highlighted the global significance and inclusive ethos of the new Club World Cup on a visit to the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California.

It is to be one of the competition's 12 host venues for the inaugural tournament which takes place from 14 June to 13 July.

“We (have) known (for) almost 100 years which country is the best country in the world in soccer, since 1930,” he said.

“It was about time that we come out with a competition which will determine which club, which team, is the best team in the world.”

Thirty-two clubs from all six FIFA confederations, including four teams from Africa, will take part in competition.

Millions of fans from around the world are expected to attend the tournament's 63 matches, with billions more watching them remotely.

Infantino also paid tribute to the first responders and those in the Los Angeles, Pasadena-Altadena community affected by the devastating January wildfires.

As a token of appreciation, FIFA donated two tickets per first responder for Club World Cup matches staged at the Rose Bowl Stadium.

Games for both the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place in Los Angeles.

	Standing outside Pasadena's Rose Bowl on Tuesday morning, FIFA President Gianni Infantino feted Los Angeles as one of the host cities for the imminent 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. During the host city trophy tour stop, Infantino acknowledged the recent devastating wildfires that engulfed the nearby Altadena and Palos Verdes neighborhoods.


	On hand at the media event were first responders, including representatives from Cal Fire, the Los Angeles Fire Department, LAPD, and the County Police Department, among others. The Los Angeles wildfires that burned out of control at the top of the year destroyed over 16,000 structures and burned 40,000 acres. 29 people died due to the fires.

	During the wildfires, the Rose Bowl was transformed into a home base for first responders battling the flames. It later acted as a wildfire donation hub and also hosted a benefit concert.


	“Knowing that this place gave hope to people, which is what we try with our sport to do. Here the first responders gathered to help the population. On behalf of FIFA and on behalf of the global soccer community, I would like to give sincere thanks,” said Infantino, who added that FIFA would be giving Los Angeles' first responded 30,000 tickets to the Club World Cup matches.


	Los Angeles will also host matches for the FIFA World Cup in 2026, but the city will get a test run with the upcoming Club World Cup. For that tournament, which kicks off June 14 and runs through to July 13, 32 club teams from six continental confederations will compete over 63 matches to crown one global club champion. In addition to Los Angeles, other US cities hosting the Club World Cup will be Seattle, Cincinnati, Nashville, Miami, and New York, among others.


	“We are working together with the entertainment industry. Globally, the only ones that can compete with these big Hollywood stars are soccer players. No other sport or social activity in life can compare to Hollywood and soccer,” Infantino told The Hollywood Reporter, adding that FIFA is in conversations with talent to participate in the tournament. “We will get a few of them on the field and see what their soccer skills are.”


	Infantino added: “What we do is a show, it's entertainment, and it's a sport, of course. When people speak about America and the United States, they know Los Angeles.”

	











	The Club World Cup is the first of many global sporting events that will be held in Los Angeles in the coming years. After the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the city will then host the 2028 Summer Olympics.

It's no secret that Chelsea have big decisions to make at several key positions this summer. They have to decide how much to invest at striker, how to proceed in central defense, and how to reshfuffle the deck in midfield with some young stars making their way to Stamford Bridge. 

The biggest decision they have to make is at the goalkeeper position where there is no great option currently wearing a Chelsea kit week in and week out. According to Matt Law of The Telegraph, a football reporter who has been following Chelsea for a very long time now, the Blues have indeed made a decision on that front. 

Law, in a report on The Telegraph, states that “Djordje Petrovic and highly-rated teenager Mike Penders will be given the chance to prove themselves at Chelsea this summer with the club preparing a full assessment of their goalkeepers”. He goes on to state that both of these young loanees will be at Chelsea before the start of the Club World Cup and will be given a chance to compete for the starting job. 

The report also suggests that Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen will be along for the ride as well and a decision has to be made on their futures as well. The easy decision seems to be to jettison Sanchez regardless of the net-loss on his transfer and allow him to play elsewhere. If Chelsea is that concerned about the quality of their third or fourth choice keeper there are definitely better options than Sanchez who may be older and are willing to be more of a locker room presence than on the field. 

Jorgensen is the wild card as he is still just 22 and is improving but has yet to prove he belongs at an elite level. Being third choice at this point in his career may see him push for a move elsewhere, whether on loan or permanently. 

The other two names in Petrovic and Penders are attracting lots of attention for their play at Strasbourg and Genk. Petrovic has been the star man for the Ligue 1 club and has helped them push for a Champions League place this season. Penders has been more of a rotational player but recently started a playoff match for the Belgian club, suggesting he is moving up the club's depth chart. 

Petrovic is the early favorite to become Chelsea's number one but Penders is seen by many as the next Thibaut Courtois. He is just 19 years old however and another loan may be the best option so he can play every week rather than sitting on the bench at Stamford Bridge. 

If Penders can prove he is worthy of a starting place then Maresca could have the best kind of selection headache where he has two legitimate number one keepers vying for the role. With the number of matches Chelsea will be playing next year across all competitions, hopefully including the Champions League as well, then there is plenty of game time to keep two young keepers fit and happy.

What once was a problem position for the Blues could suddenly become a position of strength and the Blues could once again become contenders for silverware both domestic and abroad.

USWNT's Jaedyn Shaw discusses dealing with expectations following her move to North Carolina Courage from San Diego Wave. (1:58)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said the United States and the United Kingdom are poised to be named as hosts of the Women's World Cup in 2031 and 2035, respectively.

Infantino told the UEFA Congress in Belgrade on Thursday that the joint bid from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was the only ""valid bid"" of interest for the 2035 tournament after the deadline passed, with the United States also putting forward the only bid for the 2031 edition.

""As part of the bidding process, we received one bid for '31 and one bid, valid bid, I should add for '35,"" he said.

""The '31 bid is from the United States of America and potentially some other Concacaf members together and the '36 bid is from Europe from the Home Nations so the path is there for the Women's World Cup to be taking place in '31 and '35 in some great countries and some great nations to boost even more the women's football movement.""

The UK has never hosted a Women's World Cup. England hosted the Women's Euros in 2022, winning the tournament on home soil. The men's team last hosted the World Cup in 1966. The 2035 bid could pave the way for the men's team to host a subsequent edition.

The UK's 2035 project was quickly supported by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in March when FIFA said it was formally seeking bids from member federations. FIFA excluded Europe from the 2031 contest, clearing the way for a long-expected U.S. win.

The Spanish Federation said last week they hoped to bid, possibly in conjunction with Portugal and Morocco -- the trio are hosting the men's 2030 World Cup. However, Infantino stated that there was only one ""valid bid"" for the 2035 edition, ruling out the possibility of the reigning world champions hosting the tournament.

""We are excited about the opportunity to co-host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup and, in collaboration with our @Concacaf partners, are committed to delivering a tournament that leaves a lasting legacy - one that elevates women's soccer across the world and inspires future generations of players and fans,"" U.S. Soccer said in a statement on Thursday.

""As FIFA finalizes the number of participating teams in the tournament, we will solidify our partnership structure with fellow Concacaf nations. We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling our full vision for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup in the near future.""

The United States were the only bid for the 2031 edition, having withdrawn plans to host the 2027 edition which Brazil will host. Likely in combination with several other Concacaf nations, likely Mexico, the U.S. will host their third edition after hosting the 1999 and 2003 tournaments.

The four-time winners will be the first country to host the tournament three times, with China having hosted the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 and again in 2007.

""We are honoured to be the sole bidder for the Women's World Cup 2035. Hosting the first FIFA World Cup since 1966 with our home nations partners will be very special. The hard work starts now, to put together the best possible bid by the end of the year,"" England FA CEO Mark Bullingham said in a statement.

Following a successful expansion of the tournament at Australia and New Zealand in 2023, the 2027 tournament will again feature 32 nations. The competition is set to expand to 48 teams for the 2031 World Cup.

Formal bids for 2035 must be submitted this winter, with a vote taking place next year to confirm hosts for 2031 and 2035.

FIFA have banned three countries from competing at the World Cup due to political reasons.

The 2026 edition, which will be staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico, will see an increase in qualified teams from 32 to 48.

Teams will be split into 16 three-team groups, with the top two in each group reaching the knockout stages.

Advert

Though the change of format has had its critics, it does allow nations to qualify who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to under the old system.

Two nations have been technically banned from the tournament. Russia are currently suspended from playing in FIFA-sanctioned tournaments due to their February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

They instead play international friendlies against nations largely outside of Europe, with friendlies during the most recent international window seeing them take on Zambia and Grenada.

Advert

Meanwhile, FIFA suspended FECAFOOT, the governing body of the Republic of the Congo, due to 'third-party interference in its affairs'.

Congo are not officially banned from the World Cup, but FECAFOOT cancelled its remaining qualifying matches following the announcement of the suspension.

Previously, two other nations were banned from world football's biggest tournament specifically due to political reasons.

During the period of racial apartheid in the country, South Africa were suspended by FIFA in 1961.

Advert

The ban would be lifted several years later in 1963, with then-FIFA President Stanley Rous being in support of the apartheid-era South African FA.

FIFA even put South Africa in an Asian qualifying group to avoid them facing African opposition, but other African nations successfully lobbied for the country to be suspended again.

South Africa would be expelled from FIFA entirely in 1976 after Rous was replaced by Joao Havelange, with other sports also choosing to boycott the country entirely.

They were reinstated in 1992 and won the African Cup of Nations in 1996, before hosting the World Cup in 2010.

And in 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned from international football as part of United Nations sanctions against the country.

Advert

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the FRY name continued to be used by Serbia and Montenegro, who were still part of Yugoslavia until 2003.

The two nations would then play as Serbia and Montenegro on the international stage, qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. Both nations gained full independence in June 2006.","{'href': 'https://www.sportbible.com', 'title': 'SPORTbible'}","soccer"

The Gunners have brought in the former Atletico Madrid director to help front their recruitment, and there's plenty on his in tray

There isn't quite a new era underway at Arsenal, but the Gunners are certainly opening a new chapter. Andrea Berta has officially been sworn in as the club's new sporting director, replacing popular ex-Invincbles midfielder Edu Gaspar.

Berta said upon arrival: ""I am thrilled to be joining Arsenal in what is a hugely exciting period for the club. I have watched with great interest the way Arsenal has evolved in recent years and I have admired the hard work that has gone in to re-establishing the club as a major force in European football with a passionate following around the world.""

Manager Mikel Arteta was similarly 'very excited', commenting on Monday: ""He was so willing to join us, which is a very positive thing as well because he had many other possibilities, and he's chosen to come to us. And now it's about us giving him the support and the understanding of the situation and context straight away. And for him to start to do what he's already done for many, many years at the highest level, which has been very impressive.""

Much of Berta's responsibilities will concern recruitment. Though there are already areas in which he can begin planning for the summer transfer window, some parts of his remit can be dug at right away.

Front and centre of Arsenal attention right now is Bukayo Saka, whose return from a three-month injury was greeted like a goal in Tuesday's win over Fulham, and that was before he even got on the scoresheet. He's being fast-tracked to legendary status at the Emirates Stadium and could conceivably have a statue outside it one day, though only if the club match his rapid upward trajectory.

With Berta now installed, here's what he and the club must do to build for the present and preserve their future:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The reigning European champions boast a talented squad that leaves them well-stocked in most areas, but they are facing a familiar issue in defence

For almost as long as Sarina Wiegman has been England head coach, the left-back position has been an issue. Taking over not long before Demi Stokes' international career was starting to wind down, owing to injuries as much as anything else, and while Alex Greenwood was swapping her full-back role for a central one that she has arguably become world-class in, the Lionesses have lacked natural options on the left-hand side of defence for several years now. As the reigning European champions prepare to defend their continental title this summer, in Wiegman's third major tournament in charge, that very much remains the case.

In November, it looked like she had found a solution. Greenwood and Jess Carter, another versatile centre-back who can play full-back on either side, fluidly interchanged on the left to add balance and solidity to a back line that kept a clean sheet against the United States, the Olympic champions. However, a knee injury sustained by Greenwood just two weeks later has thrown her availability for the Euros in doubt.

England have been fortunate in that the Manchester City star's absence has at least coincided with the return to fitness of Niamh Charles, the forward-turned-defender who plays on the left for Chelsea. But recent weeks have seen the Lionesses dealt another stumbling block, as the player who has become their best option for their most problematic position isn't getting the game time at club level that is going to best prepare her for a starting role at a major tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlos Alcaraz has developed into one of the best players on the ATP Tour in recent years.

The 21-year-old Spaniard continues to impress against the very best in men's tennis and is currently third in the ATP rankings.

Alcaraz won the Rotterdam Open earlier this year, taking home the 17th title of his young career and his first on indoor hard courts.

Traveling to Europe for the clay court season, Alcaraz will hope to add some more trophies to his collection.

He'll next be in action at the Monte-Carlo Masters, which begins on April 7, but first, he shared his thoughts on his ‘rude' ATP rivals.

During an interview with Louis Vuitton, Alcaraz was asked how he intends to inspire the next generation of tennis stars.

“I think the most important thing is being kind, being a good person,” he said.

“For me it's the most important thing, and of course, behave well on court.

“Get good values when you're on the court and off the court, that could be a good influence for the kids.”

The four-time Major champion then gave his honest opinion on ‘rude' ATP players.

“When I see you know some players being rude, I feel like ‘What happened with this guy?' he said.

“When I see one of my idols, for example, my idol Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer or other athletes, you know being so kind all of the time, and performing pretty well on the court.

“When I started, I felt they were being such great guys for me, I was like [I really want to be like these guys], and I want to be the same for the kids.”

Alcaraz has spent time with both Federer and Nadal, competing alongside the latter at the 2024 Olympic Games.

Nadal and Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals of the Olympic doubles tournament, losing out to the American pair of Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek.

Later that year, Alcaraz spent time with Federer at the Shanghai Masters, practising with him before the tournament in China began.

Learning from two of the best to ever play the game, perhaps it's no surprise Alcaraz continues to fight for trophies on the ATP Tour.

Alcaraz is no stranger to surrounding himself with Grand Slam talent, having been coached by 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero since the age of 16.

He has now opened up about his relationship with the 45-year-old, thanking him for the lessons he taught him.

“Well, probably thanks to Juan Carlos [Ferrero] I'm the player who I am now,” said Alcaraz.

“I learned a lot from him.

“At the beginning of our partnership we spent a lot of time together, we traveled a lot and we traveled just him and me.

“Thanks to that, I could learn a lot from him as a person, as a player.”

Alcaraz picked out the one lesson he thinks was the most important.

“He told me the importance of being off the court, that I have to be, let's say, a good person off the court, and the things that you're doing outside are going to have a huge impact on the court,” he said.

“So that's taught me a lot and probably since 16, 17, I've started to take care of all the details that I'm doing off the court, just to get better and I make sure that it's going to be good on court.”

Alcaraz will no doubt continue to learn from his countryman in 2025, as the pair look to pick up another title together in Monte-Carlo later this month.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Walton – Tiafoe: 04.04.2025 01:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Adam Walton has won three of his last five matches. This week in Houston, Walton won the opening-round match against Mmoh in straight sets. He trailed 2-5 in the second set but turned it around. This is his debut campaign in Houston.

Frances Tiafoe has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was in Miami, where he lost in the third round against Fils in three tight sets. His last clay court match was at the French Open, where he lost against Shapovalov in four tight sets.

According to the bookies, Tiafoe is the favorite in this matchup, and we agree. He was the champion here in 2023 and a finalist in 2024. We expect him to defend his points and win this match easily.

That being said, Tiafoe winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Frances Tiafoe winning 2-0 @1.91 @bet365

ATP 250 Houston quarterfinals

Brooksby – Kovacevic: 04.04.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 1-0

Jenson Brooksby has won four of his last five matches. This week in Houston, Brooskby qualified for the main draw tournament. His toughest challenge happened in the 1/8-Finals against Tabilo. Brooksby lost the opening set 3-6 but turned the match around. He saved three consecutive match points in the deciding set.

Aleksandar Kovacevic has won four of his last five matches. This week in Houston, Kovacevic won both matches in straight sets. In the 1/8-Finals, Kovacevic won against Denolly in straight sets in just over an hour.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Kovacevic has dominated this week in Houston, winning both matches in straight sets. On the other hand, Brooksby has already played four matches this week and spent almost three hours on the court in the 1/8-Finals. We expect Kovacevic to be a better player and win.

That being said, Kovacevic winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Aleksandar Kovacevic winning @1.91 @bet365

Paul – Smith: 04.04.2025 Time TBA
H2H: first meeting

Tommy Paul has won three of his last five matches. He is the first seed this week in Houston. In the opening round match, Paul defeated Garin in three tight sets after losing the opening set 2-6.

Colton Smith has won four of his last five matches. This week in Houston, Smith qualified for the main draw tournament. In the main draw round, Smith had a favorable draw. In the 1/8-Finals, Smith defeated Quinn in straight sets, offering and saving only one breakpoint.

According to the bookies, we agree that Paul is the favorite in this matchup. He is a better player than Smith and has more experience on the highest level. We expect him to be a better player and win easily.

That being said, Paul winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Tommy Paul winning 2-0 @2.00 @bet365

The ATP and WTA tours have swiftly moved on to the clay season, having just finished the hard court spell with the Sunshine Double.

ATP legend Jimmy Connors has shared his admiration for Aryna Sabalenka, who just lifted the Miami Open trophy.

The WTA number one beat Jessica Pegula in the final, with the American now turning her focus to the Charleston Open.

The clay-court tournament is a WTA 500 event, with the men set to turn their attentions to the clay courts of Monte Carlo, an ATP Masters 1000 event.

They arrive amid a challenging time for tennis chiefs, with the Professional Tennis Players Association [PTPA] last month filing a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies.

The PTPA want improved player welfare among other demands, with another protest against authorities now taking place among the leading players in the world.

As reported by L'Equipe, the top 20 ATP and WTA players have signed a letter demanding a “substantial increase” in prize money across the four Grand Slams.

READ MORE: Andy Roddick takes aim at the ATP as he claims there's a big issue which they have simply got to fix

The letter has been sent to the organisers of the four events; Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open.

The call involves a greater distribution of profits from the four Grand Slam tournaments to benefit the players.

It is certainly an interesting time for tennis, with the action on court often being overshadowed by events off it.

That is the last thing that all interested parties will want, all the way up from tennis chiefs to players and down to supporters.

Whether or not action is taken by Grand Slam organisers remains to be seen, but it seems there is a consensus across the men's and women's games.

But the fact that it is the leading players across the WTA and ATP tours is likely to be significant, with tennis chiefs unlikely to want to upset its most profitable assets.

The Australian Open has already been and gone in 2025, with the French Open next up at the end of May.

Andre Agassi despite staying relevant in the pickleball exhibition circuit and at the Australian Open hasn't been seen in particular in punditry or commentary duty much since his retirement from the sport. But TNT Sports have coaxed the former World No.1 into joining them at Roland Garros.

TNT Sports replace Eurosport and signed a $650 million deal with the FFT last year to air Roland Garros in the US over the next ten years meaning that anyone in the US doesn't have to use around five channels to watch the major.

The company who have previously worked in the UK also taking over Eurosport recently have landed a coup in Agassi albeit he will only be in the studio for the semi-finals and final.

Agassi has shown adeptness for working before on the coverage of tournaments but has not decided to travel out of the US or past Australia in recent years to do it and so this is a surprise move. He could also be reunited with John McEnroe.

Agassi who retired in 2006 has supposedly snubbed many high profile gigs. He won Roland Garros in 1999 to complete a career Grand Slam and reports suggest that McEnroe is also signed up as ever to be one of the lead analysts and commentators. So they will return together to renew their rivalry.

“Watching TNT through the years, I've admired how they create an environment that encourages everyone to express their voice in an authentic, unfiltered way,” Agassi said.

“I'm looking forward to the challenge of partnering with TNT Sports, via this very special Roland-Garros event, as we reimagine how tennis broadcasts can be.”

Craig Barry, Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, TNT Sports said: “Andre is one of the most accomplished tennis players of all time and we're excited to add his distinct voice to our inaugural Roland-Garros coverage.

“His very unique lens will elevate our presentation and appeal to both passionate fans and casual audiences.”

TNT Sports has made their first major “signing” for the upcoming French Open as former world No 1 Andre Agassi has been confirmed as a studio analyst.

The broadcaster – owned by Warner Bros. Discovery and BT Group – signed a $650-million deal with the French Tennis Federation in June last year as they acquired the rights to air Roland Garros in the United States for the next 10 years.

Previously American tennis fans had to tune into several different channels and streaming services – including NBC, Tennis Channel+ and Peacock – to watch the clay-court Grand Slam.

But as of this year, things will be much easier as they only have to subscribe to TNT Sports for the duration of the tournament.

And the company has landed their first major pundit with eight-time major champion Agassi – who has done limited TV work since retiring – joining the coverage.

There is a catch with Agassi's “signing” as he will only be in studio for the semi-finals and the finals.

“Watching TNT through the years, I've admired how they create an environment that encourages everyone to express their voice in an authentic, unfiltered way,” Agassi said.

“I'm looking forward to the challenge of partnering with TNT Sports, via this very special Roland-Garros event, as we reimagine how tennis broadcasts can be.”

Andre Agassi lands top coaching role. Roger Federer to follow in his footsteps?

Alarming drop in US Open TV figures will worry tennis chiefs

After finishing runner-up at Roland Garros in 1990 and 1991, Agassi won the clay major in 1999 to complete his Career Grand Slam.

He retired in 2006 and has turned down several high-profile gigs, but he has returned to the limelight in recent years as he signed up to become the new captain of Team World for the 2025 edition of the Laver Cup that will be held in San Francisco.

Craig Barry, Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, TNT Sports added: “Andre is one of the most accomplished tennis players of all time and we're excited to add his distinct voice to our inaugural Roland-Garros coverage.

“His very unique lens will elevate our presentation and appeal to both passionate fans and casual audiences.”

TNT Sports is yet to confirm the rest of their line-up, but reports suggest Agassi's fellow great John McEnroe – who has done extensive work for ESPN, the BBC and Eurosport over the years – will also be part of the set-up while Brian Anderson will lead the commentator.

Adam Lefkoe will be the studio host while Adam Lefkoe while former world No 1s and Grand Slam winners Jim Courier and Lindsay Davenport could also form part of the broadcasting team.

Former world number two Gauff was the top-earning female athlete last year at $30.4 million, according to sports industry news website Sportico, and has collected more than $23 million in prize money alone during her young career.

Gauff made her Grand Slam breakthrough as a 15-year-old qualifier at Wimbledon in 2019, when she reached the fourth round after stunning Venus Williams.

She won her maiden singles Grand Slam title on home soil at the 2023 U.S. Open.

Wimbledon's Henman Hill will be redeveloped to feature better accessibility and improved weather cover

Wimbledon is planning to renovate its iconic 'Henman Hill' and increase capacity for the tournament's 150th anniversary.

Thousands of fans have watched action on a big screen from the grass slope which is open to supporters without show-court tickets.

The proposed revamp - which has not yet been approved - would increase the hill's capacity by 20% in time for the 2027 event and increase accessibility.

It is the latest change planned for the All England Club, after a 39-court expansion was approved last year.

""It's all about enhancing this whole area, obviously it's become extremely popular but accessibility is difficult for everyone,"" said four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman, after whom the hill was named.

""We are always looking to enhance wherever we are on the estate. This is going to be an exciting project.""

British sports star Jack Draper had plenty to celebrate on Thursday following an exciting update away from the world of tennis.

In a post shared to Instagram, fashion house Burberry unveiled Jack as their new brand ambassador.

To announce the news, the British label shared a joyous picture of the 23-year-old clad in a khaki Burberry jacket, which he wore layered over a black T-shirt complete with a statement check collar.

A caption read: ""Introducing our new brand ambassador, British No.1 tennis player Jack Draper. His drive, dedication and optimism, on and off the tennis court, make him a perfect match for Burberry.""

Of his new role, the world No.7 said: ""Being able to represent Burberry as a brand ambassador is a real honour for me. I have admired the brand since I was a kid — it's an iconic house and represents classic British style.""

Chief Creative Officer Daniel Lee, meanwhile, said: ""It's inspiring seeing Jack Draper represent Great Britain with such a level of commitment. He is already one of his generation's most talented sportspeople.

""We are looking forward to watching his matches over the next few months.""

He joins an array of fellow ambassadors including actor Barry Keoghan, Zhang Jingyi and Tang Wei.

Fans and friends were quick to congratulate the professional tennis player, with one writing: ""Main man! Can't believe how far he's come with his journey in tennis!"" while a second remarked: ""Big congrats Jack! Well deserved,"" and a third chimed in: ""The dawn of a new era for Burberry!""

This isn't the first time Jack has dabbled in the world of luxury fashion. While Britain's No. 1 tennis star is best known for his flair on court, he's no stranger to modelling and has appeared in numerous photoshoots for the likes of British Vogue and Tatler.

Jack, who is 6ft3in tall, is currently signed to modelling agency IMG.

Reflecting on his career in the spotlight, he previously told Vogue: ""I quite enjoy being in front of the camera. If I'm looking good, that is.""

Sharing a glimpse inside his various transformations over the years, he went on to say: ""I've done a buzzcut, mohawk, mullet…""

Jack's new role with Burberry comes after he graced the FROW at the label's SS25 show at London Fashion Week. He was photographed at the glitzy event alongside Vogue's US editor in chief, Dame Anna Wintour.

...

Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open on Sunday suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipina wildcard Alexandra Eala.

The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first woman from the Philippines to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.

Eala, the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.

""Growing up it was tough,"" she said. ""You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think -- I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step,"" Eala said in her on-court interview.

Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.

""My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat -- and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success,"" said the American.

Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.

Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.

The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break.

- Patience pays off -

Swiatek didn't look back from that point on, making short work of the second set as her struggles on serve improved.

""In the first set, my serve wasn't working perfectly. I'm glad I was patient enough to just work for it, and in the second set I felt much better,"" Swiatek said.

Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, the 22nd seed, overcame 15th-seeded Czech Karolina Muchova to move into the fourth round with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 win.

In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.

Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.

Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.

""It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year,"" said Korda.

""I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today,"" he said.

Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.

The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.

""It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone,"" said Dimitrov.

""We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Will Draper, Mensik or Shelton make Nitto ATP Finals debut?","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/april-2025-race-update","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 01:16:17 GMT","

Could this be a season in which fresh faces qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals?

Following the Miami Open presented by Itau, three of the top eight players in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin — third-placed Jack Draper, sixth-placed Jakub Mensik and eighth-placed Ben Shelton — are aiming for their maiden trip to the season finale.




Draper has enjoyed his best start to a season, having showed his good form in February by reaching the final of the ATP 500 event in Doha, where he ousted Matteo Berrettini and Jiri Lehecka. That proved just the beginning.

The 23-year-old Briton showed how dangerous his powerful lefty game is by winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells. Draper, who lost just one set en route to the trophy in the desert, where he upset Carlos Alcaraz, only trails Jannik Sinner and Melbourne runner-up Alexander Zverev in the Live Race.

Following Draper's triumph at the BNP Paribas Open, the lefty then travelled to Miami for the second leg of the ‘Sunshine Double'. His first opponent in south Florida was none other than Mensik. The 19-year-old Mensik defeated Draper and rode his own wave of success to claim his first Masters 1000 title.

Draper will try to become the first British player to compete in the Nitto ATP Finals since Cameron Norrie, who did so as an alternate in 2021. Norrie also emerged victorious at Indian Wells that year.



While Draper was inside the world's Top 15 when he earned Masters 1000 glory, Mensik was outside the Top 50 when he lifted the trophy in Miami. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF competitor will try to make the jump to Turin one year on.

The Czech, whose best tour-level winning streak entering Miami was two, is now sixth in the Live Race. Mensik, 19, will try to become the first Czech to qualify for the season finale since Tomas Berdych in 2015.







Another player seeking his debut is eighth-placed Shelton, a semi-finalist at the Australian Open and a quarter-finalist in Indian Wells. The big-serving lefty is also the highest-ranked American in the Race To Turin.

Sandwiched in between Draper and Mensik are Novak Djokovic and Alcaraz. Djokovic, who fell to Mensik in the Miami final, is a record seven-time champion at the Nitto ATP Finals. The fourth-placed Serbian has competed at the event 17 times and also ousted Alcaraz en route to the Australian Open semi-finals.
Fifth-placed Alcaraz is attempting to qualify for the fourth straight season. The Spaniard won his first indoor hard court title this year in Rotterdam.

Felix Auger-Aliassime is the only player with two trophies this season, with triumphs in Adelaide and Montpellier. Boasting a 17-7 season record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Indez, the Canadian is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He also reached the ATP 500 final in Dubai. 
Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz round out the Top 10, with Holger Rune and Tommy Paul not far behind.

Jenson Brooksby fended off three consecutive match points Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the Fayez Sarofim & Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship.



The American overcame third seed Alejandro Tabilo 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(6) after a two-hour, 49-minute battle in blustery conditions. On the brink of defeat at 3/6 in the deciding-set tie-break, World No. 507 Brooksby swung freely and tallied five consecutive points to become the lowest-ranked quarter-finalist in Houston tournament history.

Brooksby also saved a match point in his first-round qualifying match Saturday against Federico Agustin Gomez. Against Tabilo, the former World No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings held a match point on return at 6-5 but ultimately navigated a rollercoaster tie-break, converting his second match point to win his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with the Chilean.



“I'm still a little bit shocked,” Brooksby said in his on-court interview. “That was a lot of back and forth. I knew he was a great competitor and I knew it would be a battle out here. I think it kind of reminded me of my first match here. You can just never quit until it's the last point.”



Tabilo, who secured an early break in the final set, will rue a loose service game when serving for the match at 5-4. In the decider, Brooksby dropped just three points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

 

Brooksby, 24, will next face Aleksandar Kovacevic or Frenchman Corentin Denolly.



Tommy Paul survived a hard-fought clash with 2019 champion Cristian Garin 2-6, 6-2, 7-6(5). Both players treated the fans to superb shotmaking in an absorbing two-hour, 42-minute match, which featured a 10-deuce, 16-minute opening game.



Paul earned a crucial break at 4-4 in the decider and served for the match in the ensuing game, but Garin struck back and eventually forced a tie-break. The 27-year-old Paul converted four of his 14 break chances, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hammered 34 winners to reach the quarter-finals. 



“Today was a tricky, rollercoaster match. I feel like that's kind of been my year so far, a lot of rollercoaster matches,” said the No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I'm really happy to get through this one. It's been a while since I've had a win here in Houston.”

Paul will next take on his friend and fellow American Colton Smith, who was sitting in the top seed's players' box Wednesday evening. Smith, competing in just his second tour-level event, defeated Ethan Quinn 6-3, 6-4. Having advanced through qualifying, Smith has not dropped serve across four matches. The 22-year-old has saved all six break points he has faced.

A standout senior at the University of Arizona, Smith is up to No. 165 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

The ATP Challenger Tour is set to reach more fans than ever in 2025, with a major global broadcast expansion set to deliver its world-class tennis to millions. A new partnership with Tennis Channel will see 35 Challenger Showcase events, featuring enhanced production, broadcast in Austria, France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and USA.

Partnering with Tennis Channel and other broadcasters means we can shine a global spotlight on the incredible talent in these events, giving players the platform they deserve and inspiring the next generation of stars. It's another signal of our commitment to growing the game at this level.”

This partnership provides a unique platform to showcase the incredible talent and storylines of the ATP Challenger Tour.

No. 3 seed Zheng Qinwen of China cruised through a marquee second-round match at the Credit One Charleston Open on Wednesday night, defeating Maria Sakkari of Greece 6-4, 6-1 to reach the Round of 16.

Charleston: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Making her first Charleston appearance since her tournament debut in 2022, reigning Olympic gold medalist Zheng needed 1 hour and 32 minutes to oust former World No. 3 Sakkari, who made last year's Charleston semifinals.

""[I knew] when I have to attack, when I have to defend, because everybody here is going to make the transition from hard to clay,"" Zheng said in her on-court interview. ""I believe who does that better here can win the the tournament.""

Here are some takeaways from the match:

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Zheng continues clay-court winning streak: Sakkari came into the match with a 2-1 head-to-head lead over Zheng, but all of those previous encounters had been on hard court.

Clay is a different story. Prior to this week, Zheng's most recent event on the surface was her historic run to the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which took place on the famed clay of Roland Garros.

Zheng carried that clay-court confidence into this evening's meeting. She has now won 12 consecutive matches on the surface (she preceded her Olympics run by defending her title at Palermo).

Meanwhile, Sakkari has seen her ranking slip from No. 7 to No. 64 in the last 12 months, and she is 6-11 on the year. Sakkari was aiming for her first Top 10 win in over a year, but she fell to 0-8 against the Top 10 since she beat Coco Gauff at 2024 Indian Wells.

Power shots propel Zheng ahead: Zheng's game serves her well on clay, where her strong, deep forehands command the court. She used that wing to grind through a lengthy 3-3 game and earn the only break of the first set.

Last year's ace leader on the Hologic WTA Tour, Zheng's first serve also continues to be a huge advantage, including on clay. She powered a big serve to save a break point while consolidating for 5-3, eventually easing to the one-set lead.

Zheng's first serve held sway in the second set as well. It made a huge difference when she got that shot into play -- Zheng won 87.5 percent of her first-serve points but was more vulnerable behind her second serve, winning only one-third of those points.

Regardless, Zheng executed enough of those first serves to ease to victory without being broken (she went 2-for-2 on break points saved). Naturally, her final shot was a hefty forehand to force an error and seal match point.

First-time opponent awaits: Next up for Zheng will be a Round of 16 meeting with No. 13 seed Elise Mertens of Belgium. In Wednesday's final match on Credit One Stadium, Mertens beat Varvara Gracheva of France 6-3, 7-5.

A new look for Zheng will be guaranteed -- she has never faced former Top 15 player Mertens.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The Tao of Danielle Collins has taken on new dimensions through what she has called this “bonus” phase of her career. Though the former world No. 7 expected to kick off retirement in 2025, she hasn't let the change in plans stop her from building the life she's always wanted.“Even as a child I wanted to have a little farm with animals,” Collins told me during the BNP Paribas Open last month. “I'm a huge animal lover. This is just the start with the chickens. Once you get chickens, you end up taking on other forms of livestock pretty quickly.“I've embraced this crunchy, granola-girl lifestyle!” she added with a laugh. “I feel very Mother Earth these days.”To be clear, Collins is still bringing her signature intensity to the tennis court—anyone who tuned into the her 2025 Australian Open campaign are clear that her lighter, brighter spirit still burns with plenty of competitive fire.

It gives me such joy and purpose to take care of all these creatures. Danielle Collins

“It's polar opposites,” she told me. “I go from being at a tournament and feeling like I'm on a stage and being so performance-oriented to pulling up weeds in your garden or going into your chicken coop when it floods from melting snow.”Collins casually pivots into a harrowing story of rescuing her seven chickens (most named after classic TV sitcom characters) from a storm—which became an athletic endeavor all its own.“I was looking at this lake that sprung up in my coop and thinking, ‘What am I supposed to do with all this water? I'm just a girl!' But then you get into emergency mode and lay down 400 pounds of sand. It doesn't matter how fit I am from the tennis court or how many weights I lift or how much running I do, my physical fitness doesn't prepare me for a project of that scale or magnitude. But I do it to keep their coop dry and safe.“The purpose you get from taking care of these animals and having them as your pets is so special, especially if you've come from a city-living environment the way I did.”

The farm is just one of Collins' active interior design projects; she's also in the midst of repairing her Florida home after it incurred damage from Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But the 2022 Australian Open finalist ultimately prefers the more pastoral setting for her growing family—one that already gained a new family member in Crash, an injured dog she rescued off the street during the Miami Open.“It gives me such joy and purpose to take care of all these creatures,” said Collins, who confirmed she had officially adopted Crash last week.Once Crash is trained, he will join Collins and dog brother Quincy on the road for camping glamping trips, at home for binge-watches of Baylen Out Loud, and on the farm to help raise the chickens in an environment where nothing (and I mean nothing) goes to waste.“When you have leftover fruits or vegetables, you give them to your chickens and those are powerful nutrients for them. When you eat their eggs, you compost the shells, and when you clean out the chicken coop, their droppings become compost for your garden to grow those fruits and vegetables!” Collins said, drawing her very own circle of life.

Collins has used social media to update fans on her growing farm (IG/@danimalcollins).

“We're so disconnected from our food sources,” she continued. “I think, from a health and nutritional standpoint, that's not great for us, and it also makes us incredibly wasteful. When you're in an urban environment, it's so easy to get disconnected from all these things.”While some would consider this pastoral persona at odds with the brasher “cash checks” ethos captured by her merch line, those who know “Danimal” understand this foray into agriculture is, in fact, a manifestation of all that has ever existed beyond the baseline.“Even though I've been on tour for seven or eight years, people don't really know who I am! And it's made me become misunderstood, in a way.“I hope sharing this part of my life can not only give some insight into what goes on behind the scenes, but also showcase all sides of my spirit.”

Ever since Oscar Piastri made his Formula 1 debut for McLaren two seasons ago, it's become almost a cliche to say that the main factor separating him from team-mate Lando Norris is his qualifying performance. A bald view of the statistics would appear to bear that out: in 2023 Norris outqualified Piastri for grands prix 15-7, in 2024 that gap widened to 20-4 – with the result that, barring a few outliers, Piastri spent most of his time behind Norris on track.

A captive narrative has emerged that he hasn't yet nailed the art of bringing his tires into the ‘sweet spot' which enables Piastri to extract maximum performance from his car over a single lap in qualifying. As a result, say the detractors, he pushes too hard in races and doesn't get the best out of his tires there either.

But F1 is a game of small margins and Piastri attributes his strong start to the 2025 season to a broader spread of factors, including being “laser-sharp” on the small details which create marginal gains.

In his home race, the season opener in Australia, Piastri qualified within a tenth of a second of his polesitting team-mate and was running closely enough to Norris over the opening stint to suggest over the radio that the team ought to order a swap. Ultimately he dropped back after going wide over the Turn 6 curb, then lost time to an off-track excursion when the rain returned, but fought his way back into the top 10.

The following weekend in China, at a circuit on which he'd struggled the previous season, Piastri put his MCL39 on pole and won – while Norris was relatively scruffy in qualifying and didn't look like mounting a serious challenge in the grand prix. While two grands prix represents a small sample set, Piastri was clear when asked about this apparent improvement that it wasn't just down to scrutinising lap times and tire temperatures.

“It's not necessarily as detailed as that, but it was and still is about all the little things,” he said.

“Even in the two qualifyings this year we've seen it's been decided by very small margins. I think last year I was often on the wrong end of those small margins.

“So it's about trying to, in some ways, look at all those numbers, all the different things, how you manage the tyres, whether you get a slipstream or not, all kinds of little things that add up and might not look like much. But when you add them all together it's the difference between, in a lot of cases now, first and second.

“Obviously an incredibly important part of the weekend now is qualifying on pole.

“So, yes, it's different everywhere you go, but I think it's just being about laser-sharp on all the little things. Obviously driving well and being confident with what you're doing is the most important, but I feel like we're all on that level that any little extra bit you can get is where the difference is.”

Piastri spoke about having “some things” he had wanted to work on in Melbourne specifically, based on experience from the past two years, and that this had boosted his competitiveness there. But China was a venue where there was more significant room for improvement.

Last year Shanghai returned to the calendar for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the race's cancellation in 2020. The Chinese track is unusual in that front-end performance of the car is more of a limiting factor than the rear: the opening snail-shaped complex of corners and the fast exit onto the back straight put high stresses through the front-left tire.

On top of that, last year the organisers painted the track surface for cosmetic reasons, and it proved horrendously slippery. Piastri qualified seven places behind Norris in the sprint and labored to eighth place in the grand prix.

“I think I said in the pre-season this year that I didn't feel like there was necessarily a hole left in my weaknesses as a driver,” said Piastri.

“It was about just making sure that the dips along the way were filled in. Obviously it's been a very small sample size, but I've been happy that, especially on one track that I struggled at a lot, the performance was so different 12 months later. I think just trying to maintain that level of performance is what's going to be important.

“Some of the limitations in China are quite specific, especially with how damaging it is to the front tires. I had some question marks on whether it was just the track or the tyres behaved in a way that suited me more naturally [in 2025] but, after analyzing the weekend, I don't think it was just a pleasant coincidence that it was a strong weekend. I think it was down to a lot of good preparation.

“I don't know if that's still working. But I think for me, analyzing that weekend gave me probably even more confidence than what I gained during the weekend, or added more on top of that.”

The elephant in the room, particularly so far as McLaren is concerned since it has to manage the relationship between its two drivers, is whether Piastri can now mount a championship challenge to Norris. After the disappointment of Australia, finishing second in the Chinese sprint and winning the grand prix lifted Piastri to fourth in the standings, 10 points behind Norris.

While this may seem to be a small gap given the ebb and flow of competition, it never pays to fall too far behind at the beginning of a season – last year McLaren only really came on song after a car upgrade at the Miami Grand Prix, by which time Max Verstappen had built a margin he was able to defend against Norris over the remaining races. And in this cause, of course, Norris wasn't aided by McLaren appearing to dither over whether to prioritise him over Piastri.

“Of course I want to try and reverse that gap that we have,” said Piastri, “but with 22 races to go it would be a pretty stressful year if you were worrying about that gap already.

“Yes, they can be won and lost at the start of the year, but they can also be won and lost at the end of the year. The first six races are just as important as the last six.

“I've had plenty of championships myself where you look at the gaps and where you've lost points and stuff like that – and you generally don't really look at where in the year they came, you just look at the fact that you did have points that you lost through the season at some point.

“So I think those kind of weekends where you maximise the performance, that is what it is all about.”

Haas has introduced a small upgrade to its VF-25 Formula 1 car's floor for the Japanese Grand Prix in a bid to solve its aero oscillation issue in high-speed corners, which emerged at the Melbourne season opener.

The team struggled at the season opener, with team principal Ayao Komatsu estimating that Haas was six tenths away from the rest of the field as it battled against bouncing in the high-speed Turn 9-10 section.

This left both drivers unable to carry speed through the left-right corners that break up the Lakeside Drive portion of the Albert Park course, severely hampering its final sector pace in the process. However, the team rallied in Shanghai as the smoother circuit ensured that the team was not suffering aerodynamically and could put the car into the right set-up window.

In an effort to quell a repeat of its issues at high speed, which Komatsu felt were precipitated by the bumpiness of the Melbourne circuit, the team focused its attention on trying to reduce the floor's sensitivity and fast-tracked a few changes between the Chinese and Japanese rounds.

Komatsu says that Haas will know if the upgrade has made any difference through assessing its first-sector performance in FP1.

""In order to get the parts here, we had to really shortcut the process – whether it's gonna make one-percent difference or 50-percent difference, honestly, I cannot say,"" he admitted.

""Depending on what we see, it could be as bad as Melbourne, or it could be even better than Shanghai. I think FP1 the key for us; as soon as we do a lap or as soon as we go through sector one, we will know.

""We had to bring something, we couldn't come here with the same car as Melbourne and just hope for the best. We just wanted to take as much in our control as possible. That's just a judgement call in terms of risk management to shortcut that process.""

Komatsu explained more about the 'risks' involved in developing the floor update, explaining that it was a case of producing the revised floor parts quickly and then retrospectively testing it in the wind tunnel while it was being shipped to Japan.

He said that the ad-hoc test in the wind tunnel suggested that Haas was moving in the right direction, but reiterated that he would remain unsure of the impact of the floor changes until the car actually takes to the track.

Komatsu explained that the smoothness of the resurfaced Shanghai circuit largely kept the aerodynamic oscillations, produced by Melbourne's less consistent track surface, in check.

As current-generation F1 cars are so stiffly sprung, it's incredibly difficult to dampen the frequencies induced upon the car by bumps on the road. If the car is unsettled before it reaches a corner, the aerodynamics are hindered by that; without the requisite downforce for a high-speed corner, the drivers will have to lift to get it through the corner.

Haas was concerned before China that the car would suffer from the same issues into Turn 1 and Turn 7, two of the higher-speed corners – but there was little detectible aerodynamic oscillation and thus the drivers could benefit from a wider range of set-ups available.

""Because we didn't have the aero oscillation issue, we can set the car up in the way that we wanted and so we do have downforce,"" Komatsu explained. ""That's the potential you saw in Shanghai.

""If you look at our Turn 7, it was crazy quick. I was worried that we're going to have a problem in Turn 7 or maybe T1 entry as well, but we didn't, so we set up the car the way we wanted.

""In Melbourne, we just couldn't – we'd just spin the car off.""

Komatsu explained that it wasn't the oscillations per se that hurt the car, but it was the combination of this plus the compression that the cars experience in Turn 10, where the springs travel to their position under maximum load and cannot damp the car any further.

""If there's a bump, that can just initiate it – then once it starts, you can't stop it. But again like corners like Turn 12 in Melbourne, the right-hander. In that corner, we actually had lots of oscillation as well, but we got quick.

""So even if you have oscillation in corners, it's fine, but Turn 10 – or the transition between Turn 9 and 10 – Is like the worst combination. We cannot carry any speed, then you hit the compression, it's just game over.""

“Nonsense”, “random” and “crap” – the three words Lando Norris used to describe recent comments made about McLaren by its rivals as the squad adjusts to life as the hunted rather than the hunter.

After ending a 26-year wait for a constructors' championship last season, McLaren has continued where it left off – Norris winning in Australia before team-mate Oscar Piastri took victory at the Chinese Grand Prix.

From the moment the McLaren broke cover in pre-season testing, much has been said of its perceived dominance over the rest of the pack. Norris and Piastri have also been labelled as favourites for the drivers' title.

Mercedes' George Russell has also enjoyed a strong start to 2025 but suggested recently that McLaren had a car that boasted a bigger advantage over the field than the Red Bull had previously and could win every race of the year.

Meanwhile, the likes of Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur and its driver Charles Leclerc have also had their say on McLaren's gap to the other teams on the grid.

“I think the people that say that, like the ‘unbeatable' stuff... it's just nonsense. They just like to talk crap sometimes,” Norris said ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix.

“It's your job as the media to figure out these things, I think, and not just listen to what everyone says and write what they say. You have to try and understand what they're saying and prove that what they're saying is a fact, rather than... I can just say a load of crap and you write it down. But it's up to you, I think, to get across the facts of what is true, and not just write nonsense that people like to say.”

Having taken over the mantle as F1's team to beat, McLaren now has a large target painted on the back of its papaya cars.

Norris, however, insists the team is enjoying the new feeling of leading the way having completed a remarkable turnaround from being one of the slowest squads.

“I think if we go back one year ago, Red Bull were still a lot further ahead than we are now. The fact that they had two drivers up there dominating, they were a lot further ahead than we are now, so I think we're doing a very good job and I feel like people are talking about us a lot more now,” he said.

“I think it's because of where we've come from over the last year and a half, the deficit we've come from. But the car Red Bull had this time last year was a lot better than what we have now, compared to our competitors.

“I think you have to take that into account, but... I think we all feel good as a team, knowing that we have a strong car. It's not always the easiest car to drive, but a very strong car and the strongest car on the grid.

“The target [on our back] is a nice thing, I think. We're still new to it. I mean, Mercedes had it for five, six years where they were the targets, so I think we've got a bit of time before we get to those kinds of numbers. So for now, it's still like a motivating thing. While we're at the front, we know that they're behind us, so it really pushes us.

“I think we've pushed even more into this season, to start the season off on the right foot, ending with a very good year last year. We want to still try and increase our advantage more than what it is now.

“It's a good thing for us and we know that people love to talk and just say random things and stuff that's not true. But I hope that you guys are the ones that figure out... you know, what the facts are.”

Max Verstappen has suggested his Red Bull Formula 1 team needs to focus on fixing its troubled 2025 car rather than worry about the identity of his team-mate.

After two difficult weekends alongside Verstappen, Red Bull has demoted Liam Lawson to Racing Bulls, with Yuki Tsunoda moving in the other direction from this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix.

While Red Bull has the remit to move its four drivers around across the two teams it owns, and has done so in the past, handing Lawson just two rounds to adapt has been felt as particularly cruel by colleagues and observers.

Former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde likened Red Bull's approach to ""bullying"" on his Instagram profile. ""Yes, you gotta perform. Yes, the pressure is insane. But in my opinion this comes closer to bullying or a panic move than actual high athlete achievements,"" he wrote. ""They made a decision - fully aware - gave Liam two races only to crush his spirit.""

The post was liked by Verstappen, who according to driver advisor Helmut Marko disagreed with the decision to swap drivers. And while the Dutchman didn't want to expand too much on his own opinion, he said he didn't interact with Van der Garde's message by mistake and felt Red Bull's main focus should be on the drivability and performance of its difficult 2025 car.

""Well, I liked the text, so I guess that speaks for itself, right? It was not a mistake,"" he said. ""My reaction was shared with the team, but in general. Not only the swap, but about everything. We discussed that already during the last race weekend and back at the factory.""

When asked if he agreed with the decision, he responded: ""Sometimes it's not necessary to always share everything in public.

""I think our main issue is that our car is not where we want it to be. Everyone knows that within the team as well and that's what I focus on, to be honest. Because as soon as the car is more competitive and more drivable in general, then I think even in the second car it will come to you anyway a bit more naturally.

""Liam did 11 races or something in total [before 2025] but over a different period of time. And I think for rookies the beginning of the season is very tough, because most of these tracks they haven't really driven on, or they merely have a sprint weekend. So all these scenarios don't help.""

Verstappen, who spent time in Red Bull's UK factory to have a deep dive with the team's engineers into his car's problems, said there isn't just one issue that is causing the RB21 to become unstable and lack balance.

""It is a little bit more nervous, a little bit more unstable in different corner phases,"" the Dutchman explained. ""I think it's a combination of a lot of things. It depends also on the corner speed, the tarmac, tyres, overheating, bumps, kerbs. Some tracks are more limiting than others. Some issues are easier to solve than others. Everyone is trying their hardest to make the car faster.""

Verstappen heads into the Japan weekend second in the standings after grabbing second in Australia's rain-affected race and salvaging fourth in China, but he still believes McLaren is ""comfortably ahead"" and will be hard to catch.

""Every track is a bit different, but at the moment, they are quite comfortably ahead,"" the four-time world champion said. ""Never say never. We come to every race trying to get the best out of the car but at the moment, I don't think – even if we optimise our performance – that is enough. But we keep working.

""We're trying to have the performance coming this year still, but if it's going to be enough to beat McLaren it's very difficult to say, because the others are also improving.""

Connor Zilisch, who is just 18 years old, made his Cup debut earlier this year at the Circuit of the Americas. Trackhouse Racing Team, who signed the Red Bull athlete last year, put Zilisch in a fourth car for COTA.

He qualified 14th and showed impressive pace, but crashed out of the race when he collided with his spinning teammate, Daniel Suarez. He finished 37th, completing 49 of 95 laps.

Zilisch will get another chance in May, competing in NASCAR's longest event -- the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He will again drive the No. 87 Chevrolet with backing from Red Bull.

“It's awesome to have the opportunity to race in one of NASCAR's coolest events,” said Zilisch in a release from the team. “The Charlotte 600 is one of the most prestigious races in NASCAR. It's going to be a physical and mental challenge because that race is so tough. I'm very appreciative for (Trackhouse owner and founder) Justin (Marks) and everyone at Red Bull for their support and turning this opportunity into a reality.”   

Zilisch is currently competing full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series with JR Motorsports. He won on debut last year at Watkins Glen and is already locked into the 2025 playoffs via a win at COTA. He earned his first oval pole last weekend at Martinsville Speedway.

Red Bull, the official energy drink company of Trackhouse, has also appeared as the primary sponsor for Shane van Gisbergen in Las Vegas. Red Bull colors will be featured on SVG's machine in the July 13th race at Sonoma Raceway, the Aug. 3rd race at Iowa Speedway, the Aug. 23rd at Daytona International Speedway, and the Sept. 28th race at Kansas Speedway.

Charles Leclerc, Ferrari

Ferrari aims to learn from the “pain” of having both its cars disqualified from the Chinese Grand Prix but its key challenge is to make up the gap to McLaren, says Charles Leclerc.

While Leclerc's team-mate Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race in Shanghai, Ferrari regards that result as an outlier and is expecting its form at the Japanese Grand Prix this weekend to be more in line with where it was on the Sunday in China.

There, Hamilton and Leclerc qualified fifth and sixth, ran fourth and fifth for most of the opening stint, but were passed by Max Verstappen as the Red Bull came alive on the hard-compound tyres in the second stint. Afterwards both Ferraris were disqualified – Leclerc for being marginally underweight, Hamilton for illegal skid plank wear.

“Obviously whenever you do mistakes you learn from them, especially when they're costing that much,” said Leclerc in the pre-race press conference at Suzuka.

“Everybody is playing with the limit and trying to be as close as possible to it, but to have both cars underneath [i.e. beyond] it was a big pain, and at the end of the day we didn't need that. It's been a very difficult first part of the season, the first two races were very difficult, the pace wasn't where we expected it to be.

“To lose more points than we already did [through underperforming in Melbourne] hurts the team a lot.”

Both these technical infractions are consequences of running as close as possible to the permitted tolerances. Carrying too much margin – in terms of ballast or ride height in these cases – costs fractions of a second or more per lap and Ferrari was unlucky, perhaps even slightly careless, to inadvertently stray over the boundaries with both cars.

Hamilton's disqualification was, in effect, unavoidable from the moment the car set off from the grid at a smooth track where the drivers spend little time riding the kerbs. But Leclerc's was potentially avoidable – it was notable, for instance, that Verstappen was careful to spend as much time as possible on his cool-down lap off the racing line, picking up spent rubber on the outside of his tyres.

Whether Verstappen was reminded to do this or not, it's an indicator of how Ferrari and Leclerc could potentially have avoided disqualification when the margins are this tight – Leclerc's car was just 1kg underweight.

“I'm confident that we'll learn from it,” said Leclerc. “Obviously when events like this happen, we try to understand and analyse where it went wrong, and change a little bit the process.

“It was a multitude of things adding up which meant the margin we had wasn't big enough.”

While running close to the limits is standard practice in Formula 1, going over them – with both cars – is indicative of the current state of play, where McLaren has a dominant (if occasionally tricky) car, and Ferrari lies some way back in a chasing pack where its position relative to Mercedes and Red Bull is more fluid.

Although the ground-effect ruleset introduced in 2022 has now reached a state of maturity, and the gaps between different cars are diminishing as performance converges, there is still a spread. Closing these gaps is not just a question of fiddling with set-up or drivers adjusting their styles – each car has a performance ceiling.

“It's as difficult as always – it's always tricky to extract maximum performance from a car,” said Leclerc. “I don't think it's any more difficult in a season like this.

“It's just that the performance compared with McLaren specifically is just not good enough. So it's not about how hard it is to extract the maximum performance out of the car, it's just that there's not enough performance in the car for now.

“But little step by little step I'm sure we can close that gap – starting from this weekend, hopefully.”

At this stage in the season there will still be car developments in the works. But lead times on more critical components are such that even the best-resourced teams are still some way from responding definitively to events in the opening rounds – although Haas is applying a tweak to its floor this weekend.

As such, Ferrari – like the other teams – is still learning about its car. To an extent, performances will vary according to track configurations, weather conditions and race circumstances, which is why Ferrari regards its performance in the sprint race in China as an outlier.

Indeed, it made set-up changes to both cars after Hamilton's victory in the sprint, with the principal aim of preserving tyre performance in the substantially longer grand prix.

“We saw a big step on Saturday [in China], in the sprint race with Lewis especially,” said Leclerc. “On Sunday I think it was back to normal.

“[This weekend] I expect us to be more in line with China on the Sunday than in Melbourne.”

Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari

Photo by: Sam Bagnall / Motorsport Images

Lewis Hamilton says having to gain a deeper understanding of Ferrari's car set-ups is the main factor behind his up-and-down form as he starts his stint with the Italian Formula 1 powerhouse.

Hamilton and Leclerc both struggled for pace in Australia's Q3 shoot-out despite looking strong earlier on, and the pair also had a mixed weekend in China where Hamilton won the sprint from pole but was off the pace during the grand prix.

Ultimately both drivers were disqualified for technical infractions in Shanghai, losing fifth and sixth, adding to Ferrari's muted start to the season as the Scuderia has yet to extract the SF-25's inherent speed in a reliable fashion.

When asked why the team's early 2025 form has been so up and down, Hamilton replied: ""It's a combination of probably several different things, but I think mostly just pinning the set-up.

""I told you that I'm still learning about this car, so I still haven't tested every item that they have yet. Ultimately, I made the wrong decision on set-up for the Saturday going into qualifying at the last race, which then I just had to live with for the race.

""If we had just left the car probably alone or actually [if] the step that we did take [had been] an improvement, I think we could have qualified in the top three, which would then have had a much different result, most likely.

""But that wasn't the case, and it was really difficult to drive from the moment we went out in qualifying and then it was the same balance on a Sunday, so we just had to persevere with it.""

Hamilton says he is pleased with how he has adapted from Mercedes' lineage of cars to the vastly different Ferrari, having been on the back foot because he hadn't been able to simulate a dry-weather race run before the China weekend, nor had he sampled Pirelli's harder C2 tyre compound that proved pivotal to pulling off a one-stop race.

""I think that outside of that garage most people completely underestimate what we actually do,"" the seven-time world champion explained.

""When we're talking about set-up and changes that we're making, all the different graphs that you're looking at for aero, through-corner balance, mechanical balance, roll balance, all these different things that we're trying to play with and finesse through a weekend.

""After analysing the last two races, the first race I generally didn't feel great in the car at the beginning, but our pace wasn't too bad on the first two days; Sunday was the first time I'd ever driven the car in the rain, and I was learning a lot throughout the race.

""Then in the last race, that was the first time I'd actually done a long run. Every other driver here pretty much got to do the Abu Dhabi test and try the 2025 tyre. I didn't. And we went into the race run in Bahrain [testing] and the car broke down. The sprint race was the first time I'd actually done a 20-lap stint and then in the race it was the first time I'd ever tried the C2, so I was just learning that through a race.

""I was definitely starting to feel the onwards effect of not being able to do the test at the end of the year, and so on reflection I'm quite happy of how I've adapted in just those two races. But I've definitely got a lot of work to do to make sure that it's better moving forward.""

Yuki Tsunoda had detailed the timeline of his Red Bull Formula 1 promotion ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix, revealing he has yet to speak to his mentor Helmut Marko.

Shortly after the Chinese Grand Prix Red Bull took the ruthless decision to swap Tsunoda with Liam Lawson after two difficult weekends for the New Zealander aboard the Red Bull RB21, with Tsunoda stepping into the seat for Japan while Lawson returns to satellite team Racing Bulls.

Tsunoda said he was informed shortly after the Shanghai weekend by team principal Christian Horner that there might be some imminent news on his future. But the Japanese driver says he hasn't yet heard from Red Bull's driver advisor Marko, which he found ""very unusual"".

""The first call I got was from Christian right after China, that I should maybe be prepared for when things are going to change a little bit,"" Tsunoda said. ""I guess it was Tuesday or something like that.

""Surprisingly, [Marko] didn't call me yet, very unusual. So, I'm not sure if he was busy with other things. I can't wait to see him, how he's going to react to me [moving]. But yeah, it's very unusual. From F3 to F1, he was always calling me, but this time he didn't call me. So, I'm sure there's not anything from his side. We have still a good relationship, so let's see how he reacts to that.""

By the time Tsunoda got the call he would be changing teams in Japan, he was in the team's simulator to prepare the Suzuka weekend for Racing Bulls, having to quickly jump into the virtual rendition of the Red Bull instead.

""I was in the UK anyway for our preparation for Suzuka with Racing Bulls, and the plan changed,"" he said. ""Immediately I had a similar session with the Red Bull. I think at that point I was spending two, three days in the UK.""

Tsunoda said he received supportive messages from former Red Bull drivers Sergio Perez and Pierre Gasly, and while the pressure is on for him to perform on his home weekend in a car he hasn't driven yet, he says he isn't feeling the weight of expectation just yet.

""No, I guess the pressure will always come once you hit the track but for now, I'm really relaxing somehow,"" he explained. ""It feels actually similar to when I was in Racing Bulls. Once I entered the hospitality, I was only thinking about breakfast! So, I don't necessarily feel pressure so far.

""Those things will naturally come in the race at my home grand prix. In qualifying, I'm sure it's going to be hectic. But now there's not much point to feeling pressure.""

Lewis Hamilton believes it was “pretty tough” on Liam Lawson to be dropped by Red Bull after just two races – but said he was not surprised to see the team act so swiftly.

Lawson struggled to get to grips with the RB21 in both the Australian and Chinese grands prix and was ultimately demoted back to Racing Bulls as a result, with Yuki Tsunoda swapped in to replace the New Zealander.

The controversial decision was the talk of the paddock at Suzuka on Thursday, with seven-time world champion Hamilton among those to offer their take on the situation.

“I'm not surprised to see them move that early, no,” he stressed when asked if the call to make the swap had caught him unaware.

“Both great drivers. I think we've got a lot of really great drivers here, particularly young, talented drivers.

“I think there's naturally a lot of pressure on youngsters coming in and I think there's no way you can get fully on top of a car which is known to be not the easiest car to necessarily drive. Just to get in two races was pretty tough.”

Tsunoda will now step in at Red Bull to join reigning champion Max Verstappen, whose tight-lipped thoughts on the situation were nonetheless meaningful.

Two other drivers who have been in a similar situation to Lawson offered their backing, with both Alex Albon and Pierre Gasly having been let go by Red Bull in the past.

“I think that it's not a career-ender for Liam at all,” Williams driver Albon said. “It's how you use this opportunity. He's still young. He's still inexperienced.

“I know Liam. I obviously raced against him in DTM. I know how quick he is and how quick he was in that series. I think he'll bounce back, and he'll be just fine.

“You feel for Liam to a certain point. And I do think that it was a tough start. I think the season as a whole has become so tight now that you can't have these races where you're six, seven tenths off. You can't afford to be that slow.

“And I think it's just a difficult circumstance for him. It's the final year of regulations where the cars have been optimised for their teams, for their drivers.”

Gasly, meanwhile, said: “I wish Liam all the best. I can obviously relate to some things, and I wish Yuki all the best. I think it's very difficult to judge anything from the outside.

""I think only Liam can know his situation and know all the details from it, and [people have] just got to respect that we're trying our best with the tools we have.

“I've got no doubts that both of them are going to do really well, but yeah it's not really for me [to comment on] because you never really know what's going on.""

Lawson is one of six rookies on the grid this season, and it was actually the future of fellow ‘newcomer' Jack Doohan that was the cause for speculation before the start of the year, with Alpine signing Franco Colapinto to a reserve driver deal.

“You know, I had rumours that I wasn't even going to drive before I drove,” Doohan said.

“I think [Lawson] is an extremely, extremely talented driver. And for one reason or another has had a very hard time. But again, only two races. So it's a shame. But I think, to be honest, it's going to be more of a threat at RB than it potentially was at Red Bull.

“It's a cutthroat sport, and especially in that situation, I don't want to comment too much on it. But in a top team especially. This is Formula 1. It's a business where they rely on performances and results. But, you know, he was in a very, very tricky situation and we know how tough that Red Bull is to drive.”

‘Spoon', ‘130R', ‘Hairpin', ‘S Curves'. The corner names at Suzuka have prescriptive, unembellished quality. Except for… Degner.

For a brief time in the 1960s, Ernst Degner was a proverbial thorn in Honda's side, helping Suzuki develop a series of 50cc racing motorcycle engines capable of screaming beyond 17,000rpm, and enabling Mitsuo Itoh to become the first (and so far only) Japanese rider to win the Isle of Man TT. Bettering these pocket rockets was a matter of pride for Honda, a company whose growing industrial might sprung from its founder's fascination with motorbikes.

The 50cc two-stroke racing bikes of the 1960s weighed less than 60kg and were good for well over 100mph, but delivered all their power within a 500rpm band, requiring the rider to Riverdance on the gearshifter, stay tucked in behind the screen and preserve as much corner speed as possible. In the first race after Suzuka opened in 1962 it's said that a random gust of wind blew Degner's front wheel out from under him as he took the sweeping right-hander after the esses (now officially the 'S' Curves).

That corner was subsequently named after him and reprofiled into two discrete radii. But the story of how Degner came to be there as 50cc world champion, with a manufacturer which had been nowhere in racing up until that season, is more fascinating.

Degner was born in what is now Poland in 1931, and grew up in what was officially known, with the typically mendacious nomenclature preferred by despotic regimes, as the German Democratic Republic. He worked as a motorcycle mechanic before discovering he had an aptitude for racing them.

By the mid-1950s he had attained a measure of fame and was co-opted into the MZ motorcycle company's international racing programme – unlikely as such a thing may sound to modern readers, MZ sales outside East Germany were a lucrative source of foreign currency. But Degner earned a standard wage and was under regular surveillance by the East German secret police force, the Stasi. He began to hanker for the lifestyles enjoyed by the people he raced against.

MZ was an unlikely standard-bearer for advanced technology but it was doing so in the unfashionable field of two-stroke engines, which most manufacturers had already abandoned for racing applications. In charge of the programme was Walter Kaaden, an engineer said to have worked at the Peenemuende Army Research Centre where the Nazi regime's V1 and V2 rockets had been developed during World War 2.

Sources differ over Kaaden's role there, but it's also claimed that Wernher von Braun later invited him to leave for the US as part of ‘Operation Paperclip', the secret op in which American intelligence services swooped for the cream of German engineering talent to join its military and space rocket programmes. At MZ, Kaaden would deploy the harmonic analysis techniques once used to finesse the V1 and V2 boost ports and exhaust expansion chambers – and use them, along with other pre-war technologies in the MZ tool chest such as the rotary valve concept, to wrangle ridiculous quantities of power from 125cc motorcycle engines.

By 1961 Kaaden was extracting 200bhp per litre from MZ's 125cc engine and Degner was challenging Honda's Tom Phillis for the world championship. Imagine the contrast between the screaming single-cylinder MZ and the thudding four-stroke parallel twin powering the RC143.

1961 was Suzuki's second year of competition in the 125cc class and it wasn't going well. It is claimed that Degner cut his deal with the company's representatives that summer, in a hotel the MZ team happened to be sharing with Suzuki's – but the principal challenge was getting his family out of East Germany, where they were effectively hostages while he was racing abroad.

An initial plan to spirit them out of East Berlin by train while Degner was competing in the Ulster Grand Prix fell through: 13 August, the day after the TT, was the notorious ‘Barbed Wire Sunday' when the East German government closed the border to West Berlin and began erecting barricades in the streets. Within days the Berlin Wall was under construction.

Come round 10 of 11, the Swedish Grand Prix in mid-September, Degner was on the cusp of winning the championship. He might have got it over the line that weekend had his engine not blown; that night he was smuggled into Denmark with technical documents and engine parts, rather than clothes and a washbag, in a suitcase. Meanwhile in East Germany, a friend was smuggling Degner's family out in a secret compartment in the boot of a car.

That friend would later say he slept with a gun under his pillow for the next 30 years, fearing Stasi reprisals.

Suzuki used the liberated technology to accelerate its own programme, resulting in the new RM62 race bike which Degner then rode to the inaugural 50cc world title in 1962 – before taking his spill at Suzuka. Whether this was scarier than spending the year looking over his shoulder for putative Stasi assassins was known only to him.

Naturally, sources working for the company at the time dispute this account.

Degner earned a substantial cash bonus for his labours, which also led to the development of the RT62 125cc machine and its successors, including the RT67 on which a young Barry Sheene made his name. Given the resources at its disposal, Suzuki would likely have got there anyway, but the internal nuances (such as Mahle's forged alloy pistons) would have been more difficult to copy without technical documentation than external features such as the exhaust pipes.

An arms race developed as the likes of Honda and Yamaha raced to catch up, and two-stroke engines would remain the de facto formula of grand prix motorcycling until the turn of the millennium. By then, though, Degner was long dead: hustling to make up ground after a poor start in a 250cc race at Suzuka in 1963, he dropped it at Turn 2 and the contents of the fuel tank caught fire as he tried to pick the bike up.

Degner required 50 skin grafts and later developed an addiction to painkillers which brought his racing career to a premature end. He died of a heart attack in Tenerife in 1981 – although, as with anyone who has incurred the wrath of a totalitarian regime, unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he had been assassinated…

Degner contributed to the Suzuki on which Barry Sheene made his name. Not this exact one, obviously...

Williams driver Carlos Sainz says he is expecting to adapt to his new Formula 1 car within ""five to 10"" races while he tweaks his driving style.

Sainz joined Alex Albon at Williams after four years at Ferrari and has thus far had two low-key weekends for his new team in Australia and China, grabbing his first point of the campaign in Shanghai after others were disqualified.

A large part of Sainz's deficit to high-flying Albon, who has already scored 16 points, stems from finding it tricky to extract the maximum out of the Williams over one lap, qualifying well behind his team-mate.

Sainz isn't particularly worried by his slower-than-expected adaptation to a new style of car, revealing he has had to unlearn years of muscle memory built up driving vastly different Ferraris, which means he is now having to change his driving style to get the most out of the Williams.

""I was used to a certain type of car at Ferrari which made me end up driving, especially since 2022, in a very specific way to extract everything about that car,"" Sainz explained in Japan. ""You fall into habits in your driving that then you apply to the next car, and it might work in some corners but in other it makes you very weak. That's probably a bit of it and then there's also a side of set-up that can help me drive the way I like.

""I'll be trying some different stuff here with my driving and different compromises with car set-up and see if they work. And if not, it's back to the drawing board, to try different things until we find where that lap time is.""

Sainz said having to fight his instinct and change his driving style yet again at his fifth F1 squad is ""the biggest challenge"" a driver can face, but added he is relishing it so far.

""From a driving perspective, the biggest challenge that you can have is to relearn a bit the way to approach a corner because you have a certain level of muscle memory, and especially under pressure in qualifying you tend to go back to the way you drive,"" the Spaniard said.

""It's something that takes time and lot of effort from a mental and driving perspective, but it's a challenge that I've always enjoyed and managed to get on top of in all my career. I've driven five different cars, different sets of regulations, and probably two races are still not enough to understand that. The car has completely different strengths and weaknesses to the car that I used to be driving for three years.""

Sainz gave a rather philosophical answer when asked how long he believes it will take to get to 100%, but has set the target of getting fully up to speed well before the summer break. ""It depends how far away it is from your natural driving style, and also what you consider as being 100%.

""If your 100% is to close your eyes and you're just naturally quick, then it takes even more than a year to get to that point.

""If your 100% is just to perform at a very high level in Formula 1, which is where I want to get to as soon as possible, that for me should take less than half a year; five to 10 races. And that's what I am expecting and targeting myself to be as soon as I get to different kinds of tracks, surfaces and grip levels.""

Liam Lawson admits he was not expecting to be dropped by Red Bull after just two rounds and will be aiming to prove he belongs in Formula 1 – even if he does not know where his long-term future lies.

The New Zealander has been demoted to Racing Bulls following a disastrous spell at Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda swapping into his seat with the senior team from this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix onwards.

The brutal nature of Lawson's removal from the team has made all the headlines ahead of the third round of the season in Suzuka, where he will once again drive for Racing Bulls having finished last year with the junior squad.

“It is maybe something I wasn't expecting so early but something that obviously is not my decision,” he said.

“For me it's about making the most of this opportunity now and still being in Formula 1, I still have that.

“I think I was more surprised. It's very early in the season and I would say I was hoping to go to a track that I'd raced before and have a clean weekend to have a chance like that.

“But the decision obviously was made when I was told. So, although it was tough to hear, I had one or two days to think about it.”

Lawson revealed the details of how he was informed of the decision to replace him with Tsunoda ahead of a race he was looking forward to following a tough start to the year.

“I had no idea in China. It was something that was decided, I guess, the Monday or Tuesday afterwards. I found out after China, basically. It was, I think, for all of us probably more unexpected, but it was after the weekend,” he said.

“It was more of a done deal [when he was told]. I left China starting preparations for Japan and I had a phone call saying that this is what was going to happen.

“I was looking forward from the start, to be honest, to go to a track that I've been to before just to have a proper preparation.

“I think the ingredients are there [at Racing Bulls] and the main thing is coming here at a track that I've driven as well. I think, hopefully, I slot right in and feel comfortable, but we'll find out tomorrow.”

Lawson is not the first driver to find himself moved from Red Bull to an iteration of their second team, but others had more than two races to show they were worthy of a seat at the top table.

None of the previous drivers to be demoted have ever found a way back to a Red Bull drive and Lawson, twice asked if that now had to be his intention, was keen to remain focused on the here and now.

“I think we know how Formula 1 is and how quickly things change. I mean, if I look back a year ago, I had no seat. I was here a year ago, watching and wishing I was racing,” he added.

“Then I had the opportunity to race at the end of last year and the opportunity then to go to Red Bull Racing. So, a lot has happened in 12 months. So, for me, the main thing is being in a car, and I have the opportunity to prove I belong here and that's what I'll try and do.

“In terms of where my future is. I don't know and, for me, the only way I can control that is by driving fast. I guess that [a Red Bull return] is part of the conversation. I guess in a way that's great, but obviously I was already there starting the season and was focused on proving myself in the team at that point.

“So, look, whatever happens down the line is more or less out of my control. What I can control is the driving stuff to prove that. So, yeah, where the future goes, honestly, at this point, I'm not really thinking about it too much.”

Liam Lawson has opened up on Red Bull's decision to demote him back to Racing Bulls just two races into the season, with the New Zealander admitting that he was “surprised” by the call but now remains determined to prove he “belongs” in the sport.

Following a tough opening two rounds to the campaign – having crashed out in Australia amid treacherous conditions before qualifying in last place for both the Sprint and Grand Prix in China – it was confirmed in the days after Shanghai that Lawson would return to Racing Bulls as of the Japanese Grand Prix, while Yuki Tsunoda would step up to replace him as Max Verstappen's team mate.

Speaking to the media on Thursday at Suzuka, Lawson admitted that he was not expecting a swap to be made at this stage of the campaign.

“Obviously [it's] an opportunity this weekend and maybe something I wasn't expecting so early, but something that obviously is not my decision, and for me it's about making the most of this opportunity now and still being in Formula 1,” the 23-year-old said. “It's been a good week of preparations, so I'm excited to get going.”

Lawson has returned to Racing Bulls following his Red Bull demotion, and was welcomed back to the sister outfit in Japan

Pushed further on whether he knew anything about the decision during the weekend in Shanghai, he added: “I had no idea in China – it was something that was decided I guess the Monday or Tuesday afterwards. I found out after China, basically. It was I think for all of us probably more unexpected, but it was after the weekend.”

And in terms of how the plan was presented to him – and whether it was explained – Lawson answered: “It was more of a done deal, I would say. I left China starting preparations for Japan, and basically I had a phone call saying this was what was going to happen.”

The Racing Bulls driver went on to reflect on how he adapted to the news in the days that followed as he prepares to race at a track he knows well – in contrast to the unknowns he faced in Melbourne and Shanghai.

“I think I was more surprised,” Lawson said of his reaction to the call. “Obviously it's very early in the season, and I was hoping to go to a track that I've raced before and have a clean weekend to have a chance like that.

“The decision obviously was made when I was told, so although it was tough to hear, I had one or two days to think about it. Then I was in Faenza with VCARB [Racing Bulls] starting preparations and seat fits, and then you're basically just focused on the job.

Liam Lawson replaced by Yuki Tsunoda 

“I have the opportunity to still be in Formula 1 and still racing, and that is the main thing for me. I'm excited to be here. It's been a strong start to the season for this team, for VCARB, so I guess it's exciting for me to now come here in this position.”

While Red Bull boss Christian Horner spoke of acting on a “duty of care” for Lawson, the 23-year-old driver insisted that the move has not dented his confidence.

“Confidence-wise it doesn't change a lot – we all have enough self-belief to be here, to make it to Formula 1,” he explained. “To be in the sport if you don't have that self-belief, it makes it very difficult, so I think we all have that naturally.

“It doesn't really change how I feel about myself. I think what it's doing for me… The best opportunity I had felt like [it] was with Red Bull Racing and that's where we're all working towards, that's what I was working towards since joining the junior programme as a 16-year-old, so obviously for me I'm going to feel like I would have liked to have made that opportunity work and that's in my best interests.

“But Christian and the team will have their opinions on what's best, and that's up to them to decide.”

Lawson will pair up with rookie Isack Hadjar at Racing Bulls

And when asked if a potential return to Red Bull could be on the cards one day should he perform well at Racing Bulls, Lawson insisted that his focus is on maximising his current opportunity.

“I think we know how Formula 1 is and how quickly things change,” he conceded. “If I look back a year ago, I had no seat – I was here a year ago watching and wishing I was racing. Then I had the opportunity to race in the last year and the opportunity then to go to Red Bull Racing, so a lot has happened in 12 months.

“For me the main thing is being in a car – I have the opportunity to prove I belong here and that's what I'll try and do, and that's what I do every single time I get in the car and that's what I'll be doing this weekend. Things change very quickly in terms of where my future is – I don't know, and for me the only way I can control that is by driving fast.”

Carlos Sainz conceded the opening weekends of his Williams career have been ‘challenging' as the Spaniard looks to take a step forward for the Japanese Grand Prix.

Sainz moved from Ferrari to Williams over the winter break, making way for Lewis Hamilton at the Italian marque, and looked to get off to a strong start with a particularly eye-catching outing in pre-season testing.

But, while new team mate Alex Albon has registered points in both Grands Prix so far, Sainz crashed behind the Safety Car in Australia and took home a point in China only through the disqualifications of Hamilton, Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly ahead.

Speaking on Thursday at Suzuka, Sainz reflected: “I think it has been quite a challenge, for sure, like always when you change teams.

“You always go through a learning process and an adaptation process that takes time and effort and takes a lot of energy, but I feel like we're on the right track, going the right way.

“I was very quick in Australia, unfortunately, with the problem in the race, but not so quick in China. We hope to understand why, but it was good to go through that experience and now, hopefully, we can put things together and perform better in this triple header.”

The issue of drivers struggling in new teams has been also been further highlighted by the decision of Red Bull to shuffle their pack, switching Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda, with the latter set to partner Max Verstappen at Red Bull for the first time in Japan.

And for Sainz, himself formerly part of the Red Bull family, the adaptation period to a new team is something he knows well as he embarks on the early stages of his Williams chapter.

“You need to give yourself time when you change teams – when you have so many things that you are used to and things are so different,” he explained.

“You need to give yourself time to experience those things and to go through different tracks, different experiences and learn from them.

“That is exactly what I am going through right now and I am going to give myself the time in the next few races to get up to speed. But I think overall, we are on the right track.”

PADDOCK INSIDER: Tsunoda's Red Bull drive is the chance he believed he was ready for – and he'll want to seize it

Yuki Tsunoda has given an insight into the expectations that Red Bull have set out for him ahead of his debut for the team at the Japanese Grand Prix, with the 24-year-old also revealing whether he is hoping for a podium result in front of his home crowd.

After entering into his fifth season for the Racing Bulls outfit at the start of the year, it was confirmed in the days after the second race on the calendar in China that Tsunoda would be promoted to the main squad from Suzuka onwards as Max Verstappen's new team mate, replacing Liam Lawson who returns to the sister team following a tough opening two races.

Asked for his feelings about the weekend ahead during media day on Thursday, Tsunoda responded: “I'm really looking forward to it. It can't be crazier than this [with] this situation, first race in Red Bull Racing but also on top of it at [my] home Grand Prix. I think [it's the] best situation ever. I'm just excited.”

And when pushed on when he found out that he would be joining Red Bull for his home race, the Japanese driver continued: “I can't say specific details. The first call I got was from Christian [Horner] after China, [to] maybe be prepared for things to change a little bit, a bit of a reminder, I guess around Tuesday or Monday.

Tsunoda is preparing to make his Red Bull debut in front of his home crowd at the Japanese Grand Prix

“I was in the UK for preparations for Suzuka with VCARB [Racing Bulls], and plans changed. Immediately I [did] a simulator session with Red Bull Racing, I think at that point it was just in case, and within [the] two or three days I was spending in the UK, he confirmed in person. I can't say when specifically, but that was the kind of timeline.”

While Red Bull moved quickly to make a change following Lawson's struggles, Tsunoda stated that team boss Horner has not given him a specific timeline in terms of how the long the squad will give him to prove himself – and also insisted that he is not feeling the pressure.

“I didn't get any specific races or the time I have to prove [myself],” Tsunoda explained. “He's been so far very supportive and he just mentioned expectations to me on what he wants me to achieve. Pressure will always come once you hit the track, [but] for now [it feels] really relaxing.

READ MORE: Lawson ‘surprised' by early Red Bull demotion as he vows to ‘prove I belong here' amid Racing Bulls return

“[It] feels actually similar to when I was in VCARB. Once I entered the hospitality, I was only thinking about breakfast! I don't so far necessarily feel pressure. I think those things will naturally come – it's a home Grand Prix, and Qualifying I'm sure is going to be hectic.

“There's not much point to feel pressure. I'm feeling confident and I hope I can do it a bit different [compared to] other drivers.”

In terms of what those expectations are that Horner set out for him, Tsunoda added: “Basically be [as] close to Max as possible, which anyway gives a good result for the team [and] also allows the team to support as a strategy as well in the race.

Liam Lawson replaced by Yuki Tsunoda 

“They clearly said the main priority is Max, which I completely understand because he's a four-time World Champion, and so far already [during] the last few races, even in the car's difficult situation, he's still performed well.

“[The expectation is] to be close as much as possible to Max, also help the development as well with my feedback – [they] seem very happy with my feedback I gave in Abu Dhabi [during the post-season test], so just continue that. But I think for now the main priority is to be closest to [Max], which won't be easy, for sure.”

Tsunoda's best finish in Formula 1 to date is a P4 – and while achieving his first podium on his debut for the team at home would be a “dream” result, the new Red Bull driver admitted that this is not necessarily the target.

“That would be great, in the first race, home Grand Prix – that's obviously inside of my head,” he said of the possibility of standing on the rostrum at Suzuka.

“That's what I'm dreaming for rather than a target, to be honest – it will be tough. I'm expecting it to be challenging, it won't be easy. It's such a limited time to adapt, but I'll do my best. If I get through Q3 and score points, I'm happy.”

Formula 1 returns to action this weekend with the Japanese Grand Prix, kicking off a triple header of races. Ahead of the event getting underway at the Suzuka Circuit, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and plenty more.

Free Practice 1 and 2 will take place on Friday, April 4, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, April 5 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, April 6.

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Suzuka is another drivers' favourite and another one that's a lot about flow. Across the first sector in particular there's no real reference points after you ping it into Turn 1.

It's all based on feel from Turns 2 to 7, just gauging the grip and balancing the car right on the edge through all the ‘S' bends which culminate at Turn 7.

PALMER: Why has Lawson struggled at Red Bull?

After that it's the Degners, which are mistake inducing. If you carry too much speed into Degner 1 you will struggle to stop for Degner 2. The hairpin that follows is not so bad; you're braking a bit for the right hander, so you've got to be careful on peak brake pressure.

The second part of Spoon I found tricky, as you're desperate to get on the throttle, and if you go too early it can draw you out onto the kerbing or beyond, and you have to back out and lose time.

130R is easy peasy, and then the chicane is a bit like Spa, maybe a little less dramatic, but you have to round out the lap with a tight sequence, lump a bit of kerb, and it's all about the braking.

“The C1, the hardest compound of the 2025 range, makes its season debut at this the third round, joined as usual by the C2 and the C3,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “That's because Suzuka is one of the toughest tracks on the calendar when it comes to tyres and Pirelli has therefore always selected the hardest trio of compounds.

“Something new for this year is the fact that a large part of the track has been resurfaced, from the exit of the last chicane to the end of the first sector. This is an important section, as it features medium and high-speed corners, some of them long ones, such as the first two after the start-finish straight, where tyres come under a lot of stress.

READ MORE: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix?

“Pre-event simulations, carried out using data supplied by the teams, suggests that lap times will come down thanks to the combined effect of the additional grip from the new surface and the increase in performance from the 2025 cars, which is reckoned will be around the one and a half seconds mark.

“That figure will be checked right from Friday during the first two hours of track activity. Also based on data from the teams, the Pirelli engineers have slightly modified the required minimum start pressures across both axles, with the front coming down by a half psi from 25 to 24.5 and the rear increasing by the same amount from 23 to 23.5.”

In terms of which strategy may prove the most popular for the race, Pirelli add: “There was quite a difference in strategy choices [in 2024], both in terms of the number of stops, with the two-stopper nevertheless proving the most popular, and the order in which the compounds were used.

“In the end, the C1 did the most laps (61% of the total) ahead of the medium (31%) and the soft only doing a short first or final stint, as its performance drop was quite significant.

“Worth noting that, starting on the medium and making only one change to hard, Charles Leclerc managed to make up four places from his grid position, to finish eighth.

“This year with what is on paper a big performance differential between the compounds, a one-stop could prove more complicated, although one must wait and see what influence the newly surfaced part of the track might have, as well as what the temperatures will be this weekend.”

How will the resurfacing of part of the Suzuka Circuit affect strategy choices during the 2025 race?

It has been advantage McLaren so far in 2025, with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri claiming one win apiece in Australia and China respectively, the second of which saw the Woking-based outfit score a 1-2 result to strengthen their lead over Mercedes in the Teams' standings.

Things have not gone entirely their way, however; Piastri's off during treacherous conditions in Melbourne has left him with points to make up if he hopes to catch his championship leader team mate, while Lewis Hamilton's Sprint victory in Shanghai hinted at untapped potential from Ferrari.

The Suzuka Circuit is one that McLaren have performed well at in the past, having taken a 2-3 finish at the event in 2023 – but so has Max Verstappen, the man who beat them to P1 that day and has a total of three wins under his belt at the track. Can the Red Bull driver keep his title defence alive with a strong result?

On the other side of his team's garage, Yuki Tsunoda will make his debut for the squad following the decision to demote Liam Lawson back to Racing Bulls following a tough opening two races for the New Zealander. With Red Bull aiming to reclaim the Teams' crown that they lost last year, can Tsunoda help them to boost their points tally going forwards?

Over at Ferrari, the high that came from Hamilton's Sprint win last time out in China was followed by a nightmare end to Sunday, with both Hamilton and Charles Leclerc being disqualified for separate technical breaches. Losing those points has seen them drop down to fifth in the standings, meaning that a good result will be much needed in Japan.

Elsewhere there is plenty to keep an eye on; Mercedes will be hoping to build on their promising performances from the first two races, while the midfield battle looks to be incredibly close, with only Alpine yet to get off the mark at the bottom of the Teams' standings.

Race Highlights: 2025 Chinese Grand Prix

F1's visit to Japan in 1989 yielded one of the most dramatic moments the sport has ever seen, with title rivals and McLaren team mates Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna banging wheels as they fought over the lead.

Reigning world champion Senna entered the weekend knowing he needed to win at Suzuka and the season finale at Adelaide to have any chance of retaining his world title, with Prost leading the way by 16 points.

Starting from pole position, Senna fell behind Prost as the lights went out and spent the early exchanges trailing by several seconds, but the balance of power shifted as the race developed and a tense battle brewed.

Senna eventually got close enough to attempt a move on Prost, hugging the sister McLaren through the high-speed 130R left-hander and lunging down the inside into the chicane, only for the two cars to make contact.

While Prost was out on the spot, Senna managed to continue, pit for a new front wing and regain the lead. However, after crossing the line to take victory, the stewards disqualified him for missing the chicane as he rejoined the track.

PADDOCK INSIDER: Tsunoda's Red Bull drive is the chance he believed he was ready for – and he'll want to seize it

Max Verstappen believes that Red Bull's focus needs to be on improving their car in order for both sides of the garage to deliver amid the team's decision to swap Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda just two races into the season.

After being promoted to the main team off the back of two super-sub stints for Racing Bulls in 2023 and 2024, Lawson faced a difficult start to his time with the Milton Keynes-based outfit, having crashed during Round 1 in Australia before qualifying at the back of the grid one week later in China.

Speculation soon mounted over the New Zealander's future, and it was confirmed in the days after Shanghai that Lawson would return to Racing Bulls from the Japanese Grand Prix onwards while Tsunoda would step up to Red Bull.

Asked to give his take on the seat swap during Thursday's media day at Suzuka, Verstappen responded: “I've discussed everything with the team, so the team knows what I think about everything, and I think that is enough, to be honest.”

Lawson has returned to Racing Bulls after two races as Verstappen's team mate at Red Bull

In terms of how much support he has offered to Tsunoda in welcoming the Japanese driver to the team, the World Champion said: “At the end of the day, it's not even about that. I've known Yuki a long time because he has been a part of the Red Bull family. It's a very natural progression.

“Everyone always does their very best to be successful in Formula 1 and everyone deserves their chances, and I think the team has been working quite well with him to prepare him in the best way possible to start here.”

“Give him a drink and yeah, he gets really fun,” Verstappen jokingly added of Tsunoda's character. “No, he's a really great guy. He's been in F1 now for a while, he's built up quite a bit of experience. He's very passionate and that's very nice to see.”

Verstappen – who also confirmed that he had spoken to Lawson – was further quizzed on whether he has confidence that Tsunoda can back him up as a team mate and help in terms of strategy going forwards.

Tsunoda is the latest driver to go up against Verstappen at Red Bull

“For me, it's not about that, to be honest,” the 27-year-old commented. “We need to just improve our car and that is where the focus needs to be. That is what I have said also to the team, and that is also what I am working on.”

Verstappen is hopeful that any improvements made to the RB21 will prove beneficial for the whole squad.

“Naturally, I think as a team, you want both cars to use the full potential,” he conceded. “For us, that has been a bit of a difficulty for whatever reason. We always try to do the best we can. I always try to do the best I can as well with my car.

“I will continue to do so, but I think in general we just need to focus on finding a bit more performance from the car, making it a bit more predictable. I think that will help everyone.”

The star and Emma Thompson previewed 'Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie' at CinemaCon, teasing the Amazon feature as ""a bit of a whodunit.""



		By Chris Gardner, Ryan Gajewski 

	April 2, 2025 9:31pm	




Hugh Jackman will soon be in his shepherd era.


	The multi-hyphenate's upcoming film, Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie, got a CinemaCon reveal Wednesday night during the Amazon MGM Studios presentation inside the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.




	Jackman and co-star Emma Thompson appeared in a video segment during the event to tease the film. “It was, as you'll see from the clip, the most fantastic, loving, beautiful idea, this synthesis between animals and people,” she said.

	Added Jackman about the film Kyle Balda directed from Craig Mazin's script: “Craig Mazin's wit is just second to none.”

	The footage from the movie included, unsurprisingly, plenty of sheep. “The movie is a bit of a whodunit, which is always fun,” Jackman said in one behind-the-scenes clip. “The movie has such heart.” 


	Directed by blockbuster animation director Balda (Minions, Despicable Me 3) from a screenplay by The Last of Us guru Mazin, the story finds Jackman playing George Hardy, a shepherd who loves his sheep and raises them only for their wool. Every night he reads aloud a murder mystery, pretending his sheep can understand but never suspecting that not only can they understand, but they also argue for hours afterward about whodunit.


	When George is found dead under mysterious circumstances, the sheep realize at once that it was a murder and think they know everything about how to go about solving it. The local cop Tim Derry, played by Succession star Nicholas Braun, on the other hand, has never solved a serious crime in his life, so the sheep conclude they will have to solve it themselves — even if it means leaving their meadow for the first time and facing the fact that the human world isn't as simple as it appears in books.


	The cast also includes Nicholas Galitzine, Molly Gordon, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bryan Cranston, Chris O'Dowd, Regina Hall and Patrick Stewart, with Hong Chau and Thompson. The film is based on the novel Three Bags Full by Leonie Swann, originally published in 2005.


	Working Title's Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner are producing with Lindsay Doran of Three Strange Angels. Executive producers include Sarah-Jane Wright, Amelia Granger, Aditya Sood, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Tim Wellspring and Tyson Hesse.

	











Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie is set for release in theaters on Feb. 20, 2026.


	CinemaCon, the annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios, is hosted in Las Vegas by the newly rebranded Cinema United, which for decades was known as the National Association of Theatre Owners. This year's edition runs from March 31 to April 3.

Nicholas Galitzine is seen hulking up in a sizzle reel as a filmmaker praises his prep, “He is transforming.” 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	CinemaCon got a major first look at Masters of the Universe.


Amazon MGM Studios took the veil off the anticipated film from director Travis Knight by showing off a sizzle reel of the cast and creative collaborators on set, offering the first time they've been seen in their costumes. The views that hit the big screen featured massive London sets with intricate backdrops, swords and accessories and He-Man in his full blonde glory with his hair blowing in the wind.




	The film based on the popular toy line — from Mattel Films and Escape Artists — stars Nicholas Galitzine as He-Man, Camila Mendes, Alison Brie, James Purefoy, Morena Baccarin, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson and Charlotte Riley, with Jared Leto (as Skeletor, not shown tonight) and Idris Elba (who was shown in his costumed glory). Plot details have not been revealed though it's known that Knight is directing from a screenplay by Chris Butler based on a story by Aaron Nee, Adam Nee and Dave Callaham.

	Knight, Galitzine and Mendes kicked off the sizzle, recorded from the London set, as they took turns explaining that they are teaming to create an “epic” movie with characters to set the scale. Knight explained that his passion for the universe dates back to childhood or “pretty much my entire life.” So much so that he “lived and breathed” the story and once even had a He-Man haircut.


	The reel featured many of the filmmaker's creative team, including producer Jason Blumenthal, who said the project marks a “rebirth of this incredible world,” adding that “the scale is massive.”


	Set pieces that were shown included the planet Eternia and He-Man's iconic Sword of Power as well as character costumes. “We're not making a cartoon here, we're making a live-action fantasy film,” the filmmaker said. Other shots showed Galitzine's rigorous training that included sword play and weight lifting. “He is transforming, it is amazing to watch,” Blumenthal praised. The reel closed with a close-up of Galitzine in his He-Man garb with the blonde locks that drew cheers from the crowd.


Masters of the Universe is scheduled to hit theaters next summer on June 5, 2026. Mattel launched the Masters of the Universe franchise with a line of action figures in 1982. A year later, an animated series He-Man and the Masters of the Universe premiered in syndication and was followed by video games and other merchandise.

Canada Bureau Chief


	Comedy artist Naomi Watanabe has signed with UTA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners for representation in all areas.


	The comedian, actor, voice actor, model and fashion icon is looking to expand on the international stage in English-speaking film, TV, comedy and elsewhere by nabbing U.S.-based representation.




	Watanabe debuted as a comic in Japan in 2007 and quickly made waves with her lip-synching impersonations of Beyoncé singing “Dreamgirls” and “Crazy in Love.”  With her celebrity impressions showcasing her comic and acting chops, Watanabe eventually moved to New York City to break into the U.S. comedy scene.

	











	In 2021, the comedian produced and hosted the comedy podcast Naomi Takes America, which was followed by a seven-city comedy show tour. In 2024, she also hosted Stand Up with Naomi Watanabe at the Gramercy Theater, where her debut English language comedy performance for one night only sold out both performances.

	As a social media powerhouse, Watanabe is a notable influencer in the fashion and beauty space, having signed global partnerships with brands like Adidas x Ivy Park, Gap, Savage X Fenty, Fendi, and Hugo Boss. She also launched her own streetwear clothing line, Punyus.


	Watanabe continues to be managed by Grace Chen of Graceful Media, and is also represented in Japan, where she remains a major celebrity, by Yoshimoto Entertainment.

As the sixth and final season lands on Hulu, THR's chief TV critic reflects on how the dystopian series was shaped by the first Donald Trump presidency — and how it hits differently during the second.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	In March, a Texas midwife was arrested for allegedly performing illegal abortions (and practicing medicine without the appropriate license). She became the first health care provider criminally charged in the aftermath of Texas' 2022 abortion ban.


	The arrest prompted horror and instigated one of left-leaning social media's favorite doomscrolling games: declaring that each new diminution of rights and bodily autonomy proves that we have gone from figuratively living in The Handmaid's Tale to more literally transitioning toward a Gilead-like nation.

					Trump Tariffs Timing Couldn't Be Worse for Hollywood		
			









	The timing, then, is perfect — or perfectly awful — for Hulu‘s The Handmaid's Tale to return for its final season, nearly two and a half years after the fifth season concluded with Elisabeth Moss‘ June and Yvonne Strahovski's Serena aboard a refugee train heading for Alaska or Hawaii or anywhere but the inhospitable terrain of Toronto or Boston.




			Related Video		







	Perfect — or perfectly awful — timing has always been the sweet spot for The Handmaid's Tale, a series that both benefited and suffered more from circumstances outside its control than any in recent memory. A confluence of real-world events and fictional choices contributed to the show being hailed as prescient, celebrated by critics and awards givers and worming its way into the vernacular in a way that far exceeded the reach of its revered source material. At the same time, the show's topicality sometimes hit so close to the bone that it became difficult to watch.


The Handmaid's Tale premiered in April 2017 as Donald Trump was settling into the presidency, and it's going to end in May 2025 as Donald Trump is settling back into the presidency. That sort of temporal tidiness is inevitable for a show that has been treated more like a cosmically symbolic text than a mere piece of television. The Handmaid's Tale was science fiction that people confused with documentary. Depending on your perspective, it was the Oracle of Delphi or it was Cassandra; it was either a strident cautionary tale or a limp warning to shut the barn door long after our personal liberties had gotten loose.


	In my first review of the series, adapted by Bruce Miller and directed in its stunning early installments by Reed Morano, I pondered an alternate reality in which Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election and The Handmaid's Tale was “merely” a speculative thriller (featuring some of the best cinematography on TV and carried by Elisabeth Moss, cementing her position as Peak TV's most essential performer).

	











	Margaret Atwood's dystopian allegorical novel didn't over-explain the U.S.' descent into fascist theocracy and thus left itself open to interpretation — so open that even American conservatives were able to claim it as a warning about Muslim fundamentalism. (It wasn't.)


	But the simultaneous arrival of the TV series on the small screen and Trump in the White House precluded textual flexibility. The show lost the power of the hypothetical and gained the precarious responsibility of the actual. Instead of leaving it to viewers to spot smoke on the horizon and find their own meaning in the inferno, it plunged us into the fire. Every federal or state restriction on abortion access or every limitation on female health care caused fatalists to say, “SEE?!?” and deniers to sigh, “Stop being hyperbolic … every Trump Supreme Court nominee has said that Roe v. Wade is settled law, so that will be our levee.”


	Atwood didn't need to spell things out, but real-world factors forced Miller and company to feel that pressure. So Gilead became less and less a looming Anyplace, Anytime and more and more a concrete attempt to respond to and keep up with our own paradigm-shifting junta.


	Narratively, The Handmaid's Tale was so deep in the Trumpian mire that even when Trump decisively lost the 2020 election, there was no opportunity to imagine or reflect any resumption of liberty tied to a Biden presidency. The reception of the fourth season was colored by the lingering resonance of the Jan. 6 insurrection, by the still vivid image of American landmarks being desecrated by costumed citizens. The fifth season, then, premiered in the noxious contrail of the Dobbs decision, which silenced those who believed a 1973 Supreme Court case could serve as a permanent finger in the political dike.

	











	Rewatched from a limited distance, that fifth season might have been the show's freest and most forward-looking. The shifting of action to Canada broadly presaged our current diplomatic crisis with our neighbors to the north as the series imagined a situation in which the friendly Canadian veneer might finally shatter. The reason for Canada's anti-American (anti-Gilead, but that's a distinction without a difference in the show's universe, and maybe ours) sentiment in season five is almost the opposite of what's driving Canadian fans to boo our national anthem at sporting events. But the souring of a special relationship on the show is, in retrospect, eerily resonant. At the time, it felt like we were more than two or three years from Canada getting sick of American bullshit. We should have known better.


The Handmaid's Tale has been so bleak for so long that I began watching my season-six screeners without knowing what to expect. This isn't a show that has ever been heading toward a happy ending, and as Trump and Musk and Co. race to erase any trace of Biden/Obama/Clinton policy, even a mildly hopeful ending runs the risk of making the series as Pollyannaish as the “It can't be Gilead, because Roe v. Wade is still in place!” optimists.


	The eight of 10 episodes sent to critics largely examine which adversarial characters will be capable of introspection and regret and which will be stuck in self-justification. Bradley Whitford's Commander Lawrence remains convinced that the Gilead he helped construct was a viable response to economic and environmental conditions and that its extreme overcorrections can be fixed. Ann Dowd's Aunt Lydia clings to her belief that her cruelty toward her red-cloaked charges offered them their best chance of survival. Strahovski's Serena, who spent last season being forced into her own version of subservience, continues to prioritize her personal salvation — boosted by potential love interest Commander Wharton (excellent guest star Josh Charles) — even when, time and again, she's given every opportunity to leave Gilead behind.

	











	Meanwhile, June and her rebels insist there's a single dramatic action that will turn the tide and provoke a conclusive revolution, but you know the show doesn't believe that's possible, so it settles for smaller, if less interesting, avenues of resolution, like the love triangle with Max Minghella's Nick and O-T Fagbenle's Luke.


The Handmaid's Tale is still more than capable of nightmarish images and emotionally potent sequences. Moss has become perhaps the series' finest director (albeit one in need of an editor willing to trim five to 10 minutes per episode) in addition to anchoring a still powerful cast. But even as The Handmaid's Tale nears its end, Hulu has announced casting for a follow-up series, The Testaments, based on Atwood's 2019 sequel set 15 years later. Viewers and pundits alike will have to brace themselves for the inevitability that, like the real world it's sure to mirror, it will not be the stuff of comedy.

High-flying execs are dropping like flies right now — at Amazon MGM, and possibly at Warner Bros. — turning what was once the most coveted job in Hollywood into one of the riskiest. 



		By Peter Kiefer, Borys Kit 

	April 3, 2025	




	While it seems unlikely that any corner of the entertainment industry will be spared from being skewered during the 10-episode run of Apple TV+'s new satirical comedy series The Studio, the primary vehicle by which its creators interrogate the current malaise afflicting Hollywood is through the eyes of a modern-day studio executive. Like any great satirist, Seth Rogen, who plays an angst-ridden studio chief, is dancing — at times hilariously — around an IRL question: Has there ever been a more challenging and unpleasant time to be a studio executive than today? 

	











	It's undoubtedly a question that former Amazon MGM Studio chief Jen Salke was asking herself March 27 when she was pushed out after seven years on the job. It's also likely one that Warner Bros. Pictures co-heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy are mulling as they try to swat away rumors that they might be next. And it was on the minds of the dozen current and former executives who spoke to The Hollywood Reporter to vent about their profession.

	Legendary — and legendarily busy — executives like Irving Thalberg, Robert Evans and Sherry Lansing are mythologized, but even on the best of days in the best of times, the life of an executive is grueling. There is endless incoming material to read and assess, and the job requires constantly finding new ways to say “no” gracefully to stay on the good side of vengeful agents and fragile talent. Execs are juggling those challenges while negotiating the internal cutthroat politics of their departments, all while trying to pick winning projects amid a sea of mediocrity. And that's on a good day.


	“It used to be a spectacular job — you could give a voice to people who deserved one, and you knew you were making something meaningful that would be seen and talked about,” says Adam Goodman, the former president of Paramount Motion Picture Group who got his start working as a production assistant on films produced by John Hughes. During his time at Paramount, Goodman oversaw a diverse slate of films including Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol, World War Z and Paranormal Activity. “Now, it feels as if there's no real reward for taking big bets or championing a favorite script or an unknown filmmaker,” he says. “You're more of a brand manager than a creative advocate and playing it safe seems like the smarter career move.” 

	











	Pervasive risk aversion and an obsession with existing IP is just one of the complaints that emerged from interviews with executives who've seen their ranks gutted over the past five years. At the traditional studios, incessant demands from Wall Street to show growth, coupled with the demise of the traditional windowing model, has placed outsized expectations on every film, causing a flight to risk-averse conformism, according to multiple sources. “You're going to either win big or lose big and there's nothing in between,” says one source. 


	Streaming, meanwhile, has bifurcated the nature of the modern-day executive, creating a fundamentally different structure with its own unique rules and incentives that differ from those that apply to executives who work at a traditional studio or network. Executives at the deep-pocketed streamers have their own challenges: How does one make a film stand out on a platform bursting with content? What, exactly, constitutes success? And perhaps most importantly, after years of consolidation, who, if anyone, has any actual power at these places?


	“I had more power as a junior a decade ago than I do now,” complains one exec. “There are so many layers of bureaucracy.”


	De Luca and Abdy present arguably the most illustrative case study in the travails of the modern-day studio executive. The central criticism of their nearly three-year tenure is hardly new. De Luca has long embraced the role of the maverick. As a 27-year-old president of production at New Line Cinema, he championed Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher. While much of the town remains transfixed by existing IP, De Luca and Abdy have been hiring such filmmakers as Ryan Coogler (Sinners), Anderson (One Battle After Another) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (The Bride) to tell original stories, despite having a rich library from which to draw.


	The knock against them at this moment of industry-wide austerity is that they've overspent to the point of being reckless. The creative bets that they've placed — big, high-profile and expensive bets — just haven't paid off. Joker: Folie à Deux, which netted director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix $20 million paydays each, flopped so badly that it's become a punchline. Over the past month, Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17 and The Alto Knights drastically underperformed and could cost the studio more than $110 million (to be fair, Alto Knights was a project championed by Zaslav). 


	Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal's take on The Bride of Frankenstein starring Jessie Buckley and Christian Bale, originally set up at Netflix before the streamer balked at the proposed budget, is costing somewhere in the $80 million to $100 million range. One Battle After Another, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, cost $160 million, according to sources, but industry insiders suggest that that figure could be low. Anderson's highest-grossing film to date is the 2007 period drama There Will Be Blood, which earned $76 million worldwide. Coogler's Sinners, a supernatural horror thriller, also blew past its initial budget of $80 million, according to two insiders.

	











	At a Morgan Stanley event on March 4, Zaslav acknowledged the spending and defended the strategy. “In some cases, we may have overspent,” he said. “I don't think we did, because we wanted to bring the best and the brightest people back to Warner Bros. It's key for us at HBO and Max.”


	It's not hard to find supporters of De Luca and Abdy across the industry. “Going out and finding great scripts and empowering some of the world's best directors to tell those stories seems like exactly what a studio chief is supposed to be doing,” said a top talent agent who was openly wondering what the point of an executive is if their mandate is to simply mine libraries for existing IP. “What value are you actually adding?” this agent asked. (Ironically, De Luca and Abdy's fate might hinge on how Minecraft, with IP harvested from one of the best-selling video games of all time, performs during its opening April 4-6 weekend.)


	There are more subtle ways in which the lives of your mid-level studio exec are impacted by today's climate. With fewer projects being made, almost every studio and streamer is placing a greater emphasis on packaging, which also puts execs in a tricky spot. On one hand, a packaged project typically comes through the door with several desirable pieces of talent in place, whether it's a director, actor or showrunner, and that provides a sense of security for the greenlight committee. 

	











	But for the executives assigned to oversee the project, there's often less of an opportunity to creatively shape the project. Top-tier packaged projects often trigger bidding wars, prompting costs to soar, which puts more pressure on the now-sidelined executive to deliver a successful project. “You have less leverage to make adjustments, and so you have to be more wily and more strategic about how you can effect change,” said a film executive at one of the top streamers.


	To be clear, we're not talking about British coal miners here. there's still an immense amount of privilege and creative opportunities that come with the job. “This will change. You don't need to get suicidal. But it will take some time to cycle through,” says one veteran exec when asked about the current malaise of having to constantly chase IP at a moment of distress across the industry. “Even while being in an existential crisis, it's still an awesome job. You still get to work on made-up stuff all day long.”


	While it's contemporary, The Studio paints today's industry with a nostalgic brush. Whether it's the score, the vintage cars or the lush offices and architecture, the show hearkens back in subtle ways to a bygone era. And who can blame Rogen and his co-creators for the indulgence? Watching executives' queue at a Tesla charging station or file into their cramped, barren offices doesn't suggest an industry that cares much about style and taste or that's having much fun. This isn't Severance, although some of the most disillusioned executives might opt for a consciousness splitting procedure that could ensure they retain no memories of how difficult their job has become. 

	











	With three episodes of the show now available, executives are already noticing eerie parallels to events that occurred in their own careers. In the opening episode, Rogen's character is faced with a classic creative dilemma: put his chips behind a mass-market movie based on a corporate icon – in this case the Kool Aid man — or pursue a high-art Scorsese-directed passion project about the Jonestown massacre.


	Seven years ago, in the wake of the animated film The Emoji Movie and a Smurfs film, a senior executive at Sony pitched an idea. It was at one of Tom Rothman's weekly Big Idea meetings where execs were expected to come in with, well, a big idea. “Tom, I've got it!” said this executive, according to a source who was present. He pitched a movie based on M&Ms. A full-length feature built around colorful candied characters. For a beat, Rothman sized up the exec and then bluntly dismissed it as a terrible idea. “It was an idea that was laughed out of the room,” said this source.


	As you take in The Studio, remember to breathe deeply and remind yourself: it's just a show.

Senior Entertainment Reporter


Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri brought the tense first trailer from their new thriller After the Hunt to CinemaCon. 


Luca Guadagnino joined his castmembers to tease the Amazon MGM Studios film that also stars Julia Roberts and hits select theaters Oct. 10 before expanding the following week. Hailing from Imagine Entertainment, After the Hunt focuses on a college professor (Roberts) who is forced to confront her own dark past when a prominent student (Edebiri) makes an accusation against one of her colleagues (Garfield).

	“I've wanted to work with Luca for 15, 20 years and finally we've gotten to do it,” Garfield told the crowd. He called Guadagnino's work “sumptuous, sensual and life-affirming.”

	Edebiri added, “This is a movie that's built to see with other people to talk about and discuss and just feel.”


	The trailer shows Edebiri coming to Roberts to confide in her. “He crossed the line,” Edebiri says of Garfield's character. “He kept going after I said no.”


	In a later scene, Garfield tells Roberts, “I told her I suspected she plagiarized.” He went on to refer to the student as “this lying little fucking bitch.” 


	The trailer ends with Edebiri telling Roberts, “I don't feel comfortable having this conversation with you anymore.” Roberts responds, “Not everything is supposed to make you feel comfortable.” 


	Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny round out the cast.


	Guadagnino helmed the movie from a script by Nora Garrett. Serving as producers are Guadagnino, Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody and Allan Mandelbaum. Imagine's Mandelbaum brought the script to the production company and worked with CAA to land Roberts and Guadagnino.


After the Hunt reunites Guadagnino with Amazon MGM Studios, which released his Zendaya-led film Challengers last year. His other features as director include Call Me by Your Name (2017), Suspiria (2018), Bones and All (2022) and Queer (2024).


	Roberts' recent film credits include the Universal romantic comedy Ticket to Paradise alongside George Clooney and last year's Netflix thriller Leave the World Behind, which co-starred Mahershala Ali and Ethan Hawke.


	CinemaCon is the annual event for exhibitors and Hollywood studios that runs this year from March 31 to April 3. It is presented by Cinema United (formerly the National Association of Theatre Owners).

Shows behind MAYHEM will bring Gaga around the world and back, eyeing more than $100 million in concert grosses in 2025. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



Last week (March 26), Lady Gaga announced dates and venues for The MAYHEM Ball, marking her first tour in three years and the sixth such “ball” of her career, dating back to 2009's The Fame Ball. With ticket sales rolling out this week (beginning March 31), Billboard estimates that the tour could land as her fourth trek to gross $100 million.


	An ever-expanding slate of shows have pushed Gaga's 2025 projections from the brink of $100 million to surging toward $125 million. But firm estimates for The MAYHEM Ball are tricky, because much in the spirit of Lady Gaga, the 2025 routing zigs where she has previously zagged. To use figures from her most recent outing – $5.6 million and 41,700 tickets per show on 2022's The Chromatica Ball – would be to ignore the nuances of this year's schedule.


	The MAYHEM Ball winds Gaga through arenas in Europe and North America, following warm-up dates at Mexico City's Estadio GNP Seguros and Singapore's National Stadium (plus a free show in Rio de Janeiro) – at least as much as stadium shows can serve as a warm-up. It's a swerve from the all-stadium routing on The Chromatica Ball, not to mention her theater residency in Las Vegas from 2018-24.


	Upon the tour's announcement, Gaga took to social media to celebrate her upcoming calendar. “We chose arenas this time to give me the opportunity to control the details of the show in a way you simply can't in stadiums – and honestly, I can't wait.”


	Not only has Gaga oscillated from intimate theaters to football stadiums, but The MAYHEM Ball re-introduces some markets that she hasn't played in decade, while foregoing some of the sold-out cities from her recent treks. Her shows in Seattle and Manchester will be her first proper concerts in those cities in 11 years. More dramatically, those stand-alone stops in Mexico City and Singapore will be her first since The Born This Way Ball in 2012.


	Time is also a factor. Since Gaga's last mostly-arena tour in 2017-18 (The Joanne World Tour), she has starred in three major-studio films, one of which won her an Academy Award for songwriting, plus a nomination for acting. She also released Chromatica and MAYHEM, both of which topped the Billboard 200 and spawned Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s, in addition to two jazz albums and the chart-topping soundtrack to A Star is Born.


	Just as key, the concert business has undergone major transformation, first shutting down entirely for more than a year due to COVID-19 and then returning bigger than ever with skyrocketing ticket prices.


	While recent projections for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter Tour were simple enough, carrying over many of the same venues from her previous tour just two years ago, the shape of The MAYHEM Ball is all its own.


	Using the average ticket price from the markets that do carry over from The Chromatica Ball, and average-to-high capacity from each venue's recent history, this year's initial routing would be headed toward $80-85 million from about 700,000 tickets sold. A 15% rise in ticket prices would push the projected gross beyond $90 million and a 25% increase would clear the $100 million mark.


	Those bumps consider the way that ticket prices have risen beyond the rate of inflation since her 2022 tour. And while The Chromatica Ball did take place after the post-COVID return as prices were already on the rise, tickets for six of its 20 shows were sold primarily in the (barely) pre-pandemic era, as the then-limited tour was first announced on March 5, 2020, just a week before venues were forced to close.


	Notably, as Gaga undergoes a relative downsizing from stadiums to arenas, supply-and-demand could drive higher prices than on The Chromatica Ball, with far fewer seats available each night. Including multiple shows in certain locations, her 2025 schedule includes just six cities in the U.S. and Canada. That's slightly less than eight for Chromatica, and much tighter than 35 on The Joanne World Tour and 33 on ArtRave: The Artpop Ball (2014). She makes up for it with multiple shows everywhere, including six at Madison Square Garden. Much like Beyoncé's upcoming trek, sales could be even more competitive as fans from surrounding cities flock to Chicago, Miami, and New York, among few others.


	Momentum behind The MAYHEM Ball and its international spin-offs has already gathered, with early demand forcing extra shows in those three markets plus a handful of others. Originally 38 shows, Gaga's current slate of 50 ticketed dates is likely to surpass of The Chromatica Ball's stadium-sized $112 million, potentially making it Gaga's biggest year on the road since 2012. 


	Isolating the proper tour's arena run, The MAYHEM Ball should approach the $100 million mark, possibly becoming Gaga's forth tour to crack the nine-figure mark. It'd follow The Monster Ball (2009-11), The Born This Way Ball (2012-13) and The Chromatica Ball. The Joanne World Tour earned $94.9 million before cancelling its last 10 shows due to Gaga's struggle with fibromyalgia. Plus, the Lady Gaga Enigma + Piano & Jazz residency brought in $110 million from 2018-24.


	Dating back to her first reported headline show at San Diego's House of Blues on March 12, 2009 ($18,500; 1,000 tickets), Gaga's tours have grossed $723.1 million and sold 6.4 million tickets from a reported 462 shows.

""I'm always down to do something unexpected, and The Masked Singer let me just go out there and play. That's what it's about.""

The Masked Singer pulled off one of its biggest surprises of the season during Wednesday night's (April 2) “Boy Band Night” episode, revealing rapper, actor, and Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man as the celebrity beneath the Stud Muffin costume.

	The reveal came after Stud Muffin delivered a smooth and cheeky rendition of Bell Biv DeVoe's “Poison,” complete with coordinated choreography and a clue package that hinted at his ties to hip-hop, brotherhood, and birthday shoutouts from BBD themselves. Clue deliveries during the episode came from Masked Singer alums Omarion (B2K) and Wayne Brady, the latter calling Method Man his “travel buddy.”

	“I had fun with it,” said Method Man, whose real name is Clifford Smith, Jr. “I'm always down to do something unexpected, and The Masked Singer let me just go out there and play. That's what it's about.”


	Panelist Rita Ora had been adamant in her guess from Stud Muffin's first appearance, and her celebration after the unmasking confirmed she'd been waiting for the win. “I knew it was you!” Ora exclaimed. “Your voice is so distinct — and you moved like a pro!”


	The reveal drew gasps from the judges, with Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong both shocked by Method Man's commitment to the disguise. 


	Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg floated guesses like MC Hammer and 2 Chainz earlier in the night, while Thicke aligned with Ora in the final moments.


	The Wu-Tang legend is just the latest high-profile name to appear on season 13 of The Masked Singer, which has leaned into music nostalgia and heavy guest star cameos this year. Method Man's appearance follows the show's recent nods to boy band royalty like NSYNC's Chris Kirkpatrick and B2K's Omarion, both of whom joined the panel this week to dish out clues.


	Best known for his iconic role in Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man has also had a prolific career in acting and production, with credits spanning How High, The Wire, Power Book II: Ghost and beyond. His last solo album, Meth Lab Season 3: The Rehab, dropped in 2022 and featured collaborations with Redman, Jadakiss, and KRS-One.


	Season 13 of The Masked Singer continues next Wednesday with the Group C finals. As for Method Man? He's officially out of the oven.

In his annual State of Music Publishing address on Wednesday (April 2), David Israelite covered a range of hot-button issues.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) president/CEO David Israelite joined the Association of Independent Music Publishers (AIMP) to give his annual State of Music Publishing address on Wednesday (April 2) at Lawry's in Beverly Hills. In his speech, Israelite discussed hot button issues for publishers, including Spotify bundling (“we are still at war”), AI concerns, PRO reform and more.


	Israelite started by sharing the NMPA's data on the revenue sources for songwriters and publishers. It found that songwriters and publishers earn 45% of revenue from streaming services, 11% from general licensing and live, 9% from traditional synchronization licensing, 8% from mass synch (licenses for UGC video platforms like YouTube), 8% from radio, 7% from TV, 4% from labels, 2% from social media, 1% from sheet music, and 1% from lyrics. The NMPA says that 75% of its income is regulated by either a compulsory license or a consent decree, while the remaining 25% is handled via free-market negotiation.


	On the AI front, Israelite explained that the NMPA is actively watching and supporting pending legal action.

	“We have not filed our own lawsuit yet, but I can promise you that if there is a path forward with a productive lawsuit, we will be filing it,” he said. As far as trying to regulate AI through policy, Israelite added, “We're doing everything that can be done.” The NMPA is participating in both a White House initiative and a Copyright Office initiative, but he added, “If you are waiting for the government to protect your rights and AI models, I think that is a very bad strategy.” 


	Instead, Israelite said that the “most emphasis” should be placed on forming business relationships with AI companies. “When that date comes [that AI companies are willing to come to the table to license music], I believe the most important principle is that the song is just as valuable, if not more, than the sound recording in the AI model,” he continued.


	During the speech, Israelite said he had a recent conversation with “the CEO of one of the major AI companies” who told him that “by far, the song [as opposed to the sound recording] is the most important input into these models. I tell you this because I am fearful that as these models develop, if we do not protect our rights, we will find ourselves in a situation where we are not getting as much or more than the sound recording when it comes to revenue…that is a responsibility of this entire community to fight for that.”


	Israelite added that his “number one problem when it comes to revenue is how we are treated with these bundled plans,” pointing to publishers' ongoing issues with Spotify. Last year, Spotify added audiobooks into its premium tier offerings and began claiming those tiers as “bundles,” a term referring to a type of subscription that qualifies for a discounted rate for music. Spotify claimed that it now had to pay to license both books and music from the same subscription price and subsequently started paying songwriters and publishers about 40% less for music, according to the NMPA. At the time, Billboard estimated that this would lead to a $150 million reduction in payments to publishers in the next year, compared to what publishers would have been paid if the tiers had never been reclassified.


	In January, news broke that Universal Music Group (UMG) and Spotify had forged a direct deal that gave UMG's publishing arm improved terms, effectively minimizing the harm caused by the previous year's bundling change. Shortly after, Warner Music Group (WMG) followed suit with its own direct deal with Spotify for improved publishing remuneration. “I know in this room in particular, there is a great concern about what those market deals mean for the whole industry,” Israelite says. “I want to be very clear about this. I believe those market deals are a good thing, but until everybody benefits from the same protections about how bundles are treated, we are still at war. Nothing has changed.”


	Israelite added later that UMG and WMG's direct deals could be cited as “evidence” to support the publishers' position during the next Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) fight, which will determine the U.S. mechanical royalty rates for publishers in the future. The CRB proceedings begin again in 10 months, and Israelite estimates his organization will spend $36 million in the next trial to fight for the publishers' position. While he often noted that “we shouldn't be in this system in the first place” during his address, Israelite conceded that despite his calls for a legislative proposal that would give publishers and writers the right to pull out of the 100-year-old system of government-regulated price setting for royalties, the “brilliant idea” is “next to impossible to accomplish.”


	Israelite went on to detail all the ways the NMPA and others are still fighting back against Spotify over the bundling debacle. He noted that the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) “is doing a fantastic job of continuing the fight” against Spotify, adding that its lawsuit, which was dismissed earlier this year by a judge who called the federal royalty rules “unambiguous,” has “been revived.” He added, “[It's] our best chance of getting back what we lost.”


	Elsewhere in his speech, Israelite told the crowd of independent publishers that the NMPA has now sent three rounds of takedown notices to Spotify for various podcast episodes, citing copyright infringement of its members' songs, and that “over 11,000 podcasts have been removed from Spotify” as a consequence.


	The recent calls for performing rights organization (PRO) reform are also top of mind for publishers in 2025. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, requesting an examination of PROs, citing two areas of concern: the “proliferation” of new PROs and the lack of transparency about the distribution of general licensing revenue. This spurred the Copyright Office to take action, opening a notice of inquiry that allows industry stakeholders to submit comments, sharing their point of view about what, if anything, should be reformed at American PROs. However, some fear that the notice of inquiry could lead to increased regulation at the PROs, further constraining publishing income.


	Israelite addressed this by giving publishers a preview of the NMPA's forthcoming comments. “I will tell you today exactly what our comments are going to say,” he said. “It is very simple. Music publishers and songwriters are already over-regulated by the federal government. Congress should be focused on decreasing regulation of our industry, not increasing regulation of our industry, and to the extent that any of these issues are substantive issues. This should be dealt with between the PROs and their members. It has nothing to do with the Copyright Office. It has nothing to do with Congress. It has nothing to do with the federal government.”

Fulton Country prosecutors have alleged ""escalating threats and witness intimidation"" as the basis of their request.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



	The Fulton County District Attorney's Office has requested that Young Thug's probation be revoked, according to a motion filed on Wednesday (April 3).


	Thug (whose real name is Jeffery Williams) ended a lengthy criminal trial in October 2024 when he pleaded guilty to charges leveled against him. The case, built around Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law, claimed that Thug and his alleged YSL gang had committed murders, carjackings, drug dealing and many other crimes.

	At the conclusion of the trial, Thug was sentenced to 40 years with five to be served in prison commuted to time served. As a result, he was given 15 years probation, with a further 20 to be commuted if successfully completed.




			Trending on Billboard		







	However, a new motion has been filed in Fulton County Superior Court which has seen the State of Georgia request Whitaker revoke Thug's probation, alleging that his “continued presence in the community under probationary supervision presents a clear and present danger to public safety and undermines the rule of law.”


	Per Channel 2 Action News, the crux of the filing revolves around what prosecutors have labelled “escalating threats and witness intimidation.” They note that Fulton County Investigator Marissa Viverito is in the process of testifying in a “multi-defendant gang murder preliminary hearing” which has seen the Court order witnesses not to be shown on television while testifying. However, a user on social media posted an image of Viverito online with a caption stating, “She doesn't want to be shown on screen? Well, here she is.”


	On Tuesday (April 1), Thug is alleged to have shared a since-deleted repost the image, pairing it with a caption claiming “Marissa Viverito is the biggest liar in the DA's office.” According to the filing, the post “quickly went viral,” resulting in over two million views, and resulting in “direct threats to Investigator Viverito and her family.”


	The filing also claims that as a result of Thug sharing the post, the home addresses of Vivirito and her parents were distributed online, with one post reportedly sharing an image of Vivirito's mother's house and stating, “If the hate is really real then pull up on her mama crib.” Another post is alleged to have been shared later which threatened the assassination of District Attorney Fani Willis.

	











	“The escalation from targeting a testifying witness to making a direct death threat against the elected District Attorney of Fulton County is a grave and unprecedented attack on the justice system,” the filing stated.


	In response to the probation revocation request, Thug shared a statement on his X (formerly Twitter), writing, “I don't make treats to people I'm a good person, I would never condone anyone threatening anyone or definitely participate in threatening anyone. I'm all about peace and love.”


	The filing alleges that the behavior is a “calculated campaign of intimidation, harassment, and misinformation designed to undermine the legal process,” and have requested the Court take “swift and decisive action by revoking the Defendant's probation and remanding them into custody without delay.”


	Currently, no hearing date has been set. Meanwhile, Thug is scheduled to give his first performance following his trial in June as part of Chicago's Summer Smash Festival.

	In the 2018 clip, The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) wanders an empty road at dusk, before bats explode from his head at the chorus. “So call out my name/ Call out my name when I kiss you so gently/ I want you to stay,” he sings in the hook.

The musician said he's gotten endless complaints about the score for the current season of the Max murder in paradise series.

	Cristóbal Tapia de Veer is checking out of The White Lotus. Permanently. The show's composer told The New York Times that he is leaving after the current season following a string of creative disputes with show creator and director Mike White. “I feel like this was, you know, a rock 'n' roll band story,” Tapia de Veer told the paper about the disagreements. “I was like, ‘OK, this is like a rock band I've been in before where the guitar player doesn't understand the singer at all.'”

	And while he's just now speaking out, Tapia de Veer said he's been having creative conflicts with White since season one, as well as conversations with producers he described as verging on “hysterical” amid their reported requests that he make his themes more “upbeat and less experimental.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	He described announcing to the creative team a few months ago that he was not coming back, but not telling White for “various reasons… I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock or whatever,” he said. Asked how White responded, Tapia de Veer said the show runner “says a lot of things” that he can't really talk about at the moment, then described the situation as being like a scene from the 1978 French drag comedy La Cage Aux Folles.


	“You know how there's Albin, which is like the star, and there's Renato, who is the producer who is always taking care that Albin doesn't lose his mind about something, because Albin is the diva and Renato is the guy who is trying to make everything work,” he said. “To me, the show felt very much like that.”


	He also said when he got the script for the first season he thought it was very “well-written,” but given the comedic, “reality TV kind of vibe” he thought it didn't fit his typically “super dark and edgy” musical vibe.


	“But when we had the talk with Mike, I just told him in a joke that I thought we could do some kind of ‘Hawaiian Hitchcock,' and he really grabbed on that and he started laughing,” Tapia de Veer said, adding that White's original temporary score had a “chill, sexy” Ibiza club vibe with “literally no edge to it” that felt like “nice background music.”


	The Chilean composer who has won three Primetime Emmys for his work on the series about rich people behaving horrendously in paradise also discussed the vitriol he's received from fans about “Enlightenment,” his radical, percussion, accordion and handclap revamp of the show's theme song for the current Thailand-based season that has been very divisive.

	











	For the record, Tapia de Veer said he loves his season three theme and was hoping the current run — which ends on Sunday (April 6) — would at some point include a longer version he'd written that would elide back into the more recognizable, fan-favorite melodies from the first two seasons. As for what direction he was given for this season, Tapia de Veer said there was none, so he began experimenting with a collection of Thai gongs, a Thai violin called a saw u and an Italian accordion his mom sent him that he didn't know how to play.


	The original plan, Tapia de Veer said, was to bring back the apparently beloved “ool-loo-loo-loo” vocalizations form the first two seasons in a longer version of the season three theme, “because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway.” He told a producer about that plan and that person thought it was a good idea. But then, he said, White cut the extended edit. “He wasn't happy about that,” Tapia de Veer said. “I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything.”

	Oscar winner Meryl Streep is in talks to play Aslan the Great Lion in Greta Gerwig and Netlfix's Narnia movie, we have confirmed with sources.


	We understand that they're not quite at the offer stage yet, however. 


	In the novels, Aslan is a talking lion who serves as Narnia's guardian and a guide for the human children. Generally portrayed as a male, Aslan was created as an allegory for Jesus by author C.S. Lewis.


	Nexus Point News was first with the Streep talks and also reported that the film will adapt the sixth novel in the Narnia series, The Magician's Nephew, which chronologically takes place first in the series. The novel tells the origin of Narnia and is centered on Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer, who discover the magical world through Digory's uncle's magic. The site reports that Aslan will be female in the Gerwig adaptation. We haven't had those plot details confirmed yet.

	











	As we previously revealed, Charli XCX is in talks for the role of the white witch and Daniel Craig is also being courted for the project, which is aiming to shoot this year. Nexus Point News reports that Craig is being eyed for the role of Digory's uncle.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In 2018, Netflix said it would develop new series and film projects based on Lewis' beloved The Chronicles of Narnia series and brought Gerwig on board in 2020 to adapt and direct the first movie. As previously reported, the movie is getting an exclusive two-week Imax global run for Thanksgiving 2026 in advance of the pic's drop on the streamer.


	The project is Gerwig's follow-up to delivering Warner Bros its highest-grossing movie ever, Barbie ($1.44 billion).


	Three-time Oscar winner Streep is coming off hit series Only Murders in the Building but hasn't starred in a movie since 2021's Don't Look Up. We reported last fall of her attachment to a series version of hit novel The Corrections and there was reporting in 2024 that she would return to make The Devil Wears Prada sequel this year.


	Netflix and Streep's reps declined comment.

Amazon MGM Studios is getting down to work on Bond.


	Courtenay Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical, and global marketing chief Sue Kroll, said Wednesday night that producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are currently in London moving forward with a new 007 at long last.


	Valenti called the duo “filmmaking legends.” After paying up to gain creative control of the franchise, Amazon MGM recently brought them on to produce the next 007 installment.


	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” she said. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”

	The big step forward on Bond was made possible by a deal in February with longtime James Bond producers and creative masters Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, who relinquished control of the beloved spy franchise and handed the reins to the new owners.


	Amazon acquired the studio in 2022 for $8.5 billion. That included all its IP. But the Bond franchise was unusual as it remained creatively the domain of Wilson and Broccoli, who had declined to move ahead on anything new since the merger.


	The e-commerce giant paid out another $1 billion to gain creative control. As part of the deal, Amazon and the producers formed a new joint venture to house the Bond intellectual property rights, with Broccoli and Wilson remaining co-owners of the franchise.

	The very pressing question mark remains the new James Bond himself. Despite years of wild speculation about who might replace Daniel Craig, there have been no substantive updates, although it now seems that will have to change.


	The Bond update arrived at Amazon MGM's debut at CinemaCon, the annual gathering of theater owners in Las Vegas. The studio is ramping up its theatrical slate to 16 films in 2027 and building out a global distribution arm.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	The Travis Knight-directed take on Masters of the Universe showed off a behind the scenes reel at CinemaCon this evening, and let's just say, it's no where near as campy and cheesy as the 1980s movie with Dolph Lundgren. After Red One, this is clearly a big tentpole for Amazon MGM Studios with a big summer date of June 5, 2026.


	The pic stars Nicholas Galitzine as wavy blonde He-Man, Camila Mendes as Teela, Alison Brie, James Purefoy, Morena Baccarin, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson and Charlotte Riley star, with Jared Leto and Idris Elba.


	This is clearly the first tentpole take of the Mattel property with many of the characters, i.e. Teela, Man at Arms, Skeletor, looking exactly as the toys and then some. God knows when the studio will drop the reel, but we catch Jared Leto as Skeletor, Camila Mendes training on jump wires and running sideways, and Galitzine in full sword swinging mode. The BTS reel showed the massive castle sets being built with plenty of green screens.

	Plot details have been under wraps for the Escape Artists and Mattel Films production. However, in the 1980s toy line and early 1980s cartoon series, Castle Grayskull is the target of numerous attacks by Skeletor, Hordak and the Snake Men, all of whom believe the secrets inside will allow them to conquer Eternia and the entire universe, thus becoming the Masters of the Universe. The castle is instrumental in the transformation of He-Man.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Val Kilmer's Greatest Love Was an '80s Icon","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/val-kilmers-romances-and-great-loves/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:26:43 GMT","

Despite romancing some of the world's most beautiful and intriguing women in the 1980s and 90s, Val Kilmer hadn't been in a relationship for quite a while at the time of his death at 65. He admitted in his memoir, “I'm Your Huckleberry,” that he hadn't “had a girlfriend in 20 years. The truth is I am lonely part of every day.” 

A sensitive, romantic soul, Kilmer loved fiercely, which led to several heartbreaks. Despite this, it's rare to find an ex of his who doesn't look back on their time together fondly.

“I've always found women infinitely more interesting than men,” Kilmer wrote. “Perhaps that's why we've always gotten along. We are big oafy elephants … and they are butterflies.” 

His first serious relationship was with St. Elmo's Fire actress Mare Winningham. After a strange dream in which she was kissing someone else, he drove 300 miles to see her.

“Then, just as in my dream, coming out of the dark woods, I saw Mare and this boy kissing,” he wrote. While they broke up, the two remained friends.

Kilmer's next big romance was with Cher, who said on The Howard Stern Show that she “was madly in love” with him. While he didn't think they'd have anything in common, he said she was “funny, hysterically funny.” The two dated and laughed together for over a year and stayed close for the rest of his life. When he found out he had throat cancer, he was visiting Cher at her house.

While Kilmer was still dating Cher, he found himself in London. He went to see the play The Genius and was immediately smitten with the lead actress, Joanne Whalley. He went to the show numerous times to get a glimpse of her but was too shy to speak to her. 

Kilmer dated gorgeous, fascinating women such as Ellen Barkin and Carly Simon in the following years. Then, he signed on to star in Willow and was astonished when Whalley walked in to audition. 

“Even now as I see the aspiring actress walk into the room to read the lines, my heart beats as loudly as it beat three decades ago,” he wrote. Within a year, they were married. 

While he and Whalley would go on to have two kids, Mercedes and Jack, before she filed for divorce years later, Kilmer felt foreboding the first couple of years. “I knew in my heart that our marriage would not last,” he wrote. “I ascribe fault to no one. I now see it as a matter of fate.”

After splitting from Whalley, he met Cindy Crawford, who he fell head over heels for. “I thought I could have died from her love, not because it was difficult but because its delight was simply too much to bear,” he wrote. 

Several years later, he worked with Angelina Jolie on Alexander. “When people ask me what Angelina Jolie is like,  always say she's like other women and other superstars, but just more,” he declared. After their relationship ended, he met Jaycee Garnet Gossett. 

“Jaycee and I embarked on a three-year love affair that lives in my body-mind like nothing else,” he wrote. “She was a real-life angel, and she was up for anything, as long as it was good for the soul.” Kilmer blames his immersion in the role of Danny Parker in The Salton Sea for the relationship's demise. 

“I let the character of Parker swallow me whole, and I was miserable, desolate, without a single sparkle in my eye,” he wrote sadly. “In honor of the project and in honor of art, I let Jaycee slip away.”

For Kilmer, Daryl Hannah was elevated above all else. 

“She was kind of the female me, except better,” he wrote in his memoir. He considered her an equal to everyone and was amazed at her positive demeanor. Despite his many romances and relationships, his breakup with Hannah devastated him more than any other.

“Those kind of rip-your-heart-out relationships that had become so normal for me were just no good anymore,” he wrote. 

Kilmer claimed that he cried every day for six months after they broke up for good but tried to stop when he realized he didn't want his kids seeing him like that. “In some ways, Daryl felt like the end of that whole piece of my personality,” he wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","90s Con: Highlights from the Popular ‘Scream' Panel","https://entertainmentnow.com/chills-and-thrills/90s-con-scream-panel/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:36:15 GMT","

The fourth annual 90s Con in Hartford, CT has come to an end. Stars like Joey Lawrence, Jennie Garth, AJ McLean from the Backstreet Boys, Carnie Wilson from Wilson Phillips, Soleil Moon Frye, and many more were in attendance spilling tea and sharing memories about their beloved hits. Here's what I saw and heard from “Scream” cast members David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Dermot Mulroney, and Skeet Ulrich.

The convention saved one of the most popular panels for the grand finale of the weekend: “Scream.” The franchise's male stars walked on stage to big applause from a packed ballroom at the Connecticut Convention Center. Ulrich first gave a heartfelt speech to the fans before the panel kicked off, stating, “We always like to start these with a little ‘thank you' to each and every one of you who has taken time out of your lives… to come here.” He continued, “It's really beautiful to see… how loving you all are, how supportive of us obviously that you are, but really, we're very grateful for who you are, and for the love you've shown to us, and we hope that in some way you've received it from us. We really try out hardest to share our gratitude for you during this weekend.” 

Ulrich then jumped into the crowd and walked around giving high-fives to many, prompting Lillard to request, “Please do not grab his butt.” Lillard soon joined the crowd as well, handing the mics directly to fans for their questions, which is a rare sight at these events. No wonder fans love the two of them. 

One audience member asked Lillard the big question about his involvement in the highly anticipated “Scream 7.” Lillard turned serious and said, “I'm very excited and slightly terrified to be back… I hope I don't F it up for everyone.” The crowd of course applauded with encouragement. He also got honest about his life, stating that he was an obese teenager with a learning disability before he made it, and added, “The duration that we've had in this business is a luxury. The hardest part is to keep going.”

When a fan asked Lillard to do the “Give It To Me Baby” dance he did in 1999's “She's All That,” it seemed for a split second that he would go for it. He then quickly declined, shouting, “I'm almost 60 years old! No, I will not do that! Security!”

Another question for the cast was, “What was your favorite moment to shoot?” Arquette, famous for playing lovable cop Dewey in the franchise, declared that his favorite scene from the original 1996 film was with Courteney Cox, who he was married to from 1999 to 2013. During the last act of the movie, Dewey and Cox's character Gale jump back from a speeding car of teens and roll onto the ground in each other's arms. The director Wes Craven “gave me the sweetest direction: ‘You're going to look at her like you've been looking for her your whole life.'” Arquette gave a little laugh as he shared that tender memory. According to In Touch, Cox was instrumental in having Arquette mysteriously return in the forthcoming “Scream 7.”

Lillard's favorite to make was filming the intense final sequence of the film, the big climax, which took three weeks to shoot. “It was crazy to shoot,” he remembered. “A lot of energy.” Meanwhile, Mulroney, who played Detective Bailey in the sixth film, and currently stars in TV series “Chicago Fire,” declared with a laugh that his favorite to shoot was (spoiler alert!) his death scene. He mentioned that he was excited when he got the call to join “the most successful horror franchise of all time,” and quickly asked his agent if he was going to be working with Arquette, who he's known since he was 16 years old. Sadly, no scenes together in that one!

When someone asked if the actors took anything from set, like a piece of wardrobe or prop, Arquette educated the crowd a bit. “You can't take much really from set in case there are reshoots,” he stated. “They catalog everything, so you don't want to mess up the continuity.” However, Ulrich took his character Billy's boots, which made the crowd happy. Lillard didn't take a physical thing, but he got the girl, at least for a little while! He admitted that he had originally auditioned for Billy, but of course didn't get it. Ulrich followed up with, “You didn't get that part, but you did get with Neve Campbell!” Lillard and scream queen Campbell dated briefly in 1997 while she was filming “Scream 2.”

As the panel was coming to a close, a fan asked the classic question from the franchise, “What's your favorite scary movie?” Ulrich went first with recent horror film “When Evil Lurks” from Argentina, praising the shocking visuals. Mulroney shouted out “The Stepfather” from 1987, praising star Terry O'Quinn, and also plugged his other horror franchise sequel “Insidious: Chapter 3.” Arquette went the classic route, sharing his love for Stanley Kubrick's 1980 hit “The Shining.”

Kennedy, who played fan favorite Randy Meeks in the first three “Scream” films, gave an answer much like his character would. He couldn't pick just one: “The Exorcist,” “Halloween,” “Friday the 13th,” and “Scream.” His co-stars were shocked he forgot an iconic line his character says in “Scream 2,” which prompted him to remember: “Oh! And ‘Showgirls!'” Lillard wrapped the question up nicely, stating that “Scream” is his favorite scary movie, adding, “It changed my life as my college experience.”

In his final words, Lillard gave a rousing closing speech about how fans can truly support them and other performers. “Follow artists and creators on social media, since that really makes an impact and it's where decisions are made.”

Despite gracing magazine covers, writing best-selling books, and signing a massive new talent deal with HGTV in January 2025, “Home Town” stars Erin and Ben Napier still don't feel like they're famous. 

“It's been very cool to get to meet people who are actually famous,” Erin said on the April 2 edition of the “Landontalks With Kate” podcast. “Like, we're not — I don't think of us as famous people. But we have met people who are and you see the way their life looks is very different from ours. Yeah, it's so, so, so very different from our life.”

While comparing their life in Laurel, Mississippi, to the lives of those they view as true celebrities, the Napiers spilled some fascinating tidbits about several down-to-earth stars who've become their real-life friends.  

A post shared by Landon Bryant (@landontalks)

While chatting with Laurel native Landon Bryant, author of the new book “Bless Your Heart: A Field Guide To All Things Southern,” and his wife Kate, the Napiers said one of the differences they've noticed between themselves and “actual” celebrities is how they navigate childcare for their two daughters, seven-year-old Helen and three-year-old Mae. 

“This is the thing that we talk about a lot,” Ben explained, “and it is a struggle for people we work with to understand because they're like, ‘Oh, well, just call a nanny service' or ‘this or that,' right? Well, that doesn't exist (in a small town).”

“Yes, we have Mimi, who was my babysitter when she was 16,” Erin chimed in. “And when I can't be with my babies, she's with my babies.”

“If she goes down, the whole thing goes down,” Ben interjected, and Erin added, “Then people are like, ‘Well, I mean, just call a nanny service if you need backup. And it's like, ‘What is that?'”

Despite the obvious differences between living in a small town versus the bright lights of Los Angeles or New York, the Napiers said they have become friends with multiple down-to-earth celebs. Erin has talked previously about how nervous she was meeting Drew Barrymore on her talk show in 2021, and said she continues to be someone she adores. 

“I was her biggest fan growing up,” she told the Bryants on their podcast. “I mean, in high school, she was everything. And so, she's the only, like, famous person I've been very star struck to meet. And then I met her, she was just so wonderful. And she will periodically send me a text to say, like, ‘Watching this episode, and I love that wallpaper!'” 

Erin recalled how Barrymore helped her procure a gown in 2023 when she and Ben were asked at the last minute to present at the CMA Awards. 

“She's extremely generous,” Erin said. “That dress that I wore to the gala and CMAs, it was because she got it for me. She's just a super big giver. I think she knows exactly how blessed she's been, and she wants everyone else to get the blessing.”

“When you watch her show,” Ben added, “that's who she is.”

Speaking of generous celebrities, the Napiers also gave high marks to fellow HGTV stars Drew and Jonathan Scott, whose branding agency is now helping the Napiers expand their product lines. 

“Drew and Jonathan Scott are two of the nicest people alive,” Erin gushed on the Bryants' podcast. “I put them in the same camp as Drew Barrymore. They want everyone around them to be comfortable. They're wonderful.” 

Of Jonathan's fiancée, actress Zooey Deschanel, Erin said, “Zooey is fantastically hospitable. We went to their house for dinner one night, and she had like, 16 kinds of ice cream sandwiches in her freezer. It's like, ‘Gluten-free! Chocolate! You want vanilla? I got strawberry!'”

The night Erin mentioned was likely an impromptu pizza party the Napiers enjoyed with the Scott brothers and their families in March 2023, during a trip to L.A. Ben shared that once the Scotts knew they were in town, they quickly coordinated a dinner at Jonathan and Zooey's home, where there was no shortage of pizza either. 

“It was like 16 kinds of pizza,” Erin recalled as she gabbed on the Bryants' podcast. “(Zooey's) like, ‘I didn't know what kind you would like, so I just got, like, a lot of different kinds.' Anyway, they're a match made in heaven. They want everyone to be so comfortable.” 

The totally-not-famous Napiers are in the throes of filming the ninth season of “Home Town.” Their spin-off series, “Home Town Takeover,” airs Sunday nights on HGTV.

Nathan Fielder is trying to solve the commercial aviation crisis, one role playing scenario at a time. The comedian centers his series “The Rehearsal” Season 2 on building an entire world complete with an airport, fake pilots, and a staged plane crash. The trailer for the viral HBO comedy series “The Rehearsal” interrogates whether Fielder's meta “Rehearsal” character really is as altruistic as he seems…or if like Icarus, is flying too close to the sun.

“The Rehearsal” returns for its second season three years after the series debuted in 2022. Season 2 was teased in 2024 as part of the HBO slate for this year. The six-episode second season continues creator/star Fielder's quest to aid others in milestone moments. The series “follows one man's journey to reduce the uncertainties of everyday life. With a construction crew, a legion of actors, and seemingly unlimited resources, Fielder helps ordinary people prepare for life's biggest moments by ‘rehearsing' them in carefully crafted simulations of his own design,” as the description reads. “In season two, the urgency of Fielder's project grows as he decides to put his resources toward an issue that affects us all.”

IndieWire previously deemed Season 1 of “The Rehearsal” to be the “best show of 2022.” Critic Ben Travers called the series “a grand HBO experiment” that achieved “next-level entertainment,” with  Fielder's “search for answers holding the first season together, and the resolution he comes to that makes this ‘complex emotional experience' so rewarding.” Fielder was celebrated by IndieWire in 2023 at the IndieWire Honors for co-creating Showtime series “The Curse” with Benny Safdie.

Fielder is the star, writer, director, and executive producer of the series. Additional writers include Eric Notarnicola, Carrie Kemper, and Adam Locke-Norton. The show is executive produced by Eric Notarnicola, Dave Paige, and Christie Smith and Dan McManus for Rise Management. “The Rehearsal” is co-executive produced by Kris Eber and Carrie Kemper, with Adam Locke-Norton producing

“The White Lotus” Emmy-winning composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer has officially exited the series amid a dispute with creator Mike White. Tapia de Veer told the New York Times that a clash about the Season 3 theme song was in part the catalyst for the decision to leave the buzzy show. 

White wanted “background music … a song that is more like something you would listen to in Ibiza, in some clubby place with a chill, sexy vibe,” according to Tapia de Veer, which did not have the same sound as the previous two other season theme songs. 

 










“I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give [audiences] the longer version with the ‘ooh-loo-loo-loos,' because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway,” Tapia de Veer said. “He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that — he wasn't happy about that.”

Tapia de Veer later released the cut, though, as included below. As for Tapia de Veer's partnership with White, that fell to the wayside. “I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything,” Tapia de Veer said of White objecting to the longer theme song. 

And so Tapia de Veer quiet quit: “I announced to the team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving,” Tapia de Veer said. “I didn't tell Mike for various reasons; I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock and whatever. Except I told the whole editorial team and music editor and producer and all that, but I didn't think that they were going to tell him. At some point he heard about that.”

Tapia de Veer compared working on “The White Lotus” to the 1978 French film “La Cage aux folles,” saying, “You know how there's Albin, which is like the star, and there's Renato, who is the producer who is always taking care that Albin doesn't lose his mind about something, because Albin is the diva and Renato is the guy who is trying to make everything work. To me, the show felt very much like that.”

“The White Lotus” was also akin to a “rock 'n' roll band story,” with White and Tapia de Veer clashing. “I was like, OK, this is like a rock band I've been in before where the guitar player doesn't understand the singer at all,” he said.

 










IndieWire has reached out to HBO and representatives for White for comment.

Elijah Wood was basically Frodo for free. The “Lord of the Rings” alum didn't shy away from admitting that he did not have a “massive” salary for the iconic trilogy that grossed almost $3 billion at the worldwide box office. “The Lord of the Rings” was first released in 2001, with all three films being shot back-to-back. 

“Because we weren't making one movie and then renegotiating a contract for the next, it wasn't the sort of lucrative scenario that you could sort of rest easy for the rest of your life,” Wood told Business Insider while at the 2025 Texas Film Awards. Wood noted that New Line Cinema took a “real gamble” filming all three movies simultaneously without knowing how the first would fare at the box office. To mitigate financial risk, the ensemble cast was offered “not massive salaries,” as Wood said.

“The benefit of that was that we were also signing up for something that was going to be a part of our lives forever,” he added.

Wood's co-star Cate Blanchett, who starred as Galadriel in the franchise, previously quipped during “Watch What Happens Live” that “no one got paid anything” to do the films. Wood now said Blanchett's comment was “hilarious,” saying, “Statements like that are not made with any kind of ire. It's such an honor to have been a part of those films and they represent some of the best experiences of my life.”

Wood also confirmed that he did not make the same amount as co-star Sean Astin, who played Samwise Gamgee; Astin was quoted as saying he was paid about $250,000 for the films. 

Fellow “Lord of the Rings” alum Orlando Bloom also said in a 2019 interview on “The Howard Stern Show” that he was paid just $175,000 for all three movies to star as Legolas. 

As for the franchise itself, Andy Serkis is directing “The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum” for an expected 2026 release. There is no word yet about casting, although Blanchett did say she would be open to reprising her role…probably for a bigger salary, though.

Riding high off “Challengers,” Luca Guadagnino is teaming up again with Amazon MGM Studios for “After the Hunt,” a tense drama and thriller starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri, and Andrew Garfield.

In what was Amazon MGM's first presentation at CinemaCon, Guadagnino, Edebiri, and Garfield took the stage at the Colosseum to present the trailer for the film ahead of the movie's release on October 17, 2025. 

The film follows Roberts as a college professor who is caught up in a political and personal crisis when one of her star pupils (Edebiri) accuses one of her fellow professors of an act of abuse. Let's just say it was a pretty tense experience, one that grapples with the culture wars and generational divide in the post-#MeToo era in fascinating ways.

Garfield referred to Guadagino as “a radical artist” and that it was a “dream come true to be directed by a living master,” someone who had a “gift for exploring the complexity of what it is to be human.”

Nora Garrett wrote the screenplay for “After the Hunt,” which also stars Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny.

“Challengers,” the sexy and tantalizing tennis film starring Zendaya, Josh O'Connor, and Mike Faist, grossed $96 million at the worldwide box office. Like that film, “After the Hunt” reunites Guadagnino with composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the score.

Amazon MGM in its presentation trotted out a mess of stars and touted films including “Project Hail Mary” with Ryan Gosling, “Mercy” starring Chris Pratt,” “Crime 101” with Chris Hemsworth and Halle Berry, and many more films. Prime Video chief Mike Hopkins told the crowd of exhibitors that it intends to reach 15 films a year by 2027 and already has a slate of 14 set up for 2026. “After the Hunt” is one of its biggest titles to come in 2025.

“After the Hunt” is one of many upcoming projects that Guadagnino fans can look forward to. The Italian auteur is also attached to direct an “American Psycho” remake for Lionsgate and a “Sgt. Rock” movie for James Gunn and Peter Safran's DC Studios at Warner Bros.

Amazon MGM Studios kicked off its first CinemaCon slate with something truly big, the first look at “Project Hail Mary,” Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's sci-fi epic starring Ryan Gosling.

In the extended trailer that opened Amazon MGM's presentation, Gosling plays a middle school teacher brought in to help stop the sun from dying, ultimately forcing him to embark on an impossible quest into deep space, farther than anyone has ever gone, in order to keep not just the Sun from dying, but also every other star in the galaxy. Suffice it to say, he's reluctant, telling Sandra Hüller that he puts the “not in astronaut.”

 










The trailer has incredible outer space effects and shows him meeting an alien, who Lord described as Rocky, “the most lovable alien since E.T.”

The film is based on a best selling book by “The Martian” author Andy Weir, and the film represents Amazon MGM's increasing commitment to theatrical. The studio stated that it intends to release 15 films by 2027 (studio head Mike Hopkins said it already has 14 films slated for 2026).

Gosling, Lord, and Miller took the stage at the Colosseum to talk about the film, saying that everything is still a work in progress and that the “effects are not done.” Gosling added that it made the CinemaCon crowd the “first people in the world to see anything from ‘Project Hail Mary' that aren't my mom.” 

Gosling and the directors also touted the film as a truly big experience, joking that they used PLFs as their monitors and that “we tried to put it on a TV once, it doesn't fit.”

“Project Hail Mary” is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and written by Drew Goddard. In addition to Gosling and Hüller, it stars Milana Vayntrub and James Ortiz. The film hails from executive producer Amy Pascal, who recently moved her first-look deal to Amazon MGM in a move that will separately see her share control of the James Bond franchise with Harry Potter veteran David Heyman. 

Amazon MGM Studios is releasing “Project Hail Mary” in theaters on March 20, 2026.

Try to organize all the emo subgenres into a flow chart and you'll either give yourself a headache or run out of room. For simplicity's sake, it's best to split emo into two halves representing key influences on the genre: punk and indie rock. (Don't make me tap the sign.) Vancouver quartet water margin is a clear-cut example of a band born from the former, and their official introduction, Gleaming Cursed, leaves no room for mistaking their suave evolution from that starting point. An astonishingly self-assured debut, it builds off the emo and post-hardcore of 1990s forebearers without resorting to filler or redundancies.

After growing up on a steady diet of Drive Like Jehu, Fugazi, and Unwound, water margin's members—singer-guitarists Geordon Gaskill-Cadwallader and Jean-Michel Lacombe, bassist Armand Paxad, and drummer Patrick Williams—looked beyond those bands' cultivated mystique to instead learn their distinct language: thick, rolling bass tone pushed up in the mix; guitars that jab at each other like fencers; drum patterns that shift downbeat placements and smooth drumrolls into one trilling whole note. In repeating it back, however, water margin don't crib from their heroes or namecheck for clout. Instead, their songwriting and stylistic flair is naturally in conversation with the past. Take the extended breakdown of “Cryptogoth,” where they so carefully reintroduce instruments, one caustic guitar riff and flailing drum fill at a time, that the single could easily be mistaken for a lost Jade Tree 7” that Numero Group would scramble to reissue.

Across nine songs, water margin invoke hallmarks of the genre's underground scene: the muscular guitar melody of “Plague Runner” is so John Reis-coded that Spotify algorithms could mistake it for Hot Snakes; the stilted pauses in “Tiger Ward” recall the Van Pelt's looming moods; both “Palisades” and “Shy of Merit” ebb in tempo like the cautious moments of heftier Jets to Brazil or Jawbox songs. Even better, two of water margin's most prominent influences are fellow Canadians: Their unremitting bass lines evoke those by the short-lived and underrated Ottawa post-hardcore '90s trio Shotmaker, and their ambitious punk hollering could fit on Outer Heaven by the defunct 2010s Toronto greats Greys. It's as if water margin burned their own emo greatest-hits CD in 1999, let the blazing sun melt it on the seat of their Chevy Corsica, and swirled a distilled version of that liquid plastic into nine original songs made of sleek tungsten.

Recorded by Mariessa McCleod in Vancouver, with Jack Shirley mixing and mastering in Oakland, Gleaming Cursed softens its gnarly post-hardcore sound by pulling Gaskill-Cadwallader and Lacombe's vocals to the front of the mix. The two share lead vocal duties on every track, operating at a near-constant exchange of verses, bridges, and double-tracked choruses. As they sing, yell, and occasionally speak into the microphone with a foreboding deadpan, the duo's worries sound fanged and impossible to avoid. The fact that Gaskill-Cadwallader and Lacombe gravitate towards similar vocal ranges makes the tradeoffs tricky to follow. When the differences do reveal themselves, you start to feel slightly off balance, like looking at a split version of yourself from all angles in a carnival's hall of mirrors.

Both Gaskill-Cadwallader and Lacombe write oblique lyrics whose fractured phrases and isolated images ask the listener to decode what, exactly, binds them all together. Given the urgency and panic of their vocal deliveries, erring on the side of melodrama while interpreting is understandable. Is “Two Eggs” a treatise on gender-affirming healthcare (“Transition in the presence of someone else... Ain't it great to be alive?”) or a diatribe of the brokenhearted (“True love competition/In a war of words without weight/Bittersweet victory”)? Is “Moon House” mocking capitalism run amok (“Come take my hand brother/We'll bathe 'em all in startup light”), mourning trampled Indigenous land (“Build a monument to stolen grit/But the bones are piled waist high”), or something else entirely? The deeper you listen, the less certain you are, but that obscurity is part of emo's early era anyway—a cryptic allure that water margin revitalize in the present day.

Stefan Kozalla is a peerless figure in a crowded field. Once the enfant terrible of Hamburg's Golden Pudel club, the German producer made his name in the early aughts with an idiosyncratic take on the bold colors and broad strokes of storied minimal-techno imprint Kompakt. He released one of the subgenre's definitive late-period records on his own label—which became a fantastical sandbox for friends and fellow weirdos—then transcended it entirely on 2018's Knock Knock, one of those Technicolor albums that renders real life sepia-toned by comparison. “It's less competition to make music without the dancefloor in mind,” DJ Koze mused on a recent Resident Advisor podcast. “Not without reason, you have all these military terms: ‘You killed it!' ‘It's a weapon of mass destruction!' ‘It's a bomb!'” Rather than scaling EDM's steep cliff face, he's burrowed into it, carving out a hermitage in the stone.

That's not to say there haven't been setbacks. The enthusiasm around Hit Parade, the 2023 LP Kozalla made with art-pop matriarch Róisin Murphy, cratered when transphobic remarks posted to the singer's personal Facebook page were made public. Koze didn't share an official statement at the time, but I can't help but hear the first words spoken on his new album, Music Can Hear Us, in that context: “I would like to start with a quote from Rumi: ‘Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,/There is a field. I'll meet you there.'” Hit Parade was supposed to be his star-making moment as much as Murphy's, the final stage in a transmutation from eccentric dancefloor wizard to global pop savant. It's taken a couple extra years, but Koze has finally arrived: Music Can Hear Us is a giddy collision of good taste and what John Waters called “good bad taste,” brought into harmonious coexistence by an artist whose greatest asset is his inextinguishable supply of curiosity and childlike wonder.

Following its brief foray into Sufi theology, seven-minute album opener “The Universe in a Nutshell” unfolds like a guided meditation as whorls of trilling violin and wordless hums sprout from a reverberant tabla pattern. Koze layers glockenspiel, chimes, and all manner of whimsical noise, but in his typically pranksterish fashion, the track culminates not in a beat drop—there are few to be found anywhere on the record—but with a harpsichord riff descended from the Brothers Johnson's cover of Shuggie Otis' “Strawberry Letter 23.” Like the cut-up Beach Boys stylings of Panda Bear, this is pop music whittled down to just the best parts, a box of Lucky Charms that's only marshmallows. “Tu Dime Cuando” pulls off a similar sleight of hand, conjuring a phantom bolero out of Sofia Kourtesis' sing-songy hook.

Music Can Hear Us lays out DJ Koze's panculturalist ethos clearer than any of his prior studio releases, island-hopping from wispy echoes of son Cubano (“A Dónde Vas?”) to Japanese-language doo-wop (“Umaoi”) to, uh, Damon Albarn-fronted Afrobeats? It's easy to cringe at two white guys in their 50s cashing in on the chart-conquering sounds of young Africa, but Koze treats the new crayons in his box as reverently as the old, sketching out a comfortable niche somewhere between King Sunny Adé's Juju Music and the more modern stylings of Nigerian Alté.

Hearing the famously stoic Blur and Gorillaz frontman break into laughter during “Pure Love”'s verses, I was reminded of an anecdote from the Hit Parade sessions, where Murphy described how personal voicemails she'd sent to Kozalla popped up on later versions of the record. Who's to say Albarn didn't record 20 perfect takes and Koze opted for the one where he flubbed a line? The effect is intoxicatingly candid, that of circumventing a collaborator's on-record persona to capture something of their true essence.

While it delights in a life spent abroad, Music Can Hear Us also digs deeper into Kozalla's home turf. “Der Fall,” sung by Pampa associate Sophia Kennedy, plays like a pastoral folk song recorded behind the Berlin Wall. “Unter meinen Füßen fängt/Der Boden an zu schwanken…doch Ich find daran Gefallen,” she sings: “The ground begins to shake beneath my feet, but I like it.” The other side of Koze's call for unity is the rupture it might take to get there. “Wie schön du bist” features a prominent sample of “Bleib Doch,” from singer-songwriter Holger Biege's 1978 album Wenn der Abend kommt. Born in East Germany, Biege fled to Hamburg without an exit permit in the early '80s and was temporarily separated from his family. Each Koze song is like this—a mini-thesis on some forgotten footnote of music history—but here his longstanding fascination with golden oldies gets personal. Kozalla would have been 5 or 6 years old when “Bleib Doch” came out, and “Wie schön du bist” beams us directly into the mind of a kid hearing his new favorite song on the radio for the first time.

This is DJ Koze's alchemy—the ability to return any dusty piece of ephemera to mint condition. On mid-album stunner “Unbelievable,” fellow German singer and producer Ada is a dead ringer forthe mid-century pop vocalist Connie Francis, resplendent in a computerized hall of mirrors. “I must be dreaming, yes dreaming/You're so heavenly,” she sings, but Koze's not content to let any emotion sit idly by; puppy love bares its teeth and sincerity is cut with camp. “What About Us,” featuring the Notwist's Markus Acher, is a kaleidoscope of digi-bells, skittering trap hi-hats, and strummed zither that instantly joins the ranks of Koze's best ballads. But in place of sweet nothings—“Honey honey/On my nose/On your titties,” “Das Wort heisst love”—it trades in existential dread: “Above our heads the sky's exploding/We hold a world that disappears.”

To show the next generation how it's done, DJ Koze throws two absolute heaters into the back half of Music Can Hear Us. “Brushcutter,” with Marley Waters, is Koze's take on breakbeat, loaded with enough sawtooth synths to cut through the high of anyone who, say, took one too many pills in Ibiza. And for those missing a “Pick Up”-style floor-filler, the showstopping “Buschtaxi” boasts a drop that lands like a swan dive and a belly flop all at once. This is the album's title made literal, a living tapestry of rainforest sounds—snakes rattling, frogs croaking, monkeys swinging from branch to branch.

This could be the defining project of DJ Koze's oeuvre: an extended attempt to rewild that which has been made palatable, sociable, and civilized. “I'm a big fan of getting rid of my mind,” Koze told Resident Advisor, “'cause it's a cage of hyped TikTok apes, spitting in my soup and getting on my nerves.” In his kingdom of ends, Rumi and Kant and Laozi and the Talented Mr. Tripley himself sit side by side in the astral plane, “pure love loves purely,” and the shaky ground of autonomy gives way to the common good. Call it hubris, call it quixotic. Music Can Hear Us makes that dream feel a little more in reach.

For decades, Bruce Springsteen fans have whispered of a suite of albums that the Boss recorded in full—particularly in the 1990s—but never released. That collection was known as Tracks II, and today, it became a reality. On June 27, seven albums of never-before-heard Springsteen music will be collected in a 9xLP/7xCD box set, spanning from 1983 to 2018. In a trailer, Springsteen describes going into his vault during the pandemic and polishing off these albums, in part to put to bed the narrative of his “lost '90s.” Below, watch that trailer and listen to a new song, “Rain in the River,” from the Perfect World collection. Plus, check out the box set's full tracklist.

Among the seven albums are LA Garage Sessions '83—a bridge between Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A.—the 1993 Streets of Philadelphia Sessions, the abandoned movie soundtrack Faithless, an E Street Band–assisted country album called Somewhere North of Nashville, and the Western Stars preface Twilight Hours. Inyo is described as a set of cinematic border tales, while Perfect World is “the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album,” says Springsteen. The complete set includes 74 songs that have never been heard, and a further eight new versions of songs that otherwise found the light of day.

7.3

Genre:

Rap

Label:

self-released

Reviewed:

April 3, 2025

Some music isn't meant to be heard with anyone else. You don't listen to Aethiopes or Turn on the Bright Lights and think, “Damn, maybe I should play this the next time I have friends over.” These are records you wallow in alone. In 2023, one of my most played songs of the year was Xang's “for me,” a spacy, desolate track that wrapped itself around me on streetlit walks home. Across two minutes, the Maryland rapper's breathy, overlapping vocals seep into a spine-tingling haze of keys and muffled bass, casting a chill of unease. Xang's lyrics are often incoherent, which can be a drawback, but it's his ability to build an atmosphere unique to him that continues to lure me in; his sludgy drawl unravels on horror OSTs like dark bolts of silk. The 24-year-old artist is an anchor of the scattershot rap clique DPM, an online collective that repurposes '90s ambient (and whatever else they get their hands on) into skin-crawling tracks with tactile percussion. His textures are equal parts alien and familiar: The Frankenstein'd Drake and Wayne beats he floats over are fitted with awkwardly placed snares and kicks that somehow maintain engrossing rhythms. The producers in Xang's orbit—ivvys, theo, .cutspace, westly, and countless others—set the tone for a ghastly ambiance that's amplified by his gruff, brooding delivery.

Watch Over My Body, or WOMB, is the clearest distillation of Xang's vision since his emergence in 2021. Nestled beneath his uncanny struggle rap are signifiers of his home soil: the tinny bells on “notice,” the blistering kick drums on “hangman,” the distinctive DMV punch-ins on “by myself.” “cake got baked” has this mischievous, cascading progression that sounds like something Goonew and Lil Dude would've slid on in 2017. But even with this in mind, WOMB features some of the most off-kilter hip-hop you'll hear this year; in a recent interview with The Fader, Xang simply dubbed it “headphone music.” The mechanical lurch of “paid” fits that label. As wailing livestock and warbling ad-libs pan from left to right, the mood is pensive and restless, almost nauseating. Like a little cousin to billy woods' “The Doldrums,” “paid”'s use of acrid sound design in empty space is too surreal to turn away from. It sounds like what a midnight drive through a sundown town must feel like. Xang definitely isn't the promethean writer that woods is, but the existential gloom in his voice is all the same. “Bitch wanna eat, gon' sell that box/It is what it is,” he mutters. “Bro wanna eat, but he stuck in a box/It is what it is.”

As cold and insular as his sound is, Xang still leaves room for levity. “forehead up” is as brisk as it is spooky, and the cheery violin flourishes from Twista's “Overnight Celebrity” turn “hangman” into a bright spot. Sometimes Xang's creepy backing melodies remind me of being a kid singing into an electric fan. Other times his marble-mouthed delivery steamrolls over funny (albeit bleak) asides. “Cuh got hit in his head/Fuck I look like fighting?” he goads on “cake got baked.” When he has more drugs than he knows what to do with, he pictures his opps in disbelief: “How the hell lil Xang keep scorin' them scripts?/He trippin'.” WOMB is a concise record, just 20 minutes long, but its layers of muck and grime make additional listens feel like coal mining—here's a searing snare roll in one corner, a punchy one-liner in another. On “bruce wayne,” Xang cuts through smog with a scythe: the pitched-down moans, quaking bass, and spurts of processed strings all form one heavy mist. Each repetition feels denser than the last.

Xang's ability to cultivate chilling atmosphere has as much to do with his voice as his production choices; he burrows into the mix and lets his punch-ins bleed into each other, rapping like his teeth are clenched tight. It works on “by myself” and “bruce wayne,” where he appears like an undead spirit who'll jugg you for everything in your pockets. The catch is how hard it can be to hear what he's getting across—on “ricky rubio,” his delivery is so vaporous it's nearly impossible to decipher. When Xang disappears in the fog of the production, he starts to lose his appeal; the more precise and forthright he is with his vocals, like on “cake got baked,” the better. Without abandoning the mise-en-scène, I wanna hear him emphasize what he's really saying.

Regardless, if Watch Over My Body serves as a breakthrough for DPM's avant-garde rap portraiture, the genre will be better for it. “notice” closes the tape with that Cortex sample you've probably heard before, but producer balenci02's rumbling 808s, doomsday bells, and elliptical synths give Xang room to make it his own. A standard often flipped with bong rips and kickbacks in mind feels newly calamitous, and Xang replaces the tight-lipped malaise with hardnosed zeal. He's possessed and invigorated, rapping like he's barreling down the highway in a 16-wheeler: The windows are down, the engine purrs, and it's hard to make out his words as the wind whips past, but you could get drunk off the adrenaline.

							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	On March 27, 2022, on the heels of a weekend marked by dozens of gang-related murders, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and his legislature plunged the country into a régimen de excepción — a state of exception — and declared war against the gangs. The state of exception suspended fundamental rights like freedom of assembly and association, the right to legal representation, and the right to see a judge within 72 hours of detention. The age of criminal responsibility was lowered to 12.


	The crackdown that ensued saw tens of thousands of arrests of suspected gang members, who were tried en masse and disappeared into the nation's prison system without even the illusion of due process. Allegations of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses abounded — and still do. Bukele is serving a second term despite a constitutional prohibition against it. The state of exception — originally a 30-day decree —  has been extended 31 times. Over the course of three years, human rights in El Salvador have crumbled under its boot.

	











	It's here that President Donald Trump hopes to find a workable model for his own immigration crackdown, and the potential eradication of opposition to his nativist, right-wing agenda. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In March, the Trump administration sent three plane loads of primarily Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, where they were greeted by professional camera crews, blinding lights, and soldiers clad in military fatigues who manhandled them as they were frogmarched, shaved, and transported into the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) — a massive prison that functions as both a detention center, and a propaganda soundstage for the Bukele government. The planes landed in El Salvador despite a court order from a federal judge blocking the administration from deporting the detained migrants to a third nation without appropriate due process. The Trump administration paid El Salvador at least $6 million for the stunt, and the migrants have been thrust into a legal void that few manage to escape.

	“The Venezuelans have been sent to basically a judicial black hole,” says Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a leading human rights organization that has represented victims and the families of those internally displaced and disappeared in Central America for more than 20 years. “There's already tens of thousands of El Salvadorans who are in it, who have not been able to exercise a defense, who have been subjected to systematic torture. Hundreds — probably more like thousands — have been killed.” 

	











	Ruth López, a renowned Salvadoran human rights lawyer who works as a chief legal officer at Cristosal, says the organization has been contacted by roughly 70 relatives and families of individuals caught in the deportation stunt, including “migrants without a prior criminal record, people who were detained on the street or upon entering the United States, others who had previously applied through the CPB One app or had existing formal asylum processes.”


	López says it's often Cristosal's job to explain to families — who in these cases live primarily outside of El Salvador — the reality of what the detained person will face, and the challenges of fighting for their release. “Here in Salvador, between March 27, 2022, and December 31, 2024, there have been over 7,200 writs of habeas corpus submitted just to the Supreme Court. We can estimate that the rulings in favor of the people on those cases don't surpass one percent,” she says. “These cases are also unique because these are not Salvadoran citizens, and additionally the government of El Salvador is being paid to hold them in an irregular situation — an unconstitutional situation.” 


	El Salvador's state of exception — billed as a necessary measure to eliminate crime and corruption — has led to the imprisonment of thousands of innocents alongside dozens of community leaders, union leaders, and human rights defenders. The situation in El Salvador may seem like a far cry from the institutions of the United States, which for decades have been revered as the global gold standard for democratic governance. But the erosion of individual rights, and the Trump administration's willingness to recreate — even partially — the Bukele model at home, should be a warning and a wake up call for Americans.

	“America constantly talks about corruption elsewhere, this assumption that American institutions are incorruptible,” Bullock says. “In the end, human rights, corruption, autocracy — from an American exceptionalist mindset — is for the third world, and it makes it hard for people to see when it's playing out in front of their faces.” 


	In the aftermath of the Salvadoran Civil War — a more than decade-long conflict made exponentially worse by the meddling of the United States — the country struggled to create a new egalitarian state, at the the same time that the American government began deporting undocumented migrants with criminal convictions from California back to Central America. The result was the rapid entrenchment and growth of criminal groups within an already unstable El Salvador, and the nation quickly became one of the world's most dangerous countries. When Bukele entered office in 2019, the murder rate in El Salvador was 38 per 100,000 people, and gangs outright controlled parts of rural El Salvador. While it's undeniable that the Bukele crackdown has reduced violent crime in the nation, the extent of its success is a matter of debate, as crime statistics are controlled by the Bukele government. Allegations have also persisted that Bukele negotiated a backdoor truce between some of the nation's most powerful gangs. At the same time, over two percent of the nation's population is now incarcerated — the highest percentage in the world — and reports of state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses have skyrocketed. 

	











	“Of course we were on board with neutralizing the gangs and the criminal elements, but that wasn't the only thing the state of exception was for,” says Samuel Ramirez, founder of Movimiento de Víctimas del Régimen (Movement of Victims of the Regime), a protest and advocacy group that works with thousands of individuals and families affected by the state of exception. Bukele “used the gangs to create a spectacle, to command the attention of the world” he says. 


	While polling consistently shows that Bukele is quite popular in El Salvador, surveys also show a steady increase in fear of public criticism of the government — to degrees that sometimes match the president's approval rating. “There's a sector of the population that feels better, because it's true that we perceive more security, we're no longer afraid of the gangs. Now we're afraid of the regime,” says Ramirez. “We see soldiers everywhere, police everywhere, patrol cars, and they're arresting people.” Ramirez notes that on top of Bukele's control of all three branches of government, and repression of the free press, families and activists he works with fear retaliation or arrest if they speak out against abuses or advocate for their imprisoned relatives. The murder rate — a statistic provided by the Bukele government — is down, but doesn't include those who die in custody of the prison system or are killed by police. 


	El Salvador's prisons have long been a hotbed of arbitrary detention and abuse, but the Bukele regime has operated under new levels of impunity. Officers are reportedly given daily arrest quotas, transfers to other prisons are frequent, and the government closely guards information about detainees from families, attorneys, and their advocates. The state of exception means little more is needed than the suspicion of an arresting officer to secure a lengthy stay in prison. Detainees are tried en masse, with no opportunity to present counter evidence — or even access to the evidence against them — and are often handed decades-long prison sentences. “People [are] being held for now three full years [since the state of exception was imposed], in some cases, without even going to trial,” Bullock says. 


	As the Trump administration looks to crack down on undocumented immigration — using the specter of crime, gang violence, and “terrorism” as the justification for their dismissal of established law — their playbook is looking increasingly similar to Bukele. 

	











	Over the weekend, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained a copy of a “Validation Guide,” used by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to determine if a Venezuelan detainee was a member of the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, and subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act — an 18th century law that allows the government to arrest, detain, and deport men over the age of 14 who are citizens of an enemy nation during times of war. Citing this infamous law — which was used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — is a major stretch. The United States is not at war with Venezuela.


	The guide included a points system through which suspected members are graded on their degree of suspected affiliation with the gang (scoring anything above a five is potentially enough to be declared an “alien enemy”). Criteria include tattoos and other symbolism; residing with someone declared a member of TDA; group photos featuring two or more “known” TDA members; and any form of communication with alleged members of TDA. 


	The administration's guide does not require due process; the supposed links between the detainee and a criminal group are not presented as evidence before a judge at a deportation hearing. The arresting officer has discretion, much like in El Salvador. 


	Following the deportations in March, the Trump administration resisted releasing information regarding the identities of those arrested, and any evidence against them. The names of the more than 200 men deported were not made public until CBS News obtained the full list from an anonymous source last month. 


	The Trump administration admitted in court documents that “many” of those sent to El Salvador did not have criminal records. As more information about those deported was unearthed, it became clear that some of the “evidence” against them was as absurd as a tattoo of a Real Madrid CF logo, or an autism awareness tattoo. 


	Under the Alien Enemies Act, they have no recourse to challenge their removal, especially when they're sent into a third country's penal system as part of a financial agreement to hold prisoners. 


	The videos produced by Bukele's government in CECOT make clear the prison is also a propaganda casting department. Inmates are more often than not shirtless, displaying large tattoos and body art supposedly indicating their affiliations with transnational gangs. It's an image both Bukele and the Trump administration are actively searching for when they make arrests — even though, for years now, gangs have been increasingly reluctant to brand members with clearly identifying, permanent symbols and tattoos as governments crack down on organized crime. More often than not, arrests in El Salvador are based on anonymous tips to police, or social and geographic proximity to someone previously arrested. 












	On Tuesday, a report from The Atlantic revealed that in one court filing, the Trump administration admitted it had wrongfully deported a man with protected status to El Salvador. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously won a legal battle against the Trump administration after being accused in 2019 of being a member of the gang MS-13, and was granted protected status that should have prevented his removal to El Salvador. 


	While the Trump administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia had been deported due to an “administrative error,” they claimed neither they nor the court had standing to order the U.S. government to secure his return, as he was in the custody of El Salvador and outside of their jurisdiction. Despite that logic, the Trump and Bukele administrations last week inked a “memorandum of cooperation” in which the two countries agreed to work together to deport “fugitives” who are wanted in El Salvador back to the Central American nation. 


	Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked Bukele for his “partnership” in a video filmed inside CECOT late last month. Before a backdrop of shirtless prisoners crowded into cage-like cells, Noem — sporting a $50,000 Rolex Daytona watch — warned that CECOT is “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”


	Bullock, of Cristosal, notes that the Trump administration sending people without convictions to El Salvador with no chance to defend themselves constitutes a “forced disappearance,” a violation of international human rights law. “It also violates another principle of international law, which is called non-refoulement, he says. “Non-refoulement is an established tenant of international human rights law that prohibits nations from deporting or removing individuals under their control — regardless of their immigration status — into a situation where they are likely to face imminent harm. 


	Bullock continues: “[Bukele] brags about the ways that they use cruel and inhumane treatment in CECOT and our organization has documented amply systematic practices of torture generally in the prison system. So the United States, in doing this, is generating a point of inflection for the international human rights system. The outcome of this is basically the creation of this transnational penal colony where a president, a head of state, can make a deal with President Bukele and disappear undesirables indefinitely.” 

	











	Disappeared is an apt description for the state of those in El Salvador's prisons. Cristosal and other advocacy groups working with the families of the detained say that CECOT is just “the public face” of a much larger system of prisons in El Salvador holding the vast majority of those arrested under the state of exception. The Bukele administration makes it nearly impossible to track the whereabouts of an arrestee once they've entered the system. Family members are not allowed contact with inmates, and are given little information on their condition and location. Release papers, if they manage to secure them, are often ignored. “We do work with hundreds of families of people, innocent people have been detained, and they don't even know for sure if they're alive.” Bullock says. “They bring monthly packages [of basic goods] to the prisons out of fear that their loved ones don't think they've been forgotten, but they have no guarantees or assurances that they're even there or they ever received the packages.” (In many Latin American countries, prisons do not provide basic goods for inmates, whose families are expected to collect and deliver them to detention centers on a monthly basis.) 


	In 2024, Cristosal published a report detailing alleged torture within El Salvador's prison system, unreported deaths of inmates, and the systematic dissappearances of those arrested. The organization has received thousands of complaints, investigated over 1,000 specific cases of alleged abuse, and documented the deaths in custody of over 200 prisoners. 


	Cristosal provided Rolling Stone with recorded testimony from a former inmate named Oscar who said he and other detainees are often forced to sign confessions by arresting officers, crammed into cells with over 250 other inmates, and regularly beaten by guards. Oscar describes witnessing food deprivation, denial of medical treatment, frequent transfers (he spent time at several prisons in El Salvador), deaths of inmates due to illness or abuse, and burials in mass graves. 


	In a 2023 report examining in-custody deaths investigated by the state-run Institute of Legal Medicine (IML), Cristosal was able to corroborate that the institute has investigated at least 28 deaths within prisons that were likely caused by torture. The actual number is estimated to be at least in the hundreds. Deaths in custody are often reported to be the result of chronic disease or natural causes, despite inmates' families claiming they had no known conditions before being arrested. 

	











	In the case of a 30-year-old man whose IML reports were obtained by Cristosal, “the forensic medical examination of the IML stated that he had died as a result of ‘mechanical asphyxia by strangulation.' The corpse presented a kind of protuberance at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and hematomas, possibly perpetrated with a rigid object. That is to say, he could have been strangled with a stick, club, or tonfa.” 


	One 24-year-old man, whose family spoke to Cristosal, died of a burst intestine theorized to have been caused by a severe beating. After an initial hospitalization due to malnutrition after seven months in prison, he was granted special release by a judge who told him that the “good news” was that a polygraph determined he was innocent — but the bad news was that he had “terminal renal insufficiency.” He told a relative shortly before he died that at Mariona Prison the “water is hot and tastes like chlorine and they hardly give us food, we get fed once a day, they don't give us breakfast or lunch only dinner … we wait in line in a large court and everyone who gets food receives two hard blows on the back … so I stopped going out to eat so they wouldn't hit me, because those blows hurt.”


	One man previously incarcerated at Mariona testified to Cristosal that at one point, guards “showed up with a bucket of food. We arrived on a Thursday (and it was Monday), the guard asked, ‘Are you hungry?' When we answered yes, the guard threw the food on the floor, which was full of mud and other dirt, and said, ‘You are only going to pick the food up with your mouth and if you grab it with your hands I will take you out and I will beat you,' and gave them five seconds to pick up the food with their mouths.” 


	Luisa — a woman whose daughter was arrested by the regime — wondered in an interview with Cristosal why her daughter was being held prisoner. “I would like for someone to come to me and say, ‘Look, here is [the evidence against your daughter] I can prove it,' but I've always said we're not of a dual-morality.” Luisa notes that since her daughter, who was the primary source of the family's income, was arrested, she now spends around $120 a month on supplies her daughter needs, taking them to the prison with only the vaguest assurance that they will actually reach her daughter. Thousands of families whose loved ones are lost in the system are now forced to carry a similar financial burden. “Many of them already have a letter of release, they know they are innocent, why don't they let them go?” Luisa asks. 

	











	It's into this system that the United States is now sending migrants without trial, with the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment being part of the system's appeal. The families of those deported from the United States cannot deliver life-saving subsistence packages to inmates. They may not even know where they are. And they will face the additional challenge of having to contend with two hostile governments — one of which is their own — as they work to extricate their loved ones from a foreign penitentiary. 


	Meanwhile, the changes ushered in by the Trump administration are quickly eroding support services in El Salvador. Cristosal has had to downsize its operations significantly in the wake of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's purge of international aid and financial assistance programs. The cuts to their operations are also taking place alongside a wave of government retaliation against activists and advocates in El Salvador. “The capacity of the human rights community in El Salvador to respond is significantly diminished,” Bullock says.  


	The biggest challenge, Bullock explains, is helping the families of those who are detained or missing navigate a system in El Salvador that is increasingly serving the interests of the president rather than the people — a pattern he says mirrors the changes rapidly taking place in the United States. “Bukele often talked about his popularity and his electoral victories as a source of legitimacy that makes any institution or norm that doesn't align with him, illegitimate,” he says. “You hear that same language with President Trump.” 


	The public dialogue taking place between Bukele and the Trump administration is undeniable. In the aftermath of U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg's attempt to block the deportation flights, Bukele echoed Republican complaints of obstruction and claimed that the U.S. was “facing a judicial coup” on social media. Bukele would know all about it, given that one of his first actions upon gaining control of the legislature in 2021 was to launch a judicial coup within El Salvador. Five Supreme Court justices and the attorney general — who had ruled against Bukele's attempts at overreach — were removed from their positions via votes by the legislature, and replaced by Bukele loyalists. 


	From López's perspective in El Salvador, the similarities between the two men — and the manner in which they approach power — is clear. “One has to understand that the limits [placed on power] are for the population,” she says. 

	











	Checks and balances are often explained as a mechanism to prevent discord between branches of a government, or resolve disputes, but López argues that their primary function is the “protection of the population” from government abuses and overreach. When those protective systems are attacked and dismantled “the population ends up suffering those consequences.” 


	Trump is currently testing the limits of the United States' checks and balances, seizing power for the executive through initiatives like he and Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), daring the courts to defy him, and threatening consequences if they do. El Salvador's state of exception has only been in place for three years — ages for those in it, a blink in the timeline of global politics — but it's been long enough for democratic norms to crumble virtually unopposed.  


	In a 2023 speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Bukele defended his attacks against El Salvador's judiciary, telling the international community that if his party “had left the same general prosecutor as before, if we had left the magistrates of the previous chamber, if we had left the judges, who many protected and who even issued convictions when we removed them, we would still be the murder capital of the world. If we had listened to them, we would still be losing thousands of Salvadorans to terrorists.” 


	Bukele made similar statements during a decidedly Trumpian speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last year. He received raucous applause after telling the audience that in order to “cleanse our society,” his government embraced the “unthinkable” and removed “corrupt judges, and corrupt attorneys, and prosecutors,” who — according to him — were practically supportive of the violent criminals he sought to thwart.  


	Trump's inauguration earlier this year brought with it a purge of career prosecutors and federal attorneys who the president deemed disloyal to the cause, and now threats of impeachment or investigation against jurists who don't let him have his way. Foreign student activists opposing American policies toward Israel and Gaza have been arrested, stripped of their visas, and deported. “It's the classic authoritarian proposition that ‘I as the leader am uniquely equipped to solve this crisis and everyone else needs to get out of my way,'” says Bullock.

	











	“Leaders constantly need emergencies in order to justify the concentration of power, the capture of the state itself, and also they need to create the image of an internal enemy,” Bullock explains.

	Trump has centered his political career around a drumbeat of fear mongering over “invasions” by criminal gangs and undocumented migrants, positioning himself as the only one who can combat them. The beat grew especially intense down the stretch of his most recent presidential campaign. In October, just weeks before the election, Trump drew widespread backlash after repeatedly stating that he intended to squash the threat of the “enemy from within.” One of his first actions upon assuming office in January was to sign an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border, and he's since used this imaginary war against immigrants as a predicate for a fascist crackdown — one many Americans never thought they'd see.


	“This deceptive bargain between security and rights will only take the American people down a pathway of loss of rights for all people,” Bullock adds. “A leader who offers that bargain to their population doesn't do it out of a concern for security, rather to concentrate power and to capture institutions.”

	…And on the sixth day, God created the animals of the land, including the livestock, those that crept upon the ground, and some wonky-looking wolves and chickens and bees that took upon themself an almost cube-like shape. Then He created humans in His own image, as well as some villagers with conspicuously phallic shaped noses, some walking skeletons, and, what the hell, a couple of zombies. And He looked upon the Earth, filled with hand-angled architecture and a ton of mines and some seriously 64-bit aesthetics, and lo, it was good.


	Then, on the seventh day, the Lord — who'd originally earmarked this as a day of rest — went to Warner Bros. Pictures and, having somehow managed to secure a meeting with studio executives, declared that there would be a motion picture dedicated to his crowning achievement. The suits looked nervously at each other before piping up: “Yes, of course, God, so shall it be! We can probably get that one guy from Tenacious D to be in it. Not the bald one, the other guy. We'll make sure he's even more manic than usual. Also we believe the dude who played Aquaman is free. And we'll ask the filmmaker who did Napoleon Dynamite to direct it.” This last part surprised and delighted God, who was a huge fan of the 2004 comedy and used to rock a “Vote Pedro” shirt back in the day.

	











	Then the Lord, who knew that sometimes not even the most talented artisans in the land could turn a video-game I.P. into a watchable movie, asked: “This will be good, then?” And the studio executives replied, almost in unison, “So, it may be best to keep your expectations low, God.”


	Say what you will about A Minecraft Movie: It certainly lives up to its, um, title. Technically, you can call this a movie (in the same way you can technically call this a review), and hundreds of people toiled day and night in order to recreate the look and feel of the mega-popular video game that makes those Lego-themed console titles seem sophisticated. That lo-fi style is part of what made Minecraft a global sensation, along with a customizable environment that turned a sandbox game into a DIY free-for-all. Don't choose your own adventure, players. Build it brick by brick, block by block.

	Short of rocking Clue-type multiple endings or giving individual audience members an open-source viewing option, there's no way this — adaptation? variation? exploitation? — of Minecraft‘s name-brand recognition and aesthetic can properly duplicate the experience of hours of gameplay. So the creators do the next “best” thing (these scare quotes are doing a monumental amount of heavy lifting) by simply taking the raw material from hundreds of other hero's-journey adventures, irony-soaked comedies, and fantasy narratives, and constructing a sort of loosey-goosey story out of those bits and pieces. The key word in the title is the article. It's “a” Minecraft movie. There were tons of options they might have gone with, and for better or worse, this is the one you're getting.

	











	In the spirit of utmost professionalism, a few details: A creative young boy named Steve yearns to swing a pickaxe in his local mines. He's given the Heisman by a crusty old coot guarding the entrance. The lad grows up to be Jack Black, who bum-rushes his way into the hole in the ground. One magical portal later, he finds himself in the “Overworld,” where he can skadoosh voxels to his heart's delight. Unfortunately, an evil pig named Malgosha (voiced by the great Rachel House) traps Steve in “the Nethers” and tries to nab his prized possession, a.k.a. “the most powerful cube-shaped orb in the universe,” for herself. Luckily, Steve's faithful wolf, Dennis, escapes with the talisman and tucks it away from her grasp. If you love breathless reams of exposition, you'll be absolutely head over heels for the film's first five minutes.


	Meanwhile, back on Earth, Natalie (Emma Myers) and Henry (Sebastian Hansen), still mourning the tragic loss of their parents, travel to Chuglass, Idaho, for Natalie's new job — she's been hired to run the social media account of a potato-chip company best known for its creepy mascot, Chuggy. Also, their real estate broker, Dawn (Danielle Brooks), has an alpaca in her car because her side hustle is running a mobile zoo. This is probably the best point to mention that, although six writers are credited for the story and screenplay, Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess' sensibility is truly the guiding light. Seriously, they should have just called the movie Napoleon Dyna-Mine. And that's before you meet Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, a former arcade-game champ still coasting off his 1980s glory days and delusions of grandeur. Maybe folks dreamed of Jason Momoa modeling dirtbag-chic couture, sporting a vintage Sunset Strip shaggy ‘do, and channeling his inner cheeseball. Wishes granted!

	Courtesy of a few plot machinations that don't matter enough to recount, that whole gang in the above-world find themselves in the Overworld, magical orb in tow, and they team up with Steve, and there are explosions and chases, and things kinda sorta happen. Black, his dial permanently stuck on 11, sings a song about lava chicken that can't hold a candle to his Super Mario Bros ditty “Peaches.” Plus, one of those grunting villagers makes his way to Idaho and Jennifer Coolidge falls in love with him. There are Easter Eggs and inside jokes galore, and fans will finally see what Creepers — imagine walking dildos that explode — look like in CGI.

	











	Regardless of whether you've ever played Minecraft or not, you'll recognize the kind of endless ribbing, nudging, winking knowingness on display here; this is steeped in the self-aware absurdism of, say, those Old Spice commercials that aim to confuse and confound in the name of moving products off store shelves. A Minecraft Movie is essentially a 101-minute version of that. It, too, is pitching a product, and you either buy what it's selling in the name of making bucks off of fandom and star power, or you don't. Much like the game itself, the choice is yours. We just don't want to be the one to inform God what his creations hath wrought with this expensively cheap, 100-percent corporate mess.

	In the debut of the darkly comic new FX miniseries Dying for Sex, Molly (Michelle Williams) learns that her breast cancer has returned and is now terminal, then thinks on her nonexistent sex life with husband Steve (Jay Duplass) and declares, “I've never even had an orgasm with another person. And now I'm gonna die.” 


	What follows is an alternately hilarious, bawdy, and sad attempt to solve the former problem before the latter befalls her. 


	Adapted by Kim Rosenstock and Elizabeth Meriwether from the podcast of the same name, Dying for Sex has the unenviable task of juggling what should be two completely incompatible tones. On the one hand, neither Molly's oncologist (drolly and sweetly played by Succession alum David Rasche) nor the show itself attempts to sugarcoat the nature of this kind of cancer. Her story will only end one way, and relatively soon, and that is inescapably sad. Yet the ticking clock created by being in Stage 4 also encourages her to leave Steve, and enlist best friend Nikki (Jenny Slate, fantastic) to act as her support person for both her treatment and her quest to find sexual satisfaction by any means necessary. And that part of the show is often utterly ludicrous, including a scene in one episode where Molly's mother (the great Sissy Spacek) tells a guy in a dog costume, “Don't drink my daughter's pee if you can't handle it!” 

	











	Rosenstock and Meriwether first worked together on the Zooey Deschanel sitcom New Girl, which would have had room for the absurdity — if not necessarily the amount of explicit detail regarding its heroine's sexual journey — and found occasional moments of pathos. But it didn't have inevitable tragedy baked into its premise in the way Dying for Sex does. Still, the duo make the two halves fit together expertly. The comedy feels like a welcome release from the sadness, but the heaviness of the material in turn keeps the jokes from feeling too over-the-top.

	It helps, of course, to have Michelle Williams playing this character. It's her first TV role since 2019's Fosse/Verdon (also made by FX), for which she won an Emmy. She might want to clear a spot on her mantel for another one. She holds the story's two spiritual halves together through charisma, sheer force of will, and comic chops that have been woefully underutilized over her career. Anyone who's heard the excerpt of her reading the audiobook for Britney Spears' memoir, about Justin Timberlake greeting Ginuwine, knows how wickedly funny she can be just with deadpan line readings. Dying for Sex puts that talent to good use, periodically drifting into voiceover where Molly tries to distract herself from the latest bad cancer news by making herself think about dicks: “Yes, dicks. Dicks! Big dicks, little dicks!” And when things go poorly with Molly's health — or as Molly wrestles with having been abused as a child by one of her mother's boyfriends — Williams doesn't need to push hard to get the audience's tear ducts flowing.

	As Molly's sexual journey takes her from epic masturbation to clumsy app hookups to a discovery that she enjoys being a dominatrix for men who get off on humiliation, she's wonderfully paired with Rob Delaney as a slovenly neighbor who both repulses and arouses her, often at the same time. Anyone who watched Delaney and Sharon Horgan's great Amazon series Catastrophe knows how comfortable he is acting in the space between silly and sad, and his character's relationship with Molly keeps going to unexpected places.  


	There are some hiccups with the pacing here and there — Molly's marriage largely ends off camera, though Steve keeps popping back up — but for the most part, the series stays on that tightrope. Even the final episode, where Molly enters the final stretch of her illness, is made bearable by a funny and warm performance by Paula Pell as a hospice nurse who pulls no verbal punches.

W
aving red-and-white flags and blasting an independence song from a speaker box, a parade of about 40 Siumut faithful, long the dominant political party, is on the march in Nuuk, Greenland's frozen capital. Cloaked in parkas, they pass a cluster of wooden homes built by the first Danish settlers three centuries ago, and giant chunks of glacial ice stranded on the beach, before stopping in the old harbor. This is what passes for a big crowd in a vast country of nearly 57,000 people, and their full-throated fervor cuts through the bracing February cold. The week before, Prime Minister Múte Egede called for snap elections after President Donald Trump's repeated threats to acquire the strategically located and resource-rich Arctic island. “We are in a serious time,” Egede wrote on Facebook. “A time we have never experienced in our country. The time is not for internal division but for cooperation and unity for our country.”


	Five of Greenland's six main political parties favor independence from Denmark, the former colonizer that still controls its foreign affairs and defense, and pays for more than half the government's public budget. But they differ on how quickly that should happen, and whether U.S. interest is ultimately more of an opportunity or menace to Greenland's long-term political and economic freedom. Siumut, a partner in the two-party government coalition, had days earlier announced its intention to hold a vote on independence. “The first step will be free association, and after many years, full independence,” says Doris Jensen, a member of parliament leading the parade.

	











	Minutes after the Siumut crowd moves on, the other half of the ruling left-wing coalition, Inuit Ataqatigiit, descends on the waterfront in a flurry of flags and slogans, their boots crunching the ice. Its party leaders had just broken ranks with Siumut, countering they would not rush an independence referendum after the vote. A more gradual approach, they reasoned, will ensure that welfare programs funded by Denmark are not disrupted, and the so-called right alliances maintained.

	“We have always known that whatever we do in Greenland for full autonomy from the Danish realm, that the United States would try and grab us,” says Aqqaluk Lynge, a veteran Inuit-rights activist and party founder who once stood outside the Danish parliament demanding independence. 

	











	Compared with other indigenous people in the Arctic, “we are the most independent country; we have rights to our own land and are accepted as a people according to international law.” Lynge, 77, now worries that the autonomy he fought for, and the island's considerable resource wealth, could be lost by hastily breaking away from Denmark. “The situation right now with the U.S. is so threatening that people are having second thoughts about independence. My generation is very worried — people don't trust the U.S. like we did a few months ago. Anything is possible.”


	A flash of the young activist comes in a parting message to Trump: “Come freeze your effing ass off here. Come in the winter, then we will put you in the middle of the ice cap and you will see what Greenland is all about!”


	As the rally ends, Lynge introduces me to Egede, the 37-year-old prime minister. He rejects Trump's overtures to buy or annex Greenland. But he's also been strident in his calls for full independence from Denmark to remove the “shackles of colonialism,” saying it is “now time to take the next step for our country” in a New Year's speech that hinted at a referendum. Of late, though, he's evaded foreign reporters pressing him about Trump. 


	We shake hands, and on hearing I'm an American journalist, he spins on a dime and breaks into a fast walk up the street.

	Having spent most of its existence on the margins of the geopolitical map, Greenland now finds itself smack in its center. Warming temperatures are opening new shipping lanes and making oil, gas, and mineral reserves more accessible, turning the world's largest island into a strategic prize in the brewing competition between the U.S., China, and Russia for supremacy in the Arctic. President Trump wanted to buy Greenland during his first term, and in 2020 the U.S. reopened its consulate in Nuuk after nearly 70 years. Upon winning reelection, Trump declared Greenland to be an “absolute necessity” for America's national security, while refusing to rule out using military conquest. “One way or the other,” he told lawmakers in March, “we're going to get it.”


	The imperial bluster has sent shock waves through Denmark, an ostensible NATO ally. In a heated Jan. 15 phone call with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Trump doubled down on threats to target Denmark with trade tariffs if it doesn't cede or sell, igniting a full-blown panic. (The U.S. is Denmark's top export market outside of the European Union, receiving more than $12 billion worth of Danish products in 2023.) But in Greenland, the background tension has forced a popular reckoning on the country's future. “Now the whole world knows where Greenland is,” says Erik Jensen, the outgoing minister of mineral resources and labor. “And it has pushed a lot of issues to the forefront about becoming more independent from Denmark.”

	











	Like many leaders here, Jensen acknowledges it will take “many years” to build up the kind of diversified, homegrown economy that would make independence viable. Greenland is heavily dependent on fishing exports, and an annual block grant of more than $500 million from Denmark covers employment, health care, and education. Its population is declining, with a workforce that lacks specialized training. And yet tourism is surging to record levels; fisheries have the potential to earn far more; and the country's diverse underground resources are mostly untapped — including rare earth elements used in green technologies that are the envy of U.S. officials looking to head off China's global monopoly.


	Over the course of two weeks traveling around the capital and fishing villages on the southwest coast, conversations with politicians, hunters, artists, and entrepreneurs yielded a near-universal refrain: We aren't for sale, but we are open for business. While Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose becoming the 51st state, most want independence. And some hope Trump's interest will usher in the jobs and investments needed to become more self-sufficient and turn the page on a colonial legacy marked by inequalities.

“MY GENERATION IS VERY WORRIED — PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE U.S. LIKE WE DID A FEW MONTHS AGO.”


	Still, that optimism is tempered by fears that Greenland's decades-long independence drive could be hijacked by a ham-fisted and unpredictable U.S. administration that is running roughshod over its closest allies. “U.S. security is our security — we're allies — and we'd like to do more business with them,” Jensen says, “but that doesn't mean that we would like to become a part of the U.S.”


	On a hill overlooking the sprawling bay of Nuuk, a seven-foot-tall statue of a man clutching a shepherd staff and Bible faces the headwinds. Hans Egede, a Danish Norwegian Protestant missionary, arrived in 1721 with a royal mandate to convert Norse settlers who had occupied the island for several hundred years. They were long gone, so he set about converting the native Inuit population instead.


	Brisk trade in whale blubber and seal skins eventually made Greenland the most prized possession in the Danish realm. In 1979, Greenland was granted home rule; this was expanded into self-rule 30 years later, allowing the country greater control over its domestic affairs. These days, Greenlanders enjoy a welfare system with universal health care and free education, paid for in part by Denmark. Danes view themselves as “good colonizers” — at least compared with the brutalities exacted by powers like the U.S., Spain, and Belgium against native communities. 


	“The self-portrait of the Danes is that all or most of what the Danish state did as a colonial power was with the best intentions,” says Birger Poppel, a Danish economist at the University of Greenland who has lived in the country for 40 years. But in the eyes of many Inuit Greenlanders, the Egede statue is a lightning rod for cultural erasure and other state abuses that have come to light. Danish policies aimed at “modernization” and assimilation saw forced relocation to larger towns and the suppression of the Inuit language and customs. Families were torn apart, with some children sent to Denmark for schooling. In the 1960s and 1970s, authorities carried out a large-scale involuntary birth-control campaign against Inuit girls and women, inserting devices without their knowledge or consent. (Prime Minister Egede has gone so far as to call this a “genocide carried out by the Danish state against the Greenland population.”) More recently, grievances have been inflamed by accusations that Danish companies and the state extracted billions of dollars in mineral wealth with little benefit to the local economy, further tainting the caretaker narrative at a vulnerable moment for Denmark.

	











	“For the past 300 years, the riches we need to build our country have been delivered to Denmark, and I think it's sad,” says Timmy Zeeb, a 36-year-old former hash smuggler I find butchering a seal on a rocky beach below the Egede statue. Pot-bellied with a chin-strap beard, skull cap, and sleeve tattoos, Zeeb just happened to be walking by when a fisherman pulled up with the extra meat and called him over. He posted a message on Facebook and went to work with a pocket knife, turning the slabs red as locals lined up for their share. Even in Greenland's largest city, communal traditions still hold.


	Zeeb carves me a piece of blubber, and I gulp it down. The gelatinous tissue is oily and salt-tinged. “We are a peaceful people and we have everything here: fish, uranium, rare earths,” he tells me. “We must make deals with other countries.”


	When I tell Zeeb I'm from the U.S., he informs me that Trump shared one of his videos on social media to troll Denmark. In the clip, he wears a MAGA cap and booms: “Buy us! Buy Greenland! We don't want to be colonized by the Danish government anymore.” Trump took the over-the-top bit and ran with it, proclaiming: “I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA' … Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” 


	Danish media were quick to report that Zeeb is a convicted criminal who once escaped from prison. Zeeb insists he's cleaned up his act since becoming a father, and downplays the viral please-buy-us! plea as lighthearted provocation. But he affirms his fondness for Trump and says he hopes that the U.S. partners with Greenland to tap resource wealth that could “feed all the lands” and transform his country. “We don't want to be part of Russia or China,” he says. “Everyone else is welcome to come and make history.”


	President Trump is hardly the first U.S. official to fixate on Greenland. Back in 1868, U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, the man who negotiated the purchase of Alaska from Russia, hailed Greenland as a place of almost bottomless natural resources that could empower the U.S. to “command the commerce of the world.” He tried to buy it and Iceland for $5.5 million — and might have succeeded had the $7.2 million Alaska deal not been ridiculed as a folly. During World War II, Greenland became a de facto American protectorate where bases allowed U.S. forces to thwart Nazi Germany's control of critical air and sea lanes. In 1946, the U.S. offered $100 million in gold for the territory. Denmark declined but joined NATO and signed a treaty that established U.S. “defense areas” to boost collective security during the Cold War.

“WE ARE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE AND WE HAVE EVERYTHING HERE: FISH, URANIUM, RARE EARTHS.”


	Chief among them: the Thule Air Base, a massive installation 950 miles shy of the North Pole that allowed NATO to track Soviet submarines and missile activity over Greenland, the shortest flight path from Europe to North America. In the 1960s, a top-secret U.S. nuclear-weapons program, code-named Project Iceworm, was partially built under the ice sheet east of Thule with a plan to embed 600 nuclear missiles, each aimed at major Soviet cities. (The program was scrapped. In another notorious 1968 incident, a B-52 bomber carrying four thermonuclear bombs crashed near Thule.) At the height of the war, the U.S. had more than 10,000 troops stationed at Thule and 17 military installations across Greenland. In 2023, Thule was renamed the Pituffik Space Base, and it still hosts roughly 150 personnel who maintain a ballistic missile early-warning system.


	Today, the Arctic is heating up four times faster than the rest of the world, and a new Great Game is intensifying in the north. As sea ice melts, Russia is ramping up naval patrols and expanding its fleet of 40 icebreakers. Not to be left out, China has focused more on economic inroads, acquiring mines, ports, and airfields as part of a broader “Polar Silk Road” campaign in the region. Though Greenland is technically covered by U.S. security guarantees through Denmark's NATO membership, the Danes have admitted their defense capabilities are woefully out-of-date: four Thetis-­class patrol boats, a surveillance aircraft, and dogsled patrols to monitor a landmass three and a half times the size of Texas with more than 27,000 miles of coastline. (In the wake of Trump's threats, Denmark has pledged more than $2 billion in military upgrades.)

	











	Kuno Fencker, a Greenlandic member of parliament fighting for independence, believes that the security concerns underlying Trump's threats are legitimate given Greenland's location and political trajectory. If Greenland becomes independent, he points out, Denmark has previously threatened to pull its annual subsidies and defense assistance, creating a security vacuum. “Who will take over? Who has the national-security interest in regards to the geostrategic position of Greenland? That is the United States.”


	Fifty years old with black-framed glasses and an urbane, matter-of-fact manner, Fencker belies the media caricature that pro-U.S. Greenlanders are a fringe collection of useful idiots for the Trump administration. He says he studied law to help Greenland break free of Denmark, and calls Trump's rhetoric “the best marketing move in our history” for making Denmark and the wider world take its independence goals more seriously. Before we met up for coffee, he'd driven his fiancée, one of two Greenlandic members of Danish parliament, to the airport for a campaign trip, given interviews to a pair of foreign media outlets, and recorded a podcast.


	Fencker likens Greenland's relationship with Denmark to a “forced child marriage” that began in 1953, when Greenland was unilaterally absorbed. In principle, Greenland became constitutionally equal to Denmark; in practice, he says, this was not the case. Although his Danish grandfather had worked as an inspector for the colonial administration, Fencker says that as an adult he initially faced discrimination for his mixed background. Working for a shipping company, he struggled to understand why nearly all of the cargo went to Denmark. He saw that most companies in Greenland are run by Danes. But it was in remote northern villages conducting impact assessments for oil exploration that his social consciousness really awakened. The “extreme discrimination” made “my sense of protecting Inuit people become very much alive.”

“WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF RUSSIA OR CHINA. EVERYONE ELSE IS WELCOME TO COME MAKE HISTORY.”


	When Fencker began speaking up on behalf of Inuit rights, he claims, his job prospects dried up. So he plunged into politics, with a mission to develop Greenland's economy so it can stand on its own. “We're a real people with the right to sovereignty,” he says, “and we need businesspeople to come here and see the possibilities — instead of thinking we are a piece of ice.” He also wants to enact strict reforms that ensure more of the benefit from fishing, mining, and other potentially lucrative industries stays in Greenland. “We have to think for ourselves and not just give up our resources all the time.” 


	In January, Fencker traveled to Trump's inauguration festivities in Washington to advocate for stronger ties with the U.S. The impromptu trip did not go down well with his party, Siumut. On returning, some accused him of being a Trojan horse for Trump's agenda. He switched to Naleraq, a secessionist party that seeks free-association status and a defense agreement with the U.S. “People are fearmongering by misinterpreting Donald Trump and making him the Big Bad Wolf, even though we have a worse wolf — in the way Denmark is treating Greenland.”

	











	President Trump has cherry-picked such affirmations as proof that Greenlanders “want to be with us,” which couldn't be further from the truth; a January opinion poll taken after his annexation threats showed that while a large majority want independence, 85 percent of people oppose joining the U.S., with just six percent in favor. And though more than half of respondents said they'd vote “yes” to an independent state referendum if it were held tomorrow, scarcely anyone thinks the country is ready. “We have to learn from other former colonies around the world that just because they gained independence, it doesn't mean their whole situation just improved like that,” says Aka Niviâna, a 30-year-old Inuk poet and actor.


	On a rare sunny afternoon, we take a walk up to the Egede statue, where a few tourists mill around snapping pictures. The statue has bothered Niviâna ever since she was a teen, and she still drives past it each day on her way to work. If she had her way, the missionary eyesore would be replaced by Arnarulunnguaq, the legendary Inuit woman explorer who traversed the Northwest Passage by sled dog. Her views about Denmark, however, have grown more complicated with age.


	Niviâna was eight when she moved to Copenhagen with her parents in search of better opportunities. She lost her language, but says the cosmopolitan exposure was a “gift” that awakened her to native struggles around the world, from Standing Rock to the Marshall Islands. On returning home at age 22, she rekindled her Inuit identity. She got a traditional chin tattoo, or talloquteq — two parallel lines from chin to lip — later complemented by “healing dots” that recede from her eyes. She wrote poetry and performed onstage to raise awareness about the gathering impact of climate change on her homeland.


	Despite having no film experience, she caught the attention in 2022 of a casting director for True Detective: Night Country and got the part of Agent Navarro's sister, a troubled soul who ends her life by stripping naked and walking out into the ice. 


	Niviâna's debut is haunting — the kind of virtuoso performance that brims with lived pain and grief.

	











	Not long after she moved back to Greenland in 2020, vandals splashed the Egede statue with red paint and Inuit symbols. Niviâna was by then a prominent voice in the debate about decolonization and faced charges for the vandalism. She denied being involved and was ultimately acquitted, but the police case staggered on for almost two years and drove her to attempt suicide. 


	“Nuuk is a small place, a village really,” and “the intensity of the internet debate,” she says, “and the fear that I can't be safe in my own community anymore became too much.” 


	The ordeal moved her to be more outspoken about mental health and depression, topics that are becoming less taboo. Greenland has one the highest suicide rates in the world, and it is the leading cause of death among young men. Niviâna says the epidemic stems from a tangle of factors spanning isolation, poverty, alcoholism, and domestic abuse, all compounded by the “hangover of intergenerational trauma.”


	And yet for all the inequalities and racism that persist, Niviâna recognizes the social benefits of living in the Danish realm. “If you compare [us] to the natives living in the U.S., I think we are in a bit better situation,” she says, citing the free health care and education provided by the Nordic welfare state. At the same time, she acknowledges the groundswell of anger toward Denmark. “And I feel it, too — I feel enraged. You hear about the billions of dollars taken out of the land, and so much poverty.”


	“At the end of the day, I think most people want independence,” she goes on. “But I think for me, the older I get, the more I hesitate.” The birth of her first child, in 2023, was like a splash of cold water on her separatist politics. “So we declare independence within the next few years, and we realize ‘Fuck, that was a bad idea,' and then we go bankrupt; and we're super poor and even worse [than] right now. I'm not willing to risk anything like that anymore.”

	











	Given Greenland's overdependence on fishing and that more than 40 percent of its people are employed by the state, Niviâna believes it will take a long time before the country has the economic foundation to go it alone. Ahead of the March elections, she was producing videos for Atassut, a small liberal movement that favors continued solidarity with Denmark. Her stance puts her at odds with many Greenlandic friends who want independence. “The conversation right now is ‘either-or,' but I'm trying to hold onto these nuances because it's not that simple,” she says. “My daughter should not have to pay for my impatience in her life.”


	In the subzero hours before dawn, Jørgen Inugsuttoq steers his skiff out of Nuuk's harbor, gliding past one of the Danish navy's aging gray frigates. The city of nearly 20,000 soon disappears behind a promontory, and he leans into the wind scanning the water for fish and stray blocks of ice. The barrel-chested 77-year-old says he's been hunting and fishing year-round since he was a boy and “would not trade this life for anything.” His labors have enabled him to raise five children, and he's instructed all of them: “Do not follow my path. It's too difficult!”

“THE CONVERSATION IS ‘EITHER-OR,' BUT I'M TRYING TO HOLD ONTO NUANCES BECAUSE IT'S NOT SIMPLE.”


	He takes us to a favorite fishing spot in a glassy cove ringed with crags, and deckhand Andreas Olsen pays out a line. At the dock, the state-owned company pays as low as $1.20 per pound of cod. By the time that catch reaches a grocer in Copenhagen, it could sell for more than 10 times that amount or higher. 


	“Our earnings cover our costs and not much more; we should be making a lot more than we do,” Olsen laments, echoing a frustration shared by many Greenlandic fishermen. At 35, he has yet to start a family.


	The bounty of cod, halibut, prawns, and snow crab in Greenland's waters account for more than 90 percent of its national exports. Nearly all of it is sent directly to Denmark. According to Vittus Qujaukitsoq, a former minister of finance who heads an association of fishermen and hunters, the industry could help the country stand on its own feet but remains hamstrung by Danish-imposed quotas and “ridiculously low” procurement prices that limit tax revenues at home. “Denmark is gaining between 14 billion and 21 billion Danish krone [$2 billion to $3 billion] for the same fish that we catch on an annual basis,” he explains. He says the Danish state earns handsome tax revenues on the true export value. Based on his organization's analysis, if Greenland received an even cost value for all the commodities being exported, the country would gain around $262 million in annual revenues. “We could easily fund our independence with fishing revenues.” 


	Several years ago, while serving as chairman of a shipping company, Fencker tried to broker a deal to sell cod directly to a U.S. processor to reduce supply-chain costs, only to see the company “ousted” by the Danes. He claims Danish food authorities mandated that all the fish caught in Greenland had to be shipped to Denmark before they could be sold on to the U.S. One of his goals is to enact reforms that keep more of the value added in Greenland. For now, lean livelihoods compel many fishermen to supplement their income with hunting.


	With cod running low this time of year, Inugsuttoq and Olsen spool in their lines and unsheathe .22-caliber rifles. A speedboat and gun may be easier to manage than the kayak and harpoon pairing used by their forefathers, but seals remain an elusive quarry. In two hours of prowling the water, the men take more than a dozen shots at passing pods — and miss them all — until a lone seal pops up about 30 yards in front of the boat. “Got him!” Olsen exclaims, and Inugsuttoq throttles forward so he can follow up with a kill shot.

	











	The men disembark on a barren islet and haul the seal up to be butchered. Although the EU has banned the import of seal products, there is an exemption for Greenlandic hunters using traditional methods. Olsen claims the meat will fetch a mere $3.30 a pound in the local market, the pelt about $65. “It will sell for much, much more in Europe,” he says with a sigh. 


	The emerging narrative in Greenland and abroad is that resource extraction could be the best pathway to economic freedom. A 2023 survey showed that 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland, including graphite, copper, nickel, lithium, uranium, titanium, and gold, as well as an estimated 1.5 million metric tons of rare earths, said to be worth between $30 billion and $70 billion. Demand for rare earths — used in artificial intelligence and energy-transition technologies from electric-car engines to wind turbines and electronics — already outstrips supply, and it's expected to keep growing. Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg have invested in companies that are prospecting in Greenland, along with Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick.


	But there's no reason to expect windfall profits anytime soon. For starters, Greenland is a tough place to do business. Infrastructure is minimal, and there are virtually no intercity roads. Ports are few, and freezing ice obstructs maritime access. A lack of manpower and technical training means a lot of labor must be imported. Private ownership of land is forbidden (residents can own their homes, not the land on which they sit), as are new licenses for oil and gas extraction. And while everyone agrees mining will play a pivotal role in the country's future, there's a robust environmental movement backed by strict laws to ensure Mother Nature is protected. In the last election cycle, the governing party campaigned — and won — on a pledge to stop a rare-earth project in southern Greenland that would have dug up radioactive elements. 


	“Right now, we don't really have a mining sector,” says Naaja Nathanielsen, the minister for mineral resources, noting that of the more than 100 government licenses granted, only one mine is operational. (Just one license is held by an American company, which is exploring rare earths.) “It takes 16 years to develop a mine, and in that period of time, you just spend a lot of money — you don't really earn a lot of money — so there's a gap there because there are not a lot of investors willing to take such a high risk over such a long period of time.” A ruby mine went bankrupt last year; others remain on hold due to funding shortages. 

“IT'S MORE THAN MOUNTAIN AND MINERALS — IT'S WHERE WE RELAX WITH OUR FAMILIES.”


	Greenland only gained authority over its underground resources in 2010, after securing self-rule from Denmark. Days before my arrival, a controversial documentary called White Gold of Greenland screened in Nuuk and inflamed an old wound. The filmmakers allege that the exploitation of cryolite, a rare mineral used in aluminum production that was mined on Greenland's west coast from 1854 to 1987, generated Danish companies and the state nearly $58.5 billion before reserves ran out. (Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt has said the figures were exaggerated, and the film was pulled by Denmark's national broadcaster.) Nathanielsen calls it “another brick in the wall” in the exploitation of Greenland's resources: “You can debate the numbers, but not the power structure.” She keeps a hunk of cryolite on a wooden stand in her office, a symbol of both betrayal and potential.


	“Today it's our hands at the steering wheel,” she asserts. “Everybody asks the companies, can you provide jobs? Can you make sure that you don't mess everything up environmentally? And if the companies can say ‘yes and yes,' then people are very open to their projects. If they can't, they're gonna shut it out — like the instance with [Narsaq and uranium].”

	











	When the bad weather finally breaks, I try to book a flight to Narsaq, the southern hamlet that edges the largest rare-earth field in the country. Flights are backlogged, so I hop on a twin prop to Narsarsuaq, the nearest airport. Beyond the windows, rugged mountains vanish into a foreboding white abyss: the ice sheet, which blankets some 80 percent of the country and is more than two miles deep in places. We land at an old U.S.-military-built airstrip. And I hustle down to the port to catch a boat that bears us through a jaw-dropping fjord, past hardscrabble farms and icebergs that glow like emeralds in the fading light.


	Narsaq is a postcard town of some 1,300 people dotted with A-frame houses in primary colors. But the mountains that rise behind it are home to Kvanefjeld (or Kuannersuit in Greenlandic), a deposit that holds a quarter of the world's rare earth minerals, making it a strategic lodestone. Oleeraq Nielsen, the caretaker of the local museum, escorts me through a special wing, past gold and rubies to a dazzling spread of rare earths like terbium and neodymium, essential components in smartphones, wind turbines, and electric cars. China controls some 60 percent of the world's rare earth elements and processes 85 percent of those (and has banned their export on national-security grounds) — a market dominance that has compelled the U.S. and other countries to start diversifying their sources to avoid supply-chain disruptions. “We're not stupid,” Nielsen says. “We know these minerals can save our economy.”


	The museum, like the new gym and handball team, were sponsored in part by Energy Transition Minerals, a Chinese-backed Australian company that acquired a license in 2007 and has invested more than $150 million developing Kvanefjeld. The company estimates the holding is worth $7.5 billion, and initially drew support from locals in a hard-up economy dependent on fishing, hunting, and livestock. Enthusiasm began to ebb when people learned that uranium and other radioactive substances would be unearthed, risking permanent damage to a pristine environment.


	“We are living side by side with nature,” says Mariane Paviasen, a soft-spoken yet stoic former heliport operator who ran for parliament to stop the project. She adds, “We cannot risk our home being destroyed for the next generation.”


	When Greenlanders went to the polls in 2021, Paviasen's Inuit Ataqatigiit party was swept to power as part of a left-wing government that banned uranium mining, effectively locking down Kvanefjeld. Now, Energy Transition Minerals is suing Greenland's government, demanding the right to exploit the deposit or receive compensation of up to $11.5 billion — the value of the holdings, plus interest. Trump's threats have spurred the company's shareholder prices to more than quadruple. An arbitration case is expected to be resolved by the end of the year, and it's unclear whether the new government will allow the project to proceed or not.


	Paviasen had just come from Nuuk to do some campaigning. She mourns how the looming project has stymied her town's rebound after years of decline due to the closure of its shrimp factory. “If you came in the summertime, you'd see a lot of potential for agriculture and tourism. Everybody was working, and we were developing the right way.” These days, hostels around town are boarded up, and more people are decamping for larger cities. “It makes me so sad that we have lost many years.” The reluctant politician says she longs to return to the quiet life, but with uncertainty over the pending court ruling, and Trump's threats, she doesn't think she'll be able to rest anytime soon. “It seems like my party is the only one that is saying a direct ‘no' to uranium.”


	The next morning, Avaaraq Bendtsen, a plucky 26-year-old activist and Paviasen protégé, drives me out to the base of Kvanefjeld. We pass the heliport where she protested a February visit by Energy Transition ­Minerals executives who expressed their hopes that the next government would repeal its uranium ban, an episode that left Bendtsen “shaking mad.” “How about us indigenous people?” she asks, ticking off a list of historic cases in Greenland and abroad where foreign companies exploited native resources, then left the land with the damage. “They've been playing us for years. Do we even matter?”

	











	Beyond the town limits, Kvanefjeld's snow-covered flank sweeps into the clouds, its bounty hidden for the time being. “It's a lot more than a mountain and just minerals — this is where we pick our berries, this is where we hunt, this is where we relax with our families,” Bendtsen says. “I'm going to keep fighting for this until I die — no matter who comes to try and take it.”

“I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS UNTIL I DIE — NO MATTER WHO COMES TO TRY AND TAKE IT.”


	On the eve of Greenland's March 11 election, President Trump softened his tone, posting on social media: “The United States strongly supports the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future,” he posted. “We will continue to KEEP YOU SAFE, as we have since World War II. We are ready to INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to create new jobs and MAKE YOU RICH — and, if you so choose, we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World, the United States of America!”


	When all the votes were tallied, the pro-business Demokraatit Party came in first. Fencker's party, Naleraq, the rapid-independence party that wants more collaboration with the United States, was a close second, doubling its seat holdings from the prior election. Demokraatit supports market reforms and innovation, opening an opportunity for the Trump administration that didn't exist under the previous, left-wing government, according to Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a ­professor of political science at the Uni­versity of Copenhagen. “The fact that a large part of the electorate has supported parties in favor of an independence referendum means positions on the board are much more favorable to President Trump's designs on Greenland.''


	Days after the election, however, the top five parties issued a joint statement rejecting Trump's annexation threats as “unacceptable.” Greenland's new coalition government will have to grapple with critical issues like the pace of independence, the future of stalled mining projects, and how to deal with a capricious U.S. administration. No one expects American warships to appear off-shore anytime soon — though no one can completely rule it out, either.


	For now, a kind of soft-power offensive is underway. In January, Donald Trump Jr. landed his father's “Trump Force One” for a five-hour visit to Nuuk. Accompanied by right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk and other hangers-on, Trump Jr. was all smiles and good cheer, telling a local broadcaster, “We're here as tourists to see this incredible place.” His team hosted a lunch at the top-floor restaurant of the Hotel Hans Egede, where a group of locals enjoyed a free buffet meal. (One down-and-out attendee wearing a MAGA hat tells me he was invited off the street and gifted $200 cash.) Trump Jr. also posed for a photo in front of the Egede statue. 

	











	His guide for the day was Jørgen Boassen, a.k.a. “Trump's Greenlandic son,” a blunt 50-year-old bricklayer who traveled to the U.S. to campaign for him in Pennsylvania. He picks me up wearing a Thug Life T-shirt featuring the president, and we head to a shopping-mall cafe to meet with his friend Tom Dans, a smooth-talking venture capitalist working his cellphone in a Trump pullover and camo stars-and-stripes hat. The pair had just wrapped a three-week tour as part of Dans' latest project, American Daybreak, a nonprofit that aims to foster closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland. Between media interviews, they traveled south to pay homage to U.S. servicemen whose boat was sunk in February 1943 off the coast by a German sub; and north of the Arctic Circle to promote a dogsled race, co-sponsored by the U.S. Consulate, that Dans likens to “Greenland's Super Bowl.” 


	Dans says his interest stretches back to his grandfather, a merchant mariner who sailed to the island during World War II and helped build the Thule base afterward. Dans first dealt with the president in the early 1990s as a cub banker in New York, when Trump was trying to buy the Miss Universe pageant. During his first term, Trump appointed Dans to the Arctic Research Commission and Treasury. “It was classified, but broadly speaking, the point of departure was: Greenland wants to be independent. How do you help an asset-rich, cash-poor country get there?”


	Dans is sober about the difficulties of building up Greenland's mining industry. In the near term, he says, “there's opportunity for less capital-intensive businesses that could be really profitable,” touting real estate potential and fisheries. “Tourism is a money spinner, too — if they do it right.” Starting on June 14, twice-weekly direct flights will begin between New York and Nuuk.

“WE ARE NOT STUPID. WE KNOW THAT THESE [RARE EARTH] MINERALS CAN SAVE OUR ECONOMY.”


	One of Dans' other lines of work is procuring icebreakers to help strengthen America's hand in the north. When I raise Trump's threats to take over Greenland, he sidesteps: “I think he's a dealmaker first, and there's a deal to be had.” Dans would like to see the U.S. and Greenland cement a mutually beneficial partnership that “ensures U.S. security, protection, and economic depth.” 


	The day before his departure, on Feb. 14, Dans paid a visit to the Katuaq Cultural Center, where a painting by artist Kristian Keto Christiansen is on display. In the painting, a Trump hotel shimmers as troops swarm and a Chinook helicopter hauls away a sling load. In the foreground, Trump, wielding an oar, stares down at a mineral deposit. On his Twitter account (with @realDonaldTrump copied), Dans posted a photo of the artwork, exclaiming: “Hang it in the Louvre!” Today, the painting's price tag reads “Not for sale.”

	











	In late March, a U.S. delegation led by J.D. Vance flew to the Pituffik Space Base. His wife, Usha, was initially scheduled to head the group, which included National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, with plans to attend the national dogsled race, until a furor broke out in Greenland and forced a change of plans to avoid ­protesters. Prime Minister Egede blasted the uncoordinated visit as an aggressive “provocation.” 


	Vance, the highest-level U.S. official to ever visit Greenland, joked on arriving that “it's cold as shit here!” before taking aim at Denmark. “You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,” he said, alleging that “underinvestment” has left U.S. military forces and Greenlanders exposed to incursions by Russia, China, and other nations taking “an extraordinary interest” in Arctic passageways and minerals. “When the president says, ‘We've got to have Greenland,' ” Vance commented, “he's saying, ‘This island is not safe.' ” Tempering Trump's annexation talk, Vance pledged respect for Greenland's sovereignty. But the next day, Trump said in an interview: “There's a good possibility that we could do it without military force.” Then he added, “This is world peace, this is international security. I don't take anything off the table.”


	Nathanielsen remains cool amid all of the chaos. Seated in an office that looks out onto the capital's main commercial strip, she says Greenland has always had an “open door” to the U.S. military and potential investors, adding that she suspects the president's fixation on her homeland may ultimately be about something else. “I lean towards the idea of expansionism: More than just money and security, [Trump's focus] is about positioning America in a new way in the world” through grand territorial claims. Recent threats to annex Canada and take back the Panama Canal, along with his penchant for renaming mountains and bodies of water, seem to affirm her notion. “In this country, we have a saying that men of a certain age get into the building of statues, to leave a legacy behind.”


	The minister smiles, then makes a sincere appeal. “Come and do business, but please respect we're a democracy. We have pride, you know. We're Greenlanders, and this is our land.”

	Fulton County prosecutors have filed a motion to revoke the probation of Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug, who was released from jail in October 2024.


	According to Channel 2 Action News, prosecutors accused the artist, born Jeffery Williams, of having “engaged in conduct that threatens the safety of witnesses and prosecutors, compromises ongoing legal proceedings, and warrants immediate revocation of probation.” The filing continues to claim that “the integrity of this court, and the safety of those involved in this prosecution are at stake.”


	Williams took to X following news of the motion, writing, “I don't make treats to people I'm a good person, I would never condone anyone threatening anyone or definitely participate in threatening anyone.” He added, “I'm all about peace and love.”


	“This motion is baseless. While intimidation and threats of violence are never appropriate, Jeffery Williams has done nothing wrong,” said Williams' lawyer, Brian Steel. “We look forward to seeking a dismissal of this petition.”

	











	The rapper spent more than two years behind bars after he was arrested and charged in the massive YSL gang case. He secured his release after pleading no contest to racketeering and gang charges, as well as guilty to drug, gun, and a lesser gang charge. 


	Williams was sentenced to time served, 15 years of probation, and a “backloaded” consecutive sentence of 20 years that would go into effect if he violates the terms of his probation. Per the terms, the artist is prohibited from associating with other known gang members or co-defendants in the trial (except his frequent collaborator Gunna). Williams is also barred from promoting gang activity in any way, must stay away from the Atlanta metro area for 10 years (with the exception of significant events such as weddings or funerals), and must give several anti-gang and anti-violence presentations.

A bone-chilling document declassified by the CIA has exposed an alleged massacre by aliens from a crashed UFO who turned an entire military unit into stone.

According to the report, Soviet troops shot down a flying saucer hovering over the Soviet military unit in Siberia roughly 35 years ago, and what happened next was truly terrifying.

In the document, summarizing a 250-page top secret file acquired by US intelligence agents, eyewitnesses said five aliens climbed out of their wrecked craft, combined themselves into one creature, exploded in a burst of intense energy, and turned 23 soldiers into solid rock.

One CIA official referred to the shocking battle as 'a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.' 

The agency added that the 'extremely menacing case' proved the aliens who visited Earth possessed weapons and technology far beyond the US government's 'assumptions' - suggesting they were already aware of the aliens' existence.

The unearthed document, declassified in 2000, was recently the topic of the AI or Evil podcast, where host Josh Hooper revealed that two of the soldiers at the UFO crash site actually survived the encounter.

However, the 23 'petrified soldiers' could not be saved. Their remains and the debris from the spacecraft were reportedly moved to a secret research base near Moscow.

An even more detail of the CIA file is description of the aliens reportedly involved in this massacre has been mentioned in UFO reports and sightings for nearly 80 years.

The subject of the document states: 'Paper reports alleged evidence on mishap involving UFO.'

This extraordinary tale was also published in the Ukrainian newspaper Holos Ukrayiny on March 27, 1993.

The incident, which a Canadian newspaper believed took place between 1989 and 1990, was only uncovered by the CIA after the fall of the Soviet Union and its 'secret police' organization, the KGB. 

The CIA document explained that the alleged alien craft was flying low and quietly above the Soviet unit while they were engaged in a training mission.

Officials wrote that 'for unknown reasons' the Soviets launched a surface-to-air missile at the UFO, sending it crashing to the Earth near the unit's position.

According to the only two soldiers who survived, when the soldiers approached the craft, the five aliens freed themselves of the debris and came close together near the wreck.

Moments later, the soldiers said the group of aliens 'merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape.' In simpler language, the aliens beings somehow morphed into a giant ball.

That's when the new ball-like alien began to buzz and hiss before igniting into a brilliant white light.

With the soldiers still looking on, the ball of light erupted like a giant flare of energy, turning 23 of the 25 Soviets into 'stone poles.'

The report stated that the only reason two of the men survived was because they were standing in a shaded area at the time of the alien energy blast.

Testing of the soldier's bodies showed the alien flare had somehow changed living tissue into a substance that closely resembles limestone.

The CIA document added that 'a source of energy that is still unknown to Earthlings' was responsible for the blast which fatally transformed the Soviets.

Even in 2025, the science behind such a shocking transformation is still difficult to explain medically and technologically.

According to the Journal of Applied Physics, it is possible to use high-energy radiation or electromagnetic pulses to change normal matter into plasma - a form that's not a liquid, solid, or gas.

In the report, the CIA described the aliens as short humanoids with 'large heads and large black eyes.'

The account matches who UFO researchers, alleged alien abductees, and others who believe in alien life refer to as a race called 'the Greys.'

Their features have become the classic image the public thinks of when discussing aliens from outer space - a small, skinny, grey-skinned alien, with an oversized head and large black eyes with no iris.

The Greys would eventually become linked to the infamous Roswell Incident of 1947, as CIA documents would later suggest that alien beings were pulled from the alleged wreck in New Mexico.

These strange creatures would also go on to represent alien life in countless science fiction shows and movies, including Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Despite their prominent place in extraterrestrial research, this disturbing incident appears to be the first time humans have alleged that these beings could have accomplished such terrifying feats.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Fifteen years after its release, just about the only people still buying the Microsoft Kinect are ghost hunters who claim the motion-sensing camera is the perfect tool for paranormal investigations.

The body-tracking camera, which was discontinued in 2017, is now enjoying a spirited afterlife outside of video games by helping paranormal investigators, like the Ghost Adventures team, in their attempts at documenting the afterlife.

The Kinect's ability to convert the data from its body-tracking sensors into an on-screen skeletal dummy delights these investigators, who allege the figures it shows in empty spaces are, in fact, spirits of the departed.

As per The Verge, the Kinect has become particularly popular with ghost-hunting YouTubers in their never-ending quest to prove there are spooks all around us.

“The Kinect's popularity as a depth camera for ghost hunting stems from its ability to detect depth and create stick-figure representations of humanoid shapes, making it easier to identify potential human-like forms, even if faint or translucent,” says Sam Ashford, founder of ghost-hunting equipment store SpiritShack.

The secret to spotting ghosts comes from the first-generation Kinect's structured light system. By projecting a grid of infrared dots into an environment – even in darkness – and reading the resulting pattern, the Kinect can detect ‘deformations in the projection' and, through a machine-learning algorithm, deduce human limbs within those deformations.

The Kinect then converts that data into a visual representation of a stick figure, which, in its previous life, made it possible to play games like Dance Central and Kinect Sports. Ghost hunters have, however, rebranded the Kinect as a “structured light sensor” (SLS) camera.

“The user will direct the camera to a certain point of the room where they believe activity to be present,” says Andy Bailey, founder of a gear shop for ghost hunters. “The subject area will be absent of human beings. However, the camera will often calculate and display the presence of a skeletal image.”

Bailey does urge caution, telling would-be ghost hunters that the cameras are best paired with “other equipment to provide an additional layer of supporting evidence.”

So, did Microsoft, while trying to break Nintendo Wii's stranglehold on the motion-gaming market, accidentally create a tool that allows us to glimpse the afterlife? Sadly, the tech bros say no.

The Kinect is designed to ‘see' human figures wherever it is pointed, whether the ‘presence' is a real human, a lamp, or just a puff of dust.

Jon Wood, a science performer who has a show devoted to examining ghost-hunting equipment, says the Kinect does much the same as our brain “trying to make sense of the randomness”, except it cannot overrule its hunches, and therefore even a shadow would appear to look like a solid figure.

“We may recognise the face of Jesus in a piece of toast or an elephant in a rock formation.”

This doesn't deter ghost-hunters, though. Setting up a Kinect in a room with infra-red lights everywhere and numerous torches in shaky hands flashing about is guaranteed to give it something to misinterperet as a ghost – and even the flimsiest ‘evidence' of life after death gets clicks.



“If a person pays good money to enjoy a ghost hunt, what are they after?” Wood asks. “They prime themselves for a ‘spooky encounter' and open up to the suggestion of anything being ‘evidence of a ghost' — they want to find a ghost, so they make sure they do.”

Rather disappointing, isn't it? Despite all the technology in the world, it would seem the only real way to see a ghost is by being born with die helm.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Cryptid+Sightings","The Loveland Frogman by Any Other Name Is Still a Cryptid","https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/strange-creatures/loveland-frogman.htm","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:15:03 GMT","

The Loveland Frogman is a legendary creature said to lurk near the Little Miami River region, 15 miles (24 km) outside the city limits of Cincinnati, Ohio. Reports of this bizarre being describe a frog-like humanoid monster, standing roughly 4 feet (1.2 m) tall on its hind legs, with large reptilian eyes bulging from a round, scaly head.

The Loveland Frogman has been a part of Ohio folklore for decades, with sightings dating back to the 1950s. Some witnesses claim the creature has magical abilities and can even emit sparks, while others believe it is simply a misidentified animal.

Advertisement

The legend has captured the imaginations of cryptid enthusiasts, inspiring everything from local t-shirts to eerie camp stories. So, is this a new kind of rare, unidentified amphibian species, or is it just another cryptid legend?

The first well-known sighting of the Loveland Frog occurred in 1955 when a man driving near the Little Miami River reported seeing three strange beings standing by the roadside.

He described them as humanoid but distinctly frog-like, with webbed hands and leathery skin. Once the eyewitness tried to get closer to the scene, the frog creatures quickly disappeared into the night.

Advertisement

Over the years, additional reports surfaced, keeping the legend alive. Some claimed the creature was closer to a lizard, leading to the alternate name ""Loveland Lizard."" However, the most famous encounters were yet to come.

One of the most well-documented sightings involved a Loveland police officer in 1972. The officer reported seeing a large, frog-like creature jump across the road on its hind legs before disappearing into the water.

In a similar event just a few weeks later, another officer, Mark Matthews, later shot and killed what he believed was the Loveland Frog ... but he later recanted, saying it was a large iguana that had lost its tail.

Despite this explanation, the legend persisted. The idea that a mysterious amphibious humanoid may inhabit Ohio waterways continues to fascinate cryptid hunters.

The legend of the Loveland Frog saw renewed interest in 2016 when Sam Jacobs and his girlfriend claimed to have spotted the creature while playing Pokémon Go near the Little Miami River.

According to Jacobs, he saw a giant frog that stood up on its hind legs in the water and stared at them with large, glowing frog eyes for a moment before quickly disappearing — an encounter eerily similar to earlier reports.

The teens captured some dark and grainy video footage on their phones. Although, when the still photo was enhanced and studied, it appeared to be an attempted hoax.

This sighting reignited interest in the Loveland Frog with cryptid enthusiasts and Ohio locals once again, leading the town to adopt a ""frog prince"" mascot in 2023.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I moved from the Midwest to Florida for my husband's job. Now, I don't ever want to leave our city on the Emerald Coast.","https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-midwest-to-florida-for-job-love-destin-emerald-coast-2025-4","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:58:00 GMT","

When my husband's military assignment brought us to Destin, I never imagined I'd fall in love with it so much.

We'd previously never visited the Florida Panhandle before or even considered living on the Emerald Coast. Then, the military gave us three weeks to find a home, pack up our lives, and relocate to Destin for his job.

Moving away from the familiarities of the Midwest was scary, but we've learned to love our slow-paced life in Destin.

Although Destin isn't huge, it's growing — and our county has a population of about 200,000 people.

My hometown of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is similar in size population-wise, and my husband grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs — one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the Midwest.

Even though I appreciated my small-town upbringing, I missed the luxuries of living in a bigger city. Growing up, we'd have to drive four hours to Minneapolis if we wanted to do some real shopping at the Mall of America or attend a bigger concert downtown.

After we moved to Destin, I was surprised by the abundance of big-city amenities right at my doorstep. Within a 20-minute drive, we have access to multiple shopping centers with everything from well-known retailers to adorable local boutiques.

Our favorite shopping centers include the open-air Destin Commons, the bustling Silver Sands Outlet Mall, and the upscale Grand Boulevard. These lively spots often host weekly farmers' markets, annual festivals, and holiday events throughout the year.

The Destin area is also filled with restaurants, coffee shops, and lively beach bars. My husband and I love getting to enjoy the sunset with a happy-hour cocktail in hand.

When announcing our move to Florida, one of my best friends said I was so lucky to be near 30A. I didn't know what 30A was. 

Turns out, it's a picturesque highway along the Gulf of Mexico lined with idyllic seaside towns that's been nicknamed ""the Hamptons of the South.""

While its town of Seaside has a relaxed beach vibe with pastel-colored homes and white-picket fences, nearby Rosemary Beach features a European-inspired design and cobblestone streets.

Having 30A just a short drive away has been one of the best parts of living in Destin — especially in the offseason. It's now one of my favorite areas to visit.

Living in a city where others vacation was an entirely new experience for us.

Our first visit to 30A was anything but smooth, as we waited for hours in summer traffic and circled endlessly for a parking spot. During our first Labor Day weekend as Floridians, we were naively surprised by the sheer number of boaters at our iconic Crab Island sandbar.

After that, we quickly learned to make the most of Destin's offseason. Late spring through early fall is packed with tourists, but the winter season is slower, with only a few flocks of snowbirds.

Most vacationers choose Orlando or Miami in the winter for sunny beach days. Meanwhile, our offseason is relatively calm due to cooler weather. 

This quieter time allows us to try popular restaurants and visit attractions that are often overtaken by tourists in the summer.

Having a strong sense of community is incredibly important to us, especially since my husband is a military pilot who travels often for work.

Fortunately, there's no shortage of Southern hospitality on the Emerald Coast.

Despite our thick Midwestern accents, locals have made us feel right at home. While moving into our house, multiple neighbors greeted us with homemade goodies. 

People here are pretty friendly, and even a quick grocery run comes with friendly conversations at the checkout line.

Preparing for our first hurricane truly showcased the kindness of the locals. Our neighbors helped us prepare by giving us much-needed guidance on preparing our house and running our generator.

I'm not sure where the military will take us next, but we hope to stick around Destin for a while.

As a travel enthusiast, I've visited some of the world's best beaches in Croatia, Thailand, Hawaii, Greece, and the Caribbean. Even still, Destin's sugar-white sand and emerald waters surpass them all.

We still can't believe we live 10 minutes from the ocean, let alone some of the best beaches in the US.

Whether it's a winter walk on the beach or a stroll through the enchanting side streets of 30A with a warm coffee in hand, we never take this coastal paradise for granted.

RH CEO Gary Friedman watched the luxury furniture retailer's stock tank during its earnings conference call with analysts Wednesday amid the unveiling of President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

Two words summed up the situation:

""Oh, sh--. OK. ... I just looked at the screen. I hadn't looked at it. It got hit when I think the tariffs came out. And everybody can see in our 10-K where we're sourcing from, so it's not a secret, and we're not trying to disguise it by putting everything in an Asia bucket.""

The company's shares plunged more than 40% as investors responded to the double whammy of RH releasing its poor earnings report and Trump's levies on foreign countries. If that move holds through Thursday's session, it would mark the California-based company's worst day in its 13-year history on the public market.

Directly following Friedman's expletive, the chief executive's explanation of where the hit came from alluded to Trump announcing his controversial tariffs on imports to the U.S. on Wednesday afternoon.

Stock market futures cratered Wednesday night as Trump's tariffs were announced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1,600 points at session lows on Thursday as the fallout continued.

Friedman said it's ""not a secret"" that RH sources from Asia, but noted that most other large players in the home sector did the same.

Notably, Trump slapped levies of 46% on Vietnam and 32% on Taiwan. China's true tariff rate rose to 54% following the new increases unveiled during the White House announcement.

""Anybody of scale in the home business has a high percentage of their content coming out of Asia,"" he said. ""Anybody who says they don't, that would just shock me.""

These duties offer yet another challenge for the seller of products like rugs and dinning tables. RH, whose stock capped off its worst quarter since 2020 this week, has already been contending with what Friedman described as the toughest housing market in around half of a century.

Specifically, Friedman pointed out to analysts that there were 4.09 million existing homes sold in the U.S. in 1978, when the country had a population of 223 million. In 2024, while the population shot up to 341 million, just 4.06 million homes were sold.

""The fact is we've been operating in the worst housing market in almost 50 years,"" he said.

Still, Friedman said RH has been able to perform ""at a level most would expect in a robust housing market."" Despite this statement, the company missed earnings expectations for the quarter and offered weak revenue guidance, with Friedman telling analysts to prepare for a ""higher-risk business environment"" due to market volatility and inflation risks in addition to tariffs.

RH earned $1.58 per share, excluding items, on $812 million in revenue for the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by LSEG predicted $1.92 in earnings per share and $830 million in revenue.

Looking forward, the company told investors to expect revenue growth of between 12.5% and 13.5% in the current quarter and within a range of 10% to 13% for the full year. Both missed consensus forecasts of analysts polled by FactSet, who penciled in growth at 16.2% for the first quarter and 14% for the year.

While Friedman attributed some of the stock's decline to the threat of tariffs, he said the company wasn't caught without a plan. Though RH hasn't yet shared details, Friedman said there's a long-term strategy for sourcing that is ""big and bold"" — and could see its timeline moved up as a result of the new policy.

""This move is quite stunning,"" Friedman said of Trump's trade announcement. ""It's going to force everyone to just play a different game.""

            It's unclear why the charge was dismissed.
    


            McIntyre said he was “pleased but not surprised” the charge was dropped and called the experience “traumatic” in a statement issued through Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy.
    


            “By falsely accusing me of a violent crime and having me jailed, Congresswoman Mace demonstrated her desire to criminalize anyone who advocates for the needs of our trans youth,” his statement reads.
    


            McIntyre's lawyer declined to comment on the matter. CNN has reached out to the US attorney's office in Washington, DC, for comment.
    


            Asked in December about Mace's claim, Capitol Police said it received a report from a member of Congress' office regarding an incident in the Rayburn House Office Building. Officers and agents with the Threat Assessment Section arrested a suspect, charging them with assaulting a government official, the agency said.
    


            Mace told law enforcement the person placed their hands over hers and “began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion” for a few seconds, according to a police filing.
    


            The filing also showed she said McIntyre stated “trans youth deserve advocacy” during the shaking motion. Following the interaction in December, Mace posted on X that she was “physically accosted” by “a pro-tr*ns man.”
    


            McIntyre is the co-founder of the Illinois chapter of Foster Care Alumni and was present to celebrate the 25th anniversary of a law expanding federal support for foster care, according to The Washington Post.
    


            After prosecutors dropped the charges, Mace said she “won't back down.”
    


            “I filed charges, and they were inexplicably ignored. But I will not be. I will not back down. I will not be intimidated. And I sure as hell won't stay silent,” Mace said in a statement to CNN.
    


            The Imprint first reported the charge had been dismissed.
    


            Despite previously calling herself “pro-transgender rights,” Mace introduced a resolution in November to ban transgender women from using women's restrooms at the Capitol and filed broader legislation that would apply to every federal building and federally funded school.
    


            The Republican lawmaker also used a phrase considered a slur to refer to transgender people during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February. Her comments were challenged by Democratic Rep.Gerry Connolly of Virginia, prompting the congresswoman to double down on the slur and respond with, “I don't really care.”

Follow:


            The White House has fired multiple administration officials, including at least three National Security Council staffers, three sources familiar with the move told CNN.
    


            The firings came after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist who once claimed 9/11 was an inside job, urged President Donald Trump during a Wednesday meeting to get rid of several members of his National Security Council staff, including his principal deputy national security adviser, claiming that they are disloyal.
    


            One of the sources said Loomer had compiled a list of roughly a dozen names, and that the subsequent firings were a direct result of the meeting with Loomer, who was an influential voice around Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall.
    


            Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Alex Wong was not among those who had been dismissed on Wednesday. However, one White House official speculated to CNN Thursday that Wong could be out as soon as today, though a final decision remains to be seen.
    


            Wong was one of the advisers specifically targeted by Loomer, who publicly questioned his loyalty to Trump and criticized him privately as a “Never Trumper.”
    


            One of the sources speculated that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz may have been reluctant to fire Wong because he has been embroiled in the controversy surrounding the leak of controversial Signal messages related to military strikes on Yemen that Waltz and his team have been under fire for initiating.
    


            The three officials fired include Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence and a former top staffer for now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Senate Intelligence Committee; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs who previously served as Waltz's legislative director in Congress; and David Feith, a senior director overseeing technology and national security who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.
    


            “NSC doesn't comment on personnel matters,” NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN.
    


            All of the officials who were fired went through the same vetting process in the last several months — which included questions about loyalty to Trump's agenda — that was run by the now-director of the Presidential Personnel Office, Sergio Gor.
    


            Loomer didn't offer details on the meeting but said she'd “continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting.”
    


            “Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I'm going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump,” Loomer told CNN on Thursday. “It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security.”
    


            The incident marks the second time that a far-right activist from conservative new media has been linked to the firing of national security officials, underscoring the influence those voices hold in Trump's second administration.
    


            Christopher Rufo, an activist known for amplifying false allegations that Haitian immigrants were eating residents' house pets in Ohio during the campaign, published internal logs that showed staffers allegedly exchanging explicit messages in National Security Agency chat rooms; Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard within days announced that she had fired people over the revelations.
    


            The Oval Office meeting with Loomer, which was first reported by The New York Times, took place as the president and his economic team were preparing the tariff announcement in the Rose Garden.
    


            Waltz had been in the Oval Office for other meetings when Loomer arrived for an audience with Trump and stayed as the president met with Loomer.
    


            It came as Waltz has faced increased criticism from Trump administration officials and those close to the president for creating the Signal chain where sensitive information regarding an impending US attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen was shared. While Trump has publicly said he is standing by Waltz, and top White House officials insist he has no plans to fire him, multiple sources familiar with behind-the-scenes conversations tell CNN that Trump is waiting to see how it all plays out.
    


            Waltz is traveling with Trump to Miami on Thursday ahead of the LIV Golf tournament at the president's Doral club, two sources familiar with his schedule said, including departing the White House with the president on Marine One.
    


            Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff who was among the advisers who worked to control Loomer's access to Trump during the campaign, was present for the Wednesday meeting, sources familiar with the meeting said. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — who greeted Loomer when she arrived at the White House on Wednesday and escorted her into the West Wing — Vice President JD Vance and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung also attended.
    


            GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, a fierce defender of Trump who was also present for the meeting, brought a list of staff concerns to discuss with the president, one source told CNN. However, he was not initially scheduled to meet with the president alongside Loomer.
    


            It was unclear when the Loomer meeting was placed on the schedule, but one aide said the presence of Wiles and Gor underscored that it was a sanctioned meeting.
    


            Gor, who is seen as one of the president's most loyal aides, has been among the advisers who has been fielding complaints from MAGA world about Waltz.
    


            Loomer, who twice ran for Congress unsuccessfully in Florida, has made a career out of courting controversy.
    


            Rising out of the radical right-wing online ecosystem, she has regularly tested the willingness of internet companies to enforce their terms of service. She once described herself as a “proud Islamophobe” and tweeted in 2018 that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.” She was eventually banned from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, now known as X. (Loomer told CNN last fall she is not “anti-Muslim.”)
    


            Loomer — who once posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job” — appeared with Trump last fall when he mingled with firefighters to observe the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.
    


            During the campaign, Loomer often appeared at events where Trump was speaking and her bombastic social media posts sometimes appeared to preview Trump's next line of attack. Some saw it as no coincidence that during his debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump talked about immigrants “eating the pets” of Ohioans, referencing the rumor circulated online, including by Loomer, who was seen deboarding Trump's private plane ahead of the debate.
    


            Loomer also said during the campaign that if Harris, who is half Indian, won, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has moved to fire several White House National Security Council officials after he was urged by far-right activist Laura Loomer to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently loyal to his “Make America Great Again” agenda, several people familiar with the matter said Thursday.

Loomer presented her research to Trump in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, making her case for the firings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters. Vice President JD Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sergio Gor, the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, took part in the meeting, the people said.

NSC spokesperson Brian Hughes declined to comment on the meeting or the firings, insisting that the White House does not discuss personnel matters.

The Presidential Personnel Office has moved to dismiss at least three senior NSC officials and multiple lower-ranking aides.

Loomer, who has promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, was a frequent presence on the campaign trail during Trump's 2024 successful White House run. More recently, she's been speaking out on social media about some members of Trump's national security team that she insists can't be trusted.

“It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings,” Loomer said in a posting on X. “I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of, and the necessity of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America, and our national security.” 




Trump has a long history of elevating and associating with people who trade in falsehoods and conspiracy theories, and he regularly amplifies posts on his social media site shared by those like Loomer, who promote QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the “deep state.”

The move by Trump to push out staff comes at a moment when Waltz is fighting back calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted Signal app to discuss planning for the sensitive March 15 military operation targeting Houthi militants in Yemen. Trump has said he stands by Waltz.

A journalist, The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg, was mistakenly added to the chain and revealed that Trump's team used it to discuss precise timing of the operation, aircraft used to carry out the strikes and more.

Waltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.

Loomer, in the leadup to Wednesday's meeting with Trump, had complained to sympathetic administration officials that she had been excluded from the NSC vetting process as Waltz built up his staff, according to one person familiar with the matter. She believes Waltz was too reliant in the process on “neocons” — shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party — as well as what she perceived as “not-MAGA-enough” types, the person said.

Waltz, in the first days of Trump's return to the White House, sent about 160 nonpolitical detailees assigned to the NSC back to their home agencies to ensure personnel were committed to implementing Trump's America First agenda.

The move sidelined nonpolitical experts on topics that range from counterterrorism to global climate policy at a time when the United States is dealing with a disparate set of complicated foreign policy matters, including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Last week, Adam Schleifer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, was fired without explanation in a terse email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office shortly after Loomer posted about him on social media, according to a person familiar with the matter.

This story has been corrected to show the surname of The Atlantic journalist is Goldberg, not Rosenberg.

Wall Street is following global markets sharply lower after U.S. President Donald Trump announced big increases in tariffs on imports of goods from around the world.

Financial markets around the world are reeling following President Donald Trump's latest and most severe volley of tariffs, and the U.S. stock market may be taking the worst of it.

Little was spared as fear flared globally about the potentially higher inflation and weakening economic growth that tariffs can create. Prices fell for everything from crude oil and Big Tech stocks to small companies that invest only in U.S. real estate.

Other news we're following:



Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican who sits on Senate committees overseeing the military and national intelligence, told reporters it “raises eyebrows” whenever “there is a firing of people on the National Security Council or their staff, particularly people that we have respect for.”

Rounds said he had never met Laura Loomer, but acknowledged that staff working in the executive branch faced more “volatility” than those working for Congress.

Hey, Bradley, thanks for your question. The U.S. Constitution grants the power to set tariffs to Congress. But over the years, Congress has delegated those powers to the president through several different laws. Those laws specify the circumstances under which the White House can impose tariffs, which are typically limited to cases where imports threaten national security or are severely harming a specific industry.

However, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell have recently been working on new legislation that would expand congressional authority over tariffs. Grassley said he was working on this legislation long before Trump introduced sweeping global tariffs. Whether it gains traction in the Republican-controlled Congress remains to be seen.

The president commented as he left the White House for a trip to Florida, saying, “I think it's going very well.”

“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom and the country is going to boom,” Trump said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,300 points as U.S. stocks lead a worldwide sell-off after Trump's announcement of tariffs against much of the world ignited a COVID-like shock.

Giorgia Meloni told Italian state TV on Thursday that she believes Trump's decision to impose 20% tariffs on exports from Europe is “wrong,'' but “it is not the catastrophe that some are making it out to be.'' 

The U.S. market represents 10% of Italy's total exports, but she argued that retaliatory tariffs could do more harm to Italy's economy. 

She said that the government would meet next week with representatives of affected sectors to formulate proposals to present to Italy's European partners. “We need to open an honest discussion on the matter with the Americans, with the goal — at least from my point of view — of removing tariffs, not multiplying them,'' Meloni said.

The watchdog at the Pentagon said he would review Pete Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app to convey plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen.

The review will also look at other defense officials' use of the publicly available encrypted app, which is not able to handle classified material and is not part of the Defense Department's secure communications network.

“It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings,” Loomer said in a posting on X. “I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of, and the necessity of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America, and our national security.”

Trump has moved to dismiss at least three senior National Security Council officials and multiple lower-ranking aides after Loomer met with the president on Wednesday and urged him to fire officials she contends are insufficiently loyal to Make America Great Again movement, according to several people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter said Thursday.

The tours originally scheduled for Saturday and Sunday will now be held only on Sunday.

The White House says it made the decision because of a protest planned near the White House on Saturday.

Thousands of people are expected to participate in more than 1,000 related protests around the country — including at the Washington Monument — focused on Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.

Garden tour tickets that were assigned for Saturday will be honored on Sunday between 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

Twice a year, in spring and fall, the White House allows the public to tour the South Lawn and its gardens.

Trump's pick as ambassador to China told lawmakers on Thursday it's time to “stand up” against unfair trade practices by the United States' top trade rival.

David Perdue, a wealthy businessman and former U.S. senator from Georgia, spoke at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Economists warn of higher prices for American consumers as one result of Trump's sweeping new tariffs, including a 34% levy on Chinese imports.

Perdue acknowledged that some sacrifices are needed, because “what we've become seduced by are the cheap prices that we gave in to over the last 30 years coming out of China.” 

“If the American public says enough's enough, what will happen to their economy?” Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida asked of China.

“It'll collapse,” Perdue answered.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., brushed off the harsh reaction financial markets are having to Trump's new tariffs.

“They're all emotional. I've invested in the stock market for years. They go up and down on whether it rains or doesn't rain,” Tuberville said. “It'll all turn around.”

Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., said it's ok to have concerns about the tariffs, but he has confidence in Trump, and “as we move along, if we need to adjust, we adjust.”

Justice also said “we got to give it some time” in evaluating whether the tariffs are working. “It is a major reset to what we're doing in this country, and anything that is a major reset, the markets usually act pretty severely to it.”

Federvini has denounced the new U.S. tariffs as a “severe blow against free trade” that will impact 2 billion euros($2.2 billion) in Italian exports of wine and spirits, 40,000 producers and 450,000 workers.

“We have been through this before, and we know the cost all too well: such measures in the past have led to a drop in exports to the United States of up to 50%,'' Federvini President Micaela Pallini said in a statement. 

“Now we risk reliving that economic trauma, with devastating consequences.'' She warned of a looming production and employment crisis if a solution cannot be negotiated, underlining that U.S. companies that import and distribute wines will also be impacted.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday condemned the Trump administration's tariffs, describing it them “negative for the American economy.” (AP Video: Nicolas Garriga)

Emmanuel Macron said it's important “that future investments be suspended for a while until we've clarified things with the U.S. ... because what would be the message of having major European players investing billions of euros (dollars) in the American economy at a time when they're hitting us?”

Macron met Thursday in Paris with representatives of wines and spirits, food, cosmetics, health, metals, aeronautics and other industries. He called Trump's announcement “brutal” and “unfounded because you can't correct trade imbalances by imposing tariffs.”

The European Union needs to respond in “the most effective way” to send “a very clear message that we're determined … to defend and protect ourselves,” Macron said, noting that American tech giants now profit from digital services in Europe.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will match the U.S. president's 25% auto tariffs with a tariff on vehicles imported from the United States — but not on their parts, as Trump did with his previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports that took effect Thursday. 

The prime minister said he told Trump last week in a phone call that he would be retaliating. 

“We take these measures reluctantly. And we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact in Canada,” Carney said. He said Canada won't tariff the parts because Canadians know the benefits of the integrated auto sector, where parts can cross the border multiple times as vehicles are assembled in Ontario or Michigan.

“Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way imaginable. Donald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,” the minority leader said on the Senate floor Thursday.

Schumer was referring to Trump's 10% sanctions on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory in the remote Antarctic. They're mostly barren, with active volcanoes.

Vladimir Putin's Russia, meanwhile, was left off Trump's list, which also includes Jan Mayen, a small Norwegian island in the Arctic that possibly has more polar bears than people.

The legislation pushed by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell would require presidents to justify new tariffs and secure congressional approval within 60 days, otherwise they would expire.

Grassley said he was working on this long before Trump introduced sweeping global tariffs. Whether it gains traction in the Republican-controlled Congress remains to be seen.

Congress already technically has authority over tariffs, but over the last century it has given much of that power to the president. This has effectively removed most of its check on executive power. Lawmakers have some standing to counter tariffs, such as nullifying a presidential emergency declaration, but such resolutions need to pass both chambers and then either be signed by the president, or have the votes to override a veto.

The NEH distributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year to state humanities councils, along with museums, historical sites, educational institutions and independent researchers. Projects have included organizing George Washington's papers and supporting “American Prometheus,” the J. Robert Oppenheimer biography that led to an Oscar-winning film.

Now NEH grant recipients are getting termination notices, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403.

“Cutting NEH funding directly harms communities in every state and contributes to the destruction of our shared cultural heritage,” reads a statement from the National Humanities Alliance, a nationwide coalition of humanities advocates. 

An NEH spokesperson did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment. The Trump administration has been dismantling institutions over what it calls “woke” culture.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says his administration will take all necessary actions, based on World Trade Organization principles and a new reciprocity bill approved by Congress on Wednesday, to protect Brazil's companies and workers after the United States imposed a 10% extra tariff on all Brazilian exports.

“We stand for multilateralism and free trade, and we will respond to any attempt to impose protectionism, which no longer has a place in today's world,” Lula said during an official ceremony in Brasília.

The U.S. is Brazil's top trade partner after China, importing Brazilian crude oil, aircraft, coffee, cellulose and beef. America's trade surplus reached $28.6 billion in goods and services last year.

Brazil has said it remains open to dialogue aimed at reversing the extra tariffs, while also considering taking the case to the WTO and imposing reciprocal tariffs. Lula has yet to sign the bill into law.

The president took action involving several senior White House National Security Council officials soon after he was urged by the far-right activist to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently committed to his Make America Great Again agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter Thursday.

Loomer presented her research to Trump in an Oval Office meeting, making her case for the firings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters. Vice President JD Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Serio Gor, the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, took part in the meeting, the people said.

NSC spokesman Brian Hughes declined to comment on the meeting or the firings.

The Trump administration is ordering schools nationwide to certify that they are following federal civil rights laws — and eliminating DEI practices — as a condition for receiving federal money.

A notice sent Thursday by the Education Department gives the nation's states and schools 10 days to sign and return the certification.

“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement.

The certification asks state and school leaders to acknowledge that “the use of certain DEI practices can violate federal law” and result in a termination of funding.

It follows a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any school policy that treats students or staff differently because of their race is illegal.

The S&P 500 was down 4.3% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since COVID shattered the global economy five years ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,538 points, or 3.6%, as of 10:55 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.6% lower.

Fear is flaring globally about the potentially toxic mix of higher inflation and weakening economic growth that could be created by the tariffs rivaling levels unseen in roughly a century.

It's “plausible” that Trump's latest and most severe set of tariffs could reduce U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to the multinational financial services company UBS.

Lesotho is one of the smallest countries in Africa with a population of 2.2 million people, yet exports $237.3 million worth of goods to the U.S. — mostly textiles and diamonds — sectors which create most of its jobs.

“There is no country immune from those tariff hikes he made. That means countries will have to renegotiate their positions with the USA and see how they will manage to trade in,” said government spokesman Thabo Sekonyela.

The U.S. is Lesotho's second biggest trade partner after South Africa. This a second blow for Lesotho after Trump withdrew foreign aid.

Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of United States European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told lawmakers Thursday that a potential Trump administration plan to relinquish U.S. control over the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe as part of its downsizing efforts could create issues for control over U.S. nuclear weapons based there as well as the tens of thousands of troops deployed there.

The position oversees all NATO decisions in Europe, where the U.S. is often the largest troop contributor to NATO operations.

“I think that would bring some challenges in terms of nuclear command and control. It would put us in a position where, in an Article Five situation, we could have for the first time since the First World War large numbers of American troops under non-U.S. command. So I think those are things that would have to be considered carefully,” Cavoli told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Democrats are blaming Trump for plunging financial markets and calling on him to rescind his tariffs.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said the tariffs amount to the biggest tax hike on families since World War II.

Schumer spoke on the Senate floor as financial markets tanked, saying “Donald Trump has singlehandedly created a financial forest fire.”

“President Trump should reverse course on his disastrous tariffs immediately,” Schumer said. “Or else, he risks plunging America into recession.”

The Home Furnishings Association, which represents more than 13,000 U.S. furniture stores, predicted that the tariffs will increase prices between 10% and 46%. Vietnam and China are the top furniture exporter to the U.S.

The association said manufacturers in Asia are offsetting some of the costs by discounting their products and lowering ocean freight rates. But it still expects U.S. furniture prices to rise. Even domestically made furniture often relies on imported components, the association said.

“While many in the industry support the long-term goal of reshoring manufacturing, the reality is that it will take at least a decade to scale domestic production,” Home Furnishings Association CEO Shannon Williams said in a statement. “Permitting, training a skilled workforce and managing the higher costs of U.S. manufacturing are significant hurdles. Applying steep tariffs during this transition period only hurts the American consumer.”

“There are some who believe now is the time to reduce drastically our military footprint in Europe,” Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said at Thursday's hearing with U.S. military commanders for Europe and Africa.

“I'm troubled at those deeply misguided and dangerous views held by some mid-level bureaucrats within the Defense Department. They've been working to pursue a U.S. retreat from Europe and they've often been doing do without coordinating with the Secretary of Defense,” Wicker said. 

It was not immediately clear what “mid-level bureaucrats” Wicker was talking about. U.S. troops in Europe increased by about 20,000 to a total of roughly 100,000 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to assist with training and logistics and to reassure NATO allies that the U.S. would defend them.

Nayib Bukele is scheduled to visit with Trump on April 14.

Bukele posted on social media a signed letter from Trump inviting him to a meeting and thanking him for help fighting illegal immigration. 

The Trump administration is paying Bukele's government to house deportees, particularly people it accuses of being Venezuelan gang members, at one of his notorious prisons. 

A White House official confirmed the date of the visit. The official was not authorized to speak publicly.







Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry says its government is calculating the impact on its exports including electronics, textiles and textile products, footwear, palm oil, rubber, furniture, shrimp and marine fishery products, and taking “strategic steps to mitigate the negative impact on the Indonesian national economy.”

“The Indonesian government is committed to maintaining the stability of the yield of Government Securities (SBN) amidst global financial market turmoil following the announcement of the U.S. reciprocal tariff,” the foreign ministry statement says.

As Mexico had hoped, the free-trade agreement it has with the United States and Canada shielded many sectors producing things covered by the treaty from avocados to clothing and electronics. Discussions continue over the 25% tariff the U.S. has placed on auto imports, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminum.

“The last call I had with President Trump I said that in the case of reciprocal tariffs, my understanding was that there wouldn't be tariffs (on Mexico), because since Mexico doesn't place tariffs on the United States, the United States doesn't put tariffs on Mexico,” Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning press briefing Thursday.

Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard pointed out that many other countries that have free-trade agreements with the U.S. were nevertheless targeted by the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday. Ebrard says Sheinbaum's strategy worked, “because today we do have preferential treatment.”

Some Americans may be giving the president the benefit of the doubt for now on his Department of Government Efficiency.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults “somewhat” or “strongly” approve of Trump's handling of Social Security, and similar approvals on his management of the federal government.

The latest AP-NORC numbers on his changes to government are almost identical to Trump's overall presidential approval, suggesting that his Republican administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close Social Security Administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies and cancel thousands of government contracts haven't yet created a significant independent backlash — or spurred independent support.

The U.S. secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker are in Brussels for a meeting of alliance foreign ministers.

Many hope Rubio will clarify Trump's intentions amid persistent signals from Washington that NATO as it has existed for 75 years may no longer be relevant.

“The United States is as active in NATO as it has ever been,” Rubio told reporters as he greeted NATO chief Mark Rutte. “And some of this hysteria and hyperbole that I see in the global media and some domestic media in the United States about NATO is unwarranted.”

“President Trump's made clear he supports NATO,” Rubio said. “We're going to remain in NATO.”

And the U.S. stock market may be taking the worst of it.

The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in early trading Thursday, more than the losses seen in other major markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1150 points, and the Nasdaq composite was off 4.3%.

Little was spared as fear flares globally about the potentially higher inflation and weakening economic growth that tariffs can create.

Prices fell for everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to small companies that invest only in U.S. real estate.

Vance says the president will have something to say about the popular social media site before his reprieve on the congressionally-approved ban of the platform expires.

“We have a couple days to continue working on it, to finalize some things. And of course, we'll let the president announce whatever we ultimately decide,” Vance said on Fox & Friends.

Trump on Inauguration Day gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that had been upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, which said the ban was necessary for national security.

Under the law, TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance is required to sell the platform to an approved buyer or take it offline in the United States.

The vice president appeared on Fox & Friends, saying it will take some time for Trump's tariffs, spending cuts and support for U.S. industries to help everyday Americans. “We are not going to fix things overnight,” Vance said.

“Frankly, a lot of people have gotten rich from American jobs moving overseas,” Vance said. “But American workers have not gotten rich. And frankly, American companies have not gotten wealthy from the increasing growth of foreign competitors manufacturing overseas.”

“We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost reducing policies — Yes, people are going to see it in their pocketbook. They're also going to benefit from the fact that foreign countries can't take advantage of us anymore.”

The sweeping tariffs declared by Trump could increase prices for Americans who depend on citrus from 1400 producers across southern Africa, according to Boitshoko Ntshabele, chief executive of the Citrus Growers Association in Johannesburg.

“South Africa does not compete with the citrus producers of the US,” Ntshabele said. “In fact, quite the opposite — we sustain customers' interest when their local citrus is out of season, benefitting US citrus growers in the end.”

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Trump's 30% tariffs on U.S. imports of South African products shows the urgent need for a new bilateral trade deal. 

Greece's exports of canned peaches to the United States in 2020 were worth 32 million euros ($35.3 million) and soared to 95 million euros ($105 million) in 2024. The new 20% tariff, on top of existing duties, could reverse those gains, according to Christos Giannakakis, vice president of Venus, one Greece's largest peach canning cooperatives.

“This creates a huge problem,” Giannakakis told the Associated Press. “It means reduced exports, lower revenue and shrinking production.”

Trump said his decision to impose sweeping import tariffs will boost American industries. 

At 1 p.m., Trump will receive his intelligence briefing in the Situation Room. After, at 2 p.m., he will travel to Florida to attend an event for LIV golf this evening. He will then head to his home at Mar-a-Lago, according to the White House.

Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said the new U.S. tariffs may violate NATO's Article 2, which stresses the importance of economic cooperation among allies to avoid conflict.

“If you want a strong NATO, you should ensure that there is as much economic growth as possible in the NATO countries. That was the insight of those who established NATO, that economic cooperation would be good for the entire alliance,” Eide said during a visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, according to the NRK broadcaster.

Eide told NRK that he will raise the tariff war with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the meeting.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the new U.S. tariffs many reduce Poland's GDP by 0.4%.

He said it was “a severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it.” The Polish-U.S. friendship, he added, “must also survive this test.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Thursday that his government will implement a $15.6 billion (14.1 billion euro) spending package to mitigate the effects of U.S. tariffs on the eurozone's fourth-largest economy.

The Spanish leader called the tariffs “19th-century protectionism,” against which the European Union and Spain had to act proactively and diversify their economic ties with the rest of the world.

Sánchez also called for a negotiated solution with the U.S. “We're once again asking President Trump to reconsider, to sit down at the negotiating table with the European Union and also with the rest of the world.”

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson says “there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism is not a way out. What the U.S. should do is to correct its wrong practices and resolve trade disputes with all countries, including China, through consultations based on equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.”

Guo Jiakun added that the tariffs violate WTO rules, “harm the common interests of people of all countries, and do not help solve the problems of the U.S. itself. It is clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the U.S.'s unilateral bullying actions, such as imposing tariffs.”

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, said that these are “the most disruptive tariff increases for 90 years.” He also drew a comparison with the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

“I think this is an extraordinary day for the world economy, comparable with the situation after the Russian aggression on Ukraine, where we knew that something new was happening and we were not prepared in Europe to cope with the challenge,” Habeck told reporters in Berlin. “And we looked in(to) the abyss in that time, but we worked it out and we managed it by putting aside everything that was restricting economic strength and energy security.”

“I think a similar reaction is necessary now from the European Union and its world partners,” Habeck said.

The local government leader of Christmas Island, one of several Australian external island territories that like Australia have been assigned a 10% U.S. tariff, said his Indian Ocean atoll exported nothing to the United States.

The Australian outpost of fewer than 2,000 people 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta has used U.S. heavy machinery to mine phosphate for decades, Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thomson said.

The uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the remote Antarctic are another Australian territory included in the 10% tariff. The mostly barren islands include two active volcanoes and can only be reached by sea.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. imports. The U.S. and Australia have a free trade agreement.

Trump's announcement of a new 20% tariff on the European Union drew a sharp rebuke from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said it was a “major blow to the world economy.”

“The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,” von der Leyen said. Groceries, transport and medicines will cost more, she said while visiting Uzbekistan. “And this is hurting, in particular, the most vulnerable citizens.”

Von der Leyen held off, however, from announcing new retaliatory measures and underlined that the EU was ready to negotiate with the U.S.

Analysts say there's little to be gained from an all-out trade war since higher tariffs can lower growth and raise inflation.

“On the other hand, Trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response,” said Matteo Villa, a senior analyst at Italy's Institute for International Political Studies. 

“Probably the hope, in Brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce Trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack.”

President Trump Signs Historic Reciprocal Tariffs Executive Orders



Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others — that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.

In a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, Trump said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States, while imposing a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency.

The action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., discusses Democrats' reaction to President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs, the possible short-term and long-term economic impacts, and the upcoming Senate vote on the budget.

World leaders reacted to the sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump released this week impacting essentially every U.S. trading partner. 

The White House has implemented a flat 10% tariff on apparently all imports, though some nations saw drastically higher taxes slapped on their U.S. exports – including Vietnam, which was issued a 46% tariff one day after it slashed its tariffs on U.S. imports.

However, no nation was handed a higher import tax than China, which Trump revealed will have an additional 34% blanket tariff on its exports to the U.S. on top of the 20% tariff the president implemented earlier this year. This brings the total tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the U.S. to 54% – just shy of the 60% Trump pledged on the campaign trail.

CANADA'S PM CARNEY VOWS TO ‘FIGHT' TRUMP'S TARIFFS, OTHER WORLD LEADERS WEIGH IMPACT

""China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,"" China's Commerce Ministry reportedly said in a statement. ""There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism.""

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun also warned that ""Protectionism has no exit ramp"" and urged Washington to ""correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries — including China — through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations."" 

The EU, which was hit with a blanket 20% tariff on top of the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as car exports to the U.S., which are expected to severely impact European nations, pledged to strike back at Trump's tariff war.

""I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video posted to X. ""Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.""

The EU chief said the bloc was already finalizing countermeasures to Trump's tariffs on steel and pledged to take similar actions to protect the pharmaceutical and auto industries ""if negotiations fail.""

""We must brace for the impact this will inevitably have. Europe has everything it needs to make it through this storm,"" von der Leyen added, noting the EU is the single largest market on the planet, which she said serves as Europe's ""safe harbor in tumultuous times.""

""If you take on one of us, you take on all of us,"" she added. ""Our unity is our strength.""

SOME COUNTRIES TARGETED BY TRUMP TARIFFS SEEK NEGOTIATIONS, CHINA SAYS 'NO WINNERS IN TRADE WARS'

Leaders in the U.K. have repeatedly said they would not immediately respond to the blanket tariff – which coupled with the steel and auto tariffs, could have a significant impact on its economy – though London is taking steps to see which tariffs could be implemented that would have the least negative effect on its own businesses. 

British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds reportedly told members of Parliament on Thursday that the U.K. will ""not hesitate to act"" if an agreement with Washington to circumvent the tariff war cannot be met, reported Politico.

""We will seek the views of U.K. stakeholders over four weeks until 1st May 2025 on products that could potentially be included in any U.K. tariff response,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""This exercise will also give businesses the chance to have their say, and influence the design of any possible U.K. response.""

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariffs will ""fundamentally change the international trading system"" and pledged to ""fight"" back through ""countermeasures.""

""We're in a situation where there's going to be an impact on the U.S. economy, which will build with time,"" he added. ""In our judgment, it will be negative on the U.S. economy that will have an impact on us.""

""In a crisis, it's important to come together,"" Carney said. ""It's essential to act with purpose and with force, and that's what we will do.""

TRUMP TOUTS RETURN OF THE 'AMERICAN DREAM' IN HISTORIC TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will ""announce a comprehensive program"" to address Trump's tariffs but will not engage in a ""tit-for-tat on tariffs.""

Sheinbaum said she plans to ""strengthen the economy under any circumstance."" 

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said, ""We're putting all options on the table in considering the most effective response.""

""Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States,"" he reportedly told his Parliament. ""We wonder if it makes sense for (Washington) to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we've been making and will continue to do so. 

""We need to consider what's best for Japan's national interest,"" he added, without detailing what specific steps Tokyo could take.

Though Australia was among the nations hit with some of the lowest tariffs issued by the White House on Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called them ""totally unwarranted.""

""President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%,"" he said at a press event. ""The administration's tariffs have no basis in logic, and they go against the basis of our two nation's partnership.""

""This is not the act of a friend,"" Albanese said.

Albanese pointed out that Americans will pay the heaviest price for the tariffs and said therefore he will not put reciprocal tariffs back on the U.S. 

""We will not join the race to the bottom,"" he added, but pledged to continue to fight to have the tariffs removed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Amazon's internal forecast suggests a $700 million financial gain from its AI shopping assistant Rufus","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-predicts-700-million-potential-gain-ai-assistant-rufus-2025-4","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 17:06:00 GMT","

Amazon has rosy projections for its Rufus AI shopping assistant.

According to an internal planning document obtained by Business Insider, Amazon expects Rufus to indirectly contribute over $700 million in operating profits this year.

The outlook is part of a metric called ""downstream impact,"" an internal financial figure Amazon uses to measure a product or service's potential to generate additional consumer spending across Amazon's vast offerings.

For example, Rufus' product recommendations can lead to more purchases on Amazon's marketplace — and an increase in its DSI. Rufus, a free service that answers everything from product details to special promotions, generates no direct revenue.

Based on this metric, Rufus lost an estimated $285 million in 2024. By 2027, however, it is expected to reach $1.2 billion in DSI profit contributions, the document showed. The estimates, after operating costs and server payments, include the income from ads placed within Rufus' responses to user inquiries.

The bullish forecast may explain why Amazon is aggressively expanding Rufus and its other AI search offerings. Amazon's leadership previously told employees that such AI projects are ""absolute"" top priorities.

Rufus, which launched in February 2024, has received mixed reviews from early users, but Amazon continues to invest in this space. Just last week, Amazon unveiled another AI-powered shopping discovery app called Interests. Last year, the company disclosed that Rufus answered ""tens of millions"" of customer questions in its first six months of operation.

It also shows how Amazon justifies its investment in one of its flagship AI products, even as DSI has received more scrutiny lately.

Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment.

To be sure, Rufus's DSI forecast is small for Amazon, given the company's $68.6 billion in total operating income last year. But early results indicate Rufus has huge potential with more room to grow.

The document said initial results showed customers using Rufus had a ""positive lift on downstream spending,"" and the impact only increased with more engagement.

Amazon has significant expansion plans for Rufus.

This year, Amazon expects $711.7 billion worth of products on its site to be eligible for Rufus's many features, like product recommendations and comparisons, up from $164 billion in 2024, according to the document. That number is expected to reach $849.8 billion in 2027.

Amazon also wants to roll out Rufus to at least 13 international marketplaces this year, the document said. Currently, Rufus is available in the US, the UK, and India, and a handful of European countries.

The document said Amazon plans to fivefold the size of the AI model powering Rufus, internally called Shopping LLM, to improve the quality of its answers. The increased model parameters to Shopping LLM were also factored into DSI, but it is unclear when this will be implemented. With the planned improvement, Amazon hopes to launch a new service that leverages Rufus to provide a wider selection and ""seamlessly purchase on behalf of the customer,"" it added.

Rufus is already becoming more prevalent across Amazon. In recent weeks, some Amazon sellers who used the Rufus app discovered an update that auto-pops up Rufus when they use trigger phrases like ""how to"" or ""what is"" in the search bar.

For some products, Rufus automatically launched with its own response before search results showed up. Amazon also started testing ad placements within Rufus's responses, Adweek reported in September.

Amazon isn't the only retailer with a homegrown AI shopping assistant. Others, like Walmart, Target, and Instacart, have launched their own AI-powered search apps in recent months.

These apps may still be in their infancy. A recent survey by e-commerce analytics firm Profitero showed that just 10% of US customers used a retailer's AI chat assistant when searching for products. By comparison, 37% of shoppers used the search bar on the retailer's websites or apps, and 29% used promotion and deal pages.

For Rufus, the other challenge is negative reviews.

Andrew Hamada, a former Amazon employee who now runs seller agency Reason Automation, wrote on Linkedin last month that Rufus misses basic catalog information and often gives inaccurate answers.

""In our experience, Rufus rarely works,"" he wrote.

There's also the question of DSI's true value.

Amazon's DSI is not the most scientific metric, and several Amazon employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, have raised questions about the fuzzy math behind the numbers.

For instance, it was never clear whether Prime Video or Amazon's shipping team should claim more DSI for the Prime membership revenue, which offers both services as a perk, one of the people said. Recently, Amazon has been deemphasizing Alexa's DSI metric, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Still, Amazon's retail CEO Doug Herrington remains a strong supporter of Rufus. During an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, Herrington said AI-driven ""personalization"" is a major focus area for Amazon, mentioning Rufus and other search features as examples.

""AI is really allowing us to personalize more and more of the shopping experience on Amazon,"" Herrington said.

Web2 marketers have long had tricks to track down and ""acquire"" (in ad speak) likely customers. But Web3? Not so much, says ad-tech exec Asaf Nadler.

His company Addressable, is out with a new service that Nadler, the chief operating officer, claims will improve the efficacy of Web3 marketing — from the perspective of salespeople, of course. It's all about ""retargeting"" the most valuable potential customers: people who very nearly pressed buy, trade, sell, swap, join, but didn't.

Finding those folks in Web2 is straightforward given the troves of personal data scattered online. Crypto's trickier because wallets are pseudonymous. The company's database ""bridges the gap,"" he said, and lets companies target their most likely customers.

Such precision could be especially important if crypto's bear market deepens into a blowout that pushes new users away. Economic malaise increases what traditional marketers call the ""cost per acquisition"" and what Addressable terms the ""cost per wallet.""

""Especially in a bear market people aren't as hyped about user acquisition,"" said Nadler, ""But what founders care about is letting the community know they still care and reactivate them.""

Addressable isn't building a doxxing service, says Nadler. While it might know on the backend that John Doe owns wallet abc123, it's not passing that information to the client, say, CoinDEX. Instead its product lets CoinDEX target John Doe with ads so that wallet abc123 becomes a paying customer.

Building the inference is Addressable's specialty, he said. The company trawls social media posts for intel that it can cross-check with wallets. Perhaps wallet abc123 interacted with protocols that John Doe follows on X. Or it's made trades that John Doe discussed on Reddit. All these clues can be enough to reverse-engineer a targetable identity.

The resulting ad-tech playbook is less an only-in-crypto innovation than a recreation of online marketer's existing capabilities with special twists for the on-chain economy. Companies' Web3 funnels are already incredibly narrow, Nadler said, because potential customers are uniquely difficult to target.

""Rather than pay KOLs, or do very broad activities, what we allow is companies to target only the users that have engaged with you,"" he said. KOLs are key opinion leaders, social media influencers who promote projects to their followers.

While Addressable has been around for three years, the retargeting service is new, Nadler said. He said he believes it will be a difference-maker for protocols seeking stickier customers.

""The most horrible thing that can happen to DeFi projects at the moment is if users stop believing in them,"" he said, pointing to targeted advertising as the solution.

 Bitcoin's pre-reciprocal US tariff gains evaporated as the S&P 500 prints intra-day losses not seen since the height of the COVID-19 sell-off in mid-2020. 

Bitcoin (BTC) hit new monthly lows at the April 3 Wall Street open as US unemployment data added to pressure on risk assets.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed the first trip below $82,000 for BTC/USD since the start of the month.

After initially surging as high as $88,580 as the US government unveiled reciprocal trade tariffs, Bitcoin soon ran out of steam as the reality of the stronger-than-expected measures hit home.

US stocks then followed, with the S&P 500 down over 4% on the day at the time of writing.

“Today's -3.7% drop puts the S&P 500 on track for its largest daily decline since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X.

Thereafter, US initial jobless claims came in below estimates, at 219,000 versus the anticipated 228,000, per data from the US Department of Labor (DoL).

“The previous week's level was revised up by 1,000 from 224,000 to 225,000. The 4-week moving average was 223,000, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week's revised average. The previous week's average was revised up by 250 from 224,000 to 224,250,” an official press release stated.

Stronger labor market trends are traditionally associated with weaker risk-asset performance as they imply that policymakers can keep financial conditions tighter for longer.

Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool nonetheless continued to see markets favor an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

“As recession odds rise, markets think that the Fed will be forced to cut rates as soon as next month,” Kobeissi added.

BTC price action predictably continued to disappoint on short timeframes as $80,000 support became uncomfortably close.

“Stair step up then elevator down,” popular trader Roman summarized in part of his latest X analysis.

Market commentator Byzantine General flagged short positions increasing across major crypto pairs, concluding that tariffs would ensure that lackluster conditions would continue.

“I could see a stop hunt below the local lows before a pump to squeeze shorts, then probably more chop that slopes downward,” he told X followers.

Onchain analytics firm Glassnode had more bad news. According to their data, Bitcoin printed a new “death cross” involving the convergence of two midterm moving averages (MAs).

“An onchain analogue to the Death Cross has emerged. The 30-day volume-weighted price of $BTC has crossed below the 180-day, signaling weakening momentum,” an X post announced.

Earlier this week, Glassnode observed that speculative sell-offs in recent months have fallen considerably short of volumes traditionally associated with blow-off BTC price tops.

There are situations in which tariffs are a useful tool to address a trade deficit, or to protect key sectors of a country's economy. Then there are situations where you accuse a bunch of penguins on an uninhabited island of currency manipulation. Guess which one we're living in?

This is the takeaway of the manifold tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the penguin-occupied Heard and McDonald Islands, the tariffs target the British Indian Ocean Territory, whose sole occupants live on a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia island. Yes, the United States is levying reciprocal tariffs against its own troops.

And then there are the tariffs against countries that have actual goods and services on which US consumers depend. China: 54 percent. Vietnam: 46 percent. Cambodia: 49 percent. South Korea: 25 percent. No corner of the US consumer economy will go untouched. Prices will rise. The stock market is spiraling. A recession looms. The tech industry will be turned upside down. Mark Cuban, noted billionaire, is encouraging people to stockpile consumables before it's too late.

It's reckless, it's absurd, and it's also everything Donald Trump said plainly he would do on the campaign trail. True, he didn't telegraph how misguided the methodology would be—you can read about it more here, but suffice to say it's thoroughly detached from the realities of international trade—but he loudly, repeatedly promised to tariff his way to glory.

The stated goal is to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, which is a bit like resurrecting the dodo. The US still manufactures plenty of goods; it's second only to China in annual output, according to the World Bank. But many of the industry's jobs have been replaced by automation, a bottle you can't re-cork. And higher domestic labor costs mean US-made products will inherently be more expensive, a trade-off American consumers have consistently rejected. All of this was already true in Trump's first term. It's even more so now.

And let's say a plurality of companies did decide to reshore or set up factories in the United States. The timeline for those decisions and implementation is measured in years, if not decades, and follow-through can be spotty. (Just ask Foxconn.) So what happens in the meantime?

The rationale has all the weight of a soap bubble. There isn't a world where the US suddenly manufactures all the items the country has decided to target. There's a 47 percent tariff on Madagascar now. Do you know why the US has a trade deficit with Madagascar? They produce vanilla; we don't. Unless we're suddenly setting up vanilla assembly lines in Ohio, that's not changing.

But maybe Trump's so-called Liberation Day is all just a master negotiating ploy. “Everybody sit back, take a deep breath. Don't immediately retaliate. Let's see where this goes,” said Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on CNN Wednesday. “Because if you retaliate, that's how we get escalation.”

It's an interesting tactic, to start a bar brawl and ask everyone not to punch back in case someone gets hurt. It's not working. China has already vowed to retaliate; the EU suggested that it could as well. (New Zealand is officially chill.)

Set the economics of this aside for a moment, though. The insult on top of that looming injury is how sloppy this all is. It's the same blunt-force destruction that DOGE has implemented within the US government, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has imposed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now projected on a global scale. Yes, Elon Musk and DOGE have taken a blowtorch to federal agencies. But the tariffs are a helpful reminder that it's Trump who's fiddling while it all burns.

It's the instinct to measure wins in units of pain and suffering. It's an assumption that the only way to help yourself is to hurt other people. This is just what America is now.

The optimist's case is that this is all a feint, that other countries will capitulate or at least make enough of a show of it that things will go back to normal. Seems unlikely. First of all, they're already doing the opposite, all apologies to Bessent. But even if they weren't, even if this is just posturing from the US, that posturing has consequences. Whatever equity the US has built up over the last century as a reputable trade partner has been largely wiped out by a businessman-president best known for his bankruptcies.

And then there's the pessimist's case, which also seems increasingly like the realist's. The US is barreling toward a recession for no good reason, and dragging the world—and a few thousand penguins on remote Antarctic islands—down with it.

Will these tariffs lead to a US manufacturing renaissance, or a prolonged recession?

Microsoft has pulled back on data center projects around the world, Bloomberg reports, suggesting that the company is wary of expanding its cloud computing infrastructure too rapidly.

Microsoft has halted talks for or delayed development sites of data centers in the U.K., Australia, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, per Bloomberg. A spokesperson told the publication that Microsoft makes its plans years in advance and that the changes demonstrate “the flexibility of [its] strategy.”

As recently as February, Microsoft reiterated earlier plans to allocate more than $80 billion of its cash to capital expenditures in 2025, primarily AI data centers. As Bloomberg points out in its piece, it's hard to know how much of the company's recent pullback reflects its expectations of diminished demand versus temporary construction challenges, such as shortages of power and building materials.

Microsoft previously said that it would shift its data center expansion focus for 2025 from new construction to fitting existing facilities with servers and other computing equipment.

Measles has been making an unwelcome comeback in the U.S. and world lately. Its resurgence might be enough to make many of us reasonably wonder: Just how protected am I from measles? And should I think about getting a booster vaccine shot?

It's important to emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective—providing 97% protection from measles with the standard two-shot series. Most Americans have and are still getting vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, thanks to routine childhood programs that were established nationwide starting in the 1980s.

These programs require children to receive several vaccines to attend public school, but families can obtain medical or personal exemptions depending on the state. As of the 2023-2024 school year, roughly 93% of school-age children in the U.S. have received their MMR shots. That said, this percentage has slightly dipped in recent years and is now below the threshold of herd, or community, immunity needed to prevent the highly contagious virus from spreading widely in any given area. Hence the recent outbreaks.

More Parents Are Finding Excuses to Not Vaccinate Their Kids, CDC Data Shows

The current measles outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, now officially over 500 cases, are occurring almost entirely among pockets of unvaccinated people, and it's the unvaccinated who are much more vulnerable to measles, particularly very young children. But there are certain situations in which you might want or need a catch-up vaccination.

Walter Orenstein, a professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and former director of the U.S. immunization program at CDC, notes that there were two types of measles vaccine that first became available in the U.S. in 1963.

One was a live, weakened virus vaccine—the same type used today, though later modified to be milder—and the other was an inactivated, or killed, measles virus vaccine. Unfortunately, the inactivated vaccine didn't provide lasting immunity and increased the risk of a severe form of measles, known as atypical measles, in people who later caught the virus naturally. It was pulled by 1967—but some people who got it are still around today.

“So if someone was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 with this vaccine, or an unknown vaccine, it's reasonable to get another dose of the measles vaccine that's actually effective,” Orenstein told Gizmodo. People who received this vaccine or are unsure of which vaccine they received during this time period are recommended to get at least one dose of the standard measles vaccine.

Practically everyone born before 1957 is likely to have contracted measles, which also provides long-lasting immunity, so they're generally fine. The Centers for Disease Control has said that healthcare personnel born before 1957 with no evidence of measles infection (either in their records or from lab tests) should consider the standard two-dose series.

It's also worth noting that Americans born between 1968 and 1989 received only one shot of the MMR vaccine. Even a single shot is highly effective—about 93%—so most people in this scenario are well protected. But the CDC does recommend that adults at higher risk for measles exposure get their second shot if they haven't already. These higher-risk groups include college students, healthcare personnel, people traveling internationally, and anyone else who's deemed to be at risk by public health officials, such as people living near active outbreaks.

RFK Jr.'s Measles Cure? Cod Liver Oil and a Whole Lot of Other Nonsense

The nearly 100% protection provided by full MMR vaccination does still leave open some tiny room for vulnerability, of course. Sometimes, a fully vaccinated person, exposed to measles during an outbreak, will get sick. This might happen because the person's immune system didn't mount a full protective response at the time of vaccination, or because a person's immunity has waned over time.

Thankfully, waning immunity isn't a major individual concern. Studies have estimated that somewhere between 0.22% and 0.04% of the vaccine's effectiveness declines yearly. This means it would take between five and 25 years for the average person to be 1% less protected than they were right after their MMR shots.

If you are concerned about your susceptibility to measles, or you don't know your vaccination status, you can always talk to your primary care doctor. Your doctor might run a blood test to check for measles antibodies—or even proactively recommend an MMR dose. While no one likes a needle, the MMR vaccine is perfectly safe, so getting an extra shot is fine even if you might already be well-protected.

“One of the pluses, if someone happens to be already immune, is that nothing would happen because their bodies would kill the vaccine virus before anything can happen,” Orenstein said.

Outside of a few corner situations, though, measles remains a more serious threat to the unvaccinated, including people who are too young or medically unable to get vaccinated, such as people with severely weakened immune systems. The best way to keep the virus contained, he notes, is to make sure everyone who can get vaccinated does.

“That's why it's so critical that we get very high immunization levels in our communities. Because for the measles virus to survive, it needs to be transmitted from an infectious person to a susceptible person. And if the infectious person only comes in contact with immune people, that chain of transmission is broken and indirectly protects people who can't be vaccinated because they have legitimate medical contradictions—they're all protected if they're not exposed,” Orenstein said.

Children are recommended to get their first MMR shot between 12 and 15 months of age, and their second shot between 4 and 6 years of age, though children at risk of exposure during an outbreak or international travel may receive them earlier and/or an extra dose.

Measles is no joke—it's highly contagious and can be dangerous especially for kids and people who can't get vaccinated. If you're at risk, or uncertain about your status, you may want to talk to your doctor sooner rather than later.

 April 03, 2025  

CHICAGO — For older patients at high risk for a heart failure event who are scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces the risk for death and heart failure events by almost 30%, the randomized DapaTAVI trial shows.

The two questions addressed in this “pragmatic” trial — whether adjunctive SGLT2 inhibitors are beneficial after TAVI and whether SGLT2 inhibitors are safe in older patients — were answered affirmatively, according to Sergio Raposeiras-Roubin, MD, PhD, professor of cardiology at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

The mean age of the trial participants was 82 years, which is not atypical for TAVI studies, but diverges markedly from the landmark trials that established SGLT2 inhibitors as a guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure.

Patients were randomized at 39 centers in Spain, said Raposeiras-Roubin, who presented the DapaTAVI results during a late-breaker session at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2025, which were published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.

TAVI patients were enrolled in DapaTAVI, if they had severe aortic stenosis and a previous heart failure episode that led to treatment with an intravenous diuretic in a hospital or an urgent care facility. In addition, patients were required to have one or more of the following risk factors: Diabetes, compromised renal function (an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25-75 mL/min/1.73 m2), or a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 40%.

The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and worsening heart failure.

At 1 year, 91 patients (15.0%) randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily experienced a primary outcome event, as did 124 patients (20.1%) randomized to usual care. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significant 28% risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; P = .018).

When composite primary endpoint events were assessed separately, the rate of death at 1 year in the dapagliflozin group was lower than in the usual care group (7.8% vs 9.1%) but did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0. 59-1.28). However, the lower rate of worsening heart failure in the dapagliflozin group (9.4% vs 14.4%) was significant (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88).

There were also significant reductions in hospitalization for heart failure (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99), urgent heart failure visits (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.82), and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98). The numerical reduction in cardiovascular death was not significant (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.49-1.35).

In subgroup analyses, the relative advantage of being randomized to dapagliflozin rather than usual care was similar for those with and without diabetes, with and without renal insufficiency, and with and without compromised left ventricular function.

Although dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated in this trial and in past trials, it was associated with more symptomatic hypotension events per 100 patient-years (6.6 vs 3.6; P = .01) and more genital infections (1.8 vs 0.5; P = .03). None of these adverse events resulted in meaningful sequelae, though.

Given the role of SGLT2 inhibitors has already been established as a pillar of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure, the benefit in TAVI patients with a history of heart failure should not be entirely surprising, said Ori Ben-Yehuda, MD, director of the Cardiovascular Outcomes Group at the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Institute, University of California San Diego, and the author of an editorial that accompanied the DapaTAVI results.

Because of their history of heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors were already indicated for patients in the DapaTAVI trial, Ben-Yehuda noted.

However, the “pervasive assumption” that TAVI solves the problem of heart failure related to aortic stenosis might explain why SGLT2 inhibitors are not commonly considered after TAVI. But SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with risk reduction in DapaTAVI, despite successful valve replacement. The separation in the event curves in favor of dapagliflozin was evident in the 30 days after randomization and is, in the opinion of Ben-Yehuda, immediately relevant to clinical practice.

“The positive outcome data of this trial are important and should influence the treatment of patients after TAVI,” Ben-Yehuda said.

“I know for me it will be practice changing when I go back to New York next week,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was the ACC-invited discussant. “I think I am pretty good about making sure my patients with heart failure and without contraindications are on SGLT2 inhibitors at discharge, but I must say that in my TAVI patients, SGLT2 inhibitors have not been part of the checklist.”

He said he now plans to offer an SGLT2 inhibitor to all TAVI patients with heart failure who do not have a contraindication to this therapy. Importantly, this includes older patients.

The older population has “largely been excluded from SGLT2 inhibitors in most cardiovascular outcome trials,” said Bhatt, who estimated that patients aged 70 years or older make up < 10% of those randomized in pivotal SGLT2 inhibitor outcome trials.

“Despite TAVI, patients with aortic stenosis still face high rates of heart failure events,” Raposeiras-Roubin observed. The routine initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors could address this problem.

Raposeiras Roubin and Ben-Yehuda reported no conflicts of interest. Bhatt reported having financial relationships with more than 45 pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol Myers Squibb, which manufactures dapagliflozin.

FIFA has a new ticket package to consider","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/fifa-club-world-cup-tickets-bundle-lincoln-financial-field-2026-20250403.html","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 18:40:36 GMT","

Soccer's governing body is offering a first-come, first-served special on its website for fans looking to attend this summer's FIFA Club World Cup and the larger tournament in 2026.

Fans looking for ways to get their hands on tickets to next summer's FIFA World Cup before the gouge of ticket resellers, you're in luck.

It will still cost you, but the blow won't be nearly as bad. 

On Thursday, FIFA announced it will hold a first-come, first-served special on its website for fans looking to attend this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. The “ticket packs” will come in two forms. 

» READ MORE: The U.S. is set to host the 2031 women's World Cup, FIFA's president says



A regular ticket pack grants the ticket holder the opportunity to purchase tickets to two Club World Club matches anywhere in the country, with the right to buy for a third. It also guarantees a ticket holder the right to purchase at least one ticket to a FIFA World Cup game, excluding the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 

A Super Ticket bundle allows the right to purchase tickets to as many as 20 FIFA Club World Cup matches, but it has to include either the opening match between Major League Soccer's Inter Miami vs. Al Ahly FC of the Saudi League, a semifinal, or the July 14 final. 

According to the FIFA release, purchasing a Super Ticket bundle grants the ticket holder a guaranteed option to purchase at least one ticket to the FIFA World Cup final. 

There is a catch. 

A guaranteed ticket opportunity will be honored only if fans purchase the tickets directly through FIFA's Club World Cup ticket portal or via fifa.com/tickets. 

Also, tickets must be used by the original purchaser and not be resold, which, if they are sold on the secondary market, will nullify the opportunity to get first dibs on World Cup tickets. 

FIFA's offer began Thursday and will last for the next 25 days or until tickets are gone. The governing body urged interested fans to read the terms and conditions. A quick glance shows much of the language beyond the usual notices regarding pricing, availability, and fan code of conduct, explicitly explaining the guidelines for securing an opportunity for the World Cup presale.

Philadelphia will be home to eight Club World Club match dates, including six group stage matches beginning on June 16, a knockout round game on June 28, and a quarterfinal on Independence Day. The early matches include world powerhouses Manchester City, Chelsea, Juventus, and Real Madrid, all participating in Lincoln Financial Field matches.

Madison Keys opened up on her tennis return after winning the Australian Open.

The 30-year-old claimed the biggest title of her career following an epic victory against Aryna Sabalenka in the Melbourne final back in January.

Keys defeated the World number one to win the first Grand Slam title of her career and in the process stop the Belarusian from winning the tournament three years in a row.

The American did not compete again until she was back on home soil at the Indian Wells Masters and she has since admitted something about her comeback.

After toiling away for years on the WTA Tour and experiencing some agonising heartbreak, Keys finally achieved her dream of becoming a Grand Slam champion.

She is now up to a career high ranking of number five and she plans to continue with her good form and attain more success moving forward.

Keys was pleased to have a mental break after her success Down Under and missed the Middle Eastern swing that followed the Grand Slam.

But once she returned at Indian Wells, Keys admitted not being completely ready for the pressure and expectation that comes with being a Grand Slam champion. 

Keys spoke to reporters at the Charleston Open, where she began her campaign by beating her compatriot Caroline Dolehide 6-3, 7-6(4).

She said: “Just taking that time at home was really important but getting back on the court for the first time was also something that I don't think I was 100% prepared for.”

During her press conference after her opening win at the Charleston Open, Keys also touched on her defeat to Sabalenka at Indian Wells.

The Belarusian gained some element of revenge when she defeated Keys for the loss of just one game in their semi-final.

Keys came through some taxing matches before facing Sabalenka and admitted she struggled both physically and mentally.

“I don't know if you have ever lost like that in front of a massive crowd like that. But, no, you're not having a great time out there,” she added.

“But it was kind of an emotional rollercoaster for me through that week and it was, honestly, already a lot more of an emotional rollercoaster and toll than I thought it was going to be after the Australian Open.

“I think honestly I kind of just ran out of steam,” she added. “When you are playing someone like Aryna, you can't not play well and it's kind of one of those things where you just leave it and pretend that it never happened.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Reigning MotoGP world champion Jorge Martin says input from rival Marc Marquez was significant in helping him not to rush his recovery or his return to action.

Having missed most of pre-season testing due to an accident in Sepang, Martin has also been absent from the first three rounds of the 2025 season following a training crash he described as “nasty”. Ahead of the Aprilia rider's planned return to racing in Qatar next weekend, Martin spoke exclusively with Motorsport.com and reflected on Marquez's contribution.

“Marc [Marquez] and other riders, like Pecco [Bagnaia], told me to take my time – not to rush things,” said the Madrid man. “That was the best advice. In Marc's case, what he says about these things carries a lot of weight because he was injured for a long time.”

Although Marquez is now fully fit, his career was derailed by a crash at Jerez in 2020. His recovery process was complicated by his attempt to return from that injury too soon.

“He said it from the heart,” continued Martin. “It's nice when your rivals show concern for you because it also means they want to see you back on track, fighting for the [major places] alongside them. When you see a colleague suffering, you really empathise with them.”

In keeping with his no-rush policy, Martin says he will be taking it easy in his first races back. With any slim hopes of a world championship defence now gone, there is little to be gained by chasing maximum points.

Furthermore, the 2025 Aprilia does not yet look like a winning motorcycle. None of the four riders across the factory or Trackhouse teams have scored a top-three finish so far this season, with rookie Ai Ogura coming closest thus far with fourth place in the Thailand opener.

“I'm approaching this with a lot of excitement but without the pressure of having to go out and win immediately,” continued Martin. “The first few races, until I feel comfortable, I will take more calmly. I need to grow alongside Aprilia.

“The truth is, when I come back, I won't be at 100%. Given my current situation, with a new bike, my goal is to get in as many laps as possible. The most important thing is that when I get back on the bike, my physical condition allows me to ride properly.

“I need to clearly identify my objective. I'm someone who is driven by goals, and I need to be very clear about what my target will be for Qatar.”

Martin also revealed that he intended to confront the circuit where the training accident occurred aboard a Supermoto machine in February.

“That crash won't happen to me again,” he declared. “I will go back to that track because I want to face it. I know what I did wrong, and I won't do it again.”

Martin confirmed that this accident was the toughest he has had to deal with in his career so far.

“The one in Portimao [in 2023] is still very fresh in my mind, but this one was even more violent – really nasty. On top of that, it caused complicated fractures, which is what has frustrated me the most. I had three fractures in my hand, four in my foot, and something in my rib that we still don't fully understand.

“[But] these experiences teach you things on a mental level because they show you that everything passes and that, sooner or later, you'll see the light again.”

We're already running to the theater. During its CinemaCon presentation on Thursday, Paramount Pictures gave the first look at “The Running Man,” the new adaptation of Stephen King's book as directed by Edgar Wright and starring Glen Powell. While footage won't be shared publicly for a while, we're happy to report that the film looks as visually stylized and creative as any of Wright's prior films.

It's not a remake of the 1987 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger but a new take on the King novel, in which an economically struggling U.S. (just how severe are those tariffs?) launches a game show where contestants are chased by murderous hunters across the globe. Wright at CinemaCon said King's book was one of his favorites as a teenager, but the real story in King's book has never been told. Fittingly, the book was set in the year 2025, so the timing of Wright's “The Running Man” adaptation couldn't be more perfect.

Powell called Wright's movie “nothing short of extraordinary” and didn't expect the action “to be so real,” saying that he did much of his own stunts. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“This is what I get for asking Tom Cruise's advice on using a stunt double,” he said. “But now that I've gone through the fire, I can say that I've never worked harder on a movie in my life.”

In the first footage shown, Colman Domingo plays the host of America's biggest reality show, and Wright's film is very much about America: “This is America, God Dammit, and we don't put up with no bullshit.” We then see Powell evading all sorts of captors and killers all while being followed by camera drones everywhere he goes. At one point he dons a disguise that should recall his work in last year's “Hit Man.” But he won't go down that easy. “I'm still here you shit eaters!” 

Wright has assembled an impressive supporting cast for “The Running Man,” which also includes Josh Brolin, Lee Pace, Katy O'Brian, William H. Macy, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, David Zayas, and Sean Hayes. While Wright has been kicking around a “Running Man” remake for a while, with the project in development as far back as 2021, the film really picked up steam this time last year at CinemaCon when Powell's casting was announced on the Colosseum stage.

Wright co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Bacall, and the film opens in theaters November 7, 2025.

Police say man landed on island in attempt to meet the Sentinelese people – a tribe untouched by the industrial world

Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a US tourist who sneaked on to a highly restricted island carrying a coconut and a can of Diet Coke to a tribe untouched by the industrial world.

Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel – part of India's Andaman Islands – in an attempt to meet the Sentinelese people, who are believed to number only about 150.

All outsiders, Indians and foreigners alike, are banned from travelling within 3 miles (5km) of the island to protect the Indigenous people from outside diseases and to preserve their way of life.

“The American citizen was presented before the local court after his arrest and is now on a three-day remand for further interrogation,” the Andaman and Nicobar Islands police chief, HGS Dhaliwal, told AFP.

Satellite photographs show a coral reef-fringed island – stretching to some 6 miles at its widest point – with thick forest and white sand beaches.

The Sentinelese last made international headlines in 2018 after they killed John Allen Chau, 27, an American missionary who landed illegally on their beach.

Chau's body was not recovered and there were no investigations over his death because of the Indian law prohibiting anyone from going to the island.

India sees the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands as strategically sited on key global shipping lanes. They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.

New Delhi plans to invest at least $9bn (£6.7bn) to expand naval and airbases, troop accommodation, the port and the main city in the region.

Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe's attention before he went ashore.

“He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,” Dhaliwal said. “A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.”

Police said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.

He first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.

This time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 35 kilometres (22 miles) of open sea from the main archipelago.

The Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.

A photograph issued by the Indian coastguard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.

Indian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.

The Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in an attempt to spend time with the Jarawa.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            The acting Inspector General of the Defense Department will review Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's use of Signal in a group chat with other key national security officials to discuss military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen last month, the IG's office announced on Thursday.
    


            In a letter to Hegseth, Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins wrote that the objective of the IG's “evaluation” is to determine whether Hegseth and other Pentagon personnel “complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business.”
    


            The probe will also examine whether Hegseth complied with classification and records retention requirements, the letter says. The review will take place both in Washington, DC and at US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, it adds.
    


            The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee requested that Stebbins conduct a review after The Atlantic magazine reported last month that Hegseth and other senior national security officials used the messaging app Signal to discuss military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Sources say the details shared by Hegseth in Signal chat were classified as Atlantic publishes additional messages



            The information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat, including the exact timing of strikes against the Houthis and the kinds of aircraft and weapons systems that would be used, was highly classified at the time he wrote it, CNN has reported. Hegseth shared the information with the group, which included the vice president and the national security adviser, 30 minutes before the operation began, the texts released by The Atlantic showed.
    


            Top US officials have said the information shared in the text messages was not classified, and Hegseth's spokesperson Sean Parnell also denied that any classified information was shared.
    


            “These additional Signal chat messages confirm there were no classified materials or war plans shared,” Parnell said last week. “The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels. The American people see through the Atlantic's pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump's national security agenda.”
    


            As part of the investigation, Stebbins indicated that Hegseth will likely have to turn over materials for the IG to review.
    


            Stebbins, who previously served as the Pentagon's deputy inspector general, was appointed acting IG after Trump fired Robert Storch, who was fired by Trump along with more than a dozen other inspectors general at federal agencies in the first few weeks of the Trump administration.

Follow:


            Carbon monoxide, often called the “silent killer,” has no taste, odor or color, yet prolonged inhalation of the invisible gas has been tied to the recent deaths of several American tourists traveling abroad.
    


            In March, 14-year-old Miller Gardner, son of former New York Yankees player Brett Gardner, died on a family vacation at a Costa Rica beach resort. A month prior, three American women were discovered dead in their Belize hotel room. In both cases, authorities have said carbon monoxide poisoning caused the deaths.
    


            While many homes in the U.S. are equipped with alarms that detect the presence of the dangerous gas, travelers may need to take extra precautions to limit their exposure on the road.
    


            Carbon monoxide is produced when natural gas is burned in appliances like boilers, pool heaters, gas stoves, fireplaces and dryers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    


            “Every carbon monoxide producing appliance is designed to take those toxic fuels out of the building,” said Charon McNabb, founder of the National Carbon Monoxide Awareness Foundation.
    


            Without regular maintenance, McNabb said venting systems can corrode or shift, creating leak pathways for carbon monoxide to remain trapped indoors. The gas is then capable of traveling into nearby rooms through drywall, doors and air ducts.
    


            A buildup of carbon monoxide in the air can diminish your ability to absorb oxygen, resulting in serious or fatal tissue damage to the brain, heart and muscles.
    


            According to a 2019 study published in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, 905 U.S. lodging guests were poisoned by carbon monoxide from 2005 to 2018, resulting in 22 deaths.
    


            In the U.S., requirements for carbon monoxide detectors in homes and hotels differ by state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
    


            While vacation rental platforms like VRBO and Airbnb only require listed units to meet local regulations, owners can indicate whether a carbon monoxide alarm is present on the property within their listings.
    


            McNabb advises travelers booking accommodations to call ahead of their stay to check for the presence of detectors in each guest room and ask about the location of their room within the building.
    


            “Travelers may want to stay away from (rooms next to) pools and pool heaters because typically, the chemicals for the pools are kept in the mechanical room where the heater is stored, and those chemicals can corrode the metal much quicker, creating leak paths,” McNabb said, adding that rooms on higher floors can also provide a safer distance from gas-powered yard equipment.
    


            “If you're not totally confident in the answers you get, play it safe and bring your own (carbon monoxide) alarm,” McNabb said.
    


            Portable alarms are battery or outlet powered, pocket-sized devices capable of monitoring CO levels and alerting the user of unsafe levels. TSA permits travelling with carbon monoxide alarms, but lithium batteries should be taken out of the device and placed in carry-on luggage.
    


            Kos Galatsis, CEO of Forensics Detectors, which sells air quality monitoring devices, suggests travelers keep the alarm by their bedside, as many poisonings occur while stationary or sleeping.
    


            Prices for portable CO alarms online range drastically, but the most important feature to look out for is a UL 2034 certification, which designates the device is in line with national product safety standards.
    


            Campers should avoid using portable gas stoves, gas-powered lanterns, power generators and flameless chemical heaters inside of tents, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
    


            This is especially important when camping in high altitudes, where the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is increased.
    


            Tents should also be pitched away from idling vehicles and campfire, according to the CPSC.
    


            Initial symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure can easily be mistaken for the flu, jet lag or stomach bugs.
    


Signs of poisoning, according to Mayo Clinic, include:
    


            -        Dull headache
    


            -        Weakness
    


            -        Dizziness
    


            -        Nausea or vomiting
    


            -        Shortness of breath
    


            -        Confusion
    


            -        Blurred vision
    


            -        Loss of consciousness
    


            High levels of exposure can cause symptoms such as mental confusion and loss of muscle control to develop more rapidly.
    


            If you or fellow travelers experience any of these symptoms, seek fresh air and medical advice immediately.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As a condition for receiving federal money, the Trump administration is ordering K-12 schools to certify that they are following federal civil rights laws and ending any discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

A notice sent Thursday by the Education Department gives states and schools 10 days to sign and return the certification. It's the latest escalation against DEI policies, apparently giving the Republican administration a new lever for terminating federal money.

“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. He said many schools have flouted their legal obligations, “including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another.”

The certification asks state and school leaders to sign a “reminder of legal obligations” acknowledging their federal money is conditioned on compliance with federal civil rights laws. It also demands compliance with several pages of legal analysis written by the administration. 

“The use of certain DEI practices can violate federal law,” the administration wrote in the certification, adding that it is illegal for programs to advantage one race over another.

Schools and states that use illegal DEI practices can face a loss of federal money, including grants and contracts, and can be held liable under the False Claims Act, according to the certification. It specifically threatens Title I funding, which sends billions of dollars a year to America's schools and targets low-income areas.




The department ordered state education offices to sign the certification and collect certifications from school systems.

It follows a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any school policy that treats students or staff differently because of their race is illegal. It aimed to fight what the memo described as widespread discrimination in education, often against white and Asian American students.

The certification letter drew blowback from critics who said it conflicts with Trump's promise to return education to schools and states.

“Is this what the Trump administration calls local control? You can't say you're giving control back to states and then dictate how they run their schools,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union.

The new memo appears to lay the groundwork for financial sanctions of the kind the Trump administration has leveraged against colleges. Columbia University recently agreed to several demands after the federal government cut $400 million amid an investigation into campus antisemitism.

The government has used similar tactics at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Schools across the U.S. have been scrambling to determine what practices could run afoul of the anti-DEI orders, but the new letter does little to add clarity.

The initial February memo declared that federal law prohibits schools and colleges from “using race” in decisions related to admissions, hiring financial aid, housing, student life and more. As justification, it invoked a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring affirmative action in college admissions — a case focused on admissions practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.

The department later clarified that some practices are allowed, including Black History Month celebrations and programs focused on certain cultures, but it said many schools have “advanced discriminatory policies and practices under the banner of ‘DEI' initiatives.”

The American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers' union, is suing to block the Feb. 14 memo, saying it violates the First and Fifth amendments.

The union's president called the certification requirement illegal, saying federal law prohibits the White House from telling schools and colleges what to teach, and that federal money cannot be withheld without due process.

“He's wielding a cudgel of billions in federal aid to tens of millions of children, of all races and ethnicities, to force educators to kowtow to his politics and ideology,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada will match U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs with a tariff on vehicles imported from the United States. Trump's previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports took effect Thursday.

TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday that Canada will match U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs with a tariff on vehicles imported from the United States.

Trump's previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports took effect Thursday. The prime minister said he told Trump last week in a phone call that he would be retaliating for those tariffs.

“We take these measures reluctantly. And we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact in Canada,” Carney said. 

Carney said Canada won't put tariffs on auto parts as Trump has done, because he said Canadians know the benefits of the integrated auto sector. The parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.

Carney said Canadians are already seeing the impact. 

Automaker Stellantis said it shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, Canada, for two weeks from April 7, the local union said late Wednesday. The president of Unifor Local 444, James Stewart, said more scheduling changes were expected in coming weeks. 

Carney said that will impact 3,600 auto workers that he met with last week. 

Autos are Canada's second-largest export and the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.

Carney announced last week a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump's tariffs.




Trump previously placed 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum. And Carney said Canada can expects further tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber and semi-conductors. 

“Given the prospective damage to their own people the American administration should eventually change course,” Carney said. “Although their policy will hurt American families, until that pain becomes impossible to ignore, I do not believe they will change direction, so the road to that point may indeed be long. And will be hard on Canadians just as it will be on other partners of the United States.” 

Carney, a former two-time central banker in Canada and the U.K, said Trump's actions will reverberate in Canada and across the world. “They are all unjustified and unwarranted and in our judgement misguided,” Carney said. 

Canada's initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs remain in place, having been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.

Carney suspended his election campaign to return to Ottawa to deal with Trump's tariffs. 

Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said he would remove the federal tax on Canadian made vehicles. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada's auto industry, called Canada's latest tariffs a “measured response.”

Fox News' Madeleine Rivera reports the latest on the legal battle over the Trump administration's deportation flights. 

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Thursday grilled Trump administration lawyers over whether they defied a court order blocking deportations under a wartime immigration law — a potential step toward holding the administration in contempt.

At issue is the administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua gang. Boasberg pressed Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign on why the government appeared to ignore an emergency injunction last month halting those deportations.

The administration has appealed the underlying case to the Supreme Court. But for now, Boasberg is weighing whether there is probable cause to move forward with contempt proceedings — a question that remained open after a tense exchange in court.

Boasberg said he would issue a decision as early as next week on how to proceed if he finds grounds to hold the administration in contempt.

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

During the hearing, Ensign was repeatedly questioned about who in the Trump administration had information about the flights and when the three deportation flights left U.S. soil for El Salvador. At least 261 migrants were deported that day, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal ""solely on the basis"" of the law temporarily blocked by the court.

""You maintain that the government was in full compliance with the court's order on March 15, correct?"" Boasberg asked Ensign. 

Ensign said yes, to which the judge responded: ""It seems to me the government acted in bad faith that day."" 

""If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and would survive a court challenge, you would not have operated the way that you did,"" Boasberg said.  

'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO

He repeatedly questioned Ensign about his knowledge of the flights and whether any related materials were classified, which could have triggered state secrets protections.

Government lawyers have refused to share information in court about the deportation flights, and whether the plane (or planes) of migrants knowingly departed U.S. soil after the judge ordered them not to do so, citing national security protections. 

But according to Ensign, that may not have been an issue. He told Boasberg the flight information likely wasn't classified, prompting the judge to wonder aloud why it hadn't been shared with him in an ex parte setting.

""Can you think of one instance"" where the state secrets privilege was invoked using unclassified info? he asked Ensign, who struggled to respond.

""Pretty sketchy,"" Boasberg said aloud in response.

Another focus of Thursday's hearing was timing — both when President Donald Trump signed the proclamation authorizing use of the Alien Enemies Act, and when federal agents began loading planes with migrants bound for El Salvador.

Boasberg noted that the Trump administration began loading the planes the morning of March 15, hours before the flights left the U.S.

""So then it's not crazy to infer there was prior knowledge and actions ahead of the Saturday night deportations?"" he asked Ensign.

The judge pressed the lawyer over the names, locations and agencies of individuals who were privy to the removals, as well as internal conversations with other administration officials who may have been listening in to the court proceedings.

""Who did you tell about my order?"" Boasberg asked. ""Once the hearing was done, who did you tell?""

Ensign says he relayed the information to Department of Homeland Security contacts and State Department officials, among others.

He listed the names of the individuals, at Boasberg's request, which the judge then carefully transcribed onto a pad of paper, interjecting at times to clarify the spelling or ask for their job titles.

The hearing is the latest in a flurry of legal battles over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. It follows Boasberg's order requiring officials to explain why they failed to comply with his directive to return the deportation flights — and whether they knowingly defied the court.

Boasberg told both sides he would see them again next week for arguments on the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion, set for Tuesday.

The hearing also marks the latest clash between Trump and Boasberg, whom the president has publicly denounced as an ""activist"" judge and called for his impeachment.

National Security Advisor Michael Waltz is pressed on claims from an article in 'The Atlantic' and defends the Trump administration's foreign policy success on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump confirmed that multiple employees within the National Security Council were fired Thursday, adding to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz's recent political woes that have snowballed since Democrats first slammed him over March's Signal chat leak. 

""Always, we're going to let go of people we don't like, or people we don't think can do the job, or people who may have loyalties to somebody else,"" Trump said from Air Force One when asked about reports on the NSC firings. 

Trump confirmed that NSC members had been fired, but remarked it was not many individuals. 

Trump added that he continues to trust his NSC team, remarking that they've ""done very well"" and ""had big success with the Houthis.""  

Waltz, who previously served as a Florida congressman and as a decorated combat Green Beret, has come under fire from Democrats and critics since March, when the Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published a firsthand account of getting added to a Signal group chat with top national security leaders, including Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, while they discussed strikes against Yemen terrorists. Trump and his administration have repeatedly defended the national security leader amid criticisms over the chat leak.  

Signal is an encrypted messaging app that operates similarly to texting or making phone calls, but with additional security measures that help ensure communications are kept private to those included in the correspondence.

The Atlantic's report characterized the Trump administration as texting ""war plans"" regarding a planned strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Trump administration has maintained, however, that no classified material was transmitted in the chat, with Trump repeatedly defending Waltz amid the fallout. 

NSC CONFIRMS MIKE WALTZ AND STAFF USED GMAIL FOR GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATION

""As the president has made it very clear, Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team,"" Trump administration press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the media in brief remarks outside of the White House's press room Monday afternoon. ""And this case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned.""

""There have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again,"" she continued. ""And we're moving forward. And the president and Mike Waltz and his entire national security team have been working together very well, if you look at how much safer the United States of America is because of the leadership of this team.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'I'm never going to buy options again': Retail traders online are despairing over the impact of Trump's tariffs","https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-tariffs-trump-trade-war-retail-investors-reddit-2025-4","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 15:38:00 GMT","

There's no way to sugarcoat it. Retail traders online are in full-blown panic mode over the trade war. 

Everyday investors took to social media on Thursday to commiserate over the impact of the president's latest tariffs, which tanked stocks on Thursday. 

By 11:00 a.m. ET, the rout had deepened, with the S&P 500 down more than 4%, the Dow falling over 1,500 points, and the Nasdaq 100 falling over 5%. Bond yields also sank as investors flocked towards safe-haven assets, with the 10-year US Treasury yield declining as much as 18 basis points to its lowest level since October.

Individual investors were caught off guard by the sweeping nature of the latest duties, which included a base 10% tariff on all US imports, with tariffs on goods from China rising to 54%. Trump whipped out a presentation board during the Wednesday address in the White House Rose Garden to show the scope of the tariffs, which impact dozens of US trading partners. 

""You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out,"" one user on r/WallStreetBets, the popular retail trading subreddit that exploded in popularity during the pandemic, wrote on Wednesday.

Other users lamented large losses in their portfolios since the market began to slide late Wednesday.

One user said he was ""officially bankrupt"" after purchasing calls on Nike prior to the tariffs announcement. Nike stock dropped 12% by mid-day Thursday as multinational brands with global supply chains were particularly hard hit. 

""I'm never going to buy options again, all my gains and now I wasted 5 years of savings,"" the user said.

Retail trader sentiment has soured since Trump's second term began.

While markets initially rejoiced at Trump's return to the White House, reality quickly set in as he pursued a much wider trade war than initially expected.  

In recent months, excitement about the president's pro-growth measures has been crushed by trade war fears and the potential impact on inflation and economic growth.

One Reddit user speculated that the damage to stocks could run on and potentially create a bear market, which is defined by stocks falling 20% from their peak.

""Today 30 years of globalization have ended. I think there will be consequences,"" the user said, speculating that high inflation and job losses could lead to a ""relatively long"" down period for stocks.

""The process of negotiating with dozens and dozens of countries simply won't happen fast. Maybe it's time to get out for an extended period of time???"" they later added.

""I have a feeling this might be one of the biggest bear traps ever tomorrow and a lot of people are going to get liquidated to hell,"" another user said, speculating that the decline in stocks could be on par with what was seen during the 2008 recession.

The American Association of Individual Investors' most recent survey shows 61.9% of investors are bearish on the stock market over the next six months. That's about double the historical average, and nearly three times the number of investors who felt bullish about the market, which stood at 21.8%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Trump's formula for tariffs shows the real thing he cares about: trade deficits","https://www.businessinsider.com/the-math-used-to-calculate-trump-tariffs-2025-4","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 15:34:00 GMT","

It turns out a pretty simple formula was used to calculate President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.

The levies on imported goods into the US vary widely between countries, ranging from 10% to 50%.

The formula used — which prompted derision from some once it was revealed by the Office of the US Trade Representative — involves dividing a country or territory's trade surplus with the US by the value of its exports to the US. Then, the resulting figure was divided by two, to make the tariff rate.

The approach has led to some eyebrow-raising rates. The French territory Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which has a population of around 5,000 people, was slapped with a 50% tariff.

Data from the US Census Bureau shows that $3.4 million of goods were imported from the islands to the US in 2024, while Saint Pierre and Miquelon imported $100,000 from the US last year so that trade imbalance was used to calculate the tariff rate.

In a statement Wednesday night, the US Trade Representative said the tariffs were ""calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the US and each of our trading partners.""

A number of countries, like the UK, Singapore, and Brazil, were hit with a base tariff rate of 10%. Israel, which scrapped all tariffs on American goods, was hit with a 17% levy.

Vietnam, a key competitor to China, would be subject to a 46% tariff.

""If trade deficits are persistent because of tariff and non-tariff policies and fundamentals, then the tariff rate consistent with offsetting these policies and fundamentals is reciprocal and fair,"" the US Trade Representative said.

Economists were quick to weigh in on the revelation of exactly how the Trump administration calculated the tariffs.

""The tariff calculation approach arguably makes for a more free-wheeling and open-ended nature to potential trade negotiations in coming months,"" George Saravelos, the head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.

""It seems there are no specific and identifiable policy asks per se but ultimately a desire to reduce bilateral trade imbalances,"" he added.

Others shared more pointed criticism of the approach.

Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus at the NYU Stern School of Business, wrote in a post on X that the formula used is ""totally flawed"" because it assumes that a fair trade balance has to be equal to zero.

""By that standard since the US runs a trade surplus in services other countries should impose a large services reciprocal tariffs against the US to balance that trade too!"" Roubini said.

Peter Schiff, the chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said in a post on X that the tariffs are based on ""a bogus formula that attributes any nation's trade surplus to tariffs, even if tariffs are low or nonexistent.""

""Running bilateral trade surplus/deficits with different countries is the way it should be,"" Olivier Blanchard, Robert M. Solow professor of economics emeritus at MIT, wrote in an X post. ""Trying to eliminate each one is simply stupid.""

""I have a trade deficit with my grocer, a trade surplus with my employer. I am not sure it would be a great idea for me to work for my grocer,"" he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron was quick to respond to US President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs on the European Union by urging businesses in the world's largest trading bloc to halt spending on the US.

“What would the message be of having big European players that invest billions in the American economy at the same time they are hitting us,” Macron said. “We must have collective solidarity.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Pentagon's internal watchdog opened an investigation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for using the Signal messaging app to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen in March with other senior Trump administration officials.

The probe will determine to what extent Hegseth and other Defense Department staff complied with existing rules over the ""use of a commercial messaging application for official business,"" the department's Office of Inspector General said in a memo Thursday.

""Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements,"" acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins told Hegseth in the memo.

The probe was launched at the request of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the committee's ranking Democrat, according to the memo.

Experts have raised concerns about whether the Signal chats violated the law.

The Signal group chat where Hegseth discussed strikes on Houthi targets included Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Hegseth gave the chat participants sensitive operational details, including the timing of the attacks and the weapons to be used.

Hegseth's texts were revealed in a bombshell report last week by The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who Waltz inadvertently added to the group chat.

The Trump administration has said that no classified information was discussed in the thread.

The Defense Department declined to comment on Stebbins' investigation, citing longstanding policy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Waltz was at an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, where the far-right activist Laura Loomer pressed the president to fire some of his national security aides, NBC News reported.

Trump fired six members of his National Security Council after that meeting, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Stebbins became the Pentagon's acting watchdog after Trump fired Inspector General Robert Storch in January.

Stebbins was previously appointed principal deputy inspector general in April 2023, under President Joe Biden.

As the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) continues to defund nearly every research project on transgender health, the White House has directed the agency to focus on studying “regret” after a person transitions to align their body with their gender identity. Several NIH employees, who were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed the directive to Nature.

‘Mind-boggling': US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers

‘Mind-boggling': US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers

Two weeks ago, Matthew Memoli, who was acting NIH director at the time, sent an e-mail to the directors of several NIH institutes. It said that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is the NIH's parent agency, “has been directed to fund research on a few specific areas” related to what it calls “chemical and surgical mutilation” of children and adults — a reference to gender-affirming care and surgery. “This is very important to the President and the Secretary” of the HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the e-mail added.

Based on its priorities, the White House sometimes directs the NIH — the world's largest public funder of biomedical science — to study certain broad topics, such as cancer or women's health, but the latest directive's specificity, inflammatory language and focus on a hyper-polarizing topic are unprecedented, the NIH employees say. Although the White House can sometimes “push us on various different things, we normally get to chart out the approach”, a staff member says.

Many scientists, reeling from the abrupt cancellation of more than US$180 million in NIH funding for research on transgender health, slammed the proposed studies as ideologically driven.

“It's really pigeonholing trans people into this medical lens where the only thing important to know about them is that they seek medical transition” and regret it, says Harry Barbee, who studies the health of people from gender and sexual minorities (LGBT+) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and identifies as non-binary and queer. “When ideology is prioritized over scientific merit, that threatens the entire scientific enterprise.”

The NIH and the White House did not respond to Nature's queries about the new research priorities or scientists' concerns with their apparent ideological bent. The HHS said that the “NIH is prioritizing research that serves the best interests of public health, not ideological agendas, and will continue to support studies that provide clear, objective data — particularly regarding the long-term effects of gender transitions.”

Estimates suggest that 1.6 million people in the United States identify as transgender, and about one-quarter of them obtain gender-affirming surgeries. Research suggests1 that access to these procedures can reduce anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation in transgender people.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office on 20 January that directed the US government to stop acknowledging that gender can differ from sex at birth. The cancellation of many trans-health research grants quickly followed, and now the agency seems to be shifting the type of research it funds. The e-mail from Memoli, obtained by Nature, specifies two areas of research that the Trump administration wishes to fund about “social transition”, which is when a person changes how they express their gender to others — for example, by changing their name or appearance. 

These include “regret and detransition following social transition as well as chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults” and “outcomes from children who have undergone social transition and/or chemical and surgical mutilation”, the e-mail says.

More research on the experience of trans people — including understanding reasons for dissatisfaction after transition — is direly needed, Barbee says. But they worry that the sole focus on negative consequences is misplaced: fewer than 1% of transgender people who undergo gender-affirming surgery regret it, according to an analysis published by Barbee and their colleagues2. By comparison, 14.4% of the broader population reports regret after any kind of surgery3.

So far, about 187 NIH grants funding trans-health research have been terminated, according to an online effort to track the Trump team's research cuts by Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who studies LGBT+ health, and her colleagues. In 2023, the NIH funded about 180 projects in this field, according to another NIH employee.

If these proposed studies move forwards, it will create a “a distorted research ecosystem where only politically favourable findings are permitted to exist” and an “evidence vacuum for clinicians who are trying to do right by their patients”, Barbee says.

Generative AI has vastly expanded the toolkit available to hackers and other bad actors. It's now possible to do everything from deepfaking a CEO to creating fake receipts.

OpenAI, the biggest generative AI startup of them all, knows this better than anyone. And it has just invested in another AI startup that helps companies defend against these kinds of attacks.

New York-based Adaptive Security has raised a $43 million Series A co-led by OpenAI's startup fund and Andreessen Horowitz, it announced Wednesday. This marks OpenAI's first investment in a cybersecurity startup, OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch. 

Adaptive Security simulates AI-generated “hacks” to train employees to spot these threats. You might pick up the phone to listen to the voice of your CTO asking for a verification code. That wouldn't be your actual CTO, but a spoof generated by Adaptive Security. 

Adaptive Security's platform doesn't just spoof phone calls: It also covers texts and emails, while scoring which parts of a company might be most vulnerable and training staff to spot the risks.

The startup focuses on hacks that require a human employee to do something they're not supposed to, like click on a bad link. These kinds of “social engineering” hacks, while basic, have led to huge losses — think of Axie Infinity, which lost over $600 million due to a fake job offer for one of its developers in 2022.

AI tools have made social engineering hacks easier than ever, co-founder and CEO Brian Long told TechCrunch. Launched in 2023, Adaptive now has over 100 customers, with Long saying positive feedback from them helped attract OpenAI to the cap table. 

It doesn't hurt that Long is a veteran entrepreneur with two previous successes: mobile ad startup TapCommerce, which he sold to Twitter in 2014 (reportedly for over $100 million) and ad-tech firm Attentive, which was last valued at over $10 billion in 2021 according to one of its investors.

Long told TechCrunch that Adaptive Security will use its latest funding mostly on hiring engineers to build out its product and keep up in the AI “arms race” against bad actors. 

Adaptive Security joins a long list of other cyber startups working on the boom in AI threats. Cyberhaven just raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation to help stop staff from putting sensitive info in tools like ChatGPT, Forbes reported. There's also Snyk, which partly credits the rise of insecure AI-generated code for helping push its ARR north of $300 million. And deepfake detection startup GetReal just raised $17.5 million last month. 

As AI threats become more sophisticated, Long has one simple tip for company employees worried about getting their voice cloned by hackers. “Delete your voicemail,” he recommends.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Spending less time in 2 deep sleep stages may contribute to Alzheimer's","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lower-proportions-time-2-sleep-stages-may-contribute-alzheimers","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:54:10 GMT","

Understanding the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease is a hot topic. With few effective treatments and increased prevalence, taking steps to potentially reduce risk is vital. 

The authors of a new study, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, investigate links between sleep architecture and brain regions relevant to Alzheimer's.

Sleep architecture refers to the sleep phases that the brain cycles through each night.

These are the four phases of sleep:

People generally cycle through these four phases 4–6 times each night. 

Previous research has shown that aspects of sleep, such as sleeping for longer than normal or disturbed sleep are associated with dementia risk and disease progression. 

However, until the latest study, the direct links between specific aspects of sleep architecture and Alzheimer's — specifically the neuroanatomy associated with this disease, had not been studied in depth.

Alzheimer's is characterized by brain atrophy. In other words, it shrinks. According to the authors of the new study, some brain regions atrophy more than others. These include:

Alongside these Alzheimer's-vulnerable brain regions, other factors are also associated with Alzheimer's progression — namely, cerebral microbleeds. 

As the name suggests, these are small bleeds within the brain and a sign of cerebral small vessel disease, which appears to be linked to Alzheimer's. 

The latest research explores the relationship between specific sleep phases and Alzheimer's-vulnerable brain regions. 

To investigate, they recruited 270 participants who were involved in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study.

They used polysomnography to assess sleep architecture. Then, they used MRI to look at the anatomical features of the brain (such as brain volume and evidence of cerebral microbleeds) 13–17 years later. They also measured the proportion of slow wave sleep, the proportion of REM sleep, and how often they experienced arousal during the night.

The scientists found that having less slow-wave sleep was associated with a smaller inferior parietal region and cuneus. Similarly, having less REM sleep was linked to a smaller inferior parietal region and precuneus. 

After adjusting their analysis for errors, reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep were most tightly associated with atrophy of the inferior parietal region.

Interestingly, measures of arousal during sleep and microbleeds were not associated with the volume of any Alzheimer's-vulnerable brain regions.

According to the authors, this study is the “first to examine the relationship of sleep architecture with the atrophy of [Alzheimer's]-vulnerable regions in older adults.”

The results of this study infer that reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep may play a significant role in the reduction of volume in the inferior parietal region.

Earlier research has shown that sleep helps clear toxins from the brain. The authors suggest that this might help explain why reductions in sleep might cause neurological atrophy. 

Medical News Today contacted Chelsie Rohrscheib, PhD, a sleep expert, neuroscientist, and sleep consultant at Wesper, who was not involved in this study. We asked why changes in sleep architecture might influence brain atrophy and Alzheimer's.

“Sleep has many crucial biological functions and is especially important for cell and tissue repair, brain maintenance, learning and memory, cognition, and brain waste clearance,” Rohrscheib explained. 

“Most of these functions occur during stage 3 slow wave sleep and REM sleep. All of these processes are crucial for maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease,” she detailed.

Rohrscheib told us how Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a buildup of junk proteins in the brain.

“These proteins are normally removed by a waste removal system that occurs during stage 4 slow wave sleep, called the glymphatic system,” she continued. “People who are chronically sleep-deprived and spend less time in slow wave sleep do not clear their brains effectively.”

MNT also contacted Leah Kaylor, PhD, a licensed psychologist who specializes in sleep, who was also not involved in the current research. She delved into a little more detail about how this trash removal service works:

“While sleeping, the brain shrinks, creating more space for cerebrospinal fluid to flood the areas where the brain's waste products accumulate. This fluid acts as a ‘car wash,' clearing out the toxins, misfolded proteins, and debris that have built up throughout the day, ensuring that our brain functions at its peak when it is time to wake up.”

Importantly, “these waste products include beta-amyloid, tau proteins, and other substances linked to neurodegenerative disorders,” Kaylor explained.

We asked Kaylor about the importance of these results.

“By examining a cohort over 13 to 17 years, the research provides a longitudinal perspective on how sleep architecture impacts brain structure over time,” she explained. This is important as it “strengthens the evidence for causal relationships.” 

Although the results of this study certainly are intriguing, the authors call for more research — this is a small study. Also, they write that their participant group was not particularly diverse, so their results might not be generalizable to other groups.

Whatever the future of this line of investigation, one thing is by now clear: Sleep is essential for good health.

We asked Rohrscheib to provide tips for anyone who struggles to get enough sleep:

She also advises people to speak with a doctor if they experience chronic sleep troubles, as this may be a sign of a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea.

Kaylor also provided some tips:

This new study adds to our understanding of the relationship between sleep architecture, brain atrophy, and Alzheimer's disease.

Although we need much more research to understand the precise mechanisms at play, focusing on getting more sleep is always a healthy option.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): It was a thing, then it stopped being a thing, and now it's a thing again. So, in the grand tradition of mansplaining, this is On Second Thought.

I think we can all agree that 2025 has been a sh*t year. For the historians watching this video hundreds of years in the future, this is when everything started to go wrong. I'm very sorry. By contrast, the 1990s were great. We saw the elimination of measles from North America, the end of the Cold War, the birth of the internet, and the rise of the Backstreet Boys. Life was pretty sweet. 

The only real wrinkle is that women were routinely prescribed hormones, and that turned out to be kind of a bad idea. What we need to remember is that medical professionals in the 1990s really believed that replacing estrogen in postmenopausal women was a good idea. The reasoning went something like this: When women lose estrogen, they experience menopause. Menopause brings hot flashes, heart disease, osteoporosis, several cancers, dementia, arthritis, weight gain, vaginal dryness, painful intercourse — a lot of bad stuff. So, if we give back estrogen, the disease will go away.

The logic of it was pretty obvious, and it made a lot of sense to a lot of people. True, it was based on observational studies and not on randomized controlled data. But don't get all high and mighty on me; if you were there, you would have done the same thing.

But we must remember something important: Some women were taking hormones to treat the symptoms of menopause (eg, hot flashes, night sweats, vasomotor symptoms), but a lot of women were prescribed hormones for long-term disease prevention. They were healthy, presumably asymptomatic women who were taking hormones to prevent conditions like heart attack and stroke.

Now, fast-forward a few years to the 2000s. We dodged a bullet on Y2K, but a lot of other bad stuff started happening. For our purposes, we're going to focus on 2002 and the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study.

The WHI study blew up the practice of prescribing hormones to women. The study was published and the findings indicated that hormones don't reduce cardiovascular disease risk like everybody thought they would. In fact, the report found that hormone use increased the risk for heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, and blood clots. Hormone use was also not associated with reduced mortality. Hormone therapy contributed to the very conditions people were trying to prevent. 

As you can imagine, everybody kind of lost their minds and HRT fell off a cliff. It was an extreme reaction and, in retrospect, a bit of an overcorrection. Everybody rushed to get their patients off HRT because it wasn't preventing heart disease, as expected — but they forgot that it was still very good at treating symptoms of menopause. They kind of threw the baby out with the bathwater and it became bad for everyone.

Now, some 20-odd years later, people can look back and point out some of the problems with the WHI study. One of the main criticisms of the WHI is that the women were about a decade too old. The women in the study had an average age of 63 years, whereas menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years.

Although this is a common criticism, you have to remember what the WHI study was trying to prove or disprove. The point of WHI was to test whether HRT could prevent cardiovascular disease, so they wanted an older, higher-risk population to improve the power of the study. It was a choice (and an understandable one), but it does mean that the study is not reflective of the majority of women who are experiencing menopause. 

Further, the increased risk for heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and breast cancer was mainly seen in the group of women who received estrogen plus progesterone. The women who received just estrogen didn't really have an increased risk; it was very minimal. However, you must give progesterone to women with an intact uterus, as unopposed estrogen increases the risk for uterine cancer. So, in the WHI study, only the women who had a hysterectomy received just estrogen; you can't really do much about that. 

But the real problem with WHI — you guessed it — is mathematical. Let's dig in.

For illustrative purposes, I'm using the numbers from the estrogen-plus-progesterone group in the original 2002 publication. The numbers are going to be a little bit different if you look at the later follow-up studies, but the points are basically the same. The authors reported hazard ratios of 1 .29 for heart disease, 1.26 for breast cancer, 1.41 for stroke, 2.13 for pulmonary embolism, and 1.22 for total cardiovascular disease. So many people looked at this and said, ""Ah, hazard ratio is greater than 1, confidence interval doesn't cross zero, P value of less than .05 — hormones are bad. Moving on."" But if we look at the absolute scale, it's a bit more nuanced.

In terms of absolute risk, hormone use was associated with seven extra heart attacks, eight extra strokes, eight extra breast cancers, and 18 extra blood clots. Sure, there were six fewer colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures, but we have colonoscopies and bisphosphonates for those. So, overall, it was a negative. 

But that's seven heart attacks, eight strokes, eight breast cancers, and 18 blood clots per 10,000 women per year. The individual risk per woman per year was very small. It's not zero, obviously, and it's not useful for cardiovascular prevention — that's pretty clear. But if you're using hormones to treat menopausal symptoms (like the vasomotor symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats), I think you can say it's fairly safe unless you have a high baseline risk.

I wouldn't give it to someone with a strong family history of breast cancer or thrombophilia or a recent heart attack or stroke. But for a low-risk or average-risk woman, hormone use doesn't lack risk, but it's low enough that it's probably worth it to achieve symptomatic relief of what can be very debilitating symptoms. And the symptoms of menopause can be very debilitating; most women don't end up seeking medical attention and end up suffering in silence.

The rise and fall and rise again of menopausal hormone therapy illustrates a funny paradox. The risks to a population can be significant. If you start giving a lot of women hormones unnecessarily, you're going to cause a lot of extra heart attacks and strokes and blood clots. But the risk to an individual woman is pretty low. Would I prescribe hormones to a woman who has menopausal symptoms? Yes. I actually get this consult all the time. If the patient has no contraindications, high-risk features, or family history, then yeah — I would have no problem starting the therapy to treat the symptoms.

But you probably shouldn't receive lifelong treatment (like we used to recommend). Continue hormone use for as long as menopause symptoms persist. That can be 5 years, or 10 years for many women. For some, it can be up to 20 years. But the point is, you're treating symptoms, not preventing disease. Use it for as long as you need to. If you want to try nonhormonal alternatives (eg, low-dose SSRIs, elinzanetant, fezolinetant), then give that a try. 

Menopausal hormone therapy is exactly what it says it is: It's therapy. It treats the symptoms of menopause, but it's not for prevention. Use it if you need it. Stop it when you don't. Overall, the risks are low for more low-risk women. 

It took almost 30 years to sort this out, but I think we got there. For Medscape, I'm Christopher Labos.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

A switch of just two weeks from a traditional African diet to a Western diet causes inflammation, reduces the immune response to pathogens, and activates processes associated with lifestyle diseases. Conversely, an African diet rich in vegetables, fiber, and fermented foods has positive effects. This study, published in Nature Medicine, highlights the significant impact of diet on the immune system and metabolism.

Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic inflammatory conditions are surging across Africa, posing a growing challenge to healthcare systems throughout the continent. Increasing economic development, urbanization and wider availability of processed foods have accelerated the adoption of Western eating habits in Africa. To understand the health consequences of this shift, researchers from Radboud university medical center and KCMC University in Tanzania have studied the effects of such dietary changes on health.

Seventy-seven healthy men from Tanzania, both urban and rural residents, participated in the study. Some participants who traditionally ate an African diet switched to a Western diet for two weeks, while others who ate a Western diet adopted a traditional African diet. A third group consumed a fermented banana drink daily. As a control, ten participants maintained their usual diet. The researchers comprehensively analyzed the function of the immune system, blood inflammation markers, and metabolic processes at baseline, after the two-week intervention, and again four weeks later.

Participants who switched to a Western diet exhibited an increase in inflammatory proteins in their blood, alongside activation of biological processes linked to lifestyle diseases. Their immune cells also responded less effectively to pathogens. Meanwhile, those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink showed a reduction in inflammatory markers. Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects.

This is the first study to comprehensively map the health effects of a traditional African diet. 'Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet', says internist Quirijn de Mast from Radboudumc. 'However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa's rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.'

De Mast finds it remarkable how significant the effects of diet are, even after just two weeks. 'The African diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and fermented foods. Our study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body. At the same time, we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. It typically consists of processed and high-calorie foods, such as French fries and white bread, with excessive salt, refined sugars, and saturated fats. Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well.'

Radboudumc and KCMC University collaborated on this study with international partners from Bonn and Florence. The research was funded by ZonMw/JPI-HDHL.

Luis Miguel Echegaray debates how Mauricio Pochettino will look to improve the USMNT ahead of the World Cup. (1:29)

The U.S. men's national team remained 16th in the latest FIFA rankings released Thursday, while Canada climbed to a new all-time high and Mexico moved up two spots following last month's Concacaf Nations League finals.

The U.S. lost both its games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, falling to Panama in the semifinals before going down to Canada in the third-place match. It is now just one place ahead of rivals Mexico, which received a boost after beating Canada and Panama to claim its first Nations League title.

Panama's reward for its shock victory over the U.S. is a three-place bump up to No. 33.

Despite falling to Mexico in the semifinals, Canada moved up one spot to new best of No. 30, continuing a staggering rise for the men's team. A little more than a decade ago, in October 2014, the team was ranked a lowly 122.

But after qualifying for its first World Cup in 36 years in 2022, the Canadians have continued their upward trajectory under American coach Jesse Marsch.

Canada, the U.S. and Mexico have automatically qualified for the next World Cup in 2026 as co-hosts. Their next competitive matches will come at the Concacaf Gold Cup, beginning June 14.

At the top of the FIFA rankings, world champions Argentina remains at No. 1 after sealing its qualification for the next World Cup with wins over Uruguay and Brazil last month.

European champions Spain moves up one spot to second, swapping places with France, while England and Brazil round out the top five.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Boris Becker has named three players he thinks have not stepped up during Jannik Sinner's suspension.

The ATP Tour was rocked when the World number one was banned for three months after testing positive for clostebol.

The suspension commenced in February and Sinner is set to return to the game on May 4, in time for his home tournament, the Italian Open.

Fans were keen to see which players would take advantage of Sinner's absence, but the six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker spoke on those who he thinks have not made the most of the opportunity.

Jannik Sinner has not played since defending the Australian Open title in January.

Despite his absence from the circuit over the past two months, the Italian still maintains a healthy lead of 2,685 points at the top of the ATP rankings.

No players around him have taken the chance to move closer to Sinner, and Becker mentioned three players in particular that he expected more from.

“For more than 15 years, one of the three, or both, were in the final. Then we thought, okay, that's normal, because they're much better than the rest. It was like that too,” Becker said.

“Federer stops, Nadal stops last year. And we thought, ‘yes, [Daniil] Medvedev, [Alexander] Zverev, [Andrey] Rublev, [Casper] Ruud the generation is now taking over'. Who takes over now?

“Jannik Sinner played one tournament this year. The others now have played five or six. But what did they do? The difference [At the top of the rankings] has grown.

“Although Sinner won Miami last year and lost a thousand points. He played one tournament, so to speak, and won 2000 points [in Melbourne] and is therefore number one. Of course, his class also says that, but also the fact that the others are weakening.

“Why does an Alcaraz weaken? Where is Medvedev? Medvedev has vanished from the top 10. Rublev lost the first round again. Where is Rune? I think we are in a reorientation.

“Who is the leading player in world tennis? There I see Sinner, there I see Alcaraz. Then with a little distance. Now the chance is there [For other players to win titles].

“You had the three supergoats, you don't have them anymore. Maybe Djokovic is still there. Now, you have the chance to make history. Now you can get to the final. So what is the problem? It is ultimately because of your own weakness.”

Daniil Medvedev, usually a model of consistency, has struggled so far in 2025.

The Russian has just made just two semi-finals this season, as Medvedev was knocked out of the Australian Open in the second round and suffered another opening round loss at the Miami Open.

Holger Rune reached the Indian Wells final, before he was beaten by Jack Draper, but the Dane has not enjoyed much success elsewhere.

Indian Wells marked the only final that Rune reached this season, and he failed to reach the last eight in all his other events.

Following Andrey Rublev's defeat to Joao Fonseca the Australian Open first round, he reached the semi-finals in Montpellier, a quarter-final in Rotterdam before winning the Qatar Open final.

Since that win, Rublev has lost his last three matches in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Former Australian Open champion and ex-World No.1, Caroline Wozniacki, has left the tennis world in suspense as she continues her hiatus since the 2024 US Open. Speculations are rife about whether the Danish star will ever make a comeback to the court after being absent for several months.

Wozniacki's last appearance on the court was in the Last 16 at the US Open, where she was defeated by Beatriz Haddad Maia in a grueling three-set match. Despite having a promising start at the tournament, she mysteriously vanished from the tennis scene, raising eyebrows and concerns among fans and experts alike.

The tennis star's father, Piotr, stirred controversy by publicly expressing his disappointment over his daughter not receiving wildcards for certain events. Wozniacki did manage to secure wildcards for the Olympic Games and Wimbledon, but her performance failed to impress, leading to early exits from both competitions.

Struggling with health issues, Wozniacki cited rheumatoid arthritis as a major factor behind her decision to step back from the sport. Her ongoing battle with the condition has cast doubts on her future in tennis, with uncertainties looming over her potential return.

As she continues to slide down the rankings due to her prolonged absence, Wozniacki's fans are left wondering if she will ever grace the court again. With minimal signs of her training or preparing for a comeback, the Danish athlete's future remains uncertain and shrouded in mystery.

Despite her remarkable career and past achievements, including a Grand Slam title, Wozniacki's current situation has left many questioning whether she will be able to stage a successful comeback or if she will ultimately choose to retire from professional tennis.

The tennis world eagerly awaits any updates or announcements from Caroline Wozniacki regarding her future in the sport, as her fans hold onto hope for a triumphant return to the game she once dominated.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli has received support from MotoGP legend and fellow Italian Valentino Rossi. In between the Chinese and Japanese Grands Prix, Antonelli was seen enjoying a karting day with the rider.

While speaking to Motorsport.com and other media in Suzuka, the Italian driver dished the details of the event and the crucial advice the seven-time MotoGP champion gave him for his rookie Formula 1 season:

""So we went karting together, it was pretty cool.

""I mean, he's such a cool dude. We had some good laughs, and he told me some stories from when he was racing in MotoGP, some funny ones as well that I can't really tell now. But you know he's such a cool guy.

""I mean he's a very easy person [to get along with], and we had a nice day together karting and definitely something that I would like to do in the future as well, hopefully also with all the [VR46] academy drivers as well because luckily I have a relationship with all of them as well.

""And, you know, also this year, I will probably go to a couple of MotoGP races just to go and see them and support them. And then, yeah, hopefully we can go one day altogether in karting because that would be a really cool experience.""

The Mercedes driver added:

""First of all, he's been really supportive, about the start and what he's been telling me also the karting, you know, just to keep going at this, and enjoy.

""And especially focus on myself and not worrying about the rest, you know, enjoying the process and then yeah, then stay focused. So yeah, definitely, you know, he's a really cool guy, and he's someone I will look up to as well because he's such a great figure in the sport as well. It's also so nice from him that he's been so supportive from that side.""

Rossi has been very supportive of Antonelli as he takes on his first full-time year in Mercedes. He previously commented to Formula Scout:

“I'm very happy to know Kimi because on the paper he can be the future Italian hope in F1. So we stay a bit together sometimes, and he is a great guy I like a lot, we enjoy.""

Antonelli has had an impressive start to his rookie F1 campaign. After taking the seat alongside George Russell when Lewis Hamilton left for Ferrari, the pressure was on. And, after just two race weekends, he sits in fifth in the drivers' standing with 22 points.

Pierre Gasly believes Yuki Tsunoda has all the ingredients to be a success with Red Bull – but warned that achieving this would be “complicated” for the Japanese driver.

Partnering four-time World Champion Max Verstappen at Red Bull has been widely dubbed ‘the toughest job in motorsport', with the Dutchman comfortably outperforming Sergio Perez, Alex Albon, Gasly and, in the closing stages of his time with the team back in 2018, Daniel Ricciardo.

Just two races into the new season, and Liam Lawson's name has been added to the rollcall, with Yuki Tsunoda promoted ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix to replace the New Zealander at Red Bull.

Asked if he'd made contact with his former team mate since news of his promotion had broken, Gasly, who raced with Red Bull for 12 races in 2019, said: “Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

Tsunoda will make his Red Bull debut this weekend

“Obviously, the way that I was also given this opportunity [to drive for Red Bull] and just in terms of what didn't quite work out and things that could have been different... I think he's got the experience, he's got the speed. I've always backed him up.

“I've raced against him and with him for two years. I've seen his raw speed. I've seen what he was capable of doing already back at the time.

“We can look back to 2021, all these years, I've always said he was an extremely fast driver. So he's got the speed. I think he's got a strong character.”

However, these terms are similar to those used by Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner back in December when talking about Liam Lawson, as he explained to the media why the New Zealander, above Tsunoda, was the ideal candidate to partner Verstappen for 2025.

Gasly drove for Red Bull for 12 races at the start of 2019

Despite the words of praise for the Japanese, Gasly was cautious when issuing a verdict on Tsunoda's chances alongside Verstappen.

He continued: “Does [his speed] mean he's going to be successful in Red Bull Racing? No. Can he be successful in Red Bull Racing? Yes. But it's slightly more complicated than that.

“I just wish him the best. I've shared my thoughts and my experience from my time there.

“Time will tell, but I think he's definitely a very strong driver. And in Formula 1 these days, you've got many strong drivers on the grid, so it's not all down to your speed. There's slightly more to it, but hopefully, he can make the best out of this opportunity.”

Producers James Wan and Jason Blum shared the footage for the erotic thriller that expands the AI-focused franchise.

Senior Entertainment Reporter


M3GAN spinoff SOULM8TE revealed its steamy first footage at CinemaCon, courtesy of producers James Wan and James Blum.


	The Blumhouse CEO noted that the pair “share a demented sensibility.” Wan noted of the title character in M3GAN, “She kicked open a door to twisted ideas we can explore together. What if we can design a perfect partner for grown-ups?”




	Wan then teased the film's “adult M3GAN,” and joked, “What could possibly go wrong?” 


	The trailer, which has not yet been publicly shared, featured Lily Sullivan as an AI-powered companion hired by a grieving man (David Rysdahl). As might be expected, the title character takes things a bit too far.

	“Tell me you love me,” Sullivan says in the footage. “Nobody will ever know you like I do.” Later, she asks, “Have I been a bad girl?”


	When facing off with a female rival, she quips, “Don't try that girl-power shit with me.” 


	The cast also includes Claudia Doumit. Kate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) directed the movie from her own script, with the story credited to Wan, Ingrid Bisu and Rafael Jordan.


SOULM8TE is described as an erotic thriller about a man who attempts to cope with the death of his wife by acquiring an AI android for companionship. The project was first announced in June.


M3GAN hit theaters in January 2023 and surpassed $180 million at the global box office. The sequel, M3GAN 2.0, is set for theatrical release June 27.


	CinemaCon is the annual event for exhibitors and Hollywood studios that runs this year from March 31 to April 3. It is presented by Cinema United (formerly the National Association of Theatre Owners).

			By Nancy Tartaglione, Anthony D'Alessandro 


	Covering Caesars Colosseum in an amazing laser light show, Disney unveiled a new teaser at CinemaCon today for Tron: Ares, the latest installment in the 43-year video game movie franchise. Slated for an October 10 theatrical release, the movie is directed by Joachim Rønning.


	Jared Leto fanned out onstage with Jeff Bridges next to him: “As a kid I was obsessed with Tron. The future felt it was right around the corner,” Leto said. “It had everything I wanted from a movie — action, adventure and spandex — it took me to a world that I never knew.”


	“This movie will hit you right in the grid,” said the House of Gucci star and Dallas Buyers Club Oscar winner.

	Leto plays Ares, a highly sophisticated Program who enters the real world from the digital world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with an artificial intelligence being. Evan Peters portrays villain Julian Dillinger. Greta Lee, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, Hasan Minhaj, Gillian Anderson and Sarah Desjardins round out the cast.

	What do we see in the trailer? The red Tron cycles speeding into our modern cities and slicing police cars in half. Those Tron forklift things fly through the air — you know, those obstacles you're suppose to shoot in the video game. As billed, it's the video game world invading ours. “Ready?” says Bridges' Kevin Flynn. “Because there's no going back.”


	Bridges, who starred in Tron: Legacy (2010) and the original Tron (1982), also returns for the third installment.


	The script was written by Jesse Wigutow and Jack Thorne. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Leto, Emma Ludbrook and Steven Lisberger produce alongside executive producer Russell Allen.

CinemaCon started rocking when during Disney's presentation, exhibitors got their first look at Jeremy Allen White as the boss himself, Bruce Springsteen. The first trailer for “Deliver Me from Nowhere” premiered on the Colosseum stage in Las Vegas on Thursday, and it looks like The Bear is now Born to Run.

White and Jeremy Strong, who plays Springsteen's manager Jon Landau in director Scott Cooper's film, took the stage to present the first look at the film, which showed White as Springsteen recording a song from his seminal album “Nebraska,” describing it as wanting it to feel like you're in the room with him. Strong's Landau describes in hushed tones what Springsteen is striving for with the album and why it's not about topping the charts with this one.

“Bruce is a repairman, and what he's doing with the sound is he's repairing that hole in his floor, he's repairing that hole in himself, and once he's done that, he's gonna repair the entire world,” Landau said. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Then it rocks out. We see White on stage singing “Born to Run” and getting fittingly sweaty as he careens through the song. 

Bruce himself previously praised White's performance, saying he sings “very well” in the film, and what we saw in the trailer was a blend of some of White's own voice and Bruce's. 

Strong also celebrated Landau and his influence on Springsteen's career: “It's just incredible to be here with this movie. Jon was deeply invested in Bruce as an artist, but he was deeply invested in his friend's happiness and well being and struggling with mental health. I see Jon as Lewis to Bruce's Clark, and their collaboration,” he said on the CinemaCon stage. 

Cooper wrote and directed the film based on Warren Zanes' book, and the film also stars Stephen Graham, Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz, Gaby Hoffman, and Marc Maron. Disney's 20th Century Studios is releasing it in theaters later this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Michael Hurley, Underground Folk Legend and Singer-Songwriter, Dies at 83","https://pitchfork.com/news/michael-hurley-underground-folk-legend-and-singer-songwriter-dies-at-83/","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 20:49:30 GMT","

Michael Hurley, the outsider folk artist and singer-songwriter who came up in the Greenwich Village folk scene in the 1960s and continued making music into the present day, has died at home in Astoria, Oregon, his family revealed in a statement. “The ‘Godfather of freak folk' was for a prolific half-century the purveyor of an eccentric genius and compassionate wit. He alone was Snock. There is no other,” it reads. Hurley was 83.

For over 60 years, Hurley wrote and recorded original songs that parse through bluegrass, freak-folk, and blues with an ear for eccentric ideas and stripped-back moments. Though his music and album artwork was playful—a wolf devours whoopie pies at a diner on the cover of 1994's Wolfways, and song titles range from “You're a Dog; Don't Talk to Me ” to “What Made My Hamburger Disappear?”—Hurley found a way to tap into the serious parts of life simultaneously, using minute details and sweeping reflections to encourage listeners to take a step back and admirer the bigger picture of life before them.

Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, several days before Christmas in 1941, Hurley started playing music and writing his own songs as a preteen. Summers were spent listening to Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton, and making up simple songs during roadtrips with his family. He dropped out of high school to design fanzines, play music, and hitchhike with a guitar slung over his back. It was on one of those wandering routes that he was picked up by Fred Ramsey, a folklorist who lived up the road and ended up producing his debut. After recovering from a multi-year-long struggle with mononucleosis, a 22-year-old Hurley finally recorded his debut album, the aptly titled First Songs, in 1963 for Folkways, the famed label home to Woody Guthrie and Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music.

Hurley expanded his skills beyond singing and playing guitar to also include fiddle and banjo, and was an active illustrator as well, painting and drawing many of the artworks that comprised his album covers. When his childhood friend and future Youngbloods singer Jesse Colin Young chose to champion his work, Hurley's music began to spread by word of mouth – in part thanks to Young releasing his next two albums, 1971's Armchair Boogie and 1972's Hi Fi Snock Uptown, on his Warner Bros. imprint Raccoon.

After signing a contract with Rounder, Hurley released Have Moicy! in 1975 and the album garnered both underground fanfare and critical acclaim, leading to the release of two more LPs on the label: 1976's Long Journey and 1980's Snockgrass. As he continued to churn out dozens of records, Hurley also garned the admiration of his younger peers, including Yo La Tengo, Cat Power, Lucinda Williams, Vic Chesnutt, and Calexico, among others.

At the turn of the century, Hurley's fandom continued to grow in new ways. While albums like 2008's Ancestral Swamp and releases on respected labels like Mississippi Records and Gnomonsong expanded his reach, so did his hand-drawn comic books and appearances in films like 2018's Leave No Trace, in which he performs “O My Stars” opposite fellow Oregon-based musician and revered guitarist Marisa Anderson.

Hurley's final full-length album was 2021's The Time of Foxgloves, which showcased just how sharp Hurley's wit had remained going into his eightieth year. He was an active and constant performing artist, too, having played his final shows—a set at Big Ears Festival 2025 in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 28, and a concert at the AyurPrana Listening Room in Asheville, North Carolina, on March 31—mere days before his death. According to his family, he was working on new music up until the end.

“I did [want to be a famous musician], but I didn't have a progressive drive about it,” Hurley told The Guardian in 2021. “I didn't enjoy the process of applying for gigs, that determination to penetrate things, all this trouble you had to go through. I preferred playing parties, little gatherings, drinking with friends, hopping across the river.”

Upon learning of his death, numerous musicians have taken to social media to honor the late singer-songwriter, including the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser, Ryley Walker, and More Eaze. “So long Val Kilmer and Michael Hurley,” Langhorne Slim wrote in an Instagram story. “Two giants of their craft. Both changed the way I saw things after experiencing their work. Both expanded my perception of art. Kings of cool. Rest in peace and thank you.”

Flavor Flav is owning up to his mistakes — and moving forward. On Thursday, the Public Enemy rapper revealed that he recently relapsed after more than four years of sobriety, but shared his commitment to getting back on track.


	“I remain authentic to who I am and a large part of the past 4.5 years for me has been my sobriety journey. I think I've been an inspiration to many that if I could get sober, anyone can do it,” Flav wrote on Instagram stories. “But just when you think it's easy, it ain't. I briefly relapsed. I say this to admit my mistake and publicly hold myself accountable.”


	Flav has been open about his sobriety journey of the last few years and celebrated his four-year mark on World Mental Health Day by paying for fans' online therapy. In a 2023 interview, he admitted he was spending up to $2,600 a day on drugs but would hide it from the public.

	“I am a human being who makes mistakes and it doesn't make me a bad person. I hope those who are around me support my choice to be sober,” Flav wrote in his Thursday statement. “I went back to Day 1, again. Time didn't stop, my journey continues.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Speaking with Akademiks on his Off the Record podcast two years ago, Flav shared that he “maintained [himself] very well” while he was doing so many drugs. “I guess God wanted me to live. And he knows that I'm a mouthpiece to the world,” he said at the time. “So, I feel that God let me live through that, so that way, I could teach people about the mistakes that I made. And hopefully, they won't make them later on in life.”
