Disclosure: Christopher Labos, MD CM, MSc, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. This transcript has been edited for clarity. So, in the grand tradition of mansplaining, this is On Second Thought. I think we can all agree that 2025 has been a sh*t year. For the historians watching this video hundreds of years in the future, this is when everything started to go wrong. The only real wrinkle is that women were routinely prescribed hormones, and that turned out to be kind of a bad idea. What we need to remember is that medical professionals in the 1990s really believed that replacing estrogen in postmenopausal women was a good idea. The reasoning went something like this: When women lose estrogen, they experience menopause. Menopause brings hot flashes, heart disease, osteoporosis, several cancers, dementia, arthritis, weight gain, vaginal dryness, painful intercourse — a lot of bad stuff. So, if we give back estrogen, the disease will go away. But don't get all high and mighty on me; if you were there, you would have done the same thing. But we must remember something important: Some women were taking hormones to treat the symptoms of menopause (eg, hot flashes, night sweats, vasomotor symptoms), but a lot of women were prescribed hormones for long-term disease prevention. They were healthy, presumably asymptomatic women who were taking hormones to prevent conditions like heart attack and stroke. Now, fast-forward a few years to the 2000s. For our purposes, we're going to focus on 2002 and the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study. The study was published and the findings indicated that hormones don't reduce cardiovascular disease risk like everybody thought they would. In fact, the report found that hormone use increased the risk for heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, and blood clots. Hormone use was also not associated with reduced mortality. As you can imagine, everybody kind of lost their minds and HRT fell off a cliff. Everybody rushed to get their patients off HRT because it wasn't preventing heart disease, as expected — but they forgot that it was still very good at treating symptoms of menopause. They kind of threw the baby out with the bathwater and it became bad for everyone. Now, some 20-odd years later, people can look back and point out some of the problems with the WHI study. The women in the study had an average age of 63 years, whereas menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years. Although this is a common criticism, you have to remember what the WHI study was trying to prove or disprove. The point of WHI was to test whether HRT could prevent cardiovascular disease, so they wanted an older, higher-risk population to improve the power of the study. It was a choice (and an understandable one), but it does mean that the study is not reflective of the majority of women who are experiencing menopause. Further, the increased risk for heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and breast cancer was mainly seen in the group of women who received estrogen plus progesterone. The women who received just estrogen didn't really have an increased risk; it was very minimal. However, you must give progesterone to women with an intact uterus, as unopposed estrogen increases the risk for uterine cancer. So, in the WHI study, only the women who had a hysterectomy received just estrogen; you can't really do much about that. But the real problem with WHI — you guessed it — is mathematical. So many people looked at this and said, "Ah, hazard ratio is greater than 1, confidence interval doesn't cross zero, P value of less than .05 — hormones are bad. But if we look at the absolute scale, it's a bit more nuanced. Sure, there were six fewer colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures, but we have colonoscopies and bisphosphonates for those. But that's seven heart attacks, eight strokes, eight breast cancers, and 18 blood clots per 10,000 women per year. But if you're using hormones to treat menopausal symptoms (like the vasomotor symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats), I think you can say it's fairly safe unless you have a high baseline risk. But for a low-risk or average-risk woman, hormone use doesn't lack risk, but it's low enough that it's probably worth it to achieve symptomatic relief of what can be very debilitating symptoms. And the symptoms of menopause can be very debilitating; most women don't end up seeking medical attention and end up suffering in silence. The risks to a population can be significant. If you start giving a lot of women hormones unnecessarily, you're going to cause a lot of extra heart attacks and strokes and blood clots. But the risk to an individual woman is pretty low. Would I prescribe hormones to a woman who has menopausal symptoms? I actually get this consult all the time. But you probably shouldn't receive lifelong treatment (like we used to recommend). For some, it can be up to 20 years. But the point is, you're treating symptoms, not preventing disease. If you want to try nonhormonal alternatives (eg, low-dose SSRIs, elinzanetant, fezolinetant), then give that a try. Overall, the risks are low for more low-risk women. It took almost 30 years to sort this out, but I think we got there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Human perception is the ultimate standard for assessing display quality. However, using human inspection as a metrology method in display evaluation for development or production presents challenges due to variations between observations and observers. In a production environment, this variability makes it difficult to apply visual quality standards consistently across multiple sources in a supply chain. It increases the risk of approving defective devices or rejecting functional ones, both of which add costs to the manufacturing process. Human inspection also lacks detailed quantitative data on defect types and occurrences, as observers tend to identify only the most obvious defects. Additionally, with displays serving as key user interfaces in consumer devices—from televisions to smartphones to automotive interiors—quality control measures that consider human visual experience are especially important in display manufacturing. Visual display testing is increasingly being automated using photometric and colorimetric imaging systems that objectively quantify visual qualities such as brightness (luminance), color, and contrast. Imaging systems with light and color measurement capabilities (imaging colorimeters) provide spatial tolerances for a display's visual qualities, including size, position, and location. However, developing an automated system that accurately identifies more subtle defects in a way that aligns with human perception has been more challenging. Until recently, creating precise software algorithms for automated defect classification that directly correlates with human perception has been difficult. This is partly because human perception of noticeable differences across a display depends on contextual factors that influence defect severity. Standard defect analysis algorithms—such as threshold setting and edge detection—do not always align with how humans perceive these imperfections. World leaders in manufacturing rely on Radiant Vision Systems for test and measurement solutions that ensure quality, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A switch of just two weeks from a traditional African diet to a Western diet causes inflammation, reduces the immune response to pathogens, and activates processes associated with lifestyle diseases. Conversely, an African diet rich in vegetables, fiber, and fermented foods has positive effects. This study, published in Nature Medicine, highlights the significant impact of diet on the immune system and metabolism. Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic inflammatory conditions are surging across Africa, posing a growing challenge to healthcare systems throughout the continent. Increasing economic development, urbanization and wider availability of processed foods have accelerated the adoption of Western eating habits in Africa. To understand the health consequences of this shift, researchers from Radboud university medical center and KCMC University in Tanzania have studied the effects of such dietary changes on health. Seventy-seven healthy men from Tanzania, both urban and rural residents, participated in the study. As a control, ten participants maintained their usual diet. Participants who switched to a Western diet exhibited an increase in inflammatory proteins in their blood, alongside activation of biological processes linked to lifestyle diseases. Their immune cells also responded less effectively to pathogens. Meanwhile, those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink showed a reduction in inflammatory markers. Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects. 'Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet', says internist Quirijn de Mast from Radboudumc. 'However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa's rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.' De Mast finds it remarkable how significant the effects of diet are, even after just two weeks. 'The African diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and fermented foods. At the same time, we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is one of 24 groups this quarter that received Penn Medicine CAREs grants to support their work. The funds will be used to help train volunteer medical students, who will then be paired with patients referred from palliative care, oncology, family medicine, and social work. At the end of this experience, patients will receive a copy of their story, and for interested patients, student artists will create an accompanying illustration. We hope that from storytelling, patients can find greater meaning," said fourth year medical student Isabel Yoon, who added that that the group hopes to work with patients across the health system interested in sharing their stories. Yoon is joined by co-leads Grace Wu (fourth year medical student), Jennifer Guo (first year medical student), and the group's faculty advisor Amanda Swain, MD, assistant professor of Family Medicine and Community Health and faculty director for UME Medical Humanities Curriculum. Other funded projects this quarter will seek to ease the overdose crisis, combat social isolation, and address unmet mental health needs in our communities. For more than 12 years, Penn Medicine faculty, staff, and students have used the Penn Medicine CAREs Grant program to increase the impact their community service activities can have, with more than $1 million in funding powering more than 1,000 projects since the program's inception. Non-fatal overdoses in the Norristown area have increased by almost 20 percent since 2023. Attendees will receive training on how to spot signs of an overdose, safely administer Narcan, and follow up with emergency services. The Renegades, led by lead community health worker Anthony Davis, is a support group for Veterans Administration (VA) patients facing chronic illness and social isolation. Although PCCHW's formal partnership with the VA ended in March 2024-after seven years of supporting more than 900 veterans-Anthony and The Renegades remain highly active. Anthony's funds will cover refreshments, activities, garden tools, and transportation. Her funding will support mental health first aid training and resources for local schools. The aim is to reduce stigma around mental illness, improve access to care, and support Penn Medicine's mission of promoting community well-being. CAREs grant recipients are selected according to criteria outlined in hospital community needs assessments, which document areas for improving health in the community, from treating substance use disorders, to addressing neighborhood conditions and navigating health systems and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Understanding the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease is a hot topic. With few effective treatments and increased prevalence, taking steps to potentially reduce risk is vital. The authors of a new study, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, investigate links between sleep architecture and brain regions relevant to Alzheimer's. People generally cycle through these four phases 4–6 times each night. Previous research has shown that aspects of sleep, such as sleeping for longer than normal or disturbed sleep are associated with dementia risk and disease progression. Alongside these Alzheimer's-vulnerable brain regions, other factors are also associated with Alzheimer's progression — namely, cerebral microbleeds. As the name suggests, these are small bleeds within the brain and a sign of cerebral small vessel disease, which appears to be linked to Alzheimer's. Then, they used MRI to look at the anatomical features of the brain (such as brain volume and evidence of cerebral microbleeds) 13–17 years later. The scientists found that having less slow-wave sleep was associated with a smaller inferior parietal region and cuneus. Similarly, having less REM sleep was linked to a smaller inferior parietal region and precuneus. After adjusting their analysis for errors, reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep were most tightly associated with atrophy of the inferior parietal region. Earlier research has shown that sleep helps clear toxins from the brain. Medical News Today contacted Chelsie Rohrscheib, PhD, a sleep expert, neuroscientist, and sleep consultant at Wesper, who was not involved in this study. We asked why changes in sleep architecture might influence brain atrophy and Alzheimer's. Rohrscheib told us how Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a buildup of junk proteins in the brain. “These proteins are normally removed by a waste removal system that occurs during stage 4 slow wave sleep, called the glymphatic system,” she continued. “People who are chronically sleep-deprived and spend less time in slow wave sleep do not clear their brains effectively.” MNT also contacted Leah Kaylor, PhD, a licensed psychologist who specializes in sleep, who was also not involved in the current research. She delved into a little more detail about how this trash removal service works: This fluid acts as a ‘car wash,' clearing out the toxins, misfolded proteins, and debris that have built up throughout the day, ensuring that our brain functions at its peak when it is time to wake up.” Importantly, “these waste products include beta-amyloid, tau proteins, and other substances linked to neurodegenerative disorders,” Kaylor explained. “By examining a cohort over 13 to 17 years, the research provides a longitudinal perspective on how sleep architecture impacts brain structure over time,” she explained. This is important as it “strengthens the evidence for causal relationships.” This new study adds to our understanding of the relationship between sleep architecture, brain atrophy, and Alzheimer's disease. Although we need much more research to understand the precise mechanisms at play, focusing on getting more sleep is always a healthy option. In this Special Feature, we question some common misconceptions about sleep, including the role of alcohol, remembering dreams, and late-night cheese.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although lung cancer screening is recommended in the U.S. for certain individuals with a history of smoking, only 18% of eligible individuals in the U.S. get screened. One suggested explanation has been that those eligible are resistant to receiving preventive healthcare, but a new study published in JAMA and led by researchers at Mass General Brigham indicates otherwise. Researchers from Mass General Brigham sought to investigate use of other preventive healthcare services among individuals eligible for lung cancer screening. Using the 2022 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset, the researchers analyzed data from 28,483 individuals aged 50 to 79 who were eligible for lung cancer screening. They found that while only 17-18% of eligible individuals received lung cancer screening, 65% of those eligible received breast and colorectal cancer screening-a nearly 4-fold higher rate. "Our findings show that many individuals eligible for lung cancer screenings are open to receiving preventive care services. The data suggest that these individuals aren't necessarily resistant to receiving cancer screenings-other factors are likely driving low rates of lung cancer screening," said first author Alexandra Potter, a researcher in the Division of Thoracic Surgery at MGH. These other factors may include difficulty assessing eligibility for lung cancer screening. Challenges accessing lung cancer screening clinics are also likely an important factor driving low rates." Alexandra Potter, Researcher, Division of Thoracic Surgery, Mass General Brigham The researchers concluded that many individuals eligible for lung cancer screening are already engaged in preventive care. They emphasized that their findings underscore the need for interventions to increase awareness of lung cancer screening and reduce barriers that prevent high-risk individuals from undergoing lung cancer screening. "As a community, we need to work together to improve lung cancer screening awareness and address the notable barriers that currently make it challenging for high-risk individuals to get lung cancer screening," said senior author Chi-Fu Jeffrey Yang, MD, of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cervical artery dissection is a tear in an artery in the neck that provides blood flow to the brain. Such a tear can result in blood clots that cause stroke. A dissection in the artery wall is most often caused by trauma due to motor vehicle accidents but can also occur with smaller injuries. Heavy lifting has also been shown to cause dissection in some people. "Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, especially in people under 50, so it is crucial to detect it right away," said Shadi Yaghi, MD, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Strokes that are not fatal can lead to long-term disability, poor mental health and reduced quality of life. Our research found a dramatic increase in the number of hospitalizations for cervical artery dissection with rates rising steadily year over year." Participants had an average age of 51, and just over half had a stroke at the same time as dissection. Researchers compared the number of hospitalizations to U.S. Census data to determine the annual rate of cervical artery dissections. They then calculated the average annual percentage change in those rates. Researchers found the number of dissections increased from 11 cases per one million people in 2005 to 46 cases per one million people in 2019, with an average annual increase of 10%. Results were similar for both female and male participants. "Possible reasons for this nearly five-fold increase over 15 years include greater awareness of cervical artery dissection by health care professionals, better access to imaging to help identify it and an overall increase in this condition for which a cause has yet to be determined," said Yaghi.
