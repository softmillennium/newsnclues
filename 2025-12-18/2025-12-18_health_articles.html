                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gestational diabetes can cause a multitude of complications in the offspring, but to date, the reasons are incompletely understood. A new study, exploring a foundational step in the process of building proteins from genetic material, called splicing, reveals that this process is affected, altering how the placenta reads and processes genetic instructions. Researchers found that in pregnancies affected by gestational diabetes , hundreds of genetic messages are assembled incorrectly, potentially disrupting how the placenta functions. When this protein was blocked in lab cells, the same errors seen in gestational diabetes appeared, suggesting that targeting SRSF10 could one day help mitigate the deleterious effects of gestational diabetes on the offspring. New study uncovers an unknown mechanism linking gestational diabetes to pregnancy complications. This may result in immediate complications for the newborns, such as being born too large or too small for gestational age, more caesarean deliveries, pre-term deliveries, and more. It also has long-lasting effects on the offspring, with higher risks for obesity and diabetes later in life. A new study led by Prof. Maayan Salton from the Faculty of Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Dr. Tal Schiller from the Faculty of Medicine at Hebrew University, Kaplan Medical Center, and Wolfson Medical Center at Tel Aviv University, reveals that gestational diabetes alters the placenta at the molecular level in ways never seen before. Using advanced RNA sequencing data from both European and Chinese pregnancy cohorts, the team discovered hundreds of alterations in how RNA molecules are "spliced", the step that determines which protein instructions are ultimately produced. These changes were strongly linked to genes involved in metabolism and diabetes-related pathways. When researchers reduced the activity of SRSF10 in placental cells, the same molecular disruptions seen in GDM appeared. This suggests that SRSF10 may be a master regulator of placental function, and potentially a new therapeutic target for preventing pregnancy complications. "Our findings bring us a step closer to that goal," added Dr. Schiller. "By pinpointing the specific molecular players involved, like the SRSF10 protein, we can start thinking about how to translate this knowledge into real-world strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes." Gestational diabetes is typically managed through diet, exercise, and insulin, but its underlying biology has remained poorly understood. This research sheds light on how the metabolic changes observed in GDM can alter how genes are processed, opening new avenues for intervention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The same pattern appears among their relatives, according to a new study from örebro University. "This suggests that both genetic and environmental factors within families may play a role," says researcher Sofi Oskarsson. Using Swedish national registers, the researchers tracked more than 1.5 million people born between 1987 and 2002, linking medical ADHD diagnoses to official criminal records. The findings indicate that individuals with ADHD are significantly more likely to be convicted of both violent crimes and other types of crimes. Relatives of those with ADHD also face a higher risk of conviction, even if they do not have ADHD. “Since ADHD is often detected later in women, the higher risk may mean that those who are diagnosed often have more severe symptoms,” says Sofi Oskarsson, a researcher in criminology at Örebro University. “Increased knowledge about the role of the family enables healthcare professionals to be more attentive to ADHD symptoms in relatives. “Our research indicates that ADHD is not only a personal challenge but also part of a family-based risk profile. These insights are vital for developing early interventions and support that can lower the risk of criminal behaviour.” The study was conducted in Sweden, a high-income country with universal healthcare and a relatively low proportion of prisoners. Cultural, legal, and organisational factors can influence both how ADHD is detected and the chances of being convicted of a crime. However, a systematic review of the global prevalence of ADHD indicates that levels are fairly comparable across regions. “This suggests that our findings could also be applicable beyond the Western world. However, further research is necessary in underrepresented regions to determine if the same pattern holds elsewhere,” concludes Sofi Oskarsson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mechanical ventilation saves lives, but the airflow it produces inside an intubated airway can also shape conditions linked to complications during long-term support. In a recent study, SUNY Polytechnic Institute faculty Dr. Aarthi Sekaran (Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering) and Dr. Ahmed Abdelaal (Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Technology) examined how two practical factors-endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff design and ventilator mode-change airflow behavior inside the human trachea. Their paper, Computational and Experimental Characterization of Flow in an Intubated Human Trachea, recently published in a special issue of MDPI's Fluids on respiratory flows, focuses on the region near the ETT cuff, where secondary issues such as infection can originate. The team compared two cuff geometries commonly used in clinical devices, Taperguard-style and Microcuff-type, and evaluated them under two ventilation strategies: Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Assisted Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV). To capture realistic, time-varying flow physics, Sekaran and Abdelaal combined 3D unsteady computational fluid dynamics (URANS CFD) with experimental validation, using flow measurements and visualization to confirm key behaviors. This blended approach allowed them to quantify changes in flow asymmetry, secondary flow structures, and wall shear stress, metrics that matter because they influence how strongly air "drags" along airway surfaces and how transport occurs near the cuff. A central finding is that ventilator mode and cuff geometry interact: the Taperguard configuration under PCV produced substantially higher wall shear stress, reaching nearly double what was observed for the same cuff under VCV. In contrast, the Microcuff + VCV combination produced lower velocities and reduced shear, with peak levels around 80 percent of those seen in the Taperguard case. Overall, the study provides a validated, engineering-based lens for understanding how device design and ventilation strategy can meaningfully reshape tracheal airflow, insights that can inform both future ETT design and clinical decision-making.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study finds menopause symptoms to be very frequently reported by female endurance athletes, with many perceiving a negative effect on their training and performance. Physical activity has been reported to mitigate the negative effects of menopause, particularly when it comes to musculoskeletal changes and quality of life. However, at the same time, menopausal symptoms may interfere with participation in physical activity and sport. In the new study, researchers surveyed 187 female runners, cyclists, swimmers, and triathletes aged 40–60 years who participated in their sport at least 3 days per week for at least 3 hours total per week. Participants completed the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS), a validated measure for assessing menopausal symptoms, and reported how symptoms affected their training and performance. The researchers found that the most common menopausal symptoms among the athletes were sleep problems (reported by 88% of women), physical and mental exhaustion (83%), sexual problems (74%), anxiety (72%), irritability (68%), depressive mood (67%), weight gain (67%), hot flushes (65%), and joint and muscular discomfort (63%). 97% of women with joint and musculoskeletal discomfort reported a negative effect on training and 91% reported a negative effect on performance, for example. Participants with more severe menopausal symptoms reported greater perceived negative effects on training and performance, with about a third of all respondents reporting that menopausal symptoms had a moderate or strong negative effect on training and about a quarter reporting a negative effect on performance. The study is limited by its cross-sectional design and the lack of demographic information, which makes it difficult to generalize to other populations. However, the authors conclude that frequency of menopausal symptoms among female endurance athletes is high and severity of menopausal symptoms is similar to that reported in the general population. Despite high physical activity levels in this population, healthcare providers should address these symptoms to promote continued participation in physical activity, they say. The authors add: "We hope this work brings attention to a growing, yet understudied population that is eager for guidance in how to navigate the menopausal transition while continuing to participate in sport and exercise."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your "roommate's" genes could be influencing the bacteria living in your gut, and vice versa, according to a study of rats published today in Nature Communications. The discovery reveals a new way genes and social life intertwine: through the exchange of commensal gut microbes that move between individuals. Though genes don't jump between individuals, microbes can. The study found some genes favour certain gut bacteria and these can spread through close social contact. "This is not magic, but rather the result of genetic influences spilling over to others through social contact. Genes shape the gut microbiome and we found that it is not just our own genes that matter," explains Dr. Amelie Baud, researcher at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and senior author of the study. While diet and medication are known to be among the main factors influencing these microbial ecosystems, the contribution of genetics has been more difficult to ascertain. In humans, only two genes have been reliably linked to gut bacteria. The lactase gene determines whether adults can digest milk and influences milk-digesting microbes. The ABO blood group gene also has an effect through yet-to-be discovered mechanisms. More gene microbe links could exist but are yet to be confirmed because nature and nurture are tricky to separate in the real world. For example, genes can influence diet and lifestyle choices, which in turn affect the gut microbiome. But families and friends share food, homes and microbes, blurring the line between nature vs. nurture's contribution to the gut microbiome. The animals share many features of mammalian biology, but can be raised in controlled conditions, such as giving everyone the same diet. By combining genetic and microbiome data from all 4,000 rats, the team identified three genetic regions that consistently influenced gut bacteria despite differences in rearing conditions across the four cohorts. A second region contained several mucin genes, which make up the gut's protective mucous layer and were linked to bacteria from the Firmicutes group. Classic examples of this phenomenon, also known as indirect genetic effects, are when a mother's genes shape her offspring's growth or immune system through the environment she provides. The controlled conditions of the rat study allowed researchers to study these effects in a completely new way. They found that the abundance of some Muribaculaceae were shaped by both direct and indirect genetic influence, meaning that some genetic effects spread socially through microbial exchange. Once these social, or indirect, effects were included in a statistical model, the total genetic influence increased by four to eight times for the three new gene-microbe links discovered. "These are the bacteria where the signal is strongest, but many more microbes could be affected once we have better microbiome profiling methods." By demonstrating that genetic influences can be coupled with gut microbe transmission, the authors of the study paint a new mechanism of action whereby the genetic effects of one individual can ripple through entire social groups, altering the biology of others without changing their DNA. If similar effects occur in humans, and given increasing evidence that the gut microbiome plays an important role in health, it could mean that genetic influences on human health have been underestimated in large studies. According to Dr. Baud, the microbiome has been linked to everything from immunity and metabolism to behaviour, but not all the reported correlations reflect causal effects and the exact mechanisms of action remain elusive. Genetic studies like hers, which use animal models in controlled environments, can help move from correlations to testable causal hypotheses, helping explain how genes and the gut microbiome interact in human health. For example, the researchers note that the gene they discovered in rats, St6galnac1, is functionally related to the human gene ST6GAL1 which, in other studies, has also been linked to Paraprevotella. It suggests the way animals coat their gut mucous with sugars can determine which microbes are able to thrive in the digestive system, and that this could be a shared biological mechanism across species. ST6GAL1 has been previously linked in other studies to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, cases where people catch COVID despite vaccination. They also hypothesise why some people develop an autoimmune kidney disease called IgA nephropathy. Our results are supported by data from four independent facilities, which means we can do follow up studies in any new setting. They're also remarkably strong compared with most host–microbiome links.

Optimized methods now yield 8-15 mg/L at 100 % purity for all required strains. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Amy Harmens et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.

GP38 strain A appeared larger than expected on DLS when in PBS. Increased NaCl and imidazole concentrations in affinity buffers prevented non-specific binding of host cell proteins to the column. Tris-based buffer for SEC prevented the reversible buffer-specific oligomerization previously seen in PBS. Analysis by SEC-MALS shows GP38 strain B is stable following one cycle of freeze-thaw (either snap-frozen and stored at -70 °C or slow-frozen to -20 °C. Kinetics profile of chimeric antibody bound to GP38 strain A assessed by surface plasmon resonance fits 1:1 model (KD = 108 pM). This shows that the GP38 is folded in a way that retains good binding to the antibody, and this was also observed for strains B-E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you." During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. "Police want us out of the way," he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Donald Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. "There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital," White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. After Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose. Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards. "It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse," said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C. Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations. Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated. The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment. Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as "Housing First" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it "intends" to do, federal housing officials said. City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter. "We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients. Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. “People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away," said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center. District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone. And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go. The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline. The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need. Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services. It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district. "I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized," said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients. Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders. He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall. After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags. "My body can't take this," Taylor said, preparing to sleep. Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back. He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said. Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer. "You get so depressed, being out here," said Kelley, 42. You start to not care about even changing your clothes." His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck," said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. I still see them around underneath the bridge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Under normal conditions, these cells act as guardians, keeping the lungs healthy, supporting breathing, and preventing unnecessary immune responses. However, new work led by Prof. Bart Lambrecht and Prof. Martin Guilliams (both VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research) shows that during allergic reactions, these macrophages can undergo a dramatic change. Instead of calming the immune system, they switch into an inflammatory mode that actively fuels allergy-driven lung inflammation. Alveolar macrophages have long been seen as peacekeepers in the lung. Our results show that during allergic responses, they can do the opposite and actually help drive inflammation." Using an advanced mouse model that allowed the researchers to precisely track and manipulate these lung cells, the team discovered that allergen exposure causes alveolar macrophages to send out signals that attract other immune cells into the lung. Instead, the study reveals that they are surprisingly flexible and can be reprogrammed by their environment, sometimes with harmful consequences. The discovery has important implications for understanding allergic lung diseases such as asthma. Current treatments mainly target other immune cells or inflammatory molecules. By identifying alveolar macrophages as active drivers of allergic inflammation, the study opens new avenues for research into therapies that could prevent or reverse their harmful switch, potentially reducing inflammation while preserving essential lung function.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is believed that these antibodies contribute to the destruction of this protective layer in the brain. MOGAD is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that target the MOG protein. This presumably damages the protective myelin layer around nerve cells, leading to inflammation in the central nervous system. In regard to therapy, it is important to distinguish the autoimmune disease MOGAD, that occurs in episodes and can affect the brain, optic nerve and spinal cord, from multiple sclerosis (MS). "Based on this alone, we were able to determine that MOG reactivity is present in different B cell subtypes," says Dr. Nora Wetzel, and Dr. Laila Kulsvehagen adds: "For example, there are B cells that are specific to MOG from the outset, while other B cells only develop this reactivity as they mature." This revealed that the antibodies use various mechanisms to eliminate MOG-producing cells. Interestingly, not all MOG antibodies were equally effective in using these different mechanisms. Anne-Katrin Pröbstel, Director, Center for Neurology, University Hospital Bonn (UKB) This study confirms previous work involving patient sera and brain autopsies, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that anti-MOG antibodies contribute to the development of the disease, known in technical terms as pathogenesis. Prof. Pröbstel emphasizes: "The new understanding of the origin of MOG-reactive B cells and antibody functions is important for developing tailored therapies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a moderate-to-severe traumatic injury, older adults with dementia had a higher likelihood of experiencing new limitations to activities of daily living than those without dementia. Older women with dementia were more likely to move from home to long-term care facilities post-injury. “For older adults with dementia, traumatic injury represents a pivotal turning point where postacute care programs may buffer an otherwise steep trajectory of functional decline. As trauma systems increasingly serve aging patient populations impacted by cognitive impairment, targeted interventions aimed at preserving function and supporting patients with the resources required for independent living will be essential for improving outcomes after injury,” the authors wrote. The study was led by Joshua E. Cohen of the Center for Surgery and Public Health at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Potential selection bias may exist due to reliance on follow-up interviews, which could exclude patients with severe cognitive impairments. The authors did not report receiving any specific funding.
